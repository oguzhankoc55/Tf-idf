0904.1596	luminous thermal flares from quiescent supermassive black holes	a dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will berevealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, anda flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of thestellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. here we presentthe third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the galex deep imagingsurvey: a 1.6x10^{43} erg s^{-1} uv/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy atz=0.1855. the uv/optical sed during the peak of the flare measured by galex andpalomar lfc imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody witht_{bb}=1.7x10^{5} k and a bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{45} erg s^{-1},assuming an internal extinction with e(b-v)_{gas}=0.3. the chandra upper limiton the x-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, l_{x}(2-10 kev)&lt; 10^{41}erg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios ofuv to x-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. we compare the lightcurves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidatesdiscovered by galex, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by thepower-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disruptedsolar-type star, and (2) the uv/optical seds can be attributed to thermalemission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidaldisruption radius of a ~10^{7} m_sun central black hole. we use the observedpeak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5 &gt; m_{g} &gt; -18.9) topredict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.(abridged)

0707.2368	new ultraviolet observations of am cvn	we have obtained observations of the ultraviolet spectrum of am cvn, anultra-short-period helium cataclysmic variable, using the space telescopeimaging spectrograph (stis) aboard the hubble space telescope (hst). weobtained data in time-tag mode during two consecutive orbits of hst, covering1600-3150 and 1140-1710 angstrom, respectively. the mean spectrum isapproximately flat in f-nu. the absorption profiles of the strong lines of n v,si iv, c iv, he ii, and n iv are blue-shifted and in some cases asymmetric,evidencing a wind that is partly occulted by the accretion disk. there is weakred-shifted emission from n v and he ii. the profiles of these lines varymildly with time. the light curve shows a decline of ~20% over the span of theobservations. there is also flickering and a 27 s (or 54 s) "dwarf novaoscillation", revealed in a power-spectrum analysis. the amplitude of thisoscillation is larger at shorter wavelengths. we assemble and illustrate thespectral energy distribution (s.e.d.) of am cvn from the ultraviolet to thenear-infrared. modeling the accretion phenomenon in this binary system can inprinciple lead to a robust estimate of the mass accretion rate on to thecentral white dwarf, which is of great interest in characterizing theevolutionary history of the binary system. inferences about the mass accretionrate depend strongly on the local radiative properties of the disk, as weillustrate. uncertainty in the distance of am cvn and other parameters of thebinary system presently limit the ability to confidently infer the massaccretion rate.

1001.2924	spectral energy distributions of weak active galactic nuclei associated  with low-ionization nuclear emission regions	we present a compilation of spectral energy distributions of 35 weak agns inliners using recent data from the published literature. we make use ofpreviously published compilations of data, after complementing and extendingthem with more recent data. the main improvement in the recent data is affordedby high-spatial resolution observations with the chandra x-ray observatory andhigh-spatial resolution radio observations utilizing a number of facilities. inaddition, a considerable number of objects have been observed with the hst inthe near-ir through near-uv bands since the earlier compilations werepublished. the data include upper limits resulting from either non-detectionsor observations at low spatial resolution that do not isolate the agn. for thesake of completeness, we also compute and present a number of quantities fromthe data, such as alpha-ox, bolometric corrections, bolometric luminosities,eddington ratios, and the average sed. we anticipate that these data will beuseful for a number of applications. in a companion paper, we use a subset ofthese data ourselves to assess the energy budgets of liners.

1001.2926	an assessment of the energy budgets of low-ionization nuclear emission  regions	using the seds of the weak agns 35 liners presented in a companion paper, weassess whether photoionization by the weak agn can power the emission-lineluminosities measured through the large (few-arcsecond) apertures used inground-based spectroscopic surveys. spectra taken through such apertures areused to define liners as a class and constrain non-stellar photoionizationmodels for liners. therefore, our energy budget test is a self-consistencycheck of the idea that the observed emission lines are powered by an agn. wedetermine the ionizing luminosities and photon rates by integrating theobserved seds and by scaling a template sed. even if all ionizing photons areabsorbed by the line-emitting gas, more than half of our liners suffer from adeficit of ionizing photons. in 1/3 of liners the deficit is severe. if only10% of the ionizing photons are absorbed by the gas, there is an ionizingphoton deficit in 85% of liners. we disfavor the possibility that additionalelectromagnetic power, either obscured or emitted in the unobservable far-uvband, is available from the agn. we consider other power sources such asmechanical heating by compact jets and photoionization by young or old stars.photoionization by young stars may be important in a small fraction of cases.mechanical heating provides enough power in most cases but it is not clear howthis power is transferred to the emission-line gas. photoionization by post-agbstars is an important power source; it provides more ionizing photons that theagn in more than half of the liners and enough ionizing photons to power theemission lines in 1/3 of the liners. it appears likely that the emission-linespectra of liners obtained from the ground include the sum of emission fromdifferent regions where different power sources dominate.

1001.3174	advection-dominated accretion, jets and the spectral energy distribution  of liners	low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) represent the bulk of the agnpopulation in the present-day universe and they trace low-level accretingsupermassive black holes. the observational properties of llagns suggest thattheir central engines are intrinsically different from those of more luminousagns. it has been suggested that accretion in llagns occurs via anadvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) associated with strong jets. in orderto probe the accretion physics in llagns as a class, we model themultiwavelength spectral energy distributions (seds) of 24 liners (taken from arecent compilation by eracleous et al.) with a coupled accretion-jet model. theaccretion flow is modeled as an inner adaf outside of which there is atruncated standard thin disk. these seds include radio, near-ir to near-uv hstdata, and chandra x-ray data. we find that the radio emission is severelyunderpredicted by adaf models but can be explained by the relativistic jet. theorigin of the x-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by threedistinct scenarios: the x-rays can be dominated by emission from the adaf, thejet, or from both components contributing at similar levels. from the modelfits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine of liners, such asthe mass accretion rate -- relevant for studies of the feeding of agns -- andthe mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power -- relevant for studies of thekinetic feedback from jets.

1003.5700	long-term profile variability in active galactic nuclei with  double-peaked balmer emission lines	an increasing number of active galactic nuclei (agns) exhibit broad,double-peaked balmer emission lines,which represent some of the best evidencefor the existence of relatively large-scale accretion disks in agns. a set of20 double-peaked emitters have been monitored for nearly a decade in order toobserve long-term variations in the profiles of the double-peaked balmer lines.variations generally occur on timescales of years, and are attributed tophysical changes in the accretion disk. here we characterize the variability ofa subset of seven double-peaked emitters in a model independent way. we findthat variability is caused primarily by the presence of one or more discrete"lumps" of excess emission; over a timescale of a year (and sometimes less)these lumps change in amplitude and shape, but the projected velocity of theselumps changes over much longer timescales (several years). we also find thatall of the objects exhibit red peaks that are stronger than the blue peak atsome epochs and/or blueshifts in the overall profile, contrary to theexpectations for a simple, circular accretion disk model, thus emphasizing theneed for asymmetries in the accretion disk. comparisons with two simple models,an elliptical accretion disk and a circular disk with a spiral arm, are unableto reproduce all aspects of the observed variability, although both account forsome of the observed behaviors. three of the seven objects have robustestimates of the black hole masses. for these objects the observed variabilitytimescale is consistent with the expected precession timescale for a spiralarm, but incompatible with that of an elliptical accretion disk. we suggestthat with the simple modification of allowing the spiral arm to be fragmented,many of the observed variability patterns could be reproduced.

0708.0414	modeling of emission signatures of massive black hole binaries: i  methods	we model the electromagnetic signatures of massive black hole binaries(mbhbs) with an associated gas component. the method comprises numericalsimulations of relativistic binaries and gas coupled with calculations of thephysical properties of the emitting gas. we calculate the uv/x-ray and thehalpha light curves and the halpha emission profiles. the simulations arecarried out with a modified version of the parallel tree sph code gadget. theheating, cooling, and radiative processes are calculated for two differentphysical scenarios, where the gas is approximated as a black-body or a solarmetallicity gas. the calculation for the solar metallicity scenario is carriedout with the photoionization code cloudy. we focus on sub-parsec binaries whichhave not yet entered the gravitational radiation phase. the results from thefirst set of calculations, carried out for a coplanar binary and gas disk,suggest that there are pronounced outbursts in the x-ray light curve duringpericentric passages. if such outbursts persist for a large fraction of thelifetime of the system, they can serve as an indicator of this type of binary.the predicted halpha emission line profiles may be used as a criterion forselection of mbhb candidates from existing archival data. the orbital periodand mass ratio of a binary may be inferred after carefully monitoring theevolution of the halpha profiles of the candidates. the discovery of sub-parsecbinaries is an important step in understanding of the merger rates of mbhbs andtheir evolution towards the detectable gravitational wave window.

1008.2339	the size of the broad line region in m84 (ngc 4374)	m84 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the virgo cluster. prior imagingwith the hubble space telescope (hst) revealed a small, highly inclined,nuclear ionized gas disk, the kinematics of which indicate the presence of a0.4 -1.5 billion solar mass black hole. two prominent radio jets emergeperpendicular to the nuclear ionized gas disk terminating in large radio lobesthat extend beyond the visible galaxy. plausible kinematic models are used toconstrain the size of the broad line region (blr) in m84 by modeling the shapeof the broad h-alpha emission line profile. the analysis indicates that theemitting region is large with an outer radius between ~ 7 and 9 pc, dependingon whether the kinematic model is represented by a spherically symmetric inflowor a keplerian disk. the inferred size makes the blr in m84 the largest yet tobe measured. the fact that the blr in m84 is so large may explain why the agnis unable to sustain the ionization seen there. thus, the blr in m84 is notsimply that of a scaled down quasar.

1008.2953	the physical conditions of the intrinsic n v narrow absorption line  systems of three quasars	we employ detailed photoionization models to infer the physical conditions ofintrinsic narrow absorption line systems found in high resolution spectra ofthree quasars at z=2.6-3.0. we focus on a family of intrinsic absorberscharacterized by n v lines that are strong relative to the ly-alpha lines. theinferred physical conditions are similar for the three intrinsic n v absorbers,with metallicities greater than 10 times the solar value (assuming a solarabundance pattern), and with high ionization parameters (log u ~ 0). thus, weconclude that the unusual strength of the n v lines results from a combinationof partial coverage, a high ionization state, and high metallicity. we considerwhether dilution of the absorption lines by flux from the broad-emission lineregion can lead us to overestimate the metallicities and we find that this isan unlikely possibility. the high abundances that we infer are not surprisingin the context of scenarios in which metal enrichment takes place very early onin massive galaxies. we estimate that the mass outflow rate in the absorbinggas (which is likely to have a filamentary structure) is less than a few solarmasses per year under the most optimistic assumptions, although it may beembedded in a much hotter, more massive outflow.

1010.6087	probing intermediate mass black holes with optical emission lines from  tidally disrupted white dwarfs	we calculate the emission line spectrum produced by the debris released whena white dwarf (wd) is tidally disrupted by an intermediate-mass black hole(imbh; $m\sim 10^{2}-10^{5}\msun$) and we explore the possibility of using theemission lines to identify such events and constrain the properties of theimbh. to this end, we adopt and adapt the techniques developed by strubbe &amp;quataert to study the optical emission lines produced when a main sequence (ms)star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole. wds are tidallydisrupted outside of the event horizon of a $&lt; 10^{5}\msun$ black hole, whichmakes these tidal disruption events good signposts of imbhs. we focus on theoptical and uv emission lines produced when the accretion flare photoionizesthe stream of debris that remains unbound during the disruption. we find thatthe spectrum is dominated by lines due to ions of c and o, the strongest ofwhich are \ion{c}{4} $\lambda$1549 at early times and [\ion{o}{3}]$\lambda$5007 at later times. furthermore, we model the profile of the emissionlines in the [\ion{o}{3}] $\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 doublet and find that itis highly asymmetric with velocity widths of up to $\sim 2500\rm{\;km\;s^{-1}}$, depending on the properties of the wd-imbh system and theorientation of the observer. finally, we compare the models with observationsof x-ray flares and optical emission lines in the cores of globular clustersand propose how future observations can test if these features are due to a wdthat has been tidally disrupted by an imbh.

1012.0834	black holes in bulgeless galaxies: an xmm-newton investigation of ngc  3367 and ngc 4536	the vast majority of optically identified active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe local universe reside in host galaxies with prominent bulges, supportingthe hypothesis that black hole formation and growth is fundamentally connectedto the build-up of galaxy bulges. however, recent mid-infrared spectroscopicstudies with spitzer of a sample of optically "normal" late-type galaxiesreveal remarkably the presence of high-ionization [nev] lines in severalsources, providing strong evidence for agns in these galaxies. we presentfollow-up x-ray observations recently obtained with xmm-newton of two suchsources, the late-type optically normal galaxies ngc 3367 and ngc 4536. bothsources are detected in our observations. detailed spectral analysis revealsthat for both galaxies, the 2-10 kev emission is dominated by a power law withan x-ray luminosity in the 10^39 - 10^40 ergs s^-1 range, consistent with lowluminosity agns. while there is a possibility that x-ray binaries account forsome fraction of the observed x-ray luminosity, we argue that this fraction isnegligible. these observations therefore add to the growing evidence that thefraction of late-type galaxies hosting agns is significantly underestimatedusing optical observations alone. a comparison of the mid-infrared [nev]luminosity and the x-ray luminosities suggests the presence of an additionalhighly absorbed x-ray source in both galaxies, and that the black hole massesare in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 m_solar for ngc 3367 and 10^4 - 10^6 m_solarfor ngc 4536.

1106.2952	a large systematic search for recoiling and close supermassive binary  black holes	[abridged] we have carried out a systematic search for close supermassiveblack hole binaries among z &lt; 0.7 sdss quasars such binaries are predicted bymodels of supermassive black hole and host galaxy co-evolution, therefore theircensus and population properties constitute an important test of these models.we used an automatic technique based on spectroscopic principal componentanalysis to search for broad h-beta lines that are displaced from therest-frame of the quasar by more than 1,000 km/s this method can also yieldcandidates for rapidly recoiling black holes. our search yielded 88 candidates,several of which were previously identified and discussed in the literature.the widths of the broad h-beta lines are typical among quasars but the shiftsare extreme. we found a correlation between the peak offset and skewness of thebroad h-beta profiles, which suggests that the profiles we have selected sharea common physical explanation. the general properties of the narrow emissionlines are typical of quasars. we carried out followup spectroscopicobservations of 68 objects to search for changes in the peak velocities of theh-beta lines (the time interval in the observer's frame between the originaland new observations is 1-10 yr). we measured significant changes in 14objects, with resulting accelerations between -120 and +120 km/s/yr. weemphasize that interpretation of the offset broad emission lines as signaturesof supermassive binaries is subject to many significant caveats. many morefollowup observations over a long temporal baseline are needed to characterizethe variability pattern of the broad lines and test that this pattern is indeedconsistent with orbital motion. the possibility that some of the objects inthis sample are rapidly recoiling black holes remains open as the availabledata do not provide strong constraints for this scenario.

1112.4640	spectral energy distribution models for low-luminosity active galactic  nuclei in liners	low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) represent the bulk of the agnpopulation in the present-day universe and they trace the low-level accretingsupermassive black holes. in order to probe the accretion and jet physicalproperties in llagns as a class, we model the broadband radio to x-raysspectral energy distributions (seds) of 21 llagns in low-ionization nuclearemission-line regions (liners) with a coupled accretion-jet model. theaccretion flow is modeled as an inner adaf outside of which there is atruncated standard thin disk. we find that the radio emission is severelyunderpredicted by adaf models and is explained by the relativistic jet. theorigin of the x-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by threedistinct scenarios: the x-rays can be dominated by emission from the adaf, orthe jet, or the x-rays can arise from a jet-adaf combination in which bothcomponents contribute to the emission with similar importance. for 3 objectsboth the jet and adaf fit equally well the x-ray spectrum and can be thedominant source of x-rays whereas for 11 llagns a jet-dominated model accountsbetter than the adaf-dominated model for the data. the individual and averagesed models that we computed can be useful for different studies of the nuclearemission of llagns. from the model fits, we estimate important parameters ofthe central engine powering llagns in liners, such as the mass accretion rateand the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power - relevant for studies ofthe kinetic feedback from jets.

1203.3830	variability of mini-bal and bal outflows in quasars	we report the results of several programs to study the variability ofhigh-velocity (up to 0.2c) mini-"broad absorption lines" (mini-bals) and balsin quasar spectra, and thus to better characterize the structural and physicalproperties of these outflows. after the report of a highly variable mini-baloutflow at a speed of ~0.17c in the quasar pg0935+417, we created the firstsystematic accounting of outflows in sloan digital sky survey (sdss) quasarspectra that includes mini-bals and extremely high velocity outflows (up to0.2c) to measure their frequency. following this study, we began a monitoringcampaign to study the location, and dynamical and evolutionary effects of theseoutflows. this program covers a range of 0.9-3.3 years in the quasars'rest-frame by comparing new spectra (using facilities at the kitt peak nationalobservatory and mdm observatory) with archival sdss spectra. we find that ~57%of quasars with mini-bals and bals varied between just two observations. thisvariability tends to occur in complex ways; however, all the variable linesvary in intensity and not in velocity, not finding evidence foracceleration/deceleration in these outflows. due to the variations in strength,mini-bals can become bals and vice versa, suggesting they share a similarnature. we include as an example the discovery of the transition of a mini-balinto a bal in the spectra of the sdss quasar j115122+020426.

1203.6101	short timescale variations of the h{\alpha} double-peaked profile of the  nucleus of ngc 1097	the broad (fwhm ~ 10,000 km/s) double-peaked h{\alpha} profile from theliner/seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc 1097 was discovered in 1991, and monitored forthe following 11 years. the profile showed variations attributed to therotation of gas in a non-axisymmetric keplerian accretion disk, ionized by avarying radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf) located in the innerparts of the disk. we present and model 11 new spectroscopic observations ofthe double-peaked profile taken between 2010 march and 2011 march. this seriesof observations was motivated by the finding that in 2010 march the flux in thedouble-peaked line was again strong, becoming, in 2010 december, even strongerthan in the observations of a decade ago. we also discovered shorter timescalevariations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, isinterpreted as due to "reverberation" of the variation of the ionizing sourceluminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between thesource and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretationprovides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black holeand as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, ofapproximately 5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in thedisk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. we use two accretiondisk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both havingnon-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral.our modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be approximately18 months. this work supports our previous conclusion that the broaddouble-peaked balmer emission lines in ngc 1097, and probably also in otherlow-luminosity active nuclei, originate from an accretion disk ionized by acentral riaf.

1302.0201	the physics and physical properties of quasar outflows	we describe two studies designed to characterize the total column densities,kinetic energies, and acceleration physics of broad absorption line (bal)outflows in quasars. the first study uses new chandra x-ray and ground-basedrest-frame uv observations of 7 quasars with mini-bals at extreme high speeds,in the range 0.1c to 0.2c, to test the idea that strong radiative shielding isneeded to moderate the mini-bal ionizations and facilitate their accelerationto extreme speeds. we find that the x-ray absorption is weak or absent, withgenerally n_h &lt; few x 10^22 mc^-2, and that radiative shielding is notimportant. we argue that the mini-bal ionizations are controlled, instead, byhigh gas densities of order n_h ~ 4 x 10^8 cm^-3 in small outflowsubstructures. if we conservatively assume that the total column density in themini-bal gas is n_h &lt; 10^22 cm^-2, covering &gt;15% of the uv continuum sourcealong our lines of sight (based on measured line depths), then the radialthickness of these outflows is only delta_r &lt; 3 x 10^13 cm and their transversesize is &gt; 8 x 10^15 cm. thus the outflow regions have the shape of very thin"pancakes" viewed face-on, or they occupy larger volumes like a spray of densecloudlets with a very small volume filling factor. we speculate that thissituation (with ineffective shielding and small dense outflow substructures)applies to most quasar outflows, including bals. our second study focuses frombals of low-abundance ions, mainly pv 1118,1128 a, whose significant strengthsimply large column densities, n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2, that can further challengemodels of the outflow acceleration. in spite of the difficulties of findingthis line in the ly-alpha forest, a search through the sdss dr9 quasar catalogreveals &gt;50 bal sources at redshifts z&gt;2.3 with strong pv bals, which we arenow using to characterize the general properties of high-column outflows.

0801.1692	exploratory study of the x-ray properties of quasars with intrinsic  narrow absorption lines	we have used archival chandra and xmm-newton observations of quasars hostingintrinsic narrow uv absorption lines (intrinsic nals) to carry out anexploratory survey of their x-ray properties. our sample consists of threeintrinsic-nal quasars and one "mini-bal" quasar, plus four quasars withoutintrinsic absorption lines for comparison. these were drawn in a systematicmanner from an optical/uv-selected sample. the x-ray properties ofintrinsic-nal quasars are indistinguishable from those of "normal" quasars. wedo not find any excess absorption in quasars with intrinsic nals, with upperlimits of a few times 10^22 cm^-2. we compare the x-ray and uv properties ofour sample quasars by plotting the equivalent width and blueshift velocity ofthe intrinsic nals and the x-ray spectral index against the "optical-to-x-ray"slope, alpha-ox. when bal quasars and other agns with intrinsic nals areincluded, the plots suggest that intrinsic-nal quasars form an extension of thebal sequences and tend to bridge the gap between bal and "normal" quasars.observations of larger samples of intrinsic-nal quasars are needed to verifythese conclusions. we also test two competing scenarios for the location of thenal gas in an accretion-disk wind. our results strongly support a location ofthe nal gas at high latitudes above the disk, closer to the disk axis than thedense bal wind. we detect excess x-ray absorption only in q0014+8118, whichdoes not host intrinsic nals. the absorbing medium very likely corresponds toan intervening system at z=1.1, which also produces strong absorption lines inthe rest-frame uv spectrum of this quasar. in the appendix we discuss theconnection between uv and x-ray attenuation and its effect on alpha-ox.

1307.1173	extreme-velocity quasar outflows and the role of x-ray shielding	quasar accretion disk winds observed via broad absorption lines (bals) in theuv produce strong continuous absorption in x-rays. the x-ray absorber isbelieved to serve critically as a radiative shield to enable radiative driving.however, "mini-bal" and narrow absorption line outflows have dramatically lessx-ray absorption than bals. here we examine x-ray and rest-frame uv spectra of8 mini-bal quasars with outflow speeds in the range 0.1c to 0.2c to testwhether extreme speeds require a strong shield. we find that the x-rayabsorption is weak or moderate, with neutral-equivalent column densities n_h &lt;few times 10^22 cm^-2, consistent with mini-bals at lower speeds. we usephotoionization models to show that this amount of shielding is too weak tocontrol the outflow ionizations and, therefore, it is not important for theacceleration. shielding in complex geometries also seems unlikely because thealleged shield would need to extinguish the ionizing far-uv flux while avoidingdetection in x-rays and the near-uv.  we argue that the outflow ionizations are kept moderate, instead, by high gasdensities in small clouds. if the mini-bals form at radial distances of order r~ 2 pc from the central quasar (broadly consistent with theoretical models andwith the mini-bal variabilities observed here and in previous work), and thetotal column densities in the mini-bal gas are n_h ~&lt; 10^21 cm^-2, then thetotal radial extent of outflow clouds is only delta-r_clouds ~&lt; 3 x 10^13 cmand the radial filling factor is delta-r_clouds/r ~&lt; 5 x 10^-6 forweak/negligible shielding. compared to the transverse sizes &gt;~ 8 x 10^15 cm(based on measured line depths), the outflows have shapes like thin "pancakes"viewed face-on, or they occupy larger volumes like a spray of many dense cloudswith a small volume filling factor. these results favor models with magneticconfinement in magnetic disk winds.

1307.6266	discovery of the transition of a mini-broad absorption line into broad  absorption in the sdss quasar j115122.14+020426.3	we present the detection of a rare case of dramatic strengthening in the uvabsorption profiles in the spectrum of the quasar j115122.14+020426.3 betweenobservations ~2.86 years apart in the quasar rest-frame. a 2001 spectrum fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) shows a civ "mini-broad" absorption line(fwhm=1,220 km/s) with a maximum blueshift velocity ~9,520 km/s, while a laterspectrum from the very large telescope (vlt) shows significantly broader andstronger absorption line, with a maximum blueshift velocity of ~12,240 km/s,that qualifies as a broad absorption line. a similar variability pattern isobserved in two additional systems at lower blueshifted velocities and in thelya and nv transitions as well. one of the absorption systems appears to beresolved and shows evidence for partial covering of the quasar continuum source(cf~0.65), indicating a transverse absorber size of, at least, ~6 x 10^(16) cm.in contrast, a cluster of narrower civ lines appears to originate in gas thatfully covers the continuum and broad emission line sources. there is noevidence for changes in the centroid velocity of the absorption troughs. thiscase suggests that, at least some of the absorbers that produce "mini-broad"and broad absorption lines in quasar spectra do not belong to intrinsicallyseparate classes. here, the "mini-broad" absorption line is most likelyinterpreted as an intermediate phase before the appearance of a broadabsorption line due to their similar velocity. while the current observationsdo not provide enough constraints to discern among the possible causes for thisvariability, future monitoring of multiple transitions at high resolution willhelp achieve this goal.

1307.6799	a census of quasar-intrinsic absorption in the hubble space telescope  archive: systems from high resolution echelle spectra	we present a census of z(abs) &lt; 2, intrinsic (those showing partial coverage)and associated [z(abs) ~ z(em)] quasar absorption-line systems detected in thehubble space telescope archive of space telescope imaging spectrograph echellespectra. this work complements the misawa et al. (2007) survey of 2 &lt; z(em) &lt; 4quasars that selects systems using similar techniques. we confirm the existenceof so-called "strong n v" intrinsic systems (where the equivalent width of h ily alpha is small compared to n v 1238) presented in that work, but find noconvincing cases of "strong c iv" intrinsic systems at low redshift/luminosity.moreover, we also report on the existence of "strong o vi" systems. from acomparison of partial coverage results as a function of ion, we conclude thatsystems selected by the n v ion have the highest probability of beingintrinsic. by contrast, the c iv and o vi ions are poor selectors. of the 30 ovi systems tested, only two of the systems in the spectrum on 3c 351 showconvincing evidence for partial coverage. however, there is a 3-sigma excess inthe number of absorbers near the quasar redshift (|delta v| &lt;= 5000 km/s) overabsorbers at large redshift differences. in at least two cases, the associatedo vi systems are known not to arise close to the accretion disk of the quasar.

1312.1982	spectral models for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in liners: the  role of advection-dominated accretion and jets	we perform an exploratory study of the physical properties of accretion flowsand jets in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) by modeling thespectral energy distributions (seds) of 12 llagns in low-ionization nuclearemission-line regions (liners). these seds we constructed from high-resolutionradio, x-ray and optical/uv observations of the immediate vicinity of the blackhole. we adopt a coupled accretion-jet model comprising an inneradvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) and an outer standard thin disk. wepresent best-fit models in which either the adaf or the jet dominate the x-rayemission. six sources in our sample display an optical-uv excess with respectto adaf and jet models; this excess can be explained as emission from thetruncated disk with transition radii 30-225 rs in four of them. in almost allsources the optical emission can also be attributed to unresolved, old stellarclusters with masses ~1e7-1e8 msun. we find evidence for a correlation betweenthe accretion rate and jet power and an anti-correlation between theradio-loudness and the accretion rate. we confirm previous findings that theradio emission is severely underpredicted by adaf models and explained by therelativistic jet. we find evidence for a nonlinear relation between the x-rayand bolometric luminosities and a slight ir excess in the average model sedcompared to that of quasars. we suggest that the hardness of the x-ray spectrumcan be used to identify the x-ray emission mechanism and discuss directions forprogress in understanding the origin of the x-rays.

1407.5998	monitoring the variability of intrinsic absorption lines in quasar  spectra	we have monitored 12 intrinsic narrow absorption lines (nals) in five quasarsand seven mini-broad absorption lines (mini-bals) in six quasars for a periodof 4-12 years (1-3.5 years in the quasar rest-frame). we present theobservational data and the conclusions that follow immediately from them, as aprelude to a more detailed analysis. we found clear variability in theequivalent widths (ews) of the mini-bal systems but no easily discerniblechanges in their profiles. we did not detect any variability in the nal systemsnor in narrow components that are often located at the center of mini-balprofiles. variations in mini-bal ews are larger at longer time intervals,reminiscent of the trend seen in variable broad absorption lines. if we assumethat the observed variations result from changes in the ionization state of themini-bal gas, we infer lower limits to the gas density $\sim$ 10$^3$-10$^5$cm$^{-3}$ and upper limits on the distance of the absorbers from the centralengine of order a few kpc. motivated by the observed variability properties, wesuggest that mini-bals can vary because of fluctuations of the ionizingcontinuum or changes in partial coverage while nals can vary primarily becauseof changes in partial coverage.

1408.4451	black holes at the centers of nearby dwarf galaxies	using a distance-limited portion of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) datarelease 7, we have identified 28 active galactic nuclei (agns) in nearby (d &lt;80 mpc) low-mass, low-luminosity dwarf galaxies. the accreting objects at thegalaxy centers are expected to be intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) withm_bh &lt; 1e6 m_sun. the agns were selected using several optical emission-linediagnostics after careful modeling of the continuum present in the spectra. wehave limited our survey to objects with spectral characteristics similar tothose of seyfert nuclei, excluding emission-line galaxies with ambiguousspectra that could be powered by stellar processes. the host galaxies in oursample are thus the least massive objects in the very local universe certain tocontain central black holes. given our focus on the nearest objects included inthe sdss, our survey is more sensitive to low-luminosity emission than previousoptical searches for agns in low-mass galaxies. the [o iii] lambda5007luminosities of the seyfert nuclei in our sample have a median value of l_5007= 2e5 l_sun and extend down to 1e4 l_sun. using published data for broad-lineimbh candidates, we have derived an [o iii] bolometric correction of log(l_bol/l_5007) = 3.0 +/- 0.3, which is significantly lower than values obtainedfor high-luminosity agns. applying this correction to our sample, we obtainminimum black-hole mass estimates that fall mainly in the 10^3 m_sun -- 10^4m_sun range, which is roughly where the predicted mass functions for differentblack-hole seed formation scenarios overlap the most. in the stellar mass rangethat includes the bulk of the agn host galaxies in our sample, we derive alower limit on the agn fraction of a few percent, indicating that active nucleiin dwarf galaxies are not as rare as previously thought.

1411.4682	short-timescale monitoring of the x-ray, uv and broad double-peak  emission line of the nucleus of ngc 1097	recent studies have suggested that the short-timescale ($\lesssim7$ days)variability of the broad ($\sim$10,000 km s$^{-1}$) double-peaked h$\alpha$profile of the liner nucleus of ngc1097 could be driven by a variable x-rayemission from a central radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf). to testthis scenario, we have monitored the ngc1097 nucleus in x-ray and uv continuumwith swift and the h$\alpha$ flux and profile in the optical spectrum usingsoar and gemini-south from 2012 august to 2013 february. during the monitoringcampaign, the h$\alpha$ flux remained at a very low level --- 3 times lowerthan the maximum flux observed in previous campaigns and showing only limited($\sim 20\%$) variability. the x-ray variations were small, only $\sim 13\%$throughout the campaign, while the uv did not show significant variations. weconcluded that the timescale of the h$\alpha$ profile variation is close to thesampling interval of the optical observations, which results in only marginalcorrelation between the x-ray and h$\alpha$ fluxes. we have caught the agn inngc1097 in a very low activity state, in which the ionizing source was veryweak and capable of ionizing just the innermost part of the gas in the disk.nonetheless, the data presented here still support the picture in which the gasthat emits the broad double-peaked balmer lines is illuminated/ionized by asource of high-energy photons which is located interior to the inner radius ofthe line-emitting part of the disk.

1412.2136	the discovery of the first "changing look" quasar: new insights into the  physics &amp; phenomenology of agn	sdss j015957.64+003310.5 is an x-ray selected, $z=0.31$ agn from the stripe82x survey that transitioned from a type 1 quasar to a type 1.9 agn between2000 and 2010. this is the most distant agn, and first quasar, yet observed tohave undergone such a dramatic change. we re-observed the source with thedouble spectrograph on the palomar 5m telescope in july 2014 and found that thespectrum is unchanged since 2010. from fitting the optical spectra, we findthat the agn flux dropped by a factor of 6 between 2000 and 2010 while thebroad h$\alpha$ emission faded and broadened. serendipitous x-ray observationscaught the source in both the bright and dim state, showing a similar 2-10 kevflux diminution as the optical while lacking signatures of obscuration. theoptical and x-ray changes coincide with $g$-band magnitude variations overmultiple epochs of stripe 82 observations. we demonstrate that variableabsorption, as might be expected from the simplest agn unification paradigm,does not explain the observed photometric or spectral properties. we interpretthe changing state of j0159+0033 to be caused by dimming of the agn continuum,reducing the supply of ionizing photons available to excite gas in theimmediate vicinity around the black hole. j0159+0033 provides insight into theintermittency of black hole growth in quasars, as well as an unprecedentedopportunity to study quasar physics (in the bright state) and the host galaxy(in the dim state), which has been impossible to do in a single sources untilnow.

1509.02575	a large systematic search for close supermassive binary and rapidly  recoiling black holes - ii. continued spectroscopic monitoring and optical  flux variability	we present new spectroscopic observations that are part of our continuingmonitoring campaign of 88 quasars at z&lt;0.7 whose broad h$\beta$ lines areoffset from their systemic redshifts by a few thousand km/s. these quasars havebeen considered candidates for hosting supermassive black hole binaries (sbhbs)by analogy with single-lined spectroscopic binary stars. we present the dataand describe our improved analysis techniques, which include an extensiveevaluation of uncertainties. we also present a variety of measurements from thespectra that are of general interest and will be useful in later stages of ouranalysis. additionally, we take this opportunity to study the variability ofthe optical continuum and integrated flux of the broad h$\beta$ line. wecompare the variability properties of the sbhb candidates to those of a sampleof typical quasars with similar redshifts and luminosities observed multipletimes during the sloan digital sky survey. we find that the variabilityproperties of the two samples are similar (variability amplitudes of 10-30% ontime scales of approximately 1-7 years) and that their structure functions canbe described by a common model with parameters characteristic of typicalquasars. these results suggest that the broad-line regions of sbhb candidateshave a similar extent as those of typical quasars. we discuss the implicationsof this result for the sbhb scenario and ensuing constraints on the orbitalparameters.

1509.03640	now you see it, now you don't: the disappearing central engine of the  quasar j1011+5442	we report the discovery of a new "changing-look" quasar, sdssj101152.98+544206.4, through repeat spectroscopy from the time domainspectroscopic survey. this is an addition to a small but growing set of quasarswhose blue continua and broad optical emission lines have been observed todecline by a large factor on a time scale of approximately a decade. the 5100angstrom monochromatic continuum luminosity of this quasar drops by a factor of&gt; 9.8 in a rest-frame time interval of &lt; 9.7 years, while the broad h-alphaluminosity drops by a factor of 55 in the same amount of time. the width of thebroad h-alpha line increases in the dim state such that the black hole massderived from the appropriate single-epoch scaling relation agrees between thetwo epochs within a factor of 3. the fluxes of the narrow emission lines do notappear to change between epochs. the light curve obtained by the catalina skysurvey suggests that the transition occurs within a rest-frame time interval ofapproximately 500 days. we examine three possible mechanisms for thistransition suggested in the recent literature. an abrupt change in thereddening towards the central engine is disfavored by the substantialdifference between the timescale to obscure the central engine and the observedtimescale of the transition. a decaying tidal disruption flare is consistentwith the decay rate of the light curve but not with the prolonged bright statepreceding the decay, nor can this scenario provide the power required by theluminosities of the emission lines. an abrupt drop in the accretion rate ontothe supermassive black hole appears to be the most plausible explanation forthe rapid dimming.

0806.0163	interpreting the variability of double-peaked emission lines in active  galactic nuclei with stochastically perturbed accretion disk models	in an effort to explain the short-timescale variability of the broad,double-peaked profiles of some active galactic nuclei, we constructedstochastically perturbed accretion disk models and calculated h alpha lineprofile series as the bright spots rotate, shear and decay. we determined thedependence of the properties of the line profile variability on the spotproperties. we compared the variability of the line profile from the models tothe observed variability of the h alpha line of arp 102b and 3c 390.3. we findthat spots need to be concentrated in the outer parts of the line emittingregion to reproduce the observed variability properties for arp 102b. thisrules out spot production by star/disk collisions and favors a scenario wherethe radius of marginal self-gravity is within the line emitting region,creating a sharp increase in the radial spot distribution in the outer parts.in the case of 3c 390.3, all the families of models that we tested canreproduce the observed variability for a suitable choice of model parameters.

1512.01825	a radial velocity test for supermassive black hole binaries as an  explanation for broad, double-peaked emission lines in active galactic nuclei	one of the proposed explanations for the broad, double-peaked balmer emissionlines observed in the spectra of some active galactic nuclei (agns) is thatthey are associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole (smbh) binaries.here, we test the binary broad-line region hypothesis through several decadesof monitoring of the velocity structure of double-peaked h-alpha emission linesin 13 low-redshift, mostly radio-loud agns. this is a much larger set ofobjects compared to an earlier test by eracleous et al. (1997) and we use muchlonger time series for the three objects studied in that paper. althoughsystematic changes in radial velocity can be traced in many of their lines,they are demonstrably not like those of a spectroscopic binary in a circularorbit. any spectroscopic binary period must therefore be much longer than thespan of the monitoring (assuming a circular orbit), which in turn would requireblack hole masses that exceed by 1-2 orders of magnitude the values obtainedfor these objects using techniques such as reverberation mapping and stellarvelocity dispersion. moreover, the response of the double-peaked balmer lineprofiles to fluctuations of the ionizing continuum and the shape of thely-alpha profiles are incompatible with a smbh binary. the binary broad-lineregion hypothesis is therefore disfavored. other processes evidently shapethese line profiles and cause the long-term velocity variations of the doublepeaks.

0808.0857	a chandra look at five of the broadest double-peaked balmer-line  emitters	we study the 0.5-10kev emission of a sample of five of the broadestdouble-peaked balmer-line emitters with chandra. the balmer lines of theseobjects originate close (within a few hundred gravitational radii) to thecentral black holes of the active galactic nuclei (agns), and theirdouble-peaked profiles suggest an origin in the agn accretion disk. we findthat four of the five targets can be modeled by simple power-law continua withphoton indices (1.6-1.8) typical of similar luminosity agns. one object, sdssj0132-0952, shows evidence of ionized intrinsic absorption. the most-luminoussdss double-peaked emitter, sdss j2125-0813, has either an unusual flatspectrum (~1) or is also highly absorbed. it is the only double-peaked emitterfor which no external illumination is necessary to account for the balmer lineemission. the strength of the balmer-line emission in the remaining fourobjects suggests that the total line flux likely exceeds the viscous energythat can be extracted locally from the accretion disk and external illuminationis necessary. all five double-peaked emitters have unusually strong x-rayemission relative to their uv/optical emission, which is the likely source ofthe external illumination necessary for the production of the observed strongbroad lines. on average about 30% of their bolometric luminosities are emittedbetween 0.5-10kev. the spectral energy distributions of the five double-peakedemitters show the big blue bumps characteristic of radiatively efficientaccretion flows. the balmer line profiles, as well as the optical and x-rayfluxes of the double-peaked emitters, are highly variable on timescales ofmonths to years in the agn rest frame.

astro-ph;0004401	double-peaked broad emission lines in ngc 4450 and other liners	spectra taken with hst reveal that ngc 4450 emits balmer emission lines withdisplaced double peaks and extremely high-velocity wings. this characteristicline profile, previously seen in a few nearby liners and in a small fraction ofbroad-line radio galaxies, can be interpreted as a kinematic signature of arelativistic accretion disk. we can reproduce the observed profile with a modelfor a disk with a radial range of 1000-2000 gravitational radii and inclined by27 degrees along the line of sight. the small-aperture hst data also allow usto detect, for the first time, the featureless continuum at optical wavelengthsin ngc 4450; the nonstellar nucleus is intrinsically very faint, with m_b =-11.2 mag for d = 16.8 mpc. we have examined the multiwavelength properties ofngc 4450 collectively with those of other low-luminosity active nuclei whichpossess double-peaked broad lines and find a number of common features. theseobjects are all classified spectroscopically as "type 1" liners or closelyrelated objects. the nuclear luminosities are low, both in absolute terms andrelative to the eddington rates. all of them have compact radio cores, whosestrength relative to the optical nuclear emission places them in the league ofradio-loud active nuclei. the broad-band spectral energy distributions of thesesources are most notable for their deficit of ultraviolet emission compared tothose observed in luminous seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars. the double-peakedbroad-line radio galaxies arp 102b and pictor a have very similar attributes.we discuss how these characteristics can be understood in the context ofadvection-dominated accretion onto massive black holes.

astro-ph;0101050	ngc 3065: a certified liner with broad, variable balmer lines	motivated by the x-ray properties of the galaxy ngc 3065, we have obtainednew optical spectra which reveal that it has a low-ionization nuclearemission-line region (liner) as well as broad balmer emission lines,establishing it as an active galactic nucleus. we also examined an olderspectrum from the cfa redshift survey which, lacking broad balmer lines,indicates that they appeared some time after 1980. thus ngc 3065 joins the setof liners with broad, variable balmer lines, which includes such well-knowngalaxies as ngc 1097 and m81. inspired by the sometimes double-peaked profilesof the variable balmer lines in other liners, we speculate that the broadbalmer lines of ngc 3065 also come from an accretion disk. we illustrate theplausibility of this hypothesis by fitting a disk model to the observedh$\alpha$ profile. we also estimate the mass of the central black hole as(9+/-4) 10^7 m_sol from the properties of the host galaxy, which leads to theconclusion that the accretion rate is only 2 10^{-4} times the eddington value,a property that appears to be common among liners. at such a low relativeaccretion rate the inner accretion disk can turn into a vertically-extended iontorus, which can illuminate the outer, thin disk and power the broad-lineemission. the reason for the sudden appearance of broad balmer lines is an openquestion, although we suggest two possible explanations: tidal disruption of astar or a sudden transition in the structure of the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0304399	emission-line diagnostics of the central engines of weak-line radio  galaxies	a handful of well-studied weak-line radio galaxies (wlrgs) have beentraditionally classified as low ionization nuclear emission-line regions(liners), suggesting that these two groups of agns might be related. in thispaper, we present new optical emission-line measurements for twenty weak-lineradio galaxies which we supplement with measurements for an additional fourfrom the literature. classifying these objects by their emission-line ratios,we find that 50% of the objects are robustly classified as liners while anadditional 25% are likely to be liners. photoionization calculations show thatthe spectral energy distribution of the well-studied wlrg 3c 270 (ngc 4261) isable to produce the observed emission-line ratios, but only if the uv emissionseen by the narrow emission-line gas is significantly higher than thatobserved, implying a_v = 2.5-4.2 magnitudes along our line of sight to thenucleus. from the photoionization calculations, we find that the emission-linegas must have an ionization parameter between 10^-3.5 and 10^-4.0 and a widerange in hydrogen density (10^2-10^6 cm^-3) to reproduce the measuredemission-line ratios, similar to the properties inferred for the emission-linegas in liners. thus, we find that properties of the emission-line gas as wellas the underlying excitation mechanism are indeed similar in liners and wlrgs.by extension, the central engines of accretion-powered liners and wlrgs, whichdo host an accreting black hole, may be qualitatively similar.

astro-ph;0401013	a study of qso evolution in the x-ray band with the aid of gravitational  lensing	we present results from a mini-survey of relatively high redshift (1.7 &lt; z &lt;4) gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasars observed with the chandra x-rayobservatory and with xmm-newton. the lensing magnification effect allows us tosearch for changes in quasar spectroscopic and flux variability properties withredshift over three orders of magnitude in intrinsic x-ray luminosity. itextends the study of quasar properties to unlensed x-ray flux levels as low asa few times 10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the observed 0.4-8 kev band. we finda possible correlation between the x-ray powerlaw photon index and x-rayluminosity of the gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasar sample. the x-rayspectral slope steepens as the x-ray luminosity increases. this correlation isstill significant when we combine our data with other samples of radio-quietquasars with z &gt; 1.5, especially in the low luminosity range between10^{43}-10^{45.5} erg s^{-1}. this result is surprising considering that such acorrelation is not found for quasars with redshifts below 1.5. we suggest thatthis correlation can be understood in the context of the hot-corona model forx-ray emission from quasar accretion disks, under the hypothesis that thequasars in our sample accrete very close to their eddington limits and theobserved luminosity range is set by the range of black hole masses (thishypothesis is consistent with recent predictions of semi-analytic models forquasar evolution). the upper limits of x-ray variability of our relatively highredshift sample of lensed quasars are consistent with the known correlationbetween variability and luminosity observed in seyfert 1s when this correlationis extrapolated to the larger luminosities of our sample.

astro-ph;0404256	tidal disruption of a star by a black hole : observational signature	we have modeled the time-variable profiles of the halpha emission line fromthe non-axisymmetric disk and debris tail created in the tidal disruption of asolar-type star by a million solar mass black hole. two tidal disruption eventsimulations were carried out using a three dimensional relativisticsmooth-particle hydrodynamic code, to describe the early evolution of thedebris during the first fifty to ninety days. we have calculated the physicalconditions and radiative processes in the debris using the photoionization codecloudy. we model the emission line profiles in the period immediately after theaccretion rate onto the black hole became significant. we find that the lineprofiles at these very early stages of the evolution of the post-disruptiondebris do not resemble the double peaked profiles expected from a rotating disksince the debris has not yet settled into such a stable structure. as a resultof the uneven distribution of the debris and the existence of a ``tidal tail''(the stream of returning debris), the line profiles depend sensitively on theorientation of the tail relative to the line of sight. moreover, the predictedline profiles vary on fairly short time scales (of order hours to days). giventhe accretion rate onto the black hole we also model the halpha light curvefrom the debris and the evolution of the halpha line profiles in time.

astro-ph;0412537	a simultaneous rxte and xmm-newton observation of the broad-line radio  galaxy 3c 111	we present the results of simultaneous xmm-newton and rxte observations ofthe broad-line radio galaxy 3c 111. we find that the compton reflection bump isextremely weak, however, broad residuals are clearly present in the spectrumnear the fe kalpha emission line region. when fitted with a gaussian emissionline,the feature has an equivalent width of 40-100ev and full-width at halfmaximum of greater than 20,000 km/s, however the exact properties of this weakline are highly dependent upon the chosen continuum model. the width of theline suggests an origin in the inner accretion disk, which is, however,inconsistent with the lack of compton reflection. we find that much of thebroad residual emission can be attributed to continuum curvature. the data areconsistent with a model in which the primary powerlaw continuum is reprocessedby an accretion disk which is truncated as small radii. alternatively, theprimary source could be partially covered by a dense absorber. the latter modelis less attractive than the former because of the small inclination angle ofthe jet of 3c 111 to the line of sight. we consider it likely that the curvedcontinuum of the partial covering model is fortuitously similar to thecontinuum shape of the reprocessing model. in both models, the fit is greatlyimproved by the addition of an unresolved fe k alpha emission line, which couldarise either in a compton-thin obscuring torus or dense clouds lying along theline of sight. we also find that there are unacceptable residuals at lowenergies in the mos data in particular, which were modeled as a gaussian withan energy of ~1.5 kev; we attribute these residuals to calibrationuncertainties of the mos detectors.

astro-ph;0502109	extreme x-ray behavior of the low-luminosity active nucleus in ngc 4395	we present the results of a 17 ks chandra acis-s observation of the nearbydwarf spiral galaxy ngc 4395. chandra affords the first high-quality, broadbandx-ray detection of the active nucleus of this object that is uncontaminated bynearby sources in the field. we find the nuclear x-ray source to be unresolvedand confirm the rapid, large-amplitude variability reported in previousstudies. the light curve appears to show ~ 11 cycles of a quasi-periodicoscillation with a period of ~ 400 s. if associated with an orbital featurenear the innermost stable orbit of the accretion disk, this period wouldconstrain the black-hole mass to be m &lt; 9e5 m_sun. the x-ray spectrum indicatesabsorption by an ionized medium, and the spectral shape appears to vary overthe course of our observation. contrary to prior reports, however, the spectralvariations are uncorrelated with changes in the hard x-ray flux. it is possiblethat the short-term spectral variability we observe results from column densityfluctuations in the ionized absorber. a power-law fit to the spectrum above 1kev yields a photon index of gamma ~ 0.6, much flatter than that typicallyobserved in the spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies. we have ruled out photon pile-upas the cause of the flat spectrum. even when complex spectral features areconsidered, the photon index is constrained to be gamma &lt; 1.25 (90%confidence). comparing our results with previous determinations of the photonindex (gamma = 1.46 and 1.72), we conclude that the slope of the primarycontinuum varies significantly on time scales of a year or less. the extremeflatness and dramatic long-term variability of the x-ray spectrum areunprecedented among active galactic nuclei.

astro-ph;0505303	observational signature of tidal disruption of a star by a massive black  hole	we have modeled the time-variable profiles of the balmer alpha emission fromthe nonaxisymmetric disk and debris tail created in the tidal disruption of asolar-type star by a million solar mass black hole. two tidal disruption eventswere simulated using a three dimensional relativistic smoothed particlehydrodynamic code to describe the early evolution of the debris during thefirst 50-90 days. we have calculated the physical conditions and radiativeprocesses in the debris using the photoionization code cloudy. we model theemission-line profiles in the period immediately after the accretion rate ontothe black hole becomes significant. we find that the line profiles at thesevery early stages of the evolution of the postdisruption debris do not resemblethe double-peaked profiles expected from a rotating disk, since the debris hasnot yet settled into such a stable structure. as a result of the unevendistribution of the debris and the existence of a ``tidal tail'' (the stream ofreturning debris), the line profiles depend sensitively on the orientation ofthe tail relative to the line of sight. moreover, the predicted line profilesvary on fairly short time scales (of order hours to days). given the accretionrate onto the black hole we also model the balmer alpha light curve from thedebris.

astro-ph;0512540	radiatively inefficient accretion flow in the nucleus of ngc 1097	we present a model for the accretion flow around the supermassive black holein the liner nucleus of ngc 1097 which fits the optical to x-ray spectralenergy distribution (sed). the x-ray segment of the sed is based onobservations with the chandra x-ray observatory, which are reported here forthe first time. the inner part of the flow is modeled as a radiativelyinefficient accretion flow (riaf) and the outer part as a standard thin disk.the value of the transition radius (~225 schwarzschild radii) between the riafand outer thin disk was obtained from our previous fitting of the double-peakedbalmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk. the black holemass was inferred from measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in thehost galaxy. when these parameters are used in the accretion flow model, thesed can be successfully reproduced, which shows that the line profile model andthe accretion flow model are consistent with each other. a small remainingexcess in the near-uv is accounted by the contribution of an obscured starburstlocated within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported in an earlier paper. theradio flux is consistent with synchrotron emission of a relativistic jetmodeled by means of the internal shock scenario. in an appendix we also analyzethe chandra x-ray observations of the ~1 kpc circumnuclear star-forming ringand of an ultraluminous compact x-ray source located outside the ring.

astro-ph;0609766	electromagnetic signatures of massive black hole binaries	we model the electromagnetic emission signatures of massive black holebinaries (mbhbs) with an associated gas component. the method comprisesnumerical simulations of relativistic binaries and gas coupled withcalculations of the physical properties of the emitting gas. we calculate theaccretion powered uv/x-ray and halpha light curves and the halpha emission lineprofiles. the simulations have been carried out with a modified version of theparallel tree sph code gadget. the heating, cooling, and radiative processesfor the solar metallicity gas have been calculated with the photoionizationcode cloudy. we investigate gravitationally bound, sub-parsec binaries whichhave not yet entered the gravitational radiation phase. the results from thefirst set of calculations, carried out for a coplanar binary and gas disk,suggest that the outbursts in the x-ray light curve are pronounced duringpericentric passages and can serve as a fingerprint for this type of binariesif periodic outbursts are a long lived signature of the binary. the halphaemission-line profiles also offer strong indications of a binary presence andmay be used as a criterion for selection of mbhb candidates for furthermonitoring from existing archival data. the orbital period and mass ratio of abinary could be determined from the halpha light curves and profiles ofcarefully monitored candidates. although systems with the orbital periodsstudied here are not within the frequency band of the laser interferometerspace antenna (lisa), their discovery is important for understanding of themerger rates of mbhbs and the evolution of such binaries through the lastparsec and towards the detectable gravitational wave window.

astro-ph;0701661	results of monitoring the dramatically variable c iv mini-bal system in  the quasar hs 1603+3820	we present six new and two previously published high-resolution spectra ofthe quasar hs 1603+3820 (z_em = 2.542) taken over an interval of 4.2 years (1.2years in the quasar rest frame). the observations were made with thehigh-dispersion spectrograph on the subaru telescope and medium-resolutionspectrograph on the hobby-eberly telescope. the purpose was to study the narrowabsorption lines (nals). we use time variability as well as coverage fractionanalysis to separate intrinsic absorption lines, which are physically relatedto the quasar, from intervening absorption lines. by fitting models to the lineprofiles, we derive the parameters of the respective absorbers as a function oftime. only the mini-bal system at z_abs ~ 2.43 (v_off ~ 9,500 km/s) shows bothpartial coverage and time variability, although two nal systems possibly showevidence of partial coverage. we find that all the troughs of the mini-balsystem vary in concert and its total equivalent width variations resemble thoseof the coverage fraction. however, no other correlations are seen between thevariations of different model parameters. thus, the observed variations cannotbe reproduced by a simple change of ionization state nor by motion of ahomogeneous parcel of gas across the cylinder of sight. we propose that theobserved variations are a result of rapid continuum fluctuations, coupled withcoverage fraction fluctuations caused by a clumpy screen of variable opticaldepth located between the continuum source and the mini-bal gas. an alternativeexplanation is that the observed partial coverage signature is the result ofscattering of continuum photons around the absorber, thus the equivalent widthof the mini-bal can vary as the intensity of the scattered continuum changes.

astro-ph;9703023	measurement of an agn central mass on centiparsec scales: results of  long-term optical monitoring of arp 102b	the optical spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy arp 102b has beenmonitored for more than thirteen years to investigate the nature of the sourceof its broad, double-peaked hydrogen balmer emission lines. the shape of thelines varied subtly; there was an interval during which the variation in theratio of the fluxes of the two peaks appeared to be sinusoidal, with a periodof 2.16 years and an amplitude of about 16% of the average value. the variablepart of the broad h-alpha line is well fit by a model in which a region ofexcess emission (a quiescent ``hot spot'') within an accretion disk (fitted tothe non-varying portion of the double-peaked line) completes at least twocircular orbits and eventually fades. fits to spectra from epochs when the hotspot is not present allow determination of the disk inclination, while fits forepochs when it is present provide a measurement of the radius of the hot spot'sorbit. from these data and the period of variation, we find that the masswithin the hot spot's orbit is 2.2 +0.2/-0.7 times 10^8 solar masses, withinthe range of previous estimates of masses of active galactic nuclei. becausethis mass is determined at a relatively small distance (~1000 au) from thecentral body, it is extremely difficult to explain without assuming that asupermassive black hole lies within arp 102b. the lack of any systematic changein the velocity of the blue peak over time yields a lower limit on the combinedmass of the two bodies in a binary black hole model like that of gaskell (1983)of 10^10 solar masses.

astro-ph;9704049	hst observations of ip pegasi in quiescence: the pre-eclipse spectrum	we present time-resolved hst uv spectroscopy and ground-based opticalphotometry of the dwarf nova ip peg in a quiescent state. the observations wereobtained prior to an eclipse, when the bright spot caused by the impact of theaccretion stream with the edge of the disk dominates the light output. theoptical light curve is strongly correlated with the uv spectrophotometric fluxcurve. an emission-like feature near 1820 a in the uv spectrum is likely to bea manifestation of the ``fe ii curtain.'' composite spectra constructed fromthe peaks and troughs of flickers in the light curve show substantialdifferences. the spectrum of the flickers is not adequately modelled by asimple blackbody, suggesting that a more sophisticated model is appropriate. weperform a cross-correlation analysis of the variability in spectrophotometricflux curves of the uv continuum and prominent uv emission lines (c ii 1335, siiv 1400, c iv 1550). the continuum and lines are not correlated, suggestingthat they are produced separately. the c ii and si iv lines are moderatelycorrelated with each other, but neither line is correlated with c iv,suggesting that the latter forms in a different region than the former. webriefly discuss a qualitative model for the geometry of the emission regions inip peg that is consistent with the observed behavior of the uv lines andcontinuum.

astro-ph;9802052	optical and x-ray spectroscopy of 1e 0449.4-1823: demise of the original  type 2 qso	new optical spectra of the original narrow-line quasar 1e 0449.4-1823 showthat it now has broad emission lines of considerable strength, eliminating itas a "type 2 qso" candidate. we suggest that the behavior of 1e 0449.4-1823 isthe same as that of some seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies, in which goodrichattributed long-term variations of their broad balmer lines to dynamicalmotions of obscuring material located in or around the broad-line region. theoptical continuum and broad emission-line regions of 1e 0449.4-1823 may stillbe partly covered in our line of sight, which would explain its largeforbidden-line equivalent widths and flat alpha_ox relative to otherlow-redshift qsos. also present are apparent absorption features in the broadbalmer lines and in mg ii, which may be related to the past obscuration andcurrent emergence of the broad-line region. however, it is difficult todistinguish absorption from broad emission-line peaks that are displaced invelocity; we consider the latter a plausible competing interpretation of thesepeculiar line profiles. an asca x-ray spectrum of 1e 0449.4-1823 can be fittedwith a power-law of gamma = 1.63, intrinsic n_h &lt; 9 x 10^20 cm-2, and no fekalpha line emission. its 2-10 kev luminosity is 6.7 x 10^44 ergs/s. withregard to the still hypothetical type 2 qsos, we argue that there is littleevidence for the existence of any among x-ray selected samples.

0809.3262	sdss j092712.65+294344.0: recoiling black hole or a sub-parsec binary  candidate?	a search for recoiling supermassive black hole candidates recently yieldedthe best candidate thus far, sdss j092712.65+294344.0 reported by komossa etal. here we propose the alternative hypothesis that this object is asupermassive black hole binary. from the velocity shift imprinted in theemission-line spectrum we infer an orbital period of ~190 years for a binarymass ratio of 0.1, a secondary black hole mass of 100 million solar masses, andassuming inclination and orbital phase angles of 45 degrees. in this model theorigin of the blueshifted narrow emission lines is naturally explained in thecontext of an accretion flow within the inner rim of the circumbinary disk. weattribute the blueshifted broad emission lines to gas associated with a diskaround the accreting secondary black hole. we show that, within theuncertainties, this binary system can be long lived and thus, is not observedin a special moment in time. the orbital motion of the binary can potentiallybe observed with the vlba if at least the secondary black hole is a radioemitter. in addition, for the parameters quoted above, the orbital motion willresult in a ~100 km/s velocity shift of the emission lines on a time scale ofabout a year, providing a direct observational test for the binary hypothesis.

astro-ph;9804253	the asca x-ray spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy pictor a: a  simple power law with no fe k-alpha line	we present the x-ray spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy pictor a asobserved by asca in 1996. the main objective of the observation was to detectand study the profiles of the fe~k$\alpha$ lines. the motivation was the factthat the balmer lines of this object show well-separated displaced peaks,suggesting an origin in an accretion disk. the 0.5-10 kev x-ray spectrum isdescribed very well by a model consisting of a power law of photon index 1.77modified by interstellar photoelectric absorption. we find evidence for neithera soft nor a hard (compton reflection) excess. more importantly, we do notdetect an fe k-alpha line, in marked contrast with the spectra of typicalseyfert galaxies and other broad-line radio galaxies observed by asca. the99%-confidence upper limit on the equivalent width of an unresolved line at arest energy of 6.4 kev is 100 ev, while for a broad line (fwhm of approximately60,000 km/s) the corresponding upper limit is 135 ev. we discuss severalpossible explanations for the weakness of the fe k-alpha line in pictor~apaying attention to the currently available data on the properties of fek-alpha lines in other broad-line radio galaxies observed by asca. we speculatethat the absence of a hard excess (compton reflection) or an fe k-alpha line isan indication of an accretion disk structure that is different from that oftypical seyfert galaxies, e.g., the inner disk may be an ion torus.

astro-ph;9811372	the post-common envelope and pre-cataclysmic binary pg 1224+309	we have made extensive spectroscopic and photometric observations of pg1224+309, a close binary containing a da white dwarf primary and an m4+secondary. the h alpha line is in emission due to irradiation of the m-star bythe hot white dwarf and is seen to vary around the orbit. from the radialvelocities of the h alpha line we derive a period of p = 0.258689 +/- 0.000004days and a semi-amplitude of k_halpha = 160 +/- 8 km/s. we estimate acorrection delta_k = 21 +/- 2 km/s, where k_m = k_halpha + delta_k. radialvelocity variations of the white dwarf reveal a semi-amplitude of k_wd = 112+/- 14 km/s. the blue spectrum of the white dwarf is well fit by a syntheticspectrum having t_eff = 29,300 k and log(g) = 7.38. the white dwarf contributes97% of the light at 4500 angstroms and virtually all of the light blueward of3800 angstroms. no eclipses are observed. the mass inferred for the white dwarfdepends on the assumed mass of the thin residual hydrogen envelope: 0.40 &lt; m_wd&lt; 0.45 solar masses for hydrogen envelope masses of 0 &lt; m_h &lt; 4.0e-4 solarmasses. we argue that the mass of the white dwarf is closer to 0.45 solarmasses, hence it appears that the white dwarf has a relatively large residualhydrogen envelope. the mass of the m-star is then m_m = 0.28 +/- 0.05 solarmasses, and the inclination is i = 77 +/- 7 degrees. we discuss briefly how pg1224+309 may be used to constrain theories of close binary star evolution, andthe past and future histories of pg 1224+309 itself. the star is both a``post-common envelope'' star and a ``pre-cataclysmic binary'' star. masstransfer by roche-lobe overflow should commence in about 10 gyr.

astro-ph;9902341	intrinsic narrow absorption lines in hires/keck spectra of a sample of  six quasars	in the course of a large intervening mgii survey of 25 quasars, the civemission lines of six (three radio-loud and three radio-quiet) were observedserendipitously. in four of these six quasars, we detected associated narrowabsorption lines. three of these four quasars are radio-quiet while the otheris radio-loud. as a result of the original target selection, the small sampleof six quasars is unbiased towards finding associated civ absorption lines. inthree of these four cases, the absorption line optical-depth ratios deviatefrom the prediction based on atomic physics, suggesting that the backgroundphoton source(s) are only partially covered by the absorbing medium and, byextension, that the absorption lines are intrinsic to the quasar. we have usedthe method of barlow &amp; sargent to determine the effective coverage fraction ofbackground source(s) and we have extended it to constrain the coverage fractionof the continuum and broad-emission line sources separately. we have alsoapplied this refined method to the narrow intrinsic absorption lines in threeadditional quasars for which the necessary data were available from theliterature. we find that in two objects from our sample, the continuum sourcemust be partially covered regardless of the covering factor of theemission-line source. we discuss these results in the context of the propertiesof absorption lines observed in different types of active galaxies and relatedoutflow phenomena. we cannot distinguish between possible mechanisms for theorigin of the partial coverage signature although we do consider possibleobservational tests. finally, we speculate on how the gas responsible for thenarrow lines may be related to the accretion disk wind that may be responsiblefor the broad absorption lines observed in some quasars.

astro-ph;9911503	radio-loud agns: the x-ray perspective	the x-ray emission of radio-loud (rl) agns is a powerful tool for probing thestructure of the accretion flow in these objects. we review recent spectral andvariability studies of rl agns, which show that these systems havesystematically different x-ray properties than their radio-quiet (rq)counterparts. specifically, rl agns have weaker and narrower fe k lines andweaker compton reflection components above 10 kev. the nuclear continuum of rlagns in the 2--10 kev band is well described by a power law with photon indices$\sim$ 1.8, similar to rq agns of comparable x-ray luminosity. rl agns havelittle or no flux variability on short time scales (\ltsima 0.5 days); however,flux and spectral variations are observed on time scales of weeks in twowell-monitored objects, 3c~390.3 and 3c~120. these properties strongly suggestthat the central engines of the two agns classes are different. we discuss theimplications of these observational results, in particular the possibility thatthe central engines of rl agns are harbor an ion torus (also known as anadvection-dominated accretion flow or adaf). we show that a beamed componentfrom the jet is unlikely in the majority of sources.  moreover, the x-ray data provide evidence that the circumnuclear environs ofrl and rq agns also differ: large amounts of cold gas are detected in blrgs andqsrs, contrary to seyfert galaxies of similar x-ray luminosity where an ionizedabsorber seems to be the norm. the role of future x-ray missions in advancingour understanding of the central engines of rl agns is briefly highlighted.
