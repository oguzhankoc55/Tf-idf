0901.3256	north ecliptic pole wide field survey of akari: survey strategy and data  characteristics	we present the survey strategy and the data characteristics of the northecliptic pole (nep) wide survey of akari. the survey was carried out for aboutone year starting from may 2006 with 9 passbands from 2.5 to 24 micron and theareal coverage of about 5.8 sq. degrees centered on nep. the survey depthreaches to 21.8 ab magnitude near infrared (nir) bands, and ~ 18.6 abmaggnitude at the mid infrared (mir) bands such as 15 and 18 micron. the totalnumber of sources detected in this survey is about 104,000, with more sourcesin nir than in the mir. we have cross matched infrared sources with opticallyidentified sources in cfht imaging survey which covered about 2 sq. degreeswithin nep-wide survey region in order to characterize the nature of infraredsources. the majority of the mid infrared sources at 15 and 18 micron band arefound to be star forming disk galaxies, with smaller fraction of early typegalaxies and agns. we found that a large fraction (60~80 %) of bright sourcesin 9 and 11 micron stars while stellar fraction decreases toward faintersources. we present the histograms of the sources at mid infrared bands at 9,11, 15 and 18 micron. the number of sources per magnitude thus varies as m^0.6for longer wavelength sources while shorter wavelength sources show steepervariation with m, where m is the ab magnitude.

0704.1182	an optical source catalog of the north ecliptic pole region	we present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of thesources in the north ecliptic pole (nep) region based on deep observations madewith megacam at cfht. the source catalog covers about 2 square degree areacentered at the nep and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands,about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection overan 1 arcsec aperture). the total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'=23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. fromthe investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagramsand color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources aremostly (u*-r') &lt; 3.0 and (g'-z') &gt; 0.5. this can be used to separate theextended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint sourcedomain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly workefficiently. we have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the redsequence galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey data. by applying thisrelation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities,we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.

0903.2922	the mid-infrared view of red sequence galaxies in abell 2218 with akari	we present the {\it akari} infrared camera (irc) imaging observation ofearly-type galaxies in a2218 at z $\simeq$ 0.175. mid-infrared (mir) emissionfrom early-type galaxies traces circumstellar dust emission from agb starsor/and residual star formation. including the unique imaging capability at 11and 15 $\mu$m, our {\it akari} data provide an effective way to investigate mirproperties of early-type galaxies in the cluster environment. among ourflux-limited sample of 22 red sequence early-type galaxies with precisedynamical and line strength measurements ($&lt;$ 18 mag at 3 $\mu m$), we findthat at least 41% have mir-excess emission. the $n3-s11$ versus $n3$ (3 and 11$\mu$m) color-magnitude relation shows the expected blue sequence, but themir-excess galaxies add a red wing to the relation especially at the fainterend. a sed analysis reveals that the dust emission from agb stars is the mostlikely cause for the mir-excess, with low level of star formation being thenext possible explanation. the mir-excess galaxies show a wide spread of$n3-s11$ colors, implying a significant spread (2--11 gyr) in the estimatedmean ages of stellar populations. we study the environmental dependence ofmir-excess early-type galaxies over an area out to a half virial radius($\sim$1 mpc). we find that the mir-excess early-type galaxies arepreferentially located in the outer region. from these evidences, we suggestthat the fainter, mir-excess early-type galaxies have just joined the redsequence, possibly due to the infall and subsequent morphological/spectraltransformation induced by the cluster environment.

0907.2095	pseudo-newtonian models for the equilibrium structures of rotating  relativistic stars	we obtain equilibrium solutions for rotating compact stars including thespecial relativistic effects. the gravity is assumed to be newtonian, but weused the active mass density, which takes into account all the energies such asmotions of the fluids, internal energy, pressure energy in addition to the restmass energy, in computing the gravitational potential using poisson's equation.such a treatment could be applicable to the neutron stars with relativisticmotions or relativistic equation of state. we applied the hachisu'sself-consistent field (scf) method to find spheroidal as well as toroidalsequences of equilibrium solutions. our solutions show better agreement thannewtonian relativistic hydrodynamic approach that does not take into accountthe active mass, with general relativistic solutions. the physical quantitiessuch as the peak density, equatorial radii of our solutions agree with generalrelativistic ones within 5%.therefore our approach can be a simple alternativeto the fully relativistic one when large number of model calculations arenecessary as it requires much less computational resources.

1003.3077	trajectory of test particle around a slowly rotating relativistic star  emitting isotropic radiation	we explored the motion of test particles near slowly rotating relativisticstar having a uniform luminosity. in order to derive the test particle'sequations of motion, we made use of the radiation stress-energy tensor firstconstructed by miller and lamb \cite{ml96}. from the particle's trajectoryobtained through the numerical integration of the equations of motion, it isfound that for sufficiently high luminosity, "suspension orbit" exists, wherethe test particle hovers around at uniform angular velocity in the samedirection as the star's spin. interestingly, it turned out that the radialposition of the "suspension orbit" was determined by the luminosity and theangular momentum of the star alone and was independent of the initial positionsand the specific angular momentum of the particle. also found is that thereexist not only the radiation drag but also "radiation counter-drag" whichdepends on the stellar radius and the angular momentum and it is this radiationcounter-drag that makes the test particle in the "suspension orbit" to hoveraround at uniform angular velocity which is greater than that induced by thelense-thirring effect (i.e., general relativistic dragging of inertial frame).

1006.0352	a deep radio survey of the akari north ecliptic pole field - wsrt 20 cm  radio survey description, observations and data reduction	the westerbork radio synthesis telescope, wsrt, has been used to make a deepradio survey of an ~ 1.7 sq degree field coinciding with the akari northecliptic pole deep field. the observations, data reduction and source countanalysis are presented, along with a description of the overall scientificobjectives. the survey consisted of 10 pointings, mosaiced with enough overlapto maintain a similar sensitivity across the central region that reached as lowas 21 microjy per beam at 1.4 ghz. a catalogue containing 462 sources detectedwith a resolution of 17"x15" is presented. the differential source countscalculated from the wsrt data have been compared with those from the shallowvla-nep survey of kollgaard et al 1994, and show a pronounced excess forsources fainter than ~ 1 mjy, consistent with the presence of a population ofstar forming galaxies at sub-mjy flux levels. the akari north ecliptic poledeep field is the focus of a major observing campaign conducted across theentire spectral region. the combination of these data sets, along with the deepnature of the radio observations will allow unique studies of a large range oftopics including the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of radiosources, the clustering environment of radio galaxies, the nature of obscuredradio-loud active galactic nuclei, and the radio/far-infrared correlation fordistant galaxies. this catalogue provides the basic data set for a futureseries of paper dealing with source identifications, morphologies, and theassociated properties of the identified radio sources.

1006.2166	environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies	we study the environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) found in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data. the lirg and ulirg samples are constructed bycross-correlating spectroscopic catalogs of galaxies of the sdss data release 7and the infrared astronomical satellite faint source catalog. we examine theeffects of the large-scale background density (sigma_5), galaxy clusters, andthe nearest neighbor galaxy on the properties of infrared galaxies (irgs). wefind that the fraction of lirgs plus ulirgs among irgs (f_(u)lirgs) and theinfrared luminosity (l_ir) of irgs strongly depend on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy: the probability for an irg to be a(u)lirg (f_(u)lirgs) and its l_ir both increase as it approaches a late-typegalaxy, but decrease as it approaches an early-type galaxy (within half thevirial radius of its neighbor). we find no dependence of f_(u)lirgs on thebackground density (surface galaxy number density) at fixed stellar mass ofgalaxies. the dependence of f_(u)lirgs on the distance to galaxy clusters isalso found to be very weak, but in highest-density regions such as the centerof galaxy clusters, few (u)lirgs are found. these environmental dependence oflirgs and ulirgs and the evolution of star formation rate (sfr)-environmentrelation from high redshifts to low redshifts seem to support the idea thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions/merging play a critical role in triggering the starformation activity of lirgs and ulirgs.

1008.0859	luminosity functions of local infrared galaxies with akari: implications  to the cosmic star formation history and agn evolution	infrared (ir) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic starformation history and agn evolution. the akari ir space telescope performed allsky survey in 6 ir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) with 3-10 times bettersensitivity than iras, covering the crucial far-ir wavelengths across the peakof the dust emission. combined with a better spatial resolution, akari can muchmore precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (l_tir) of individualgalaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the localuniverse. by fitting ir sed models, we have re-measured l_tir of the irasrevised bright galaxy sample. we present mid-ir monochromatic luminosity tol_tir conversions for spitzer 8,24um, akari 9,18um, iras 12um, wise 12,22um,and iso 15um filters, with scatter ranging 13-44%. the resulting akari irluminosity function (lf) agrees well with that from the iras. we integrate thelf weighted by l_tir to obtain a cosmic ir luminosity density of omega_tir=(8.5^{+1.5}_{-2.3})x 10^7 l mpc^-3, of which 7+-1% is produced by lirgs, andonly 0.4+-0.1% is from ulirgs in the local universe. once ir contributions fromagn and star-forming galaxies (sfg) are separated, sfg ir lf shows a steepdecline at the bright-end. compared with high-redshift results from the akarinep deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of omega_tirsf propto(1+z)^4.0+-0.5, and omega_tiragn propto (1+z)^4.4+-0.4. for omega_tiragn, theulirg contribution exceeds that from lirg already by z~1. a rapid evolution inboth omega_tiragn and omega_tirsfg suggests the correlation between starformation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. wecompare the evolution of omega_tiragn to that of x-ray luminosity density. theomega_tiragn/omega_x-rayagn ratio shows a possible increase at z&gt;1, suggestingan increase of obscured agn at z&gt;1.

0708.3004	the far-infrared surveyor (fis) for akari	the far-infrared surveyor (fis) is one of two focal plane instruments on theakari satellite. fis has four photometric bands at 65, 90, 140, and 160 um, anduses two kinds of array detectors. the fis arrays and optics are designed tosweep the sky with high spatial resolution and redundancy. the actual scanwidth is more than eight arcmin, and the pixel pitch is matches the diffractionlimit of the telescope. derived point spread functions (psfs) from observationsof asteroids are similar to the optical model. significant excesses, however,are clearly seen around tails of the psfs, whose contributions are about 30% ofthe total power. all fis functions are operating well in orbit, and itsperformance meets the laboratory characterizations, except for the two longerwavelength bands, which are not performing as well as characterized.furthermore, the fis has a spectroscopic capability using a fourier transformspectrometer (fts). because the fts takes advantage of the optics and detectorsof the photometer, it can simultaneously make a spectral map. this papersummarizes the in-flight technical and operational performance of the fis.

0708.3140	optical identification of 15 micron sources in the akari performance  verification field toward the north ecliptic pole	we present the results of optical identifications for 257 mid-infraredsources detected with a deep 15um survey over approximately 80 arcmin^2 area inthe akari performance verification field near the north ecliptic pole. the 15umfluxes of the sources range from 1 mjy down to 40 ujy, approximately a half ofwhich are below 100 ujy. optical counterparts were searched for within a 2-3arcsec radius in both the bvri'z' catalog generated by using the deepsubaru/suprime-cam field which covers one-third of the performance verificationfield, and the g'r'i'z' catalog based on observations made with megacam atcfht. we found b-r and r-z' colours of sources with successful opticalidentifications are systematically redder than that of the entire opticalsample in the same field. moreover, approximately 40% of the 15um sources showcolours r-l15&gt;5, which cannot be explained by the spectral energy distribution(sed) of normal quiescent spiral galaxies, but are consistent with seds ofredshifted (z&gt;1) starburst or ultraluminous infrared galaxies. this resultindicates that the fraction of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in our faint15um sample is much larger than that in our brighter 15um sources, which isconsistent with the evolving mid-infrared luminosity function derived by recentstudies based on the spitzer 24um deep surveys. based on an sed fittingtechnique, the nature of the faint 15um sources is further discussed for aselected number of sources with available k_s-band data.

1011.6408	merging galaxy cluster abell 2255 in mid-infrared	we present the mid-infrared (mir) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster,abell 2255 by the akari space telescope. using the akari's continuouswavelength coverage between 3-24 micron and the wide field of view, weinvestigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall ofthe galaxies, the cluster substructures, and the cluster-cluster mergerinfluence their evolution. we show that the excess of mir (11 micron) flux is agood indicator to discriminate galaxies at different evolutionary stages, anddivide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong mir-excess (n3-s11&gt;0.2)galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies, weakmir-excess (-2.0&lt;n3-s11&lt;-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (&gt;5 gyr)galaxies where the mir emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dustaround agb stars, and intermediate mir-excess (-1.2&lt;n3-s11&lt;0.2) galaxies inbetween the two classes that are less than a few gyrs old past the prime starformation activity. with the mir-excess diagnostics, we investigate how localand cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. we derive thetotal star formation rate of ~130 msun/yr for a2255 using the strong mir-excessgalaxies, which is consistent with other clusters of galaxies at similarredshifts and with similar masses. we find no strong evidence that supportsenhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructureregion. the intermediate mir-excess galaxies, representing galaxies intransition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are locatedpreferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures. ourfindings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxiesinto red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core,which can be well-explained by the ram-pressure stripping as previoussimulation suggests.

1102.3430	infrared luminosity functions of akari-sdss galaxies	by cross-correlating akari infrared (ir) sources with the sdss galaxies, weidentified 2357 infrared galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift. this is notjust one of the largest samples of local ir galaxies, but akari providescrucial fir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) in accurately measuringgalaxy sed across the peak of the dust emission at ~100um. by fitting modern irsed models to the akari photometry, we measured the total infrared luminosity(l_ir) of individual galaxies more accurately. using this l_ir, we constructedluminosity functions of infrared galaxies at a median redshift of z=0.031, with4 times larger sample than previous work. the lf agrees well with that atz=0.0082 (rbgs), showing smooth and continuous evolution toward higher redshiftlfs measured in the akari nep deep field. the derived local cosmic irluminosity density is omega_ir=3.8x10^8 lsunmpc^-3. we separate galaxies intoagn, star-forming, and composite by using the [nii]/ha vs [oiii]/hb lineratios. the fraction of agn shows a continuous increase with increasing l_irfrom 25% to 90% at 9&lt;log l_ir&lt;12.5. the sfr_ha and l_[oiii] show goodcorrelations with l_ir for sfg (star-forming galaxies) and agn, respectively.the self-absorption corrected ha/hb ratio shows a weak increase with l_ir witha substantial scatter. when we separate ir lfs into contributions from agn andsfg, the agn contribution becomes dominant at l_ir&gt;10^11lsun, coinciding thebreak of the both sfg and agn ir lfs. at l_ir&lt;10^11lsun, sfg dominates ir lfs.only 1.1% of omega_ir is produced by lirg, and only 0.03% is by ulirg in thelocal universe. this work also provides the most accurate infrared luminositydensity of the local universe to date. compared with high redshift results fromthe akari nep deep survey, we observed a strong evolution of omega_ir^sfg~(1+z)^4.1+-0.4 and omega_ir^agn ~(1+z)^4.1+-0.5 (abridged).

1102.4416	equilibrium and dynamical evolution of self-gravitating system embedded  in a potential well	isothermal and self-gravitating systems bound by non-conducting andconducting walls are known to be unstable if the density contrast between thecenter and the boundary exceeds critical values. we investigate the equilibriumand dynamical evolution of isothermal and self-gravitating system embedded inpotential well, which can be the situation of many astrophysical objects suchas the central parts of the galaxies, or clusters of galaxies with potentialdominated by dark matter, but is still limited to the case where the potentialwell is fixed during the evolution. as the ratio between the depth ofsurrounding potential well and potential of embedded system becomes large, thepotential well becomes effectively the same boundary condition as conductingwall, which behaves like a thermal heat bath. we also use the direct n-bodysimulation code, nbody6 to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar systemembedded in potential wells and propose the equilibrium models for this system.in deep potential well, which is analogous to the heat bath with hightemperature, the embedded self-gravitating system is dynamically hot, andloosely bound or can be unbound since the kinetic energy increases due to theheating by the potential well. on the other hand, the system undergoes corecollapse by self-gravity when potential well is shallow. binary heating canstop the collapse and leads to the expansion, but the evolution is very slowbecause the potential as a heat bath can absorb the energy generated by thebinaries. the system can be regarded as quasi-static. density and velocitydispersion profiles from the n-body simulations in the final quasi-equilibriumstate are similar to our equilibrium models assumed to be in thermalequilibrium with the potential well.

1111.6693	akari observation of the north ecliptic pole (nep) supercluster at z =  0.087: mid-infrared view of transition galaxies	we present the mid-infrared (mir) properties of galaxies within asupercluster in the north ecliptic pole region at z?0.087 observed with theakari satellite. we use data from the akari nep-wide (5.4 deg2) ir survey andthe clusters of galaxies evolution studies (clevl) mission program. we showthat near-ir (3 {\mu}m)-mid- ir (11 {\mu}m) color can be used as an indicatorof the specific star formation rate and the presence of intermediate agestellar populations. from the mir observations, we find that red-sequencegalaxies consist not only of passively evolving red early-type galaxies, butalso of 1) "weak-sfg" (disk-dominated star-forming galaxies which have starformation rates lower by \sim 4 \times than blue-cloud galaxies), and 2)"intermediate- mxg" (bulge-dominated galaxies showing stronger mir dustemission than normal red early-type galaxies). those two populations can be aset of transition galaxies from blue, star-forming, late-type galaxies evolvinginto red, quiescent, early-type ones. we find that the weak-sfg are predominantat intermediate masses (1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1010.5m\odot) and are typicallyfound in local densities similar to the outskirts of galaxy clusters. as muchas 40% of the supercluster member galaxies in this mass range can be classifiedas weak-sfgs, but their proportion decreases to &lt; 10% at larger masses (m\star&gt; 1010.5 m\odot) at any galaxy density. the fraction of the intermediate-mxgamong red- sequence galaxies at 1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1011m\odot also decreasesas the density and mass increase. in particular, \sim42% of the red-sequencegalaxies with early-type morphologies are classified as intermediate-mxg atintermediate densities. these results suggest that the star formation activityis strongly dependent on the stellar mass, but that the morphologicaltransformation is mainly controlled by the environment.

1204.3945	axially symmetric pseudo-newtonian hydrodynamics code	we develop a numerical hydrodynamics code using a pseudo-newtonianformulation that uses the weak field approximation for the geometry, and ageneralized source term for the poisson equation that takes into accountrelativistic effects. the code was designed to treat moderately relativisticsystems such as rapidly rotating neutron stars. the hydrodynamic equations aresolved using a finite volume method with high resolution shock capturing (hrsc)techniques. we implement several different slope limiters for second orderreconstruction schemes and also investigate higher order reconstructions. weuse the method of lines (mol) to convert the mixed spatial-time partialdifferential equations into ordinary differential equations (odes) that dependonly on time. these odes are solved using 2nd and 3rd order runge-kuttamethods. the poisson equation for the gravitational potential is solved with amultigrid method. in order to confirm the validity of our code, we carry outfour different tests including one and two dimensional shock tube tests,stationary star tests of both non-rotating and rotating models and radialoscillation mode tests for spherical stars. in the shock tube tests, the codeshows good agreement with analytic solutions which include shocks, rarefactionwaves and contact discontinuities. the code is found to be stable and accurate:for example, when solving a stationary stellar model the fractional changes inthe maximum density, total mass, and total angular momentum per dynamical timeare found to be $3 \times 10^{-6}$, $5 \times 10^{-7}$ and $2 \times 10^{-6}$,respectively. we also find that the frequencies of the radial modes obtained bythe numerical simulation of the steady state star agree very well with thoseobtained by linear analysis.

1211.6527	comparative study between n-body and fokker-planck simulations for  rotating star clusters - ii. 2-component models	to understand the effects of the initial rotation on the evolution of thetidally limited clusters with mass spectrum, we have performed n-bodysimulations of the clusters with different initial rotations and compared theresults with those of the fokker-planck (fp) simulations. we confirmed that thecluster evolution is accelerated by not only the initial rotation but also themass spectrum. for the slowly rotating models, the time evolutions of mass,energy and angular momentum show good agreements between n-body and fpsimulations. on the other hand, for the rapidly rotating models, there aresignificant differences between these two approaches at the early stage of theevolutions because of the development of bar instability in n-body simulations.the shape of the cluster for n-body simulations becomes tri-axial or evenprolate, which cannot be produced by the 2-dimensional fp simulations. thetotal angular momentum and the total mass of the cluster decrease rapidly whilebar-like structure persists. after the rotational energy becomes smaller thanthe critical value for the bar instability, the shape of the cluster becomesnearly axisymmetric again, and follows the evolutionary track predicted by thefp equation. we have confirmed again that the energy equipartiton is notcompletely achieved when m2/m1(m2&gt;/m1)^(3/2) &gt; 0.16. by examining the angularmomentum at each mass component, we found that the exchange of angular momentumbetween different mass components occurs, similar to the energy exchangeleading to the equipartition.

1308.1641	compact binaries ejected from globular clusters as gw sources	performing n-body simulations, we examine the dynamics of bh-bh (10 msuneach) and ns-ns (1.4 msun each) binaries formed in a cluster and itsimplications for gravitational wave detection. a significant fraction ofcompact binaries are ejected from a globular cluster after core collapse. amongthe total number of ejected compact objects, 30 per cent of them are inbinaries. merging time-scales of ejected binaries, which depend on thecluster's velocity dispersion, are in some cases shorter than the age of theuniverse. during the merging event, these dynamically formed compact mergersare expected to produce gravitational waves that can be detectable by theadvanced ground-based interferometers. based on our reference assumptions,merger rates of ejected bh-bh and ns-ns binaries per globular cluster areestimated to be 2.5 and 0.27 per gyr, respectively. assuming the spatialdensity of globular clusters to be 8.4 h^3 clusters mpc^-3 and extrapolatingthe merger rate estimates to the horizon distance of the advanced ligo-virgonetwork, we expect the detection rates for bh-bh and ns-ns binaries withcluster origin are to be 15 and 0.024 yr^-1, respectively. we find out thatsome of the dynamically formed binaries are ejected with a large escapevelocity. they can be responsible for short gamma-ray bursts whose locationsare far from host galaxies.

1308.5704	detection of h-alpha emission from z&gt;3.5 submillimetre luminous galaxies  with akari-fuhyu spectroscopy	we present tentative h-alpha emission line detections of foursubmillimetre-detected galaxies at z&gt;3.5: the radio galaxies 8c1909+722 and4c60.07 at signal-to-noise ratios (snrs) of 3.1 and 2.5, and twosubmillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs) near the first of these at snrs of 10.0and 2.4, made with the akari space telescope as part of the fuhyu missionprogram. these are the highest-redshift h-alpha detections in such galaxies,made possible by akari's unique near-infrared spectroscopic capability. the tworadio galaxies had known redshifts and surrounding structure, and we havedetected broad h-alpha components indicating the presence of dust-shroudedquasars. we conclude that powerful agns at z&gt;3.5 occur in peaks of thestar-formation density fields, supporting a close connection between stellarmass build-up and black hole mass assembly at this redshift. we also show that4c60.07 is a binary agn. the h-alpha detections of the two smgs are the firstredshift determinations for these sources, confirming their physicalassociation around their companion radio galaxy. the h-alpha-derived starformation rates (sfrs) for the smgs are lower than their far-infrared derivedsfrs by a factor of ~10, suggesting a level of dust obscuration similar to thatfound in studies at ~1&lt;z&lt;2.7.

1309.7353	a tale of two feedbacks: star-formation in the host galaxies of  radio-agn	several lines of argument support the existence of a link between activity atthe nuclei of galaxies, in the form of an accreting supermassive black hole,and star-formation activity in these galaxies. the exact nature of this link isstill under debate. radio jets have long been argued to be an ideal mechanismthat allows agn to interact with their host galaxy and regulate star-formation.in this context, we are using a sample of radio sources in the north eclipticpole (nep) field to study the nature of the putative link between agn activityand star-formation. this is done by means of spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting. we use the excellent spectral coverage of the akari infrared spacetelescope together with the rich ancillary data available in the nep to buildseds extending from uv to far-ir wavelengths. through sed fitting we constrainboth the agn and host galaxy components. we find a significant agn component inour sample of relatively faint radio-sources ($&lt;$mjy), that increases in powerwith increasing radio-luminosity. at the highest radio-luminosities, thepresence of powerful jets dominates the radio emission of these sources. apositive correlation is found between the luminosity of the agn component andthat of star-formation in the host galaxy, independent of the radio luminosity.by contrast, for a given redshift and agn luminosity, we find that increasingradio-luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star-formation rate. themost radio-loud agn are found to lie on the main sequence of star-formation fortheir respective redshifts. for the first time, such a two-sided feedbackprocess is seen in the same sample. we conclude that radio jets do suppressstar-formation in their host galaxies but appear not to totally quench it. ourresults therefore support the maintenance nature of "radio-mode" feedback fromradio-agn jets.

0803.1893	physical properties of tidal features in interacting disk galaxies	we explore tidal interactions of a galactic disk with toomre parameter q ~ 2embedded in rigid halo/bulge with a point mass companion moving in a prescribedparabolic orbit. tidal interactions produce well-defined spiral arms andextended tidal features such as bridge and tail that are all transient, butdistinct in nature. in the extended disks, strong tidal force is able to lockthe perturbed epicycle phases of the near-side particles to the perturber,shaping them into a tidal bridge that corotates with the perturber. a tidaltail develops at the opposite side as strongly-perturbed, near-side particlesovertake mildly-perturbed, far-side particles. the tail is essentially a narrowmaterial arm with a roughly logarithmic shape, dissolving with time because oflarge velocity dispersions. inside the disks where tidal force is relativelyweak, on the other hand, a two-armed logarithmic spiral pattern emerges due tothe kinematic alignment of perturbed particle orbits. while self-gravity makesthe spiral arms a bit stronger, the arms never become fully self-gravitating,wind up progressively with time, and decay after the peak almost exponentiallyin a time scale of ~ 1 gyr. the arm pattern speed varying with both radius andtime converges to omega-kappa/2 at late time, suggesting that the pattern speedof tidally-driven arms may depend on radius in real galaxies. we present theparametric dependences of various properties of tidal features on the tidalstrength, and discuss our findings in application to tidal spiral arms ingrand-design spiral galaxies.

0705.1862	detection of cfirb with akari/fis deep observations	the cosmic far-infrared background (cfirb) contains information about thenumber and distribution of contributing sources and thus gives us an importantkey to understand the evolution of galaxies. using a confusion study to set afundamental limit to the observations, we investigate the potential to explorethe cfirb with akari/fis deep observations. the far-infrared surveyor (fis) isone of the focal-plane instruments on the akari (formerly known as astro-f)satellite, which was launched in early 2006. based upon source distributionmodels assuming three different cosmological evolutionary scenarios (noevolution, weak evolution, and strong evolution), an extensive model fordiffuse emission from infrared cirrus, and instrumental noise estimates, wepresent a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusion levelsfor deep far-infrared observations. we use our derived sensitivities to suggestthe best observational strategy for the akari/fis mission to detect the cfirbfluctuations. if the source distribution follows the evolutionary models,observations will be mostly limited by source confusion. we find that we willbe able to detect the cfirb fluctuations and that these will in turn provideinformation to discriminate between the evolutionary scenarios of galaxies inmost low-to-medium cirrus regions.

1501.02717	black hole binaries in galactic nuclei and gravitational wave sources	stellar black hole (bh) binaries are one of the most promising gravitationalwave (gw) sources for gw detection by the ground-based detectors. nuclear starclusters (ncs) located at the centre of galaxies are known to harbour massiveblack holes (mbhs) and to be bounded by a gravitational potential by othergalactic components such as the galactic bulge. such an environment of ncsprovides a favourable conditions for the bh-bh binary formation by thegravitational radiation capture due to the high bh number density and velocitydispersion. we carried out detailed numerical study of the formation of bhbinaries in the ncs using a series of n-body simulations for equal-mass cases.there is no mass segregation introduced. we have derived scaling relations ofthe binary formation rate with the velocity dispersion of the stellar systembeyond the radius of influence and made estimates of the rate of formation ofblack hole binaries per unit comoving volume and thus expected detection rateby integrating the binary formation rate over galaxy population within thedetection distance of the advanced detectors. we find that the overallformation rates for bh-bh binaries per nc is 10^(-10)/yr for the milky-way-likegalaxies and weakly dependent on the mass of mbh as m^(3/28). we estimate thedetection rate of 0.02-14/yr for advanced ligo/virgo considering severalfactors such as the dynamical evolution of ncs, the variance of the numberdensity of stars and the mass range of mbh giving uncertainties.

(2004). using 11 agns with reliable detection of brackettlines, we derive the brackett-line-based bh mass estimators. we also find thatthe observed brackett line ratios can be explained with the commonly adoptedphysical conditions of the broad line region (blr). moreover, we fit the hotand warm dust components of the dust torus by adding photometric data of sdss,2mass, $\it{wise}$, and $\it{iso}$ to the $\it{akari}$ spectra, finding hot andwarm dust temperatures of $\sim1100\,\rm{k}$ and $\sim220\,\rm{k}$,respectively, rather than the commonly cited hot dust temperature of 1500 k.

1505.04857	physical properties of tidal features of interacting disk galaxies:  three-dimensional self-consistent models	using self-consistent three-dimensional (3d) n-body simulations, weinvestigate the physical properties of non-axisymmetric features in a diskgalaxy created by a tidal interaction with its companion. the primary galaxyconsists of a stellar disk, a bugle, and a live halo, corresponding tomilky-way type galaxies, while the companion is represented by a halo alone. wevary the companion mass and the pericenter distance to explore situations withdiffering tidal strength parameterized by either the relative tidal force p orthe relative imparted momentum s. we find that the formation of a tidal tail inthe outer parts requires p &gt; 0.05 or s &gt; 0.07. a stronger interaction resultsin a stronger, less wound tail that forms earlier. similarly, a stronger tidalforcing produces stronger, more loosely wound spiral arms in the inner parts.the arms are approximately logarithmic in shape, with both amplitude and pitchangle decaying with time. the derived pattern speed decreases with radius andis close to the omega-kappa/2 curve at late time, with omega and kappa denotingthe angular and epicycle frequencies, respectively. this suggests that thetidally-induced spiral arms are most likely kinematic density waves weaklymodified by self-gravity. compared to the razor-thin counterparts, arms in the3d models are weaker, have a smaller pitch angle, and wind and decay morerapidly. the 3d density structure of the arms is well described by theconcentrated and sinusoidal models when the arms are in the nonlinear andlinear regimes, respectively. we demonstrate that dynamical friction betweeninteracting galaxies transfers the orbital angular momentum of one galaxy tothe spin angular momentum of the companion halo.

astro-ph;0008441	n-body simulations of compact young clusters near the galactic center	we investigate the dynamical evolution of compact young star clusters (cycs)near the galactic center (gc) using aarseth's nbody6 codes. the relativelysmall number of stars in the cluster (5,000-20,000) makes real-number n-bodysimulations for these clusters feasible on current workstations. usingfokker-planck (f-p) models, kim, morris, &amp; lee (1999) have made a survey ofcluster lifetimes for various initial conditions, and have found that clusterswith a mass &lt;~ 2x10^4 msun evaporate in ~10 myr. these results were, however,to be confirmed by n-body simulations because some extreme cluster conditions,such as strong tidal forces and a large stellar mass range participating in thedynamical evolution, might violate assumptions made in f-p models. here we findthat, in most cases, the cyc lifetimes of previous f-p calculations are 5-30%shorter than those from the present n-body simulations. the comparison ofprojected number density profiles and stellar mass functions between n-bodysimulations and hst/nicmos observations by figer et al. (1999) suggests thatthe current tidal radius of the arches cluster is ~1.0 pc, and the followingparameters for the initial conditions of that cluster: total mass of 2x10^4msun and mass function slope for intermediate-to-massive stars of 1.75 (thesalpeter function has 2.35). we also find that the lower stellar mass limit,the presence of primordial binaries, the amount of initial mass segregation,and the choice of initial density profile (king or plummer models) do notsignificantly affect the dynamical evolution of cycs.

astro-ph;0402478	dynamical evolution of rotating stellar systems: iii. the effect of mass  spectrum	we have studied the dynamical evolution of rotating star clusters with massspectrum using a fokker-planck code. as a simplest multi-mass model, we firstinvestigated the two-component clusters. rotation is found to accelerate thedynamical evolution through the transfer of angular momentum outward, as wellas from the high masses to the low masses. however, the degree of accelerationdepends sensitively on the assumed initial mass function since dynamicalfriction, which generates mass segregation, also tends to accelerate theevolution, and the combined effect of both is not linear or multiplicative. aslong as dynamical friction dominates in the competition with angular momentumexchange the heavy masses lose random energy and angular momentum, sink towardsthe centre, but their remaining angular momentum is sufficient to speed them uprotationally. this is gravo-gyro instability. as a consequence, we find thatthe high mass stars in the central parts rotate faster than low mass stars.this leads to the suppression of mass segregation compared to the non-rotatingclusters. from the study of multi-component models, we observe similar trendsto the two-component models in almost all aspects. the mass function changesless drastically for clusters with rotation. unlike non-rotating clusters, themass function depends on $r$ and $z$. our models are the only ones that canpredict mass function and other quantities to be compared with newobservations.

astro-ph;0409037	mass segregation and tidal tails of the globular cluster ngc 7492	we present a wide field ccd photometric study of galactic globular clusterngc 7492. the derived vr color-magnitude diagram extends down to about 3.5 magbelow the cluster main sequence turn-off. the field covers 42' x 42' about 3times larger than the known tidal radius of this cluster. the sample of clustermember candidates obtained by cmd-mask process has been used to constructluminosity and mass functions and surface density map. ngc 7492 has a very flatmass function with very little variation in the slope with the distance fromthe cluster center. however, there is a clear evidence for the increase of theslope of the mass function from inner to outer regions, indicating a masssegregation of the cluster. the surface density map of ngc 7492 showsextensions toward the galactic anticenter (northeast) and northwest from thecluster center. a comparison of luminosity function for stars in the tails withthat for stars within the tidal radius suggests that the extensions shown inthe surface density map could be a real feature. the overall shape of ngc 7492is significantly flattened. if the flattened shape of the ngc 7492 is caused byits rotation, galactic tidal field must have given important influences, sincethe initial rotation would have been almost completely removed by dynamicalrelaxation.

astro-ph;0411431	far-ir detection limits i: sky confusion due to galactic cirrus	fluctuations in the brightness of the background radiation can lead toconfusion with real point sources. such background emission confusion will beimportant for infrared observations with relatively large beam sizes since theamount of fluctuation tends to increase with angular scale. in order toquantitively assess the effect of the background emission on the detection ofpoint sources for current and future far-infrared observations by space-bornemissions such as spitzer, astro-f, herschel and spica, we have extended thegalactic emission map to higher angular resolution than the currently availabledata. using this high resolution map, we estimate the sky confusion noise dueto the emission from interstellar dust clouds or cirrus, based on fluctuationanalysis and detailed photometry over realistically simulated images. we findthat the confusion noise derived by simple fluctuation analysis agrees wellwith the result from realistic simulations. although the sky confusion noisebecomes dominant in long wavelength bands (&gt; 100 um) with 60 - 90cm aperturemissions, it is expected to be two order of magnitude smaller for the nextgeneration space missions with larger aperture sizes such as herschel andspica.

astro-ph;0503216	effects of external tidal field on the evolution of multi-mass star  clusters	we present n-body simulations of realistic globular clusters containinginitial mass function in the galaxy to study effects of tidal fieldsystematically on the properties of outer parts of globular clusters. usingnbody6 which takes into account the two-body relaxation correctly, weinvestigate general evolution of globular clusters in galactic tidal field. forsimplicity, we have employed only spherical components (bulge and halo) of thegalaxy. total number of stars in our simulations was about 20,000. allsimulations were done for several orbital periods in order to understand thedevelopment of the tidal tails. in our scaled down models, the relaxation timeis sufficiently short to show the mass segregation effect, but we did not gofar enough to see the core-collapse, and the fraction of stars lost from thecluster at the end of simulation is only about 10%. the radial distribution ofextra-tidal stars can be described by a power law with a slope around -3. thedirection of tidal tails are determined by the orbits and locations of theclusters. we find that the length of tidal tails increases towards theapogalacticon and decreases towards the perigalacticon. this is ananti-correlation with the strength of the tidal field, caused by the fact thatthe the time-scale for the stars to respond to the potential is similar to theorbital time-scale of the cluster. when the length of tidal tails decreasessome of the stars in the tidal tails are recaptured by the host cluster. fromthe investigation of velocity anisotropy of the model clusters, we find that inthe early stages of globular cluster evolution the clusters have radialanisotropy in the outermost parts, while clusters are nearly isotropic in thecental region. the radial anisotropy decreases with time.

astro-ph;9409073	evolution of galactic nuclei with 10 $m_\odot$ black holes	a star with main sequence mass greater than $25\sim 30\msun$ may collapse toa black hole of about 10 $\msun$ at the final stage of the evolution. about anorder of 1\% of stellar mass is likely to be in form of such black holes ingalaxies. we have examined the dynamics of two-component stellar systemscomposed of 0.7 $\msun$ main-sequence stars, representing the old population ofstars whose main-sequence lifetimes are longer than the hubble time, and asmall fraction of 10 $\msun$ black holes. the dynamical friction leads to thesegregation of black holes to the core and the core collapse takes place amongthe black holes in a time scale much shorter than that required for a singlecomponent cluster. the ultimate evolution of the two-component stellar systemdepends on the role of three-body binaries formed among the black holes. for asystem with $v\gta 100\kms$ binaries merge by gravitational radiation at somehardness instead of being ejected. the critical hardness, at which thecollision time and the merger time become comparable, determines the efficiencyof the binary as a heat source. the efficiency is found to be inverselyproportional to the velocity dispersion. for the clusters without seriousreduction in heating efficiency (i.e., velocity dispersion well below 500$\kms$), heating by three-body binaries have the effect of stopping thecore-collapse. the cluster

astro-ph;9410096	influence of the stellar mass function on the evaporation rate of  tidally limited postcollapse globular clusters	we study the rate of escape of stars (``evaporation'') from tidally-limitedpostcollapse globular clusters having a power-law distribution of stellarmasses. we use a multi-mass fokker-planck code and assume a steady tidal field.stellar-dynamical processes cause the inner parts of the cluster to expand,which in turn causes stars to overflow the tidal boundary. mass loss by stellarevolution is assumed to be unimportant in these later evolutionary stages. thefraction of the cluster mass lost per half-mass relaxation time ($\trh$) isroughly constant, in agreement with simple homologous models with equal-massstars. if $\trh$ is computed in the conventional way from the mean stellarmass, however, a broad stellar mass function can double the loss of mass per$\trh$. we discuss implications of our results for the evolution ofglobular-cluster systems in our own and other galaxies. in particular, thenumber of galactic clusters destroyed by evaporation alone may be as large orlarger than the present cluster population.

astro-ph;9512101	supersonic collisions between two gas streams	a star around a massive black hole can be disrupted tidally by the gravity ofthe black hole. then, its debris may form a precessing stream which may evencollide with itself. in order to understand the dynamical effects of thestream-stream collision on the eventual accretion of the stellar debris ontothe black hole, we have studied how gas flow behaves when the outgoing streamcollides supersonically with the incoming stream. we have investigated theproblem analytically with one-dimensional plane-parallel streams andnumerically with more realistic three-dimensional streams. a shock formedaround the contact surface converts the bulk of the orbital streaming kineticenergy into thermal energy. in three-dimensional simulations, the accumulatedhot post-shock gas then expands adiabatically and drives another shock into thelow density ambient region. through this expansion, thermal energy is convertedback to the kinetic energy associated with the expanding motion. thus, in theend, only a small fraction of the orbital kinetic energy is actually convertedto the thermal energy, while most of it is transferred to the kinetic energy ofthe expanding gas. nevertheless the collision is effective in circularizing thedebris orbit, because the shock efficiently transforms the ordered motion ofthe streams into the expanding motion in directions perpendicular to thestreams. the circularization efficiency decreases, if two colliding streamshave a large ratio of cross sections and a large density contrast. but even insuch cases, the main shock extends beyond the overlapping contact surface andthe high pressure region behind the shock keeps the stream of the larger crosssection from passing freely. thus the stream-stream collisions are stillexpected to circularize the stellar debris rather efficiently, unless the ratio

astro-ph;9603137	close encounters between a neutron star and a main-sequence star	we have examined consequences of strong tidal encounters between a neutronstar and a normal star using sph as a possible formation mechanism of isolatedrecycled pulsars in globular clusters. we have made a number of sph simulationsfor close encounters between a main-sequence star of mass ranging from 0.2 to0.7 solar masses represented by an n=3/2 polytrope and a neutron starrepresented by a point mass. the outcomes of the first encounters are found tobe dependent only on the dimensionless parameter eta' = (m/(m+m))^(1/2)(r_min/r_ms)^(3/2) (m/m)^(1/6), where m and m are the masses of themain-sequence star and the neutron star, respectively, r_min the minimumseparation between two stars, and r_ms the size of the main-sequence star. thematerial from the (at least partially) disrupted star forms a disk around theneutron star. if all material in the disk is to be acctreted onto the neutronstar's surface, the mass of the disk is enough to spin up the neutron star tospin period of 1 ms.

0809.2795	mapping dusty star formation in and around a cluster at z=0.81 by  wide-field imaging with akari	we present environmental dependence of dusty star forming activity in andaround the cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 based on wide-field andmulti-wavelength observations with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope and irconboard the akari satellite. our optical data shows that the optical colourdistribution of galaxies starts to dramatically change from blue to red at themedium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments. bycombining with infrared data, we find that 15 micron galaxies tend to haveoptical colours between the red sequence and the blue cloud with a tail intothe red sequence.  the spatial distribution of the 15 micron galaxies over ~200 arcmin^2 aroundthe cluster reveals that few 15 micron galaxies are detected in the clustercentral region. this is probably due to the low star forming activity in thecluster core. however, interestingly, the fraction of 15 micron galaxies in themedium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, despite thefact that the optical colours start to change in the medium-densityenvironments. furthermore, we find that 15 micron galaxies which have opticallyred colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specificstar formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment.these results imply that the star forming activity in galaxies in groups andfilaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to themedium-density environment, and such a phenomenon is probably directlyconnected to the truncation of star forming activity in galaxies seen as thedramatic change in optical colours in such environments.

astro-ph;9711108	two-component fokker-planck models for the evolution of isolated  globular clusters	two-component (normal and degenerate stars) models are the simplestrealization of clusters with a mass spectrum because high mass stars evolvequickly into degenerates, while low mass stars remain on the main-sequence forthe age of the universe. here we examine the evolution of isolated globularclusters using two-component fokker-planck (fp) models that include heating bybinaries formed in tidal capture and in three-body encounters. three-bodybinary heating dominates and the postcollapse expansion is self-similar, atleast in models with total mass m &lt;= 3 x 10^5 m_\odot, initial half-mass radiusr_{h,i} &gt;= 5 pc, component mass ratio m_2/m_1 &lt;= 2, and number ratio n_1/n_2 &lt;=300 when m_2=1.4 m_\odot. we derive scaling laws for \rho_c, v_c, r_c, and r_has functions of m_1/m_2, n, m, and time t from simple energy-balance arguments,and these agree well with the fp simulations. we have studied the conditionsunder which gravothermal oscillations (gtos) occur. if e_{tot} and e_c are theenergies of the cluster and of the core, respectively, and t_{rh} and t_c aretheir relaxation times, then \epsilon \equiv (e_{tot}/t_{rh})/(e_c/t_{rc}) is agood predictor of gtos: all models with \epsilon&gt;0.01 are stable, and all butone with \epsilon &lt; 0.01 oscillate. we derive a scaling law for \epsilonagainst n and m_1/m_2 and compared with our numerical results. clusters withlarger m_2/m_1 or smaller n are stabler.

astro-ph;9806245	effects of tidal shocks on the evolution of globular clusters	we present new fokker-planck models of the evolution of globular clusters,including gravitational tidal shocks. we extend our calculations beyond thecore collapse by adopting three-body binary heating. effects of the shocks areincluded by adding the tidal shock diffusion coefficients to the ordinaryfokker-planck equation: the first order heating term, &lt;de&gt;, and the secondorder energy dispersion term, &lt;de^2&gt;. as an example, we investigate theevolution of models for the globular cluster ngc 6254. using the hipparcosproper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in thegalaxy. tidal shocks accelerate significantly both core collapse and theevaporation of the cluster and shorten the destruction time from 24 gyr to 18gyr. we examine various types of adiabatic corrections and find that they arecritical for accurate calculation of the evolution. without adiabaticcorrections, the destruction time of the cluster is twice as short.  we examine cluster evolution for a wide range of the concentration and tidalshock parameters, and determine the region of the parameter space where tidalshocks dominate the evolution. we present fitting formulae for the corecollapse time and the destruction time, covering all reasonable initialconditions. in the limit of strong shocks, the typical value of the corecollapse time decreases from 10 t_{rh} to 3 t_{rh} or less, while thedestruction time is just twice that number. the effects of tidal shocks arerapidly self-limiting: as clusters lose mass and become more compact, theimportance of the shocks diminishes. this implies that tidal shocks were moreimportant in the past.

astro-ph;9902132	the stream-stream collision after the tidal disruption of a star around  a massive black hole	a star can be tidally disrupted around a massive black hole. it has beenknown that the debris forms a precessing stream, which may collide with itself.the stream collision is a key process determining the subsequent evolution ofthe stellar debris: if the orbital energy is efficiently dissipated, the debriswill eventually form a circular disk (or torus). in this paper, we havenumerically studied such stream collision resulting from the encounter betweena 10^6 msun black hole and a 1 msun normal star with a pericenter radius of 100rsun. a simple treatment for radiative cooling has been adopted for bothoptically thick and thin regions. we have found that approximately 10 to 15% ofthe initial kinetic energy of the streams is converted into thermal energyduring the collision. the angular momentum of the incoming stream is increasedby a factor of 2 to 3, and such increase, together with the decrease in kineticenergy, significantly helps the circularization process. initial luminosityburst due to the collision may reach as high as 10^41 erg/sec in 10^4 sec,after which the luminosity increases again (but slowly this time) to a steadyvalue of a few 10^40 erg/sec in a few times of 10^5 sec. the radiation from thesystem is expected to be close to planckian with effective temperature of\~10^5k.

astro-ph;9905325	evaporation of compact young clusters near the galactic center	we investigate the dynamical evolution of compact young clusters (cycs) nearthe galactic center (gc) using fokker-planck models. cycs are very young (&lt; 5myr), compact (&lt; 1 pc), and only a few tens of pc away from the gc, while theyappear to be as massive as the smallest galactic globular clusters (~10^4msun). a survey of cluster lifetimes for various initial mass functions,cluster masses, and galactocentric radii is presented. short relaxation timesdue to the compactness of cycs, and the strong tidal fields near the gc makeclusters evaporate fairly quickly. depending on cluster parameters, masssegregation may occur on a time scale shorter than the lifetimes of mostmassive stars, which accelerates the cluster's dynamical evolution even more.when the difference between the upper and lower mass boundaries of the initialmass function is large enough, strongly selective ejection of lighter starsmakes massive stars dominate even in the outer regions of the cluster, so thedynamical evolution of those clusters is weakly dependent on the lower massboundary. the mass bins for fokker-planck simulations were carefully chosen toproperly account for a relatively small number of the most massive stars. wefind that clusters with a mass &lt;~ 2x10^4 msun evaporate in &lt;~ 10 myr. a simplecalculation based on the total masses in observed cycs and the lifetimesobtained here indicates that the massive cycs comprise only a fraction of thestar formation rate (sfr) in the inner bulge estimated from lyman continuumphotons and far-ir observations.
