0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0903.2262	journey to the m_bh -sigma relation: the fate of low mass black holes in  the universe	in this paper, we explore the establishment and evolution of the empiricalcorrelation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion with redshift. wetrack the growth and accretion history of massive black holes starting fromhigh redshift using two seeding models:(i) population iii remnants, and (ii)massive seeds from direct gas collapse. although the seeds do not initiallysatisfy the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ relation, the correlation is established andmaintained at all times if self-regulating accretion episodes are associatedwith major mergers. the massive end of the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ relation isestablished early, and lower mass mbhs migrate over time. how mbhs migratetoward the relation, the slope and the scatter of the relation all dependcritically on the seeding model as well as the adopted self-regulationprescription. we expect flux limited agn surveys and lisa to select accretingand merging mbhs respectively that have already migrated onto the $\msigma$relation. this is a consequence of major mergers being more common at highredshift for the most massive, biased, galaxies that anchor the $\msigma$relation early. we also predict the existence of a large population of low mass`hidden' mbhs at high redshift which can easily escape detection. additionally,we find that if mbh seeds are massive, $\sim 10^5 m_{\odot}$, the low-mass endof the $\msigma$ flattens towards this asymptotic value, creating acharacteristic `plume'.

0907.5450	exploring intermediate and massive black-hole binaries with the einstein  telescope	we discuss the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector such asthe einstein telescope (et) to enhance our astrophysical knowledge throughdetections of gravitational waves emitted by binaries includingintermediate-mass and massive black holes. the design target for suchinstruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies, specifically inthe ~ 1-10 hz range. this will allow the detection of gravitational wavesgenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~100-1000 solar masses. we primarily discuss two different source types --mergers between two intermediate mass black holes (imbhs) of comparable mass,and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (imris) of smaller compact objects withmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into imbhs. imbhs may form via two channels: (i) indark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse ofvery massive metal-poor population iii stars, or (ii) via runaway stellarcollisions in globular clusters. in this paper, we will discuss both formationchannels, and both classes of merger in each case. we review existing rateestimates where these exist in the literature, and provide some newcalculations for the approximate numbers of events that will be seen by adetector like the einstein telescope. these results indicate that the et maysee a few to a few thousand comparable-mass imbh mergers and as many as severalhundred imri events per year. these observations will significantly enhance ourunderstanding of galactic black-hole growth, of the existence and properties ofimbhs and of the astrophysics of globular clusters. we finish our review with adiscussion of some more speculative sources of gravitational waves for the et,including hypermassive white dwarfs and eccentric stellar-mass compact-objectbinaries.

1001.1743	gravitational recoil: effects on massive black hole occupation fraction  over cosmic time	we assess the influence of massive black hole (mbh) ejections from galaxycentres, due to the gravitational radiation recoil, along the cosmic mergerhistory of the mbh population. we discuss the 'danger' of the recoil for mbhsas a function of different mbh spin/orbit configurations and of the host halocosmic bias, and on how that reflects on the 'occupation fraction' of mbhs. weassess ejection probabilities for mergers occurring in a gas-poor environment,where the mbh binary coalescence is driven by stellar dynamical processes, andthe spin/orbit configuration is expected to be isotropically distributed. wecontrast this case with the 'aligned' case. the latter is the most realisticsituation for 'wet', gas-rich mergers, which are the expectation forhigh-redshift galaxies. we find that if all halos at z&gt;5-7 host a mbh, theprobability of the milky way (or similar size galaxy) to host a mbh today isless than 50%, unless mbhs form continuously in galaxies. the 'occupationfraction' of mbhs, intimately related to halo bias and mbh formationefficiency, plays a crucial role in increasing the retention fraction. smallhalos, with shallow potential wells and low escape velocities, have a highejection probability, but the mbh merger rate is very low along their galaxyformation merger hierarchy: mbh formation processes are likely inefficient insuch shallow potential wells. recoils can decrease the overall frequency ofmbhs in small galaxies to ~60%, while they have little effect on the frequencyof mbhs in large galaxies (at most a 20% effect).

1003.5220	quasistars and the cosmic evolution of massive black holes	we explore the cosmic evolution of massive black hole (mbh) seeds formingwithin 'quasistars' (qss), accreting black holes embedded within massivehydrostatic gaseous envelopes. these structures could form if the infall of gasinto the center of a halo exceeds about 1 solar mass per year. we use amerger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which qss might form as a functionof redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting qs and seed blackhole populations. we relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergersof gas-rich galaxies, and to a threshold for global gravitational instability,which we link to the angular momentum of the host. this is the main parameterof our models. once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halopotential; the properties of the resulting qs and seed black hole depend onthis rate. after the epoch of qss, we model the growth of mbhs within theirhosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. we compare mbh seeds grown insidequasistars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the firstmetal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of mbhformation operate simultaneously. we find that a limited range of qs/mbhformation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observationalconstraints. our models match the density of z = 6 quasars, the cumulative massdensity accreted onto mbhs (according to soltan's argument), and the currentmass density of mbhs. the mass function of qss peaks at mass ~ 1e6 solarmasses, and we calculate the number counts for the jwst in the 2-10 micronband. we find that jwst could detect up to several qss per field at z ~ 5 - 10.

1004.1921	lisa extreme-mass-ratio inspiral events as probes of the black hole mass  function	one of the sources of gravitational waves for the proposed space-basedgravitational wave detector, the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa), arethe inspirals of compact objects into supermassive black holes in the centresof galaxies - extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (emris). using lisa observations, wewill be able to measure the parameters of each emri system detected to veryhigh precision. however, the statistics of the set of emri events observed bylisa will be more important in constraining astrophysical models than extremelyprecise measurements for individual systems. the black holes to which lisa ismost sensitive are in a mass range that is difficult to probe using othertechniques, so lisa provides an almost unique window onto these objects. inthis paper we explore, using bayesian techniques, the constraints that lisaemri observations can place on the mass function of black holes at lowredshift. we describe a general framework for approaching inference of thistype --- using multiple observations in combination to constrain aparameterised source population. assuming that the scaling of emri rate withblack hole mass is known and taking a black hole distribution given by a simplepower law, dn/d(ln m) = a (m/m_*)^b, we find that lisa could measure theparameters to a precision of d(ln a) ~ 0.08, and d(b) ~ 0.03 for a referencemodel that predicts ~1000 events. even with as few as 10 events, lisa shouldconstrain the slope to a precision ~0.3, which is the current level ofobservational uncertainty in the low-mass slope of the black hole massfunction. we also consider a model in which a and b evolve with redshift, butfind that emri observations alone do not have much power to probe such anevolution.

1009.6172	constraining properties of the black hole population using lisa	lisa should detect gravitational waves from tens to hundreds of systemscontaining black holes with mass in the range from 10 thousand to 10 millionsolar masses. black holes in this mass range are not well constrained bycurrent electromagnetic observations, so lisa could significantly enhance ourunderstanding of the astrophysics of such systems. in this paper, we describe aframework for combining lisa observations to make statements about massiveblack hole populations. we summarise the constraints that lisa observations ofextreme-mass-ratio inspirals might be able to place on the mass function ofblack holes in the lisa range. we also describe how lisa observations can beused to choose between different models for the hierarchical growth ofstructure in the early universe. we consider four models that differ in theirprescription for the initial mass distribution of black hole seeds, and in theefficiency of accretion onto the black holes. we show that with as little as 3months of lisa data we can clearly distinguish between these models, even underrelatively pessimistic assumptions about the performance of the detector andour knowledge of the gravitational waveforms.

1011.5893	reconstructing the massive black hole cosmic history through  gravitational waves	the massive black holes we observe in galaxies today are the naturalend-product of a complex evolutionary path, in which black holes seeded inproto-galaxies at high redshift grow through cosmic history via a sequence ofmergers and accretion episodes. electromagnetic observations probe a smallsubset of the population of massive black holes (namely, those that are activeor those that are very close to us), but planned space-based gravitational-waveobservatories such as the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) can measurethe parameters of ``electromagnetically invisible'' massive black holes out tohigh redshift. in this paper we introduce a bayesian framework to analyze theinformation that can be gathered from a set of such measurements. our goal isto connect a set of massive black hole binary merger observations to theunderlying model of massive black hole formation. in other words, given a setof observed massive black hole coalescences, we assess what information can beextracted about the underlying massive black hole population model. forconcreteness we consider ten specific models of massive black hole formation,chosen to probe four important (and largely unconstrained) aspects of the inputphysics used in structure formation simulations: seed formation, metallicity``feedback'', accretion efficiency and accretion geometry. for the first timewe allow for the possibility of ``model mixing'', by drawing the observedpopulation from some combination of the ``pure'' models that have beensimulated. a bayesian analysis allows us to recover a posterior probabilitydistribution for the ``mixing parameters'' that characterize the fractions ofeach model represented in the observed distribution. our work shows that lisahas enormous potential to probe the underlying physics of structure formation.

0709.1722	evolution of massive black holes	supermassive black holes are nowadays believed to reside in most localgalaxies. accretion of gas and black hole mergers play a fundamental role indetermining the two parameters defining a black hole: mass and spin. i brieflyreview here some of the physical processes that are conducive to the evolutionof the massive black hole population. i'll discuss black hole formationprocesses that are likely to place at early cosmic epochs, and how massiveblack hole evolve in a hierarchical universe. the mass of the black holes thatwe detect today in nearby galaxy has mostly been accumulated by accretion ofgas. while black hole--black hole mergers do not contribute substantially tothe final mass of massive black holes, they influence the occupancy of galaxycenters by black hole, owing to the chance of merging black holes being kickedfrom their dwellings due to the gravitational recoil. similarly, accretionleaves a deeper imprint on the distribution of black hole spins than black holemergers do. the differences in accretion histories for black holes hosted inelliptical or disc galaxies may reflect on different spin distributions.

1103.1644	how important is the dark matter halo for black hole growth?	in this paper, we examine if the properties of central black holes ingalactic nuclei correlate with their host dark matter halo. we analyze theentire sample of galaxies where black hole mass, velocity dispersion, sigma,and asymptotic circular velocity, vc, have all been measured. we fit m-sigmaand m-vc to a power law, and find that in both relationships the scatter andslope are similar. this model-independent analysis suggests that although theblack hole masses are not uniquely determined by dark matter halo mass, whenconsidered for the current sample as a whole, the m-vc correlation may be asstrong (or as weak) as m-sigma. although the data are sparse, there appears tobe more scatter in the correlation for both sigma and vc at the low--mass end.this is not unexpected given our current understanding of galaxy and black holeassembly. in fact, there are several compelling reasons that account for this:(i) smbh formation is likely less efficient in low-mass galaxies with largeangular momentum content; (ii) smbh growth is less efficient in low-mass diskgalaxies that have not experienced major mergers; (iii) dynamical effects, suchas gravitational recoil, increase scatter preferentially at the low-mass end.therefore, the recent observational claim of the absence of central smbhs inbulgeless, low mass galaxies, or deviations from the correlations defined byhigh-mass black holes in large galaxies today is, in fact, predicated bycurrent models of black hole growth. we show how this arises as a directconsequence of the coupling between dark matter halos and central black holesat the earliest epochs.

1103.5565	blazars in the early universe	we investigate the relative occurrence of radio--loud and radio-quiet quasarsin the first billion years of the universe, powered by black holes heavier thanone billion solar masses. we consider the sample of high-redshfit blazarsdetected in the hard x-ray band in the 3-years all sky survey performed by theburst alert telescope (bat) onboard the swift satellite. all the black holespowering these blazars exceed a billion solar mass, with accretion luminositiesclose to the eddington limit. for each blazar pointing at us, there must behundreds of similar sources (having black holes of similar masses) pointingelsewhere. this puts constraints on the density of billion solar masses blackholes at high redshift (z&gt;4), and on the relative importance of (jetted)radio-loud vs radio-quiet sources. we compare the expected number of highredshift radio--loud sources with the high luminosity radio-loud quasarsdetected in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), finding agreement up to z~3,but a serious deficit at z&gt;3 of sdss radio-loud quasars with respect to theexpectations. we suggest that the most likely explanations for thisdisagreement are: i) the ratio of blazar to misaligned radio-sources decreasesby an order of magnitude above z=3, possibly as a result of a decrease of theaverage bulk lorentz factor; ii) the sdss misses a large fraction of radio-loudsources at high redshifts, iii) the sdss misses both radio-loud and radio-quietquasars at high redshift, possibly because of obscuration or because ofcollimation of the optical-uv continuum in systems accreting near eddington.these explanations imply very different number density of heavy black holes athigh redshifts, that we discuss in the framework of the current ideas about therelations of dark matter haloes at high redshifts and the black hole they host.

1104.3858	the first massive black hole seeds and their hosts	we investigate the formation of the first massive black holes in highredshift galaxies, with the goal of providing insights to which galaxies do ordo not host massive black holes. we adopt a novel approach to forming seedblack holes in galaxy halos in cosmological sph+n-body simulations. theformation of massive black hole seeds is dictated directly by the local gasdensity, temperature, and metallicity, and motivated by physical models ofmassive black hole formation. we explore seed black hole populations as afunction of halo mass and redshift, and examine how varying the efficiency ofmassive black hole seed formation affects the relationship between black holesand their hosts. seed black holes tend to form in halos with mass between 10^7and 10^9 msun, and the formation rate is suppressed around z = 5 due to thediffusion of metals throughout the intergalactic medium. we find that the timeof massive black hole formation and the occupation fraction of black holes area function of the host halo mass. by z = 5, halos with mass m_halo &gt; 3 x 10^9msun host massive black holes regardless of the efficiency of seed formation,while the occupation fraction for smaller halos increases with black holeformation efficiency. our simulations explain why massive black holes are foundin some bulgeless and dwarf galaxies, but we also predict that their occurrencebecomes rarer and rarer in low-mass systems.

1105.3653	blindly detecting merging supermassive black holes with radio surveys	supermassive black holes presumably grow through numerous mergers throughoutcosmic time. during each merger, supermassive black hole binaries aresurrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk that imposes a significant (~1e4 gfor a binary of 1e8 msun) magnetic field. the motion of the binary through thatfield will convert the field energy to poynting flux, with a luminosity ~1e43erg/s (b/1e4 g)^2 (m/1e8 msun)^2, some of which may emerge as synchrotronemission at frequencies near 1 ghz where current and planned wide-field radiosurveys will operate. we find that the short timescales of many mergers willlimit their detectability with most planned blind surveys to &lt;1 per year overthe whole sky, independent of the details of the emission process and fluxdistribution. including an optimistic estimate for the radio flux makesdetection even less likely, with &lt;1 mergers per year over the whole sky.however, wide-field radio instruments may be able to localize systemsidentified in advance of merger by gravitational waves. further, radio surveysmay be able to detect the weaker emission produced by the binary's motion as itis modulated by spin-orbit precession and inspiral well in advance of merger.

1106.3079	black hole growth in the early universe is self-regulated and largely  hidden from view	the formation of the first massive objects in the infant universe remainsimpossible to observe directly and yet it sets the stage for the subsequentevolution of galaxies. while some black holes with masses &gt; billion solarmasses? have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion yearsafter the big bang, these individual extreme objects have limited utility inconstraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes. the initialconditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growthprocess. from deep, optimally stacked, archival x-ray observations, we measurethe amount of black hole growth in z=6-8 galaxies (0.7-1 billion years afterthe big bang). our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with theirhosts throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. we find thatmost copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significantamounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highestenergy x-rays. this suggests that black holes grow significantly more thanpreviously thought during these early bursts, and due to obscuration they donot contribute to the re-ionization of the universe with their ultravioletemission.

1107.1946	assessing the redshift evolution of massive black holes and their hosts	motivated by recent observational results that focus on high redshift blackholes, we explore the effect of scatter and observational biases on the abilityto recover the intrinsic properties of the black hole population at highredshift. we find that scatter and selection biases can hide the intrinsiccorrelations between black holes and their hosts, with 'observable' subsamplesof the whole population suggesting, on average, positive evolution even whenthe underlying population is characterized by no- or negative evolution. wecreate theoretical mass functions of black holes convolving the mass functionof dark matter halos with standard relationships linking black holes with theirhosts. under these assumptions, we find that the local mbh - sigma correlationis unable to fit the z = 6 black hole mass function proposed by willott et al.(2010), overestimating the number density of all but the most massive blackholes. positive evolution or including scatter in the mbh - sigma correlationmakes the discrepancy worse, as it further increases the number density ofobservable black holes. we notice that if the mbh - sigma correlation at z = 6is steeper than today, then the mass function becomes shallower. this helpsreproducing the mass function of z = 6 black holes proposed by willott et al.(2010). alternatively, it is possible that very few halos (of order 1/1000)host an active massive black hole at z = 6, or that most agn are obscured,hindering their detection in optical surveys. current measurements of the highredshift black hole mass function might be underestimating the density of lowmass black holes if the active fraction or luminosity are a function of host orblack hole mass. finally, we discuss physical scenarios that can possibly leadto a steeper mbh - sigma relation at high redshift.

1107.4916	the mass function of black holes at 1&lt;z&lt;4.5: comparison of models with  observations	in this paper, we compare the observationally derived black hole massfunction (bhmf) of luminous broad-line quasars (blqsos) at 1&lt;z&lt;4.5 drawn fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) presented in kelly et al. (2010), withmodels of merger driven bh growth in the context of standard hierarchicalstructure formation models. in the models, we explore two distinct black holeseeding prescriptions at the highest redshifts: "light seeds" - remnants ofpopulation iii stars and "massive seeds" that form from the direct collapse ofpre-galactic disks. the subsequent merger triggered mass build-up of the blackhole population is tracked over cosmic time under the assumption of a fixedaccretion rate as well as rates drawn from the distribution derived by merloni&amp; heinz. our model snapshots are compared to the sdss derived bhmfs of blqsos.our key findings are that the duty cycle of smbhs powering blqsos increaseswith increasing redshift for all models and models with pop iii remnants asblack hole seeds are unable to fit the observationally derived bhmfs forblqsos, lending strong support for the massive seeding model (abridged).

1111.0223	observability of dual active galactic nuclei in merging galaxies	supermassive black holes (smbhs) have been detected in the centers of mostnearby massive galaxies. galaxies today are the products of billions of yearsof galaxy mergers, but also billions of years of smbh activity as activegalactic nuclei (agns) that is connected to galaxy mergers. in this context,detection of agn pairs should be relatively common. observationally, however,dual agn are scant, being just a few percent of all agn. in this letter weinvestigate the triggering of agn activity in merging galaxies via a suite ofhigh resolution hydrodynamical simulations. we follow the dynamics andaccretion onto the smbhs as they move from separations of tens of kiloparsecsto tens of parsecs. our resolution, cooling and star formation implementationproduce an inhomogeneous, multi-phase interstellar medium, allowing us toaccurately trace star formation and accretion onto the smbhs. we study theimpact of gas content, morphology, and mass ratio, allowing us to study agnactivity and dynamics across a wide range of relevant conditions. we test whenthe two agn are simultaneously detectable, for how long and at whichseparations. we find that strong dual agn activity occurs during the latephases of the mergers, at small separations (&lt;1-10 kpc) below the resolutionlimit of most surveys. much of the smbh accretion is not simultaneous, limitingthe dual agn fraction detectable through imaging and spectroscopy to a fewpercent, in agreement with observational samples.

1201.1923	gravitational recoil from accretion-aligned black-hole binaries	we explore the newly discovered "hangup-kick" effect, which greatly amplifiesthe recoil for configuration with partial spin- orbital-angular momentumalignment, by studying a set of 48 new simulations of equal-mass, spinningblack-hole binaries. we propose a phenomenological model for the recoil thattakes this new effect into account and then use this model, in conjunction withstatistical distributions for the spin magnitude and orientations, based onaccretion simulations, to find the probabilities for observing recoils ofseveral thousand km/s. in addition, we provide initial parameters,eccentricities, radiated linear and angular momentum, precession rates andremnant mass, spin, and recoils for all 48 configurations. our results indicatethat surveys exploring peculiar (redshifted or blueshifted) differentialline-of-sight velocities should observe at least one case above 2000 km/s outof four thousand merged galaxies. the probability that a remnant bh receives atotal recoil exceeding the ~2000 km/s escape velocity of large ellipticalgalaxies is ten times larger. probabilities of recoils exceeding the escapevelocity quickly rise to 5% for galaxies with escape velocities of 1000 km/sand nearly 20% for galaxies with escape velocities of 500 km/s. in addition thedirection of these large recoils is strongly peaked toward the angular momentumaxis, with very low probabilities of recoils exceeding 350 km/s for angleslarger than 45 deg. with respect to the orbital angular momentum axis.

0710.5770	compact massive objects in virgo galaxies: the black hole population	we investigate the distribution of massive black holes (mbhs) in the virgocluster. observations suggest that agn activity is widespread in massivegalaxies (m&gt;1e10 solar masses), while at lower galaxy masses star clusters aremore abundant, which might imply a limited presence of central black holes inthese galaxy-mass regimes. we explore if this possible threshold in mbhhosting, is linked to nature, nurture, or a mixture of both. the naturescenario arises naturally in hierarchical cosmologies, as mbh formationmechanisms typically are efficient in biased systems, which would later evolveinto massive galaxies. nurture, in the guise of mbh ejections following mbhmergers, provides an additional mechanism that is more effective for low mass,satellite galaxies. the combination of inefficient formation, and lowerretention of mbhs, leads to the natural explanation of the distribution ofcompact massive ob jects in virgo galaxies. if mbhs arrive to the correlationwith the host mass and velocity dispersion during merger-triggered accretionepisodes, sustained tidal stripping of the host galaxies creates a populationof mbhs which lie above the expected scaling between the holes and their hostmass, suggesting a possible environmental dependence.

1203.1877	effects of circum-nuclear disk gas evolution and the spin of central  black holes	mass and spin are the only two parameters needed to completely characterizeblack holes in general relativity. however, the interaction between black holesand their environment is where complexity lies, as the relevant physicalprocesses occur over a large range of scales. that is particularly relevant inthe case of super-massive black holes (smbhs), hosted in galaxy centers, andsurrounded by swirling gas and various generations of stars. these compete withthe smbh for gas consumption and affect both dynamics and thermodynamics of thegas itself. how the behavior of such fiery environment influence the angularmomentum of the gas accreted onto smbhs, and, hence, black-hole spins isuncertain. we explore the interaction between smbhs and their environment viafirst 3d sub-parsec resolution simulations (ranging from 0.1 pc to 1 kpcscales) that study the evolution of the smbh spin by including the effects ofstar formation, stellar feedback, radiative transfer, and metal pollutionaccording to the proper stellar yields and lifetimes. this approach is crucialto investigate the impact of star formation processes and feedback effects onthe angular momentum of the material that could accrete on the central hole. wefind that star formation and feedback mechanisms can locally inject significantamounts of entropy in the surrounding medium, and impact on the inflowinclination angles and eddington fractions. as a consequence, the resultingtrends show upper-intermediate equilibrium values for the spin parameter, a, ofabout 0.6 - 0.9, corresponding to radiative efficiencies \epsilon = 9% - 15%.these results suggest that star formation feedback taking place in thecircum-nuclear disk during the in-fall cannot induce alone very strong chaotictrends in the gas flow, quite independently from the different numericalparameters.

1209.2243	black holes in the early universe	the existence of massive black holes was postulated in the sixties, when thefirst quasars were discovered. in the late nineties their reality was provenbeyond doubt, in the milky way and a handful nearby galaxies. since then,enormous theoretical and observational efforts have been made to understand theastrophysics of massive black holes. we have discovered that some of the mostmassive black holes known, weighing billions of solar masses, powered luminousquasars within the first billion years of the universe. the first massive blackholes must therefore have formed around the time the first stars and galaxiesformed. dynamical evidence also indicates that black holes with masses ofmillions to billions of solar masses ordinarily dwell in the centers of today'sgalaxies. massive black holes populate galaxy centers today, and shone asquasars in the past; the quiescent black holes that we detect now in nearbybulges are the dormant remnants of this fiery past. in this review we report onbasic, but critical, questions regarding the cosmological significance ofmassive black holes. what physical mechanisms lead to the formation of thefirst massive black holes? how massive were the initial massive black holeseeds? when and where did they form? how is the growth of black holes linked tothat of their host galaxy? answers to most of these questions are work inprogress, in the spirit of these reports on progress in physics.

1210.1025	the evolution of active galactic nuclei and their spins	massive black holes (mbhs) in contrast to stellar mass black holes areexpected to substantially change their properties over their lifetime. mbhmasses increase by several order of magnitude over the hubble time, asillustrated by soltan's argument. mbh spins also must evolve through the seriesof accretion and mergers events that grow the mbh's masses. we present a simplemodel that traces the joint evolution of mbh masses and spins across cosmictime. our model includes mbh-mbh mergers, merger-driven gas accretion,stochastic fueling of mbhs through molecular cloud capture, and a basicimplementation of accretion of recycled gas. this approach aims at improvingthe modeling of low-redshift mbhs and agn, whose properties can be more easilyestimated observationally. despite the simplicity of the model, it captureswell the global evolution of the mbh population from z\sim6 to today. under ourassumptions, we find that the typical spin and radiative efficiency of mbhsdecrease with cosmic time because of the higher incidence of stochasticprocesses in gas-rich galaxies and mbh-mbh mergers in gas-poor galaxies. at z=0the spin distribution in gas-poor galaxies peaks at spins 0.4-0.8, and it isnot strongly mass dependent. mbhs in gas-rich galaxies have a more complexevolution, with low-mass mbhs at low redshift having low spins, and spinsincreasing at larger masses and redshifts. we also find that at z&gt;1 mbh spinsare on average highest in high luminosity agn, while at lower redshifts thesedifferences disappear.

1211.6840	massive black holes in central cluster galaxies	we explore how the co-evolution of massive black holes (mbhs) and galaxies isaffected by environmental effects, addressing in particular mbhs hosted in thecentral galaxies of clusters (we will refer to these galaxies in general as'cgs'). recently the sample of mbhs in cgs with dynamically measured masses hasincreased, and it has been suggested that these mbh masses (m_bh) deviate fromthe expected correlations with velocity dispersion (sigma) and mass of thebulge (m_bulge) of the host galaxy: mbhs in cgs appear to be `over-massive'.this discrepancy is more pronounced when considering the m_bh-sigma relationthan the m_bh-m_bulge one. we show that this behavior stems from a combinationof two natural factors, (i) that cgs experience more mergers involvingspheroidal galaxies and their mbhs, and (ii) that such mergers arepreferentially gas-poor. we use a combination of analytical and semi-analyticalmodels to investigate the mbh-galaxy co-evolution in different environments andfind that the combination of these two factors explains the trends observed incurrent data-sets.

1304.4583	black hole evolution: iii. statistical properties of mass growth and  spin evolution using large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulations	supermassive black holes (bh) at the centres of galaxies can rapidly changetheir mass and spin by gas accretion and mergers. using hydrodynamicalcosmological simulations, with prescriptions for bh growth and feedback fromactive galactic nuclei, we study how the evolution of bh mass growth is drivenby gas accretion and mergers. using a semi-analytical approach to evolve spins,we also highlight the mechanisms responsible for driving the magnitude and thedirection of spins as a function of cosmic time. we find that in thehigh-redshift universe galaxies maintain large values of gas accretion ontobhs, which therefore is the main driver of their mass and spin evolution.sustained accretion of cold gas at high-redshift tends to align bh spins withthe angular momentum of the surrounding gas and maximise their magnitude.conversely, at low redshift, as bhs get more massive and galaxies moregas-poor, the contribution from binary coalescences to the total bh mass growthincreases, especially at the high-mass end, and tends to decrease the magnitudeof spins and change their direction.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1306.2325	the hot and energetic universe: the formation and growth of the earliest  supermassive black holes	a crucial challenge in astrophysics over the coming decades will be tounderstand the origins of supermassive black holes (smbhs) that lie at thecentres of most, if not all, galaxies. the processes responsible for theinitial formation of these smbhs and their early growth via accretion - whenthey are seen as active galactic nuclei (agn) - remain unknown. to address thischallenge, we must identify low luminosity and obscured z&gt;6 agns, whichrepresent the bulk of early smbh growth. sensitive x-ray observations are aunique signpost of accretion activity, uncontaminated by star formationprocesses, which prevent reliable agn identification at other wavelengths (e.g.optical, infrared). the athena+ wide field imager will enable x-ray surveys tobe carried out two orders of magnitude faster than with chandra or xmm-newton,opening a new discovery space and identifying over 400 z&gt;6 agn, includingobscured sources. athena+ will also play a fundamental role to enhance thescientific return of future multiwavelength facilities that will probe thephysical conditions within the host galaxies of early smbhs, which is vital forunderstanding how smbhs form, what fuels their subsequent growth, and to assesstheir impact on the early universe. follow-up of samples of z&gt;6 galaxies withthe athena+ x-ray integral field unit could also reveal the presence of highlyobscured agns, thanks to the detection of strong iron lines. thus, athena+ willenable the first quantitative measurements of the extent and distribution ofsmbh accretion in the early universe.

1307.0856	the relative role of galaxy mergers and cosmic flows in feeding black  holes	using a set of zoomed-in cosmological simulations of high-redshiftprogenitors of massive galaxies, we isolate and trace the history of gas thatis accreted by central supermassive black holes. we determine the origins ofthe accreted gas, in terms of whether it entered the galaxy during a mergerevent or was smoothly accreted. furthermore, we designate whether the smoothlyaccreted gas is accreted via a cold flow or is shocked upon entry into thehalo. for moderate-mass (10^6 - 10^7 msun) black holes at z ~ 4, there is apreference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin.however, this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has ahigher fraction of gas from cold flows. in general, each black hole tends toaccrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger-accreted gas as is containedin its host galaxy, suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomeswell-mixed, and its origins are erased. we find that the angular momentum ofthe gas upon halo entry is a more important factor; black holes preferentiallyaccrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy,regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers.

1310.7581	nuclear coups: dynamics of black holes in galaxy mergers	we study the dynamical evolution of supermassive black holes (bhs) in merginggalaxies on scales of hundreds of kpc to 10 pc, to identify the physicalprocesses that aid or hinder the orbital decay of bhs. we presenthydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers with a resolution of $\leq$20 pc,chosen to accurately track the motion of the nuclei and provide a realisticenvironment for the evolution of the bhs. we find that, during the late stagesof the merger, tidal shocks inject energy in the nuclei, causing one or bothnuclei to be disrupted and leaving their bh `naked', without any bound gas orstars. in many cases, the nucleus that is ultimately disrupted is that of thelarger galaxy (`nuclear coup'), as star formation grows a denser nuclear cuspin the smaller galaxy. we supplement our simulations with an analyticalestimate of the orbital-decay time required for the bhs to form a binary atunresolved scales, due to dynamical friction. we find that, when a nuclear coupoccurs, the time-scale is much shorter than when the secondary's nucleus isdisrupted, as the infalling bh is more massive, and it also finds itself in adenser stellar environment.

0802.0025	cosmological black hole spin evolution by mergers and accretion	using recent results from numerical relativity simulations of black holemergers, we revisit previous studies of cosmological black hole spin evolution.we show that mergers are very unlikely to yield large spins, unless alignmentof the spins of the merging holes with the orbital angular momentum is veryefficient. we analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spinevolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolongedaccretion episodes, (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic)accretion episodes. we study how different diagnostics can distinguish betweenthese evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power ofgravitational-wave measurements and x-ray spectroscopy. gravitational radiationcan produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding respectivelythe spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spinof the merger remnant (as encoded in the ringdown waves), and the spin of``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (emri) of compactobjects. the latter spin population is also accessible to iron-linemeasurements. we compute and compare the spin distributions relevant for thesedifferent observations. if iron-line measurements and gravitational-waveobservations of emris only yield dimensionless spins j=j/m^2&gt;0.9, thenprolonged accretion should be responsible for spin-up, and chaotic accretionscenarios would be very unlikely. if only a fraction of the whole population oflow-redshift black holes spins rapidly, spin-alignment during binary mergers(rather than prolonged accretion) could be responsible for spin-ups.

1401.1220	black hole evolution: ii. spinning black holes in a supernova-driven  turbulent interstellar medium	supermassive black holes (bh) accrete gas from their surroundings andcoalesce with companions during galaxy mergers, and both processes change thebh mass and spin. by means of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations ofgalaxies, either idealised or embedded within the cosmic web, we explore theeffects of interstellar gas dynamics and external perturbations on bh spinevolution. all these physical quantities were evolved on-the-fly in aself-consistent manner. we use a `maximal' model to describe the turbulenceinduced by stellar feedback to highlight its impact on the angular momentum ofthe gas accreted by the bh. periods of intense star formation are followed byphases where stellar feedback drives large-scale outflows and hot bubbles. wefind that bh accretion is synchronised with star formation, as only when gas iscold and dense do both processes take place. during such periods, gas motion isdominated by consistent rotation. on the other hand, when stellar feedbackbecomes substantial, turbulent motion randomises gas angular momentum. howeverbh accretion is strongly suppressed in that case, as cold and dense gas islacking. in our cosmological simulation, at very early times (z&gt;6), thegalactic disc has not yet settled and no preferred direction exists for theangular momentum of the accreted gas, so the bh spin remains low. as the gassettles into a disc (6&gt;z&gt;3), the bh spin then rapidly reaches its maximalvalue. at lower redshifts (z&lt;3), even when galaxy mergers flip the direction ofthe angular momentum of the accreted gas, causing it to counter-rotate, the bhspin magnitude only decreases modestly and temporarily. should this be atypical evolution scenario for bh, it potentially has dramatic consequencesregarding their origin and assembly, as accretion on maximally spinning bhembedded in thin shakura-sunyaev disc is significantly reduced.

1401.3513	the case for super-critical accretion onto massive black holes at high  redshift	short-lived intermittent phases of super-critical (super-eddington) growth,coupled with star formation via positive feedback, may account for early growthof massive black holes (mbh) and coevolution with their host spheroids. weestimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, bothassuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recentnumerical simulations. the angular momentum of gas joining the accretion diskdetermines the length of the accretion episodes, and the final mass a mbh canreach. the latter can be related to the gas velocity dispersion, and ingalaxies with low-angular momentum gas the mbh can get to a higher mass. whenthe host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msunyr, replenishingand circulation lead to a sequence of short (~1e4-1e7 years), heavily obscuredaccretion episodes that increase the growth rates, with respect to aneddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude. our model predicts thatthe ratio of mbh accretion rate to star formation rate is 1e2 or higher,leading, at early epochs, to a ratio of mbh to stellar mass higher than the"canonical" value of ~1e-3, in agreement with current observations. our modelmakes specific predictions that long-lived super-critical accretion occurs onlyin galaxies with copious low-angular momentum gas, and in this case the mbh ismore massive at fixed velocity dispersion.

1402.1165	dancing in the dark: galactic properties trace spin swings along the  cosmic web	a large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, horizon-agn, is used toinvestigate the alignment between the spin of galaxies and the cosmic filamentsabove redshift 1.2. the analysis of more than 150 000 galaxies per time step inthe redshift range 1.2&lt;z&lt;1.8 with morphological diversity shows that the spinof low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouringfilaments, while high-mass red galaxies tend to have a perpendicular spin. thereorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers,which are significant in their mass build-up. we find that the stellar masstransition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3.10^10 m_sun.galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migratetowards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angularmomentum into spin. the signature of this process can be traced to theproperties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. we argue that astrong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quenchin situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. itallows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and,therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.

1406.2325	constraining the high redshift formation of black hole seeds in nuclear  star clusters with gas inflows	in this paper we explore a possible route of black hole seed formation thatappeal to a model by davies, miller &amp; bellovary who considered the case of thedynamical collapse of a dense cluster of stellar black holes subjected to aninflow of gas. here, we explore this case in a broad cosmological context. theworking hypotheses are that (i) nuclear star clusters form at high redshifts inpre-galactic discs hosted in dark matter halos, providing a suitableenvironment for the formation of stellar black holes in their cores, (ii) majorcentral inflows of gas occur onto these clusters due to instabilities seeded inthe growing discs and/or to mergers with other gas-rich halos, and that (iii)following the inflow, stellar black holes in the core avoid ejection due to thesteepening to the potential well, leading to core collapse and the formation ofa massive seed of $&lt;~ 1000\, \rm m_\odot$. we simulate a cosmological boxtracing the build up of the dark matter halos and there embedded baryons, andexplore cluster evolution with a semi-analytical model. we show that this routeis feasible, peaks at redshifts $z &lt;~ 10$ and occurs in concomitance with theformation of seeds from other channels. the channel is competitive relative toothers, and is independent of the metal content of the parent cluster. thismechanism of gas driven core collapse requires inflows with masses at least tentimes larger than the mass of the parent star cluster, occurring on timescalesshorter than the evaporation/ejection time of the stellar black holes from thecore. in this respect, the results provide upper limit to the frequency of thisprocess.

1409.5797	no wimp mini-spikes in dwarf spheroidal galaxies	the formation of black holes inevitably affects the distribution of dark andbaryonic matter in their vicinity, leading to an enhancement of the dark matterdensity, called spike, and if dark matter is made of wimps, to a strongenhancement of the dark matter annihilation rate. spikes at the center ofgalaxies like the milky way are efficiently disrupted by baryonic processes,but mini-spikes can form and survive undisturbed at the center of dwarfspheroidal galaxies. we show that fermi lat satellite data allow to set verystringent limits on the existence of mini-spikes in dwarf galaxies: for thermalwimps with mass between 100 gev and 1 tev, we obtain a maximum black hole massbetween 100 and 1000 $m_\odot$, ruling out black holes masses extrapolated fromthe m-{\sigma} relationship in a large region of the parameter space. we alsoperformed monte carlo simulations of merger histories of black holes in dwarfspheroidals in a scenario where black holes form from the direct collapse ofprimordial gas in early halos, and found that this specific formation scenariois incompatible at the 84% cl with dark matter being in the form of thermalwimps.

1502.06363	growing black holes and galaxies: black hole accretion versus star  formation rate	we present a new suite of hydrodynamical simulations and use it to study, indetail, black hole and galaxy properties. the high time, spatial and massresolution, and realistic orbits and mass ratios, down to 1:6 and 1:10, enableus to meaningfully compare star formation rate (sfr) and bh accretion rate(bhar) timescales, temporal behaviour and relative magnitude. we find that (i)bhar and galaxy-wide sfr are typically temporally uncorrelated, and havedifferent variability timescales, except during the merger proper, lasting~0.2-0.3 gyr. bhar and nuclear (&lt;100 pc) sfr are better correlated, and theirvariability are similar. averaging over time, the merger phase leads typicallyto an increase by a factor of a few in the bhar/sfr ratio. (ii) bhar andnuclear sfr are intrinsically proportional, but the correlation lessens if thelong-term sfr is measured. (iii) galaxies in the remnant phase are the onesmost likely to be selected as systems dominated by an active galactic nucleus(agn), because of the long time spent in this phase.

1502.07076	black hole accretion versus star formation rate: theory confronts  observations	we use a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers to comparestar formation rate (sfr) and black hole accretion rate (bhar) for galaxiesbefore the interaction ('stochastic' phase), during the `merger' proper,lasting ~0.2-0.3 gyr, and in the `remnant' phase. we calculate the bi-variatedistribution of sfr and bhar and define the regions in the sfr-bhar plane thatthe three phases occupy. no strong correlation between bhar and galaxy-wide sfris found. a possible exception are galaxies with the highest sfr and thehighest bhar. we also bin the data in the same way used in severalobservational studies, by either measuring the mean sfr for agn in differentluminosity bins, or the mean bhar for galaxies in bins of sfr. we find that theapparent contradiction or sfr versus bhar for observed samples of agn and starforming galaxies is actually caused by binning effects. the two types ofsamples use different projections of the full bi-variate distribution, and thefull information would lead to unambiguous interpretation. we also find that agalaxy can be classified as agn-dominated up to 1.5 gyr after the merger-drivenstarburst took place. our study is consistent with the suggestion that mostlow-luminosity agn hosts do not show morphological disturbances.

1504.00018	black hole evolution: i. supernova-regulated black hole growth	the growth of a supermassive black hole (bh) is determined by how much gasthe host galaxy is able to feed it, which in turn is controlled by the cosmicenvironment, through galaxy mergers and accretion of cosmic flows that time howgalaxies obtain their gas, but also by internal processes in the galaxy, suchas star formation and feedback from stars and the bh itself. in this paper, westudy the growth of a 10^12 msun halo at z=2, which is the progenitor of algroup of galaxies at z=0, and of its central bh by means of a high-resolutionzoomed cosmological simulation, the seth simulation. we study the evolution ofthe bh driven by the accretion of cold gas in the galaxy, and explore theefficiency of the feedback from supernovae (sne). for a relatively inefficientenergy input from sne, the bh grows at the eddington rate from early times, andreaches self-regulation once it is massive enough. we find that at early cosmictimes z&gt;3.5, efficient feedback from sne forbids the formation of a settleddisc as well as the accumulation of dense cold gas in the vicinity of the bhand starves the central compact object. as the galaxy and its halo accumulatemass, they become able to confine the nuclear inflows provided by major mergersand the bh grows at a sustained near-to-eddington accretion rate. we argue thatthis mechanism should be ubiquitous amongst low-mass galaxies, corresponding togalaxies with a stellar mass below &lt;10^9 msun in our simulations.

1505.00263	how an improved implementation of h2 self-shielding influences the  formation of massive stars and black holes	high redshift quasars at z&gt;6 have masses up to ~$10^9$ m$_\odot$. one of thepathways to their formation includes direct collapse of gas, forming asupermassive star, precursor of the black hole seed. the conditions for directcollapse are more easily achievable in metal-free haloes, where atomic hydrogencooling operates and molecular hydrogen (h2) formation is inhibited by a strongexternal uv flux. above a certain value of uv flux (j_crit), the gas in a halocollapses isothermally at ~$10^4$ k and provides the conditions forsupermassive star formation. however, h2 can self-shield, reducing the effectof photodissociation. so far, most numerical studies used the local jeanslength to calculate the column densities for self-shielding. we implement animproved method for the determination of column densities in 3d simulations andanalyse its effect on the value of j_crit. this new method captures the gasgeometry and velocity field and enables us to properly determine thedirection-dependent self-shielding factor of h2 against photodissociatingradiation. we find a value of j_crit that is a factor of two smaller than withthe jeans approach (~2000 j_21 vs. ~4000 j_21). the main reason for thisdifference is the strong directional dependence of the h2 column density. withthis lower value of j_crit, the number of haloes exposed to a flux &gt;j_crit islarger by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous studies. thismay translate into a similar enhancement in the predicted number density ofblack hole seeds.

1506.05299	shining in the dark: the spectral evolution of the first black holes	massive black hole (mbh) seeds at redshift $z \gtrsim 10$ are now thought tobe key ingredients to explain the presence of the super-massive ($10^{9-10} \,\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) black holes in place $ &lt; 1 \, \mathrm{gyr}$ after the bigbang. once formed, massive seeds grow and emit copious amounts of radiation byaccreting the left-over halo gas; their spectrum can then provide crucialinformation on their evolution. by combining radiation-hydrodynamic andspectral synthesis codes, we simulate the time-evolving spectrum emerging fromthe host halo of a mbh seed with initial mass $10^5 \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$,assuming both standard eddington-limited accretion, or slim accretion disks,appropriate for super-eddington flows. the emission occurs predominantly in theobserved infrared-submm ($1-1000 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) and x-ray ($0.1 - 100 \,\mathrm{kev}$) bands. such signal should be easily detectable by jwst around$\sim 1 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ up to $z \sim 25$, and by athena (between $0.1$ and$10 \, \mathrm{kev}$, up to $z \sim 15$). ultra-deep x-ray surveys like thechandra deep field south could have already detected these systems up to $z\sim 15$. based on this, we provide an upper limit for the $z \gtrsim 6$ mbhmass density of $\rho_{\bullet} \lesssim 2.5 \times 10^{2} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}\, mpc^{-3}}$ assuming standard eddington-limited accretion. if accretionoccurs in the slim disk mode the limits are much weaker, $\rho_{\bullet}\lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot} \, mpc^{-3}}$ in the mostconstraining case.

1508.02224	a comparison of black hole growth in galaxy mergers with gasoline and  ramses	supermassive black hole dynamics during galaxy mergers is crucial indetermining the rate of black hole mergers and cosmic black hole growth. assimulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whetherthe black hole dynamics is influenced by the treatment of the interstellarmedium in different simulation codes. we here compare simulations of black holegrowth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamicscode gasoline, and the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. we seek toidentify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences inhydrodynamic methods and implementations of sub-grid physics. we find that thegeneral behavior is consistent between codes. black hole accretion is minimalwhile the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they "fly-by" within 10 kpcat first pericenter). at late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,tidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black holeaccretion accompanied by star formation. we also note quantitativediscrepancies that are model-dependent: our ramses simulations show less starformation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with largerclumps and filaments, than our gasoline simulations. we attribute thesedifferences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling andfeedback and gas thermodynamics. the main conclusion is that differences existquantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when makingcomparisons with observations. however, reassuringly, both codes capture thesame dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering of black hole accretion, starformation, and black hole dynamics.

1508.06274	relations between central black hole mass and total galaxy stellar mass  in the local universe	scaling relations between central black hole (bh) mass and host galaxyproperties are of fundamental importance to studies of bh and galaxy evolutionthroughout cosmic time. here we investigate the relationship between bh massand host galaxy total stellar mass using a sample of 262 broad-line activegalactic nuclei (agn) in the nearby universe (z &lt; 0.055), as well as 79galaxies with dynamical bh masses. the vast majority of our agn sample isconstructed using sloan digital sky survey spectroscopy and searching forseyfert-like narrow-line ratios and broad h-alpha emission. bh masses areestimated using standard virial techniques. we also include a small number ofdwarf galaxies with total stellar masses m_stellar &lt; 10^9.5 msun and asub-sample of the reverberation-mapped agns. total stellar masses of all 341galaxies are calculated in the most consistent manner feasible usingcolor-dependent mass-to-light ratios. we find a clear correlation between bhmass and total stellar mass for the agn host galaxies, with m_bh proportionalto m_stellar, similar to that of early-type galaxies with dynamically-detectedbhs. however, the relation defined by the agns has a normalization that islower by more than an order of magnitude, with a bh-to-total stellar massfraction of m_bh/m_stellar ~ 0.025% across the stellar mass range 10^8 &lt;m_stellar/msun &lt; 10^12. this result has significant implications for studies athigh redshift and cosmological simulations in which stellar bulges cannot beresolved.

1509.09027	massive black holes in merging galaxies	the dynamics of massive black holes (bhs) in galaxy mergers is a rich fieldof research that has seen much progress in recent years. in this contributionwe briefly review the processes describing the journey of bhs during mergers,from the cosmic context all the way to when bhs coalesce. if two galaxies eachhosting a central bh merge, the bhs would be dragged towards the center of thenewly formed galaxy. if/when the holes get sufficiently close, they coalescevia the emission of gravitational waves. how often two bhs are involved ingalaxy mergers depends crucially on how many galaxies host bhs and on thegalaxy merger history. it is therefore necessary to start with fullcosmological models including bh physics and a careful dynamical treatment.after galaxies have merged, however, the bhs still have a long journey untilthey touch and coalesce. their dynamical evolution is radically different ingas-rich and gas-poor galaxies, leading to a sort of "dichotomy" betweenhigh-redshift and low-redshift galaxies, and late-type and early-type,typically more massive galaxies.

astro-ph;0207276	the assembly and merging history of supermassive black holes in  hierarchical models of galaxy formation	we assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (smbhs) at thecenter of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in the darkhalo `merger tree'. we assume that the first `seed' black holes (bhs) formed in(mini)halos collapsing at z=20 from high-sigma density fluctuations. as thesepregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into largerand larger halos, they sink to the center owing to dynamical friction, accretea fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form abinary system, and eventually coalesce. the merger history of dark matter halosand associated bhs is followed by cosmological monte carlo realizations of themerger hierarchy. a simple model, where quasar activity is driven by majormergers and smbhs accrete at the eddington rate a mass that scales with thefifth power of the velocity dispersion, is shown to reproduce the optical lf ofquasars in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;4. binary and triple bh interactions arefollowed in our merger tree. the assumptions underlying our scenario lead tothe prediction of a population of massive bhs wandering in galaxy halos and theintergalactic medium at the present epoch, and contributing &lt;10% to the totalbh mass density. at all epochs the fraction of binary smbhs in galaxy nuclei isof order 10%, while the fraction of binary quasars is less than 0.3%

astro-ph;0304389	the formation of galaxy stellar cores by the hierarchical merging of  supermassive black holes	we investigate a hierarchical structure formation scenario in which galaxystellar cores are created from the binding energy liberated by shrinkingsupermassive black hole (smbh) binaries. the binary orbital decay heats thesurrounding stars, eroding a preexisting 1/r^2 stellar cusp. we follow themerger history of dark matter halos and associated smbhs via cosmological montecarlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in alcdm cosmology. massive black holes get incorporated through a series ofmergers into larger and larger halos, sink to the center owing to dynamicalfriction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to becomesupermassive, and form a binary system. stellar dynamical processes drive thebinary to harden and eventually coalesce. a simple scheme is applied in whichthe loss cone is constantly refilled and a constant density core forms due tothe ejection of stellar mass. we find that a model in which the effect of thehierarchy of smbh interactions is cumulative and cores are preserved duringgalaxy mergers produces at the present epoch a correlation between the `massdeficit' (the mass needed to bring a flat inner density profile to a 1/r^2cusp) and the mass of the nuclear smbh, with a normalization and slopecomparable to the observed relation. models in which the mass displaced by thesmbh binary is replenished after every major galaxy merger appear instead tounderestimate the mass deficit observed in `core' galaxies.

astro-ph;0310223	early reionization by miniquasars	motivated by the recent detection by wmap of a large optical depth to thomsonscattering -- implying a very early reionization epoch -- we assess a scenariowhere the universe was reionized by `miniquasars' powered by intermediate-massblack holes (imbhs), the remnants of the first generation of massive stars.pregalactic imbhs form within minihalos above the cosmological jeans masscollapsing at z=24, get incorporated through mergers into larger and largersystems, sink to the center owing to dynamical friction, and accrete coldmaterial. the merger history of dark halos and associated imbhs is followed bymonte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a lcdm cosmology. whileseed imbhs that are as rare as the 3.5-sigma peaks of the primordial densityfield evolve largely in isolation, a significant number of black hole binarysystems will form if imbhs populate the more numerous 3-sigma peaks instead. inthe case of rapid binary coalescence a fraction of imbhs will be displaced fromgalaxy centers and ejected into the igm by the `gravitational rocket' effect,rather than accrete and shine as miniquasars. we show that, under a number ofplausible assumptions for the amount of gas accreted onto imbhs and theiremission spectrum, miniquasars powered by imbhs may be responsible forcosmological reionization at z~15. reionization by miniquasars with a hardspectrum may be more `economical' than stellar reionization, as soft x-raysescape more easily from the dense sites of star formation and travel furtherthan euv radiation. energetic photons will make the diffuse igm warm and weaklyionized prior to the epoch of reionization breakthrough, set an entropy floor,and reduce gas clumping. future 21 cm observations may detect a preheated,weakly-ionized igm in emission against the cmb.

astro-ph;0401543	low-frequency gravitational radiation from coalescing massive black hole  binaries in hierarchical cosmologies	we compute the expected gravitational wave signal from coalescing massiveblack hole (mbh) binaries at the center of galaxies in a hierarchical structureformation scenario in which seed holes of intermediate mass form far up in thedark halo merger tree. the merger history of dm halos and mbhs is followed fromz=20 to the present in a lcdm cosmology. mbhs get incorporated through halomergers into larger and larger structures, sink to the center owing todynamical friction against the dm background, accrete cold material in themerger remnant, and form mbh binary systems. stellar dynamical interactionscause the hardening of the binary at large separations, while gravitationalwave emission takes over at small radii and leads to the final coalescence ofthe pair. the integrated emission from inspiraling mbh binaries results in agravitational wave background (gwb). the characteristic strain spectrum has thestandard h_c(f)\propto f^{-2/3} behavior only in the range 1e-9&lt;f&lt;1e-6 hz. atlower frequencies the orbital decay of mbh binaries is driven by the ejectionof background stars, and h_c(f) \propto f. at higher frequencies, f&gt;1e-6 hz,the strain amplitude is shaped by the convolution of last stable circular orbitemission. we discuss the observability of inspiraling mbh binaries by theplanned lisa. over a 3-year observing period lisa should resolve this gwb intodiscrete sources, detecting ~60 (~250) individual events above a s/n=5 (s/n=1)confidence level.

astro-ph;0410342	the distribution and cosmic evolution of massive black hole spins	we study the expected distribution of massive black hole (mbh) spins and itsevolution with cosmic time in the context of hierarchical galaxy formationtheories. our model uses monte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in alcdm cosmology, coupled to semi-analytical recipes, to follow the mergerhistory of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the mbhs they host, and theirgrowth via gas accretion and binary coalescences. the coalescence of comparablemass holes increases the spin of mbhs, while the capture of smaller companionsin randomly-oriented orbits acts to spin holes down. we find that, given thedistribution of mbh binary mass ratios in hierarchical models, binarycoalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spin-up or spin-down of mbhswith time: the spin distribution retains memory of its initial conditions. bycontrast, because of the bardeen-petterson effect, gas accretion via a thindisk tends to spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis changesrandomly in time. in our models, accretion dominates over black hole capturesand efficiently spins holes up. the spin distribution is heavily skewed towardsfast-rotating kerr holes, is already in place at early epochs, and does notchange much below redshift 5. if accretion is via a thin disk, about 70% of allmbhs are maximally rotating and have radiative efficiencies approaching 30%(assuming a "standard'' spin-efficiency conversion). even in the conservativecase where accretion is via a geometrically thick disk, about 80% of all mbhshave spin parameters a/m &gt; 0.8 and accretion efficiencies &gt; 12%. rapidlyspinning holes with high radiative efficiencies may satisfy constraints basedon comparing the local mbh mass density with the mass density inferred fromluminous quasars (soltan's argument).

astro-ph;0501345	dynamical evolution of intermediate mass black holes and their  observable signatures in the nearby universe	we investigate the consequences of a model of the assembly and growth ofmassive black holes from primordial seeds, remnants of the first generation ofstars in a hierarchical structure formation scenario. our model traces thebuild-up of mbhs from an early epoch, and follows the merger history of darkmatter halos and their associated holes via monte carlo realizations of themerger hierarchy from early times to the present time. the sequence of minorand major mergers experienced by galactic halos in their hierarchical growthaffects the merger history of mbhs embedded in their nuclei. so, if theformation route for the assembly of smbhs dates back to the early universe, alarge number of bh interactions is inevitable. binary black holes coalescencetimescales can be long enough for a third bh to fall in and interact with thecentral binary. these bh triple interactions lead typically to the finalexpulsion of one of the three bodies and to the recoil of the binary. also,asymmetric emission of gravitational waves in the last stages of the black holemerging can give a recoil velocity to the centre of mass of the coalescingbinary. this scenario leads to the prediction of a population of intermediatemass bhs (imbhs) wandering in galaxy halos at the present epoch. we compute theluminosity distribution produced by these imbhs accreting from theircircumstellar medium. we find that in a milky way-sized galaxy they are unableto account for sources with luminosities &gt; 1e39 erg/s unless they carry abaryonic remnant from which they are able to accrete for a long time. we alsofind that, for typical spiral galaxies, the bright end of the point sourcedistribution correlates with the mass of the galaxy, and the most luminoussources are expected to be found in the disk.

astro-ph;0506040	rapid growth of high redshift black holes	we discuss a model for the early assembly of supermassive black holes (smbhs)at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in thedark halo `merger tree'. motivated by the observations of luminous quasarsaround redshift z=6 with smbh masses of billion solar masses, we assess thepossibility of an early phase of stable super-critical quasi-sphericalaccretion in the bhs hosted by metal free halos with virial temperature largerthan 10000 k. we assume that the first `seed' black holes formed withintermediate masses following the collapse of the first generation of stars, inmini-halos collapsing at z=20-30 from high peaks of density fluctuations. inhigh redshift halos with virial temperature larger than 10000 k, conditionsexist for the formation of a fat disc of gas at t_gas=5000-10000 k. cooling viahydrogen atomic lines is in fact effective in these comparatively massivehalos. the cooling and collapse of an initially spherical configuration of gasleads to a rotationally supported disc at the center of the halo if baryonspreserve their specific angular momentum during collapse. the conditions forthe formation of the gas disc and accretion onto a central black holes out ofthis supply of gas are investigated, as well as the feedback of the emissiononto the host and onto the intergalactic medium. we find that even a shortphase of supercritical accretion eases the requirements set by the z=6 quasars.

astro-ph;0602363	formation of supermassive black holes by direct collapse in pregalactic  halos	we describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can form directlyin the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for seed black holes left overfrom early star formation. self-gravitating gas in dark matter halos can loseangular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, theso-called "bars within bars" mechanism. this leads to the rapid buildup of adense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by aradiation pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and iscompressed further by subsequent infall. these conditions lead to such hightemperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically bythermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of acentral black hole.  we estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typicalconditions in metal-free halos with t_vir ~ 10^4 k, which are the most likelyto be susceptible to runaway infall. the initial black hole should have a massof &lt;~20 solar masses, but in principle could grow at a super-eddington rateuntil it reaches ~ 10^4-10^6 solar masses. rapid growth may be limited byfeedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply bystar formation or halo mergers. even if super-eddington growth stops at\~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this process would give black holes ample time toattain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seedsfor all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.

astro-ph;0602630	evolution of supermassive black holes	supermassive black holes (smbhs) are nowadays believed to reside in mostlocal galaxies, and the available data show an empirical correlation betweenbulge luminosity - or stellar velocity dispersion - and black hole mass,suggesting a single mechanism for assembling black holes and forming spheroidsin galaxy halos. the evidence is therefore in favour of a co-evolution betweengalaxies, black holes and quasars. in cold dark matter cosmogonies, small-masssubgalactic systems form first to merge later into larger and largerstructures. in this paradigm galaxy halos experience multiple mergers duringtheir lifetime. if every galaxy with a bulge hosts a smbh in its center, and alocal galaxy has been made up by multiple mergers, then a black hole binary isa natural evolutionary stage. the evolution of the supermassive black holepopulation clearly has to be investigated taking into account both thecosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of smbhs and their hosts.the seeds of smbhs have to be looked for in the early universe, as veryluminous quasars are detected up to redshift higher than z=6. these black holesevolve then in a hierarchical fashion, following the merger hierarchy of theirhost halos. accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays a fundamentalrole in determining the two parameters defining a black hole: mass and spin. aparticularly intriguing epoch is the initial phase of smbh growth. it is verychallenging to meet the observational constraints at z=6 if bhs are not fed atvery high rates in their infancy.

astro-ph;0606675	constraints on the accretion history of massive black holes from faint  x-ray counts	we investigate how hierarchical models for the co-evolution of the massiveblack hole (mbh) and agn population can reproduce the observed faint x-raycounts. we find that the main variable influencing the theoretical predictionsis the eddington ratio of accreting sources. we compare three different modelsproposed for the evolution of agn eddington ratio, f_edd: constant f_edd=1,f_edd decreasing with redshift, and f_edd depending on the agn luminosity, assuggested by simulations of galactic mergers including bhs and agn feedback. wefollow the full assembly of mbhs and host halos from early times to the presentin a lambdacdm cosmology. agn activity is triggered by halo major mergers andmbhs accrete mass until they satisfy the observed correlation with velocitydispersion. we find that all three models can reproduce fairly well the totalfaint x-ray counts. the redshift distribution is however poorly matched in thefirst two models. the eddington ratios suggested by merger simulations predictsno turn-off of the faint end of the agn optical luminosity function atredshifts z&gt;=1 down to very low luminosity.

astro-ph;0701556	the imprint of massive black hole formation models on the lisa data  stream	the formation, merging, and accretion history of massive black holes alongthe hierarchical build--up of cosmic structures leaves a unique imprint on thebackground of gravitational waves at mhz frequencies. we study here, by meansof dedicated simulations of black hole build--up, the possibility ofconstraining different models of black hole cosmic evolution using futuregravitational wave space--borne missions, such as lisa. we consider two mainscenarios for black hole formation, namely, one where seeds are light (~10^2\msun, remnant of population iii stars), and one where seeds are heavy (&gt;~10^4\msun, direct collapse). in all the models we have investigated, massive blackhole binary coalescences do not produce a stochastic gw background, but rather,a set of individual resolved events. detection of several hundreds mergingevents in 3 year lisa mission will be the sign of a heavy seed scenario withefficient formation of black hole seeds in a large fraction of high redshifthalos. on the other extreme, a low event rate, about few tens in 3 years, ispeculiar of scenarios where either the seeds are light, and many coalescencesdo not fall into the lisa band, or seeds are massive, but rare. in this case adecisive diagnostic is provided by the shape of the mass distribution ofdetected events. light binaries (m&lt;10^4\msun) are predicted in a fairly largenumber in population iii remnants models, but are totally absent in directcollapse models. finally, a further, helpful diagnostic of black hole formationmodels lies in the distribution of the mass ratios in binary coalescences.while heavy seed models predict that most of the detected events involve equalmass binaries, in the case of light seeds, mass ratios are equally distributedin the range 0.1-1.

astro-ph;0703180	gravitational recoil: signatures on the massive black hole population	in the last stages of a black hole merger, the binary can experience a recoildue to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. recent numericalrelativity simulations suggest that the recoil velocity can be as high as a fewthousands kilometers per second for particular configurations. we consider herethe effect of a worst case scenario for orbital and phase configurations on thehierarchical evolution of the massive black hole (mbh) population. the orbitalconfiguration and spin orientation in the plane is chosen to be the oneyielding the highest possible kick. masses and spin magnitudes are insteadderived self-consistently from the mbh evolutionary models. if seeds formearly, e.g. as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the firstfew generation of binaries are ejected. the fraction of lost binaries decreasesat later times due to a combination of the binary mass ratio distributionbecoming shallower, and the deepening of the hosts potential wells. if seedsform at later times, in more massive halos, the retention rate is much higher.we show that the gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolutionof the mbh population that we observe locally in either case, although highmass seeds seem to be favored. the gravitational recoil is instead a realhazard for (i) mbhs in biased halos at high-redshift, where mergers are morecommon, and the potential wells still relatively shallow. similarly, it is verychallenging to retain (ii) mbhs merging in star clusters.

0810.1057	formation of the first nuclear clusters and massive black holes at high  redshift	we present a model for the formation of massive black holes ($\sim 1000\msun$) due to stellar-dynamical processes in the first stellar clusters formedat early cosmic times ($z\sim10-20$). the high redshift black hole seeds formas a result of multiple successive instabilities that occur in low metallicity$z\sim 10^{-5}z_\odot$) protogalaxies. we focus on relatively massive halos athigh redshift ($t_{\rm vir} &gt; 10^4$ k, $z\gsim 10$) after the very first starsin the universe have completed their evolution. this set of assumptions ensuresthat (i) atomic hydrogen cooling can contribute to the gas cooling process,(ii) a uv field has been created by the first stars, and (iii) the gas insidethe halo has been mildly polluted by the first metals. the second conditionimplies that at low density $h_2$ is dissociated and does not contribute tocooling. the third condition sets a minimum threshold density forfragmentation, so that stars form efficiently only in the very inner core ofthe protogalaxy. within this core, very compact stellar clusters form. a largefraction of these very dense clusters undergo core collapse before stars areable to complete stellar evolution. runaway star-star collisions eventuallylead to the formation of a very massive star, leaving behind a massive blackhole remnant. clusters unstable to runaway collisions are always the first,less massive ones that form. typically a fraction $\sim 0.05$ of protogalaxiesat $z\sim10-20$ form black hole seeds, with masses $\sim 1000-2000 \msun$,leading to a mass density in seeds of a few $\simeq10^2\msun/{\rm mpc}^{-3}$.this density allows enough room for black hole growth by accretion during thequasar epoch.

0811.1011	massive black hole binary inspirals: results from the lisa parameter  estimation taskforce	the lisa parameter estimation (lisape) taskforce was formed in september 2007to provide the lisa project with vetted codes, source distribution models, andresults related to parameter estimation. the taskforce's goal is to be able toquickly calculate the impact of any mission design changes on lisa's sciencecapabilities, based on reasonable estimates of the distribution ofastrophysical sources in the universe. this paper describes our taskforce'swork on massive black-hole binaries (mbhbs). given present uncertainties in theformation history of mbhbs, we adopt four different population models, based on(i) whether the initial black-hole seeds are small or large, and (ii) whetheraccretion is efficient or inefficient at spinning up the holes. we compare fourlargely independent codes for calculating lisa's parameter-estimationcapabilities. all codes are based on the fisher-matrix approximation, but inthe past they used somewhat different signal models, source parametrizationsand noise curves. we show that once these differences are removed, the fourcodes give results in extremely close agreement with each other. using a codethat includes both spin precession and higher harmonics in thegravitational-wave signal, we carry out monte carlo simulations and determinethe number of events that can be detected and accurately localized in our fourpopulation models.

0812.1569	double quasars: probes of black hole scaling relationships and merger  scenarios	we analyze the available sample of double quasars, and investigate theirphysical properties. our sample comprises 85 pairs, selected from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we derive physical parameters for the engine and thehost, and model the dynamical evolution of the pair. first, we comparedifferent scaling relationships between massive black holes and their hosts(bulge mass, velocity dispersion, and their possible redshift dependences), anddiscuss their consistency. we then compute dynamical friction timescales forthe double quasar systems to investigate their frequency and their agreementwith scenarios for quasar triggering. comparing typical merging timescales toexpected quasar lifetimes, the fraction of double quasars should be roughly afactor of 10 larger than observed. additionally, we find that, depending on thecorrelations between black holes and their hosts, the occurrence of doublequasars could be redshift-dependent. comparison of our models to the sdssquasar catalog suggests that double quasars should be more common at highredshift. we compare the typical separations at which double quasars areobserved to the predictions of merger simulations. we find that thedistribution of physical separations peaks at ~30 kpc, with a tail at largerseparations (~100-200 kpc). these large separation pairs are instead consistentwith unequal mass mergers where gas is dynamically perturbed during the firstpericentric passage, but the gas reaches the black hole only at the nextapocenter, where the pair is observed.
