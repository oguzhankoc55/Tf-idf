0902.4204	weak lensing signal in unified dark matter models	weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for studying both the geometryand the dynamics of the universe. its power spectrum contains information onthe sources emitting photons and on the large--scale structures that thesehotons cross. we calculate the weak lensing cosmic convergence and shear powerspectra, in linear theory and limber's approximation, for two different classesof cosmological models: the standard \lambdacdm and unified dark matter (udm)models. the latter models attempt to solve the problems of the dark matter inthe dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters and of the late-time accelerationof the universe expansion by introducing a scalar field that mimics both darkmatter and dark energy. a crucial feature of the udm models is the speed ofsound c_\infty, that is the value of the sound speed at late times, on whichstructure formation depends. in this paper, we provide the predictions of theudm models for the weak lensing signal,with various values of c_\infty. weconsider both the cosmic microwave background and background galaxies atdifferent redshifts as sources for the weak lensing power spectra. we find thatthe power spectra in udm models are more sensitive to the variations ofc_\infty for sources located at low redshifts. moreover, we find that forc_\infty&gt;10^{-3} (in units of the speed of light), the udm weak lensingconvergence power spectrum c^{\kappa\kappa}(l) for background galaxies isstrongly suppressed with respect to the \lambdacdm spectrum, particularly atsmall angular scales l\gtrsim100.

0903.2874	resolving the timing problem of the globular clusters orbiting the  fornax dwarf galaxy	we re-investigate the old problem of the survival of the five globularclusters orbiting the fornax dwarf galaxy in both standard and modifiednewtonian dynamics. for the first time in the history of the topic, we useaccurate mass models for the fornax dwarf, obtained through jeans modelling ofthe recently published line of sight velocity dispersion data, and we are alsonot resigned to circular orbits for the globular clusters. previously conceivedproblems stem from fixing the starting distances of the globulars to be lessthan half the tidal radius. we relax this constraint since there is absolutelyno evidence for it and show that the dark matter paradigm, with either cuspedor cored dark matter profiles, has no trouble sustaining the orbits of the twoleast massive globular clusters for a hubble time almost regardless of theirinitial distance from fornax. the three most massive globulars can remain inorbit as long as their starting distances are marginally outside the tidalradius. the outlook for modified newtonian dynamics is also not nearly as bleakas previously reported. although dynamical friction inside the tidal radius isfar stronger in mond, outside dynamical friction is negligible due to theabsence of stars. this allows highly radial orbits to survive, but moreimportantly circular orbits at distances more than 85% of fornax's tidal radiusto survive indefinitely. the probability of the globular clusters being oncircular orbits at this distance compared with their current projecteddistances is discussed and shown to be plausible. finally, if we ignore thepresence of the most massive globular (giving it a large line of sightdistance) we demonstrate that the remaining four globulars can survive withinthe tidal radius for the hubble time with perfectly sensible orbits.

0906.3322	equilibrium configurations of 11ev sterile neutrinos in mondian galaxy  clusters	(abridged) modified newtonian dynamics (mond) can fit a broad range of galaxykinematic data, but struggles with clusters of galaxies. mondian clusters needdark matter, and here we test the 11 ev sterile neutrino - used to fit thefirst three acoustic peaks of the cosmic microwave background - byinvestigating their equilibrium distributions in 30 groups and clusters over awide range of temperatures. knowing both the sterile neutrino density andvelocity dispersion tells us the tremaine-gunn phase-space limit at all radii.we find that all 30 systems serendipitously reach the tremaine-gunn limit bythe centre, which means a portion of the dynamical mass must always be coveredby the brightest cluster galaxy. interestingly, the typical fitted k-bandmass-to-light ratio is unity and at most 1.2, which is very consistent -although leaving no margin for error - with stellar population synthesismodels. amidst the sample there are several special cases including the comacluster (for which dark matter was first proposed), ngc 720 (where geometricalevidence for dark matter was found) and the bullet cluster (where dark matter -of some kind - in clusters was directly proven to exist). we demonstrate that11 ev sterile neutrinos are unlikely to influence spiral galaxy rotationcurves, as they don't influence even some very massive early-types (ngc 4125and ngc 6482). finally, we conclude that it is intriguing that the minimum massof sterile neutrino particle that can match the cosmic microwave background isidentical to the minimum mass found here to be consistent with equilibriumconfigurations of mondian clusters of galaxies.

0907.4689	constraining f(r) theories with type ia supernovae and gamma ray bursts	fourth - order gravity theories have received much interest in recent yearsthanks to their ability to provide an accelerated cosmic expansion in a matteronly universe. in these theories, the lagrangian density of the gravitationalfield has the form r + f(r), and the explicit choice of the arbitrary functionf(r) must meet the local tests of gravity and the constraints from theprimordial abundance of the light elements. two popular classes of f(r) models,which are expected to fulfill all the above requirements, have recently beenproposed. however, neither of these models has ever been quantitatively testedagainst the available astrophysical data. here, by combining type ia supernovaeand gamma ray bursts, we investigate the ability of these models to reproducethe observed hubble diagram over the redshift range (0, 7). we find that bothmodels fit very well this dataset with the present day values of the matterdensity and deceleration parameters which agree with previous estimates.however, the strong degeneracy among the f(r) parameters prevents us fromputting strong constraints on the values of these parameters; nevertheless, wecan identify the regions of the parameter space that should, in principle, becarefully explored with future data and dynamical probes in order todiscriminate among f(r) theories and standard dark energy models.

0910.2242	velocity dispersion profile of the milky way halo	we present a spectroscopic sample of 910 distant halo stars from thehypervelocity star survey from which we derive the velocity dispersion profileof the milky way halo. the sample is a mix of 74% evolved horizontal branchstars and 26% blue stragglers. we estimate distances to the stars usingobserved colors, metallicities, and stellar evolution tracks. our samplecontains twice as many objects with r&gt;50 kpc as previous surveys. we computethe velocity dispersion profile in two ways: with a parametric method based ona milky way potential model, and with a non-parametric method based on thecaustic technique originally developed to measure galaxy cluster mass profiles.the resulting velocity dispersion profiles are remarkably consistent with thosefound by two independent surveys based on other stellar populations: the milkyway halo exhibits a mean decline in radial velocity dispersion of -0.38+-0.12km/s/kpc over 15&lt;r&lt;75 kpc. this measurement is a useful basis for calculatingthe total mass and mass distribution of the milky way halo.

1001.0006	comparison of hectospec virial masses with sze measurements	we present the first comparison of virial masses of galaxy clusters withtheir sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) signals. we study 15 clusters from thehectospec cluster survey (hecs) with mmt/hectospec spectroscopy and publishedsze signals. we measure virial masses of these clusters from an average of 90member redshifts inside the radius $r_{100}$. the virial masses of the clustersare strongly correlated with their sze signals (at the 99% confidence levelusing a spearman rank-sum test). this correlation suggests that $y_{sz}$ can beused as a measure of virial mass. simulations predict a powerlaw scaling of$y_{sz}\propto m_{200}^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx$1.6. observationally, wefind $\alpha$=1.11$\pm$0.16, significantly shallower (given the formaluncertainty) than the theoretical prediction. however, the selection functionof our sample is unknown and a bias against less massive clusters cannot beexcluded (such a selection bias could artificially flatten the slope).moreover, our sample indicates that the relation between velocity dispersion(or virial mass estimate) and sze signal has significant intrinsic scatter,comparable to the range of our current sample. more detailed studies of scalingrelations are therefore needed to derive a robust determination of the relationbetween cluster mass and sze.

1002.4122	a sub-resolution multiphase interstellar medium model of star formation  and sne energy feedback	we present a new multi-phase sub-resolution model for star formation andfeedback in sph numerical simulations of galaxy formation. our model, calledmuppi (multi-phase particle integrator), describes each gas particle as amulti-phase system, with cold and hot gas phases, coexisting in pressureequilibrium, and a stellar component. cooling of the hot tenuous gas phasefeeds the cold gas phase. stars are formed out of molecular gas with a givenefficiency, which scales with the dynamical time of the cold phase. ourprescription for star formation is not based on imposing the schmidt-kennicuttrelation, which is instead naturally produced by muppi. energy from supernovaexplosions is deposited partly into the hot phase of the gas particles, andpartly to that of neighboring particles. mass and energy flows among thedifferent phases of each particle are described by a set of ordinarydifferential equations which we explicitly integrate for each gas particle,instead of relying on equilibrium solutions. this system of equations alsoincludes the response of the multi-phase structure to energy changes associatedto the thermodynamics of the gas. we apply our model to two isolated diskgalaxy simulations and two spherical cooling flows. muppi is able to reproducethe schmidt-kennicutt relation for disc galaxies. it also reproduces the basicproperties of the inter-stellar medium in disc galaxies, the surface densitiesof cold and molecular gas, of stars and of star formation rate, the verticalvelocity dispersion of cold clouds and the flows connected to the galacticfountains. quite remarkably, muppi also provides efficient stellar feedbackwithout the need to include a scheme of kinetic energy feedback.

1002.4740	measuring unified dark matter with 3d cosmic shear	we present parameter estimation forecasts for future 3d cosmic shear surveysfor a class of unified dark matter (udm) models, where a single scalar fieldmimics both dark matter (dm) and dark energy (de). these models have theadvantage that they can describe the dynamics of the universe with a singlematter component providing an explanation for structure formation and cosmicacceleration. a crucial feature of the class of udm models we use in this workis characterised by a parameter, c_inf (in units of the speed of light c=1),that is the value of the sound speed at late times, and on which structureformation depends. we demonstrate that the properties of the dm-like behaviourof the scalar field can be estimated with very high precision with large-scale,fully 3d weak lensing surveys. we found that 3d weak lensing significantlyconstrains c_inf, and we find minimal errors 0.00003, for the fiducial valuec_inf=0.001, and 0.000026, for c_inf=0.012. moreover, we compute the bayesianevidence for udm models over the lcdm model as a function of c_inf. for thispurpose, we can consider the lcdm model as a udm model with c_inf=0. we findthat the expected evidence clearly shows that the survey data wouldunquestionably favour udm models over the lcdm model, for the valuesc_inf&gt;0.001.

1011.0372	measuring the escape velocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters  beyond their virial radius	the caustic technique uses galaxy redshifts alone to measure the escapevelocity and mass profiles of galaxy clusters to clustrocentric distances wellbeyond the virial radius, where dynamical equilibrium does not necessarilyhold. we provide a detailed description of this technique and analyse itspossible systematic errors. we apply the caustic technique to clusters withmass m_200&gt;=10^{14}h^{-1} m_sun extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamicsimulation of a lambdacdm universe. with a few tens of redshifts per squaredcomoving megaparsec within the cluster, the caustic technique, on average,recovers the profile of the escape velocity from the cluster with better than10 percent accuracy up to r~4 r_200. the caustic technique also recovers themass profile with better than 10 percent accuracy in the range (0.6-4) r_200,but it overestimates the mass up to 70 percent at smaller radii. thisoverestimate is a consequence of neglecting the radial dependence of thefilling function f_beta(r). the 1-sigma uncertainty on individual escapevelocity profiles increases from ~20 to ~50 percent when the radius increasesfrom r~0.1 r_200 to ~4 r_200. individual mass profiles have 1-sigma uncertaintybetween 40 and 80 percent within the radial range (0.6-4) r_200. we show thatthe amplitude of these uncertainties is completely due to the assumption ofspherical symmetry, which is difficult to drop. alternatively, we can apply thetechnique to synthetic clusters obtained by stacking individual clusters: inthis case, the 1-sigma uncertainty on the escape velocity profile is smallerthan 20 percent out to 4 r_200. the caustic technique thus provides reliableaverage profiles which extend to regions difficult or impossible to probe withother techniques.

1101.2560	testing a phenomenologically extended dgp model with upcoming weak  lensing surveys	a phenomenological extension of the well-known brane-world cosmology ofdvali, gabadadze and porrati (edgp) has recently been proposed. in this model,a cosmological-constant-like term is explicitly present as a non-vanishingtension sigma on the brane, and an extra parameter alpha tunes the cross-overscale r_c, the scale at which higher dimensional gravity effects become nonnegligible. since the hubble parameter in this cosmology reproduces the samelcdm expansion history, we study how upcoming weak lensing surveys, such aseuclid and des (dark energy survey), can confirm or rule out this class ofmodels. we perform markov chain monte carlo simulations to determine theparameters of the model, using type ia supernov\ae, h(z) data, gamma ray burstsand baryon acoustic oscillations. we also fit the power spectrum of thetemperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background to obtain thecorrect normalisation for the density perturbation power spectrum. then, wecompute the matter and the cosmic shear power spectra, both in the linear andnon-linear regimes. the latter is calculated with the two different approachesof hu and sawicki (2007) (hs) and khoury and wyman (2009) (kw). with the edgpparameters coming from the markov chains, kw reproduces the lcdm matter powerspectrum at both linear and non-linear scales and the lcdm and edgp shearsignals are degenerate. this result does not hold with the hs prescription:euclid can distinguish the edgp model from lcdm because their expected powerspectra roughly differ by the 3sigma uncertainty in the angular scale range700&lt;l&lt;3000; on the contrary, the two models differ at most by the 1sigmauncertainty over the range 500&lt;l&lt;3000 in the des experiment and they arevirtually indistinguishable.

1103.5501	gamma-ray bursts as cosmological probes: lambdacdm vs. conformal gravity	lambdacdm, for the currently preferred cosmological density omega_0 andcosmological constant omega_lambda, predicts that the universe expansiondecelerates from early times to redshift z~0.9 and accelerates at later times.on the contrary, the cosmological model based on conformal gravity predictsthat the cosmic expansion has always been accelerating. to distinguish betweenthese two very different cosmologies, we resort to gamma-ray bursts (grbs),which have been suggested to probe the universe expansion history at z&gt;1, whereidentified type ia supernovae (sne) are rare. we use the full bayesian approachto infer the cosmological parameters and the additional parameters required todescribe the grb data available in the literature. for the first time, we usegrbs as cosmological probes without any prior information from other data. inaddition, when we combine the grb samples with sne, our approach neatly avoidsall the inconsistencies of most numerous previous methods that are plagued bythe so-called circularity problem. in fact, when analyzed properly, currentdata are consistent with distance moduli of grbs and sne that can respectivelybe, in a variant of conformal gravity, ~15 and ~3 magnitudes fainter than inlambdacdm. our results indicate that the currently available sn and grb samplesare accommodated equally well by both lambdacdm and conformal gravity and donot exclude a continuous accelerated expansion. we conclude that grbs arecurrently far from being effective cosmological probes, as they are unable todistinguish between these two very different expansion histories.

1104.2740	tomography from the next generation of cosmic shear experiments for  viable f(r) models	we present the cosmic shear signal predicted by two viable cosmologicalmodels in the framework of modified-action f(r) theories. we use f(r) modelswhere the current accelerated expansion of the universe is a direct consequenceof the modified gravitational lagrangian rather than dark energy (de), eitherin the form of vacuum energy/cosmological constant or of a dynamical scalarfield (e.g. quintessence). we choose starobinsky's (st) and hu &amp; sawicki's (hs)f(r) models, which are carefully designed to pass the solar system gravitytests. in order to further support - or rule out - f(r) theories as alternativecandidates to the de hypothesis, we exploit the power of weak gravitationallensing, specifically of cosmic shear. we calculate the tomographic shearmatrix as it would be measured by the upcoming esa cosmic vision euclidsatellite. we find that in the st model the cosmic shear signal is almostcompletely degenerate with lcdm, but it is easily distinguishable in the hsmodel. moreover, we compute the corresponding fisher matrix for both the st andhs models, thus obtaining forecasts for their cosmological parameters. finally,we show that the bayes factor for cosmic shear will definitely favour the hsmodel over lcdm if euclid measures a value larger than ~0.02 for the extra hsparameter n_hs.

1104.5040	the abundance of galaxy clusters in mond: cosmological simulations with  massive neutrinos	we present a new particle-mesh cosmological n-body code for accuratelysolving the modified poisson equation of the quasi linear formulation of mond.we generate initial conditions for the angus (2009) cosmological model, whichis identical to lcdm except that the cold dark matter is switched for a singlespecies of thermal sterile neutrinos. we set the initial conditions at z=250for a (512 mpc/h)^3 box with 256^3 particles and we evolve them down to z=0. weclearly demonstrate the necessity of mond for developing the large scalestructure in a hot dark matter cosmology and contradict the naive expectationthat mond cannot form galaxy clusters. we find that the correct order ofmagnitude of x-ray clusters (with t_x &gt; 4.5 kev) can be formed, but that weoverpredict the number of very rich clusters and seriously underpredict thenumber of lower mass clusters. the latter is a shortcoming of the resolution ofour simulations, whereas we suggest that the over production of very richclusters might be prevented by incorporating a mond acceleration constant thatvaries with redshift and an expansion history that cannot be described by theusual friedmann models. we present evidence that suggests the density profilesof our simulated clusters are compatible with those of observed x-ray clustersin mond. it remains to be seen if the low mass end of the cluster mass functioncan be reproduced and if the high densities of dark matter in the central 20kpc of groups and clusters of galaxies, measured in the mond framework, can beachieved. as a last test, we computed the relative velocity between pairs ofhalos within 10 mpc and find that pairs with velocities larger than 3000 km/slike the bullet cluster, can form without difficulty.

1105.3378	how unusual are the shapley supercluster and the sloan great wall?	we use extreme value statistics to assess the significance of two of the mostdramatic structures in the local universe: the shapley supercluster and thesloan great wall. if we assume that shapley (volume ~ 1.2 x 10^5 (mpc/h)^3)evolved from an overdense region in the initial gaussian fluctuation field,with currently popular choices for the background cosmological model and theshape and amplitude sigma8 of the initial power spectrum, we estimate that thetotal mass of the system is within 20 percent of 1.8 x 10^16 msun/h. extremevalue statistics show that the existence of this massive concentration is notunexpected if the initial fluctuation field was gaussian, provided there are noother similar objects within a sphere of radius 200 mpc/h centred on ourgalaxy. however, a similar analysis of the sloan great wall, a more distant (z~ 0.08) and extended concentration of structures (volume ~ 7.2 x 10^5(mpc/h)^3) suggests that it is more unusual. we estimate its total mass to bewithin 20 percent of 1.2 x 10^17 msun/h; even if it is the densest such objectof its volume within z=0.2, its existence is difficult to reconcile withgaussian initial conditions if sigma8 &lt; 0.9. this tension can be alleviated ifthis structure is the densest within the hubble volume. finally, we show howextreme value statistics can be used to address the likelihood that an objectlike shapley exists in the same volume which contains the great wall, finding,again, that shapley is not particularly unusual. it is straightforward toincorporate other models of the initial fluctuation field into our formalism.

(2005b) analysis of the sdssand the liu et al.

1108.3697	using dwarf satellite proper motions to determine their origin	the highly organised distribution of satellite galaxies surrounding the milkyway is a serious challenge to the concordance cosmological model. perhaps theonly remaining solution, in this framework, is that the dwarf satellitegalaxies fall into the milky way's potential along one or two filaments, whichmay or may not plausibly reproduce the observed distribution. here we test thisscenario by making use of the proper motions of the fornax, sculptor, ursaminor and carina dwarf spheroidals, and trace their orbits back through severalvariations of the milky way's potential and account for dynamical friction. thekey parameters are the proper motions and total masses of the dwarf galaxies.using a simple model we find no tenable set of parameters that can allow fornaxto be consistent with filamentary infall, mainly because the 1 sigma error onits proper motion is relatively small. the other three must walk a tightropebetween requiring a small pericentre (less than 20 kpc) to lose enough orbitalenergy to dynamical friction and avoiding being tidally disrupted. we thenemployed a more realistic model with host halo mass accretion, and found thatthe four dwarf galaxies must have fallen in at least 5 gyrs ago. this timeinterval is longer than organised distribution is expected to last before beingerased by the randomisation of the satellite orbits.

1201.1616	clash: precise new constraints on the mass profile of abell 2261	we precisely constrain the inner mass profile of abell 2261 (z=0.225) for thefirst time and determine this cluster is not "over-concentrated" as foundpreviously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\lambda}cdmexpectations. these results are based on strong lensing analyses of new 16-bandhst imaging obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of subaruwide field imaging with 5-band subaru + kpno photometry, we place tight newconstraints on the halo virial mass m_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70(within r \approx 3 mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming aspherical halo. this agrees broadly with average c(m,z) predictions from recent{\lambda}cdm simulations which span 5 &lt;~ &lt;c&gt; &lt;~ 8. our most significantsystematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. to estimatethis, we also derive a mass profile based on archival chandra x-rayobservations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile atr2500 ~ 600 kpc. agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axisratio along our line of sight. for this elongated halo model, we find m_vir =1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lowerlimits on these values. the need for halo elongation can be partially obviatedby non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors inthe x-ray mass measurements. we estimate the effect of background structuresbased on mmt/hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lowermvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

1201.3272	an updated analysis of two classes of f(r) theories of gravity	the observed accelerated cosmic expansion can be a signature offourth\,-\,order gravity theories, where the acceleration of the universe is aconsequence of departures from einstein general relativity, rather than thesign of the existence of a fluid with negative pressure. in thefourth\,-\,order gravity theories, the gravity lagrangian is described by ananalytic function $f(r)$ of the scalar curvature $r$ subject to the demandingconditions that no detectable deviations from standard gr is observed on thesolar system scale. here we consider two classes of $f(r)$ theories able topass solar system tests and investigate their viability on cosmological scales.to this end, we fit the theories to a large dataset including the combinedhubble diagram of type ia supernovae and gamma ray bursts, the hubble parameter$h(z)$ data from passively evolving red galaxies, baryon acoustic oscillationsextracted from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)and the distance priors from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe sevenyears (wmap7) data. we find that both classes of $f(r)$ fit very well thislarge dataset with the present\,-\,day values of the matter density, hubbleconstant and deceleration parameter in agreement with previous estimates;however, the strong degeneracy among the $f(r)$ parameters prevents us fromstrongly constraining their values. we also derive the growth factor $g =d\ln{\delta}/d\ln{a}$, with $\delta = \delta \rho_m/\rho_m$ the matter densityperturbation, and show that it can still be well approximated by $g(z) \propto\omega_m(z)^{\gamma}$. we finally constrain $\gamma$ (on some representativescales) and investigate its redshift dependence to see whether future data candiscriminate between these classes of $f(r)$ theories and standard dark energymodels.

1206.6231	the acceleration scale, modified newtonian dynamics, and sterile  neutrinos	general relativity is able to describe the dynamics of galaxies and largercosmic structures only if most of the matter in the universe is dark, namely itdoes not emit any electromagnetic radiation. intriguingly, on the scale ofgalaxies, there is strong observational evidence that the presence of darkmatter appears to be necessary only when the gravitational field inferred fromthe distribution of the luminous matter falls below an acceleration of theorder of 10^(-10) m/s^2. in the standard model, which combines newtoniangravity with dark matter, the origin of this acceleration scale is challengingand remains unsolved. on the contrary, the full set of observations can beneatly described, and were partly predicted, by a modification of newtoniandynamics, dubbed mond, that does not resort to the existence of dark matter. onthe scale of galaxy clusters and beyond, however, mond is not as successful ason the scale of galaxies, and the existence of some dark matter appearsunavoidable. a model combining mond with hot dark matter made of sterileneutrinos seems to be able to describe most of the astrophysical phenomenology,from the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies to thedynamics of dwarf galaxies. whether there exists a yet unknown covariant theorythat contains general relativity and newtonian gravity in the weak field limit,and mond as the ultra-weak field limit is still an open question.

1209.3786	measuring the ultimate mass of galaxy clusters: redshifts and mass  profiles from the hectospec cluster survey (hecs)	the infall regions of galaxy clusters represent the largest gravitationallybound structures in a $\lambda$cdm universe. measuring cluster mass profilesinto the infall regions provides an estimate of the ultimate mass of thesehaloes. we use the caustic technique to measure cluster mass profiles fromgalaxy redshifts obtained with the hectospec cluster survey (hecs), anextensive spectroscopic survey of galaxy clusters with mmt/hectospec. we survey58 clusters selected by x-ray flux at 0.1$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$0.3. the survey includes21,314 unique mmt/hectospec redshifts for individual galaxies; 10,275 of thesegalaxies are cluster members. for each cluster we acquired high signal-to-noisespectra for $\sim 200$ cluster members and a comparable number offoreground/background galaxies. the cluster members trace out infall patternsaround the clusters. the members define a very narrow red sequence. thevelocity dispersions decline with radius; we demonstrate that the determinationof the velocity dispersion is insensitive to the inclusion of bluer members (asmall fraction of the cluster population). we apply the caustic technique todefine membership and estimate the mass profiles to large radii. the ultimatehalo mass of clusters (the mass that remains bound in the far future of a$\lambda$cdm universe) is on average (1.99$\pm$0.11)$m_{200}$, a newobservational cosmological test in essential agreement with simulations. summedprofiles binned in $m_{200}$ and in $l_x$ demonstrate that the predicted nfwform of the density profile is a remarkably good representation of the data inagreement with weak lensing results extending to large radius. theconcentration of these summed profiles is also consistent with theoreticalpredictions.

1209.5675	measuring the mass distribution in galaxy clusters	cluster mass profiles are tests of models of structure formation. only twocurrent observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitationallensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption ofdynamical equilibrium. both techniques enable determination of the extendedmass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. for 19 clusters, we compare themass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurementstaken from the literature. this comparison offers a test of systematic issuesin both techniques. around the virial radius, the two methods of massestimation agree to within about 30%, consistent with the expected errors inthe individual techniques. at small radii, the caustic technique overestimatesthe mass as expected from numerical simulations. the ratio between the lensingprofile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weaklensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. at radiilarger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the causticmass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile bylarge-scale structures within the lensing kernel. we highlight the case of theclosely neighboring clusters ms0906+11 and a750 to illustrate the potentialseriousness of contamination of the the weak lensing signal by unrelatedstructures.

1211.3669	identification of members in the central and outer regions of galaxy  clusters	the caustic technique measures the mass of galaxy clusters in both theirvirial and infall regions and, as a byproduct, yields the list of clustergalaxy members. here we use 100 galaxy clusters with mass m200&gt;=1e14 msun/hextracted from a cosmological n-body simulation of a lambdacdm universe to testthe ability of the caustic technique to identify the cluster galaxy members. weidentify the true three-dimensional members as the gravitationally boundgalaxies. the caustic technique uses the caustic location in the redshiftdiagram to separate the cluster members from the interlopers. we apply thetechnique to mock catalogues containing 1000 galaxies in the field of view of12 mpc/h on a side at the cluster location. on average, this sample sizeroughly corresponds to 180 real galaxy members within 3r200, similar to recentredshift surveys of cluster regions. the caustic technique yields acompleteness, the fraction of identified true members, fc=0.95 (+- 0.03) within3r200. the contamination increases from fi=0.020 (+0.046;-0.015) at r200 tofi=0.08 (+0.11;-0.05) at 3r200. no other technique for the identification ofthe members of a galaxy cluster provides such large completeness and smallcontamination at these large radii. the caustic technique assumes sphericalsymmetry and the asphericity of the cluster is responsible for most of thespread of the completeness and the contamination. by applying the technique toan approximately spherical system obtained by stacking the individual clusters,the spreads decrease by at least a factor of two. we finally estimate thecluster mass within 3r200 after removing the interlopers: for individualclusters, the mass estimated with the virial theorem is unbiased and within 30per cent of the actual mass; this spread decreases to less than 10 per cent forthe spherically symmetric stacked cluster.

1303.0995	the dynamics of the bulge dominated galaxy ngc 7814 in mond	the bulge dominated galaxy ngc 7814 provides one of the strongest dynamicaltests possible for modified newtonian dynamics (mond). spitzer 3.6 micronphotometry fixes the bulge parameterisation and strongly constrains theproperties of the sub-dominant stellar disk. furthermore, the distance is knownto better than 5 percent, virtually eliminating it as a free parameter. therotation curve is easily measured, since the h i (and stellar) disks are edgeon, and both the receding and approaching sides agree very well. in this paperwe explore the agreement between the model and observed rotation curves in mondgiven that the only two free parameters available are the mass-to-light ratiosof the bulge and disk. we use a grid based mond poisson solver that accuratelysolves for the mond gravity and produces our model rotation curves from a givenmass distribution. the input to the poisson solver is a 3d distribution of nparticles which is generated from modelling the observed distribution of starsand gas in the galaxy. by ensuring a superior fit to the radial surfacebrightness profile than previous works, by virtue of a double sersic fit to thebulge, we were able to produce excellent fits to the rotation curve withtypical values for both mass-to-light ratios. we conclude that the modelrotation curve of a mass distribution in mond is extremely sensitive to thebulge-disk decomposition and even slight deviation from the observed massdistribution can produce large differences in the model rotation curve.

1305.4804	the galaxy population of the complex cluster system abell 3921	we present a spectrophotometric analysis of the galaxy pop. in the area ofthe merging cluster abell 3921 at redshift 0.093. we investigate the impact ofthe complex cluster environment on galaxy properties such as morphology or starformation rate. we combine multi-object spectroscopy from the 2df spectrographwith optical imaging taken with the eso wfi. we carry out a redshift analysisand determine cluster velocity dispersions using biweight statistics. applyinga dressler-shectman (ds-)test we seek evidence for cluster substructure.cluster and field galaxies are investigated with respect to [oii] and h{\alpha}equivalent width, sfr and morphological descriptors such as concentration indexand gini coefficient. we study these cluster galaxy properties as a function ofclustercentric distance and investigate the spatial distribution of variousgalaxy types. applying the ds-test we find a 3rd component (a3921-c) inaddition to the two main subclusters (a3921-a and a3921-b) already known. there-determined mass ratio between the main components a and b is approx. 2:1.similar to prev. studies of galaxy clusters, we find that a large fraction ofthe disk galaxies close to the cluster core show no detectable star formation.these are likely systems that are quenched due to ram pressure stripping. wealso find quenched spirals at rather large distances of 3 to 4 mpc from thecluster core. a3921-c might be a group of galaxies falling onto the maincluster components. we speculate that the unexpected population of quenchedspirals at large clustercentric radii in a3921-a and a3921-b might be an effectof the ongoing cluster merger: shocks in the icm might give raise to enhancedram pressure stripping and at least in part be the cause for the quenching ofstar formation. these quenched spirals might be an interm. stage in themorphological transformation of field spirals into cluster s0s.

1309.6094	cosmological simulations in mond: the cluster scale halo mass function  with light sterile neutrinos	we use our modified newtonian dynamics (mond) cosmological particle-meshn-body code to investigate the feasibility of structure formation in aframework involving mond and light sterile neutrinos in the mass range 11 - 300ev: always assuming that \omega_{\nu_s}=0.225 for h_o=72 \kms mpc^{-1}. we runa suite of simulations with variants on the expansion history, cosmologicalvariation of the mond acceleration constant, different normalisations of thepower spectrum of the initial perturbations and interpolating functions. usingvarious box sizes, but typically with ones of length 256 mpc/h, we compare oursimulated halo mass functions with observed cluster mass functions and showthat (i) the sterile neutrino mass must be larger than 30 ev to account for thelow mass (m_{200}&lt;10^{14.6} solar masses) clusters of galaxies in mond and (ii)regardless of sterile neutrino mass or any of the variations we mentionedabove, it is not possible to form the correct number of high mass(m_{200}&gt;10^{15.1} solar masses) clusters of galaxies: there is always aconsiderable over production. this means that the ansatz of considering theweak-field limit of mond together with a component of light sterile neutrinosto form structure from z ~ 200 fails. if mond is the correct description ofweak-field gravitational dynamics, it could mean that subtle effects of theadditional fields in covariant theories of mond render the ansatz inaccurate,or that the gravity generated by light sterile neutrinos (or by similar hotdark matter particles) is different from that generated by the baryons.

(2010) especially when the impact offoreground and background structure is included. the values of r$_{200}$ =$1.22\pm 0.01 h^{-1}$ mpc and m$_{200}$ = $(5.07 \pm 0.09)\times 10^{14}h^{-1}$ m$_\odot$ obtained by application of the caustic technique agree wellwith recent completely independent lensing measures. the caustic estimateextends direct measurement of the cluster mass profile to a radius of $\sim 5h^{-1}$ mpc.

1403.4119	n-body simulations of the carina dsph in mond	the classical dwarf spheroidals (dsphs) provide a critical test for modifiednewtonian dynamics (mond) because they are observable satellite galacticsystems with low internal accelerations and low, but periodically varying,external acceleration. this varying external gravitational field is notcommonly found acting on systems with low internal acceleration. using jeansmodelling, carina in particular has been demonstrated to require a v-bandmass-to-light ratio greater than 5, which is the nominal upper limit for anancient stellar population. we run mond n-body simulations of a carina-likedsph orbiting the milky way to test if dsphs in mond are stable to tidal forcesover the hubble time and if those same tidal forces artificially inflate theirvelocity dispersions and therefore their apparent mass-to-light ratio. we runmany simulations with various initial total masses for carina, andgalactocentric orbits (consistent with proper motions), and compare thesimulation line of sight velocity dispersions (losvds) with the observed losvdsof walker et al. (2007). we find that the dsphs are stable, but that the tidalforces are not conducive to artificially inflating the losvds. furthermore, therange of mass-to-light ratios that best reproduces the observed line of sightvelocity dispersions of carina is 5.3 to 5.7 and circular orbits are preferredto plunging orbits. therefore, some tension still exists between the requiredmass-to-light ratio for the carina dsph in mond and those expected from stellarpopulation synthesis models. it remains to be seen whether a careful treatmentof the binary population or triaxiality might reduce this tension.

0803.1843	wmap5 and the cluster mass function	the recently revised cosmological constraints from the five-year wmap dataameliorate previous tension between cosmological constraints from the microwavebackground and from cluster abundances. we demonstrate that the revisedestimates of cosmological parameters are in excellent agreement with the massfunction of x-ray clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. velocitysegregation between galaxies and the underlying dark matter could cause virialmass estimates to be biased, causing the mass scale of the mass function to beoffset from the true value. modest velocity segregation($\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{dm}$=1.13$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$) is sufficient to match themass function to the five-year wmap results. when the new wmap results arecombined with constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations,there is no need for velocity segregation($\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{dm}$=1.05$\pm$0.05). this result agrees withexpectations for velocity segregation from state-of-the-art numericalsimulations of clusters. together with the improved agreement between the newwmap results and recent cosmic shear measurements, this result demonstratesthat the amplitude of large-scale structure in the nearby universe matches thatpredicted from the structure seen in the microwave background. the newconstraint we place on velocity segregation in clusters indicates that virialmass estimates for clusters are reasonably accurate. this result suggests thatfuture cluster surveys will be able to probe both cosmological parameters andfundamental cluster physics.

1410.3883	comparing dense galaxy cluster redshift surveys with weak lensing maps	we use dense redshift surveys of nine galaxy clusters at $z\sim0.2$ tocompare the galaxy distribution in each system with the projected matterdistribution from weak lensing. by combining 2087 new mmt/hectospec redshiftsand the data in the literature, we construct spectroscopic samples within theregion of weak-lensing maps of high (70--89%) and uniform completeness. withthese dense redshift surveys, we construct galaxy number density maps usingseveral galaxy subsamples. the shape of the main cluster concentration in theweak-lensing maps is similar to the global morphology of the number densitymaps based on cluster members alone, mainly dominated by red members. we crosscorrelate the galaxy number density maps with the weak-lensing maps. the crosscorrelation signal when we include foreground and background galaxies at0.5$z_{\rm cl}&lt;z&lt;2z_{\rm cl}$ is $10-23$% larger than for cluster members aloneat the cluster virial radius. the excess can be as high as 30% depending on thecluster. cross correlating the galaxy number density and weak-lensing mapssuggests that superimposed structures close to the cluster in redshift spacecontribute more significantly to the excess cross correlation signal thanunrelated large-scale structure along the line of sight. interestingly, theweak-lensing mass profiles are not well constrained for the clusters with thelargest cross correlation signal excesses ($&gt;$20% for a383, a689 and a750). thefractional excess in the cross correlation signal including foreground andbackground structures could be a useful proxy for assessing the reliability ofweak-lensing cluster mass estimates.

1412.3996	galaxy evolution in the mid-infrared green valley: a case of the a2199  supercluster	we study the mid-infrared (mir) properties of the galaxies in the a2199supercluster at z = 0.03 to understand the star formation activity of galaxygroups and clusters in the supercluster environment. using the wide-fieldinfrared survey explorer data, we find no dependence of mass-normalizedintegrated sfrs of galaxy groups/clusters on their virial masses. we classifythe supercluster galaxies into three classes in the mir color-luminositydiagram: mir blue cloud (massive, quiescent and mostly early-type), mirstar-forming sequence (mostly late-type), and mir green valley galaxies. thesemir green valley galaxies are distinguishable from the optical green valleygalaxies, in the sense that they belong to the optical red sequence. we findthat the fraction of each mir class does not depend on virial mass of eachgroup/cluster. we compare the cumulative distributions of surface galaxy numberdensity and cluster/group-centric distance for the three mir classes. mir greenvalley galaxies show the distribution between mir blue cloud and mir sfsequence galaxies. however, if we fix galaxy morphology, early- and late-typemir green valley galaxies show different distributions. our results suggest apossible evolutionary scenario of these galaxies: 1) late-type mir sf sequencegalaxies -&gt; 2) late-type mir green valley galaxies -&gt; 3) early-type mir greenvalley galaxies -&gt; 4) early-type mir blue cloud galaxies. in this sequence,star formation of galaxies is quenched before the galaxies enter the mir greenvalley, and then morphological transformation occurs in the mir green valley.

1503.08823	identification of galaxy cluster substructures with the caustic method	we investigate the power of the caustic technique for identifyingsubstructures of galaxy clusters from optical redshift data alone. the caustictechnique is designed to estimate the mass profile of galaxy clusters to radiiwell beyond the virial radius, where dynamical equilibrium does not hold. twoby-products of this technique are the identification of the cluster members andthe identification of the cluster substructures. we test the caustic techniqueas a substructure detector on two samples of 150 mock redshift surveys ofclusters; the clusters are extracted from a large cosmological $n$-bodysimulation of a $\lambda$cdm model and have masses of $m_{200} \sim 10^{14}h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ and $m_{200} \sim 10^{15} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ in the twosamples. we limit our analysis to substructures identified in the simulationwith masses larger than $10^{13} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$. with mock redshift surveyswith 200 galaxies within $3r_{200}$, (1) the caustic technique recovers $\sim30-50$\% of the real substructures, and (2) $\sim 15-20$\% of the substructuresidentified by the caustic technique correspond to real substructures of thecentral cluster, the remaining fraction being low-mass substructures, groups orsubstructures of clusters in the surrounding region, or chance alignments ofunrelated galaxies. these encouraging results show that the caustic techniqueis a promising approach for investigating the complex dynamics of galaxyclusters.

1505.05522	mass models of disk galaxies from the diskmass survey in mond	this article explores the agreement between the predictions of modifiednewtonian dynamics (mond) and the rotation curves and stellar velocitydispersion profiles measured by the diskmass survey. a bulge-disk decompositionwas made for each of the thirty published galaxies, and a mond poisson solverwas used to simultaneously compute, from the baryonic mass distributions, modelrotation curves and vertical velocity dispersion profiles, which were comparedto the measured values. the two main free parameters, the stellar disk'smass-to-light ratio ($m/l$) and its exponential scale-height ($h_z$), wereestimated by markov chain monte carlo modelling. the average best-fit k-bandstellar mass-to-light ratio was $m/l \simeq 0.55 \pm 0.15$. however, to matchthe diskmass survey data, the vertical scale-heights would have to be in therange $h_z=200$ to $400$ pc which is a factor of two lower than those derivedfrom observations of edge-on galaxies with a similar scale-length. the reasonis that modified gravity versions of mond characteristically require a larger$m/l$ to fit the rotation curve in the absence of dark matter and thereforepredict a stronger vertical gravitational field than newtonian models. it wasfound that changing the mond acceleration parameter, the shape of the velocitydispersion ellipsoid, the adopted vertical distribution of stars, as well asthe galaxy inclination, within any realistic range, all had little impact onthese results.

astro-ph;0005485	the spatial and kinematic distributions of cluster galaxies in a lcdm  universe -- comparison with observations	we combine dissipationless n-body simulations and semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation to study the spatial and kinematic distributions of clustergalaxies in a lcdm cosmology. we investigate how the star formation rates,colours and morphologies of galaxies vary as a function of distance from thecluster centre and compare our results with the cnoc1 survey of galaxies from15 x-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.18 to 0.55. in our model,gas no longer cools onto galaxies after they fall into the cluster and theirstar formation rates decline on timescales of 1-2 gyr. galaxies in clustercores have lower star formation rates and redder colours than galaxies in theouter regions because they were accreted earlier. our colour and star formationgradients agree with those those derived from the data. the difference invelocity dispersions between red and blue galaxies observed in the cnoc1clusters is also well reproduced by the model. we assume that the morphologiesof cluster galaxies are determined solely by their merging histories.morphology gradients in clusters arise naturally, with the fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies highest in cluster cores. we compare these gradients withthe cnoc1 data and find excellent agreement for bulge-dominated galaxies. thesimulated clusters contain too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-diskratio, suggesting that additional processes may influence the morphologicalevolution of disk-dominated galaxies in clusters. although the properties ofthe cluster galaxies in our model agree extremely well with the data, the sameis not true of field galaxies. both the star formation rates and the colours ofbright field galaxies appear to evolve much more strongly from redshift 0.2 to0.4 in the cnoc1 field sample than in our simulations.

astro-ph;0009166	peculiar velocities of galaxies and clusters	we present a simple model for the shape of the distribution function ofgalaxy peculiar velocities. we show how both nonlinear and linear theory termscombine to produce a distribution which has an approximately gaussian core withexponential wings. the model is easily extended to study how the statisticdepends on the type of particle used to trace the velocity field (dark matterparticles, dark matter haloes, galaxies), and on the density of the environmentin which the test particles are. comparisons with simulations suggest that ourmodel is accurate. we also show that the evolution of the peculiar velocitiesdepends on the local, rather than the global density. since clusters populatedenser regions on average, using cluster velocities with the linear theoryscaling may lead to an overestimate of the global value of omega. conversely,using linear theory with the global value of omega to scale cluster velocitiesfrom the initial to the present time results in an underestimate of their truevelocities. in general, however, the directions of motions of haloes are ratherwell described by linear theory. our results help to simplify models ofredshift-space distortions considerably.

astro-ph;0009167	linear and nonlinear contributions to pairwise peculiar velocities	we write the correlation function of dark matter particles, xi(r), as the sumof two terms - one which accounts for nonlinear evolution, and dominates onsmall scales, and another which is essentially the term from linear theory, anddominates on large scales. we use models of the number and spatial distributionof haloes and halo density profiles to describe the nonlinear term and itsevolution. the result provides a good description of the evolution of xi(r) insimulations. we then use this decomposition to provide simple and accuratemodels of how the single particle velocity dispersion evolves with time, andhow the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution dependon scale. the key idea is to use the simple physics of linear theory on largescales, the simple physics of the virial theorem on small scales, and our modelfor the correlation function to tell us how to weight the two types ofcontributions (linear and nonlinear) to the pairwise velocity statistics. whenincorporated into the streaming model, our results will allow a simple accuratedescription of redshift-space distortions over the entire range of linear tohighly nonlinear regimes.

astro-ph;0104332	non-gaussian cmb temperature fluctuations from peculiar velocities of  clusters	we use numerical simulations of a (480 mpc/h)^3 volume to show that thedistribution of peak heights in maps of the temperature fluctuations from thekinematic and thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effects will be highly non-gaussian,and very different from the peak height distribution of a gaussian randomfield. we then show that it is a good approximation to assume that each peak ineither sz effect is associated with one and only one dark matter halo. thisallows us to use our knowledge of the properties of haloes to estimate the peakheight distributions. at fixed optical depth, the distribution of peak heightsdue to the kinematic effect is gaussian, with a width which is approximatelyproportional to optical depth; the non-gaussianity comes from summing over arange of optical depths. the optical depth is an increasing function of halomass, and the distribution of halo speeds is gaussian, with a dispersion whichis approximately independent of halo mass. this means that observations of thekinematic effect can be used to put constraints on how the abundance of massiveclusters evolves, and on the evolution of cluster velocities. thenon-gaussianity of the thermal effect, on the other hand, comes primarily fromthe fact that, on average, the effect is larger in more massive haloes, and thedistribution of halo masses is highly non-gaussian. we also show that becausehaloes of the same mass may have a range of density and velocity dispersionprofiles, the relation between halo mass and the amplitude of the thermaleffect is not deterministic, but has some scatter.

astro-ph;0606545	the virial mass function of nearby sdss galaxy clusters	we present a new determination of the cluster mass function and velocitydispersion function in a volume $\sim10^7 h^3$mpc$^{-3}$ using the fourth datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we use the caustic technique toremove foreground and background galaxies. the cluster virial mass functionagrees well with recent estimates from both x-ray observations and clusterrichnesses. the mass function lies between those predicted by the first-yearand three-year wmap data. we constrain the cosmological parameters $\omega_m$and $\sigma_8$ and find good agreement with wmap and constraints from othertechniques. with the cirs mass function alone, we estimate$\omega_m=0.24^{+0.14}_{-0.09}$ and $\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, or$\sigma_8=0.84\pm$0.03 when holding $\omega_m=0.3$ fixed. we also use the wmapparameters as priors and constrain velocity segregation in clusters. using thefirst and third-year results, we infer velocity segregation of$\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{dm}\approx0.94\pm$0.05 or 1.28$\pm$0.06 respectively. wecompare the velocity dispersion function of clusters to that of early-typegalaxies and conclude that clusters comprise the high-velocity end of thevelocity dispersion function of dark matter haloes. the evolution of clusterabundances provides constraints on dark energy models; the mass functionpresented here offers an important low redshift calibration benchmark.

astro-ph;9602086	galaxy pairwise velocity distributions on non-linear scales	the redshift-space correlation function $\xi_s$ for projected galaxyseparations $\simless 1h^{-1}$ mpc can be expressed as the convolution of thereal-space correlation function with the galaxy pairwise velocity distributionfunction (pvdf). an exponential pvdf yields the best fit to the $\xi_s$measured from galaxy samples of different redshift surveys. we show that thisexponential pvdf is not merely a fitting function but arises from well definedgravitational processes. two ingredients conspire to yield a pvdf with a nearlyexponential shape: (i) the number density $n(\sigma)$ of systems with velocitydispersion $\sigma$; (ii) the unrelaxed dynamical state of most galaxy systems.the former ingredient determines the exponential tail and the latter thecentral peak of the pvdf. we compare the $\xi_s$ measured on non-linear scalesfrom galaxy samples of the cfa redshift surveys with different models of thepvdf convolved with the measured real-space correlation function. thispreliminary comparison indicates that the agreement between model andobservations depends strongly on both the underlying cosmological model and theinternal dynamics of galaxy systems. neither parameter dominates. moreover, theagreement depends sensitively on the accuracy of the galaxy position andvelocity measurements.

astro-ph;9701034	infall regions of galaxy clusters	in hierarchical clustering, galaxy clusters accrete mass through theaggregation of smaller systems. thus, the velocity field of the infall regionsof clusters contains significant random motion superimposed on radial infall.because the purely spherical infall model does not predict the amplitude of thevelocity field correctly, methods estimating the cosmological density parameteromega_0 based on this model yield unreliable biased results. in fact, theamplitude of the velocity field depends on local dynamics and only very weaklyon the global properties of the universe. we use n-body simulations of flat andopen universes to show that the amplitude of the velocity field of the infallregions of dark matter halos is a direct measure of the escape velocity withinthese regions. we can use this amplitude to estimate the mass of dark matterhalos within a few megaparsecs from the halo center. in this region dynamicalequilibrium assumptions do not hold. the method yields a mass estimate withbetter than 30% accuracy. if galaxies trace the velocity field of the infallregions of clusters reliably, this method provides a straightforward way toestimate the amount of mass surrounding rich galaxy clusters from redshift dataalone.

astro-ph;9712222	survival of substructure within dark matter haloes	using high resolution cosmological n-body simulations, we investigate thesurvival of dark matter satellites falling into larger haloes. satellitespreserve their identity for some time after merging. we compute their loss ofmass, energy and angular momentum as dynamical friction, tidal forces andcollisions with other satellites dissolve them. we also analyse the evolutionof their internal structure. satellites with less than a few per cent the massof the main halo may survive for several billion years, whereas largersatellites rapidly sink into the center of the main halo potential well andlose their identity. penetrating encounters between satellites are frequent andmay lead to significant mass loss and disruption. only a minor fraction ofcluster mass (10 per cent on average) is bound to substructure at mostredshifts of interest. we discuss the application of these results to thesurvival and extent of dark matter haloes associated with cluster galaxies, andto interactions between galaxies in clusters. we find that 35-40 per cent ofgalaxy dark matter haloes are disrupted by the present time. the fraction ofsatellites undergoing close encounters is similar to the fraction ofinteracting or merging galaxies in clusters at moderate redshift.

astro-ph;9805283	clustering of galaxies in a hierarchical universe: i. methods and  results at z=0	we introduce a new technique for following the formation and evolution ofgalaxies in cosmological n-body simulations. dissipationless simulations areused to track the formation and merging of dark matter halos as a function ofredshift. simple prescriptions, taken directly from semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation, are adopted for cooling, star formation, supernova feedbackand the merging of galaxies within the halos. this scheme enables us to studythe clustering properties of galaxies and to investigate how selection by type,colour or luminosity influences the results. in this paper, we study propertiesof the galaxy distribution at z=0. these include luminosity functions, colours,correlation functions, pairwise peculiar velocities, cluster m/l ratios andstar formation rates. we focus on two variants of a cdm cosmology: a high-density model with gamma=0.21 (tcdm) and a low-density model with omega=0.3 andlambda=0.7 (lcdm). both are normalized to reproduce the i-band tully-fisherrelation near a circular velocity of 220 km/s. our results depend strongly bothon this normalization and on the prescriptions for star formation and feedback.very different assumptions are required to obtain an acceptable model in thetwo cases. for tcdm, efficient feedback is required to suppress the growth ofgalaxies low-mass field halos. without it, there are too many galaxies and thecorrelation function turns over below 1 mpc. for lcdm, feedback must be weak,otherwise too few l* galaxies are produced and the correlation function is toosteep. given the uncertainties in modelling some of the key physical processes,we conclude that it is not yet possible to draw conclusions about the values ofcosmological parameters from studies of this kind. further work on global starformation and feedback effects is required to narrow the range of possibilities

astro-ph;9809168	clustering of galaxies in a hierarchical universe: ii. evolution to high  redshift	in hierarchical cosmologies the evolution of galaxy clustering depends bothon cosmological quantities such as omega and lambda, which determine how darkmatter halos form and evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, starformation and feedback - which drive the formation of galaxies within thesemerging halos. in this paper, we combine dissipationless cosmological n-bodysimulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to study howthese two aspects interact. we focus on the differences in clustering predictedfor galaxies of differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formationrate and on what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formationprocess. we show that a "dip" in the amplitude of galaxy correlations betweenz=0 and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. such a dip occurs in low-densitycdm models because structure forms early and dark matter halos of 10**12 solarmasses, containing galaxies with luminosities around l*, are unbiased tracersof the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude thenevolves similarly to that of the dark matter. at higher redshifts brightgalaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again.in high density models, structure forms late and bias evolves more rapidly. asa result, the clustering amplitude of l* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to1. the strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. the dip isweaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higherluminosities and earlier morphological types. we explain why this is the caseand how it is related to the variation with redshift of the abundance and andenvironment of the observed galaxies. studies of clustering evolution as afunction of galaxy properties should place strong constraints on models.

astro-ph;9812009	clustering of galaxies in a hierarchical universe: iii. mock redshift  surveys	this is the third paper in a series which combines n-body simulations andsemi-analytic modelling to provide a fully spatially resolved simulation of thegalaxy formation and clustering processes. here we extract mock redshiftsurveys from our simulations: a cold dark matter model with either omega_0=1(taucdm) or omega_0=0.3 and lambda=0.7 (lambdacdm). we compare the mockcatalogues with the northern region (cfa2n) of the center for astrophysics(cfa) redshift surveys. we study the properties of galaxy groups and clustersidentified using standard observational techniques and we study the relation ofthese groups to real virialised systems. most features of cfa2n groups arereproduced quite well by both models with no obvious dependence on omega_0.redshift space correlations and pairwise velocities are also similar in the twocosmologies. the luminosity functions predicted by our galaxy formation modelsdepend sensitively on the treatment of star formation and feedback. for theparticular choices of paper i they agree poorly with the cfa survey. to isolatethe effect of this discrepancy on our mock redshift surveys, we modify galaxyluminosities in our simulations to reproduce the cfa luminosity functionexactly. this adjustment improves agreement with the observed abundance ofgroups, which depends primarily on the galaxy luminosity density, but otherstatistics, connected more closely with the underlying mass distribution,remain unaffected. regardless of the luminosity function adopted, modestdifferences with observation remain. these can be attributed to the presence ofthe ``great wall'' in the cfa2n. it is unclear whether the greater coherence ofthe real structure is a result of cosmic variance, given the relatively smallregion studied, or reflects a physical deficiency of the models.

astro-ph;9910228	topology and geometry of the cfa2 redshift survey	we analyse the redshift space topology and geometry of the nearby universe bycomputing the minkowski functionals of the updated zwicky catalogue (uzc). theuzc contains the redshifts of almost 20,000 galaxies, is 96% complete to thelimiting magnitude m_zw=15.5 and includes the center for astrophysics (cfa)redshift survey (cfa2). from the uzc we can extract volume limited samplesreaching a depth of 70 hmpc before sparse sampling dominates. we quantify theshape of the large-scale galaxy distribution by deriving measures of planarityand filamentarity from the minkowski functionals. the nearby universe shows alarge degree of planarity and a small degree of filamentarity. this quantifiesthe sheet-like structure of the great wall which dominates the northern region(cfa2n) of the uzc. we compare these results with redshift space mockcatalogues constructed from high resolution n-body simulations of two cold darkmatter models with either a decaying massive neutrino (taucdm) or a non-zerocosmological constant (lambdacdm). we use semi-analytic modelling to form andevolve galaxies in these dark matter-only simulations. we are thus able, forthe first time, to compile redshift space mock catalogues which containgalaxies, along with their observable properties, rather than dark matterparticles alone. in both models the large scale galaxy distribution is lesscoherent than the observed distribution, especially with regard to the largedegree of planarity of the real survey. however, given the small volume of theregion studied, this disagreement can still be a result of cosmic variance.

0809.4015	infall regions and scaling relations of x-ray selected groups	we use the fifth data release of the sloan digital sky survey to studyx-ray-selected galaxy groups and compare their properties to clusters. wesearch for infall patterns around the groups and use these to measure groupmass profiles to large radii. in previous work, we analyzed infall patterns foran x-ray-selected sample of 72 clusters from the rosat all-sky survey. here, weextend this approach to a sample of systems with smaller x-ray fluxes selectedfrom the 400 square degree serendipitous survey of clusters and groups in rosatpointed observations. we identify 16 groups with sdss dr5 spectroscopy, searchfor infall patterns, and compute mass profiles out to 2-6 mpc from the groupcenters with the caustic technique. no other mass estimation methods arecurrently available at such large radii for these low-mass groups, because thevirial estimate requires dynamical equilibrium and the gravitational lensingsignal is too weak. despite the small masses of these groups, most displayrecognizable infall patterns. we use caustic and virial mass estimates tomeasure the scaling relations between different observables, extending theserelations to smaller fluxes and luminosities than many previous surveys. closeinspection reveals that three of the groups are subclusters in the outskirts oflarger clusters. a fourth group is apparently undergoing a group-group merger.these four merging groups represent the most extreme outliers in the scalingrelations. excluding these groups, we find $l_x\propto\sigma_p^{3.4\pm1.6}$,consistent with previous determinations for both clusters and groups.understanding cluster and group scaling relations is crucial for measuringcosmological parameters from clusters.

astro-ph;9912117	large scale motions in superclusters: their imprint in the cmb	we identify high density regions of supercluster size in high resolutionn-body simulations of a representative volume of three cold dark matteruniverses. by assuming that (1) the density and peculiar velocities of baryonstrace those of the dark matter, and (2) the temperature of plasma isproportional to the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles in regionswhere the crossing times is smaller than the supercluster free-fall time, weinvestigate how thermal motions of electrons in the intra-cluster medium andpeculiar velocity of clusters can affect the secondary anisotropies in thecosmic microwave background (cmb). we show that the thermal effect dominatesthe kinematic effect and that the largest thermal decrements are associatedwith the most massive clusters in superclusters. thus, searching for thepresence of two or more close large cmb decrements represents a viable strategyfor identifying superclusters at cosmological distances. moreover, maps of thekinematic effect in superclusters are characterized by neighboring large peaksof opposite signs. these peaks can be as high as ~ 10 microk at the arcminuteangular resolution. simultaneous pointed observations of superclusters in themillimeter and submillimeter bands with upcoming sensitive cmb experiments canseparate between the thermal and kinematic effect contributions and constrainthe evolution of the velocity field in large overdense regions.
