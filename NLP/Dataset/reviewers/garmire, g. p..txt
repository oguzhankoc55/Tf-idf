0904.2460	modeling mm- to x-ray flare emission from sgra*	we report on new modeling results based on the mm- to x-ray emission of thesgra* counterpart associated with the massive black hole at the galacticcenter. our modeling is based on simultaneous observations carried out on 07july, 2004, using the eso naco adaptive optics instrument and the acis-iinstrument aboard the chandra x-ray observatory as well as the sma and the vla.the observations revealed several flare events in all wavelength domains. herewe show that a combined synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model followed by anadiabatic expansion of the source components can fully account for the observedflare flux densities and delay times covering the spectral range from the x-rayto the mm-radio domain. the derived physical quantities that describe the flareemission give a blob expansion speed of v{exp}=0.005c, magnetic field of &lt; 60gand spectral indices of 0.8 to 1.4. the derived model parameters suggest thatthe adiabatic expansion takes place in source components that have a bulkmotion larger than v{exp} or the expanding material contributes to a corona ordisk, confined to the immediate surroundings of sgra*.

0906.4153	discrepant mass estimates in the cluster of galaxies abell 1689	we present a new mass estimate of a well-studied gravitational lensingcluster, abell 1689, from deep chandra observations with a total exposure of200 ks. within r=200 h-1 kpc, the x-ray mass estimate is systematically lowerthan that of lensing by 30-50%. at r&gt;200 h-1 kpc, the mass density profilesfrom x-ray and weak lensing methods give consistent results. the most recentweak lensing work suggest a steeper profile than what is found from the x-rayanalysis, while still in agreement with the mass at large radii. previousstudies have suggested that cooler small-scale structures can bias x-raytemperature measurements or that the northern part of the cluster is disturbed.we find these scenarios unlikely to resolve the central mass discrepancy sincethe former requires 70-90% of the space to be occupied by these cool structuresand excluding the northern substructure does not significantly affect the totalmass profiles. a more plausible explanation is a projection effect. we alsofind that the previously reported high hard-band to broad-band temperatureratio in a1689, and many other clusters observed with chandra, may be resultingfrom the instrumental absorption that decreases 10-15% of the effective area at~1.75 kev.

0907.2251	a chandra survey of the x-ray properties of broad absorption line  radio-loud quasars	this work presents the results of a chandra study of 21 broad absorption line(bal) radio-loud quasars (rlqs). we conducted a chandra snapshot survey of 12bright bal rlqs selected from sdss/first data and possessing a wide range ofradio and civ absorption properties. optical spectra were obtained nearlycontemporaneously with the hobby-eberly telescope; no strong flux or balvariability was seen between epochs. we also include in our sample 9 additionalbal rlqs possessing archival chandra coverage. we compare the properties of(predominantly high-ionization) bal rlqs to those of non-bal rlqs as well as tobal radio-quiet quasars (rqqs) and non-bal rqqs for context.  all 12 snapshot and 8/9 archival bal rlqs are detected, with observed x-rayluminosities less than those of non-bal rlqs having comparable optical/uvluminosities by typical factors of 4.1-8.5. (bal rlqs are also x-ray weak bytypical factors of 2.0-4.5 relative to non-bal rlqs having both comparableoptical/uv and radio luminosities.) however, bal rlqs are not as x-ray weakrelative to non-bal rlqs as are bal rqqs relative to non-bal rqqs. while somebal rlqs have harder x-ray spectra than typical non-bal rlqs, some havehardness ratios consistent with those of non-bal rlqs, and there does notappear to be a correlation between x-ray weakness and spectral hardness, incontrast to the situation for bal rqqs. rlqs are expected to have x-raycontinuum contributions from both disk-corona and small-scale jet emission.while the entire x-ray continuum in bal rlqs cannot be obscured to the samedegree as in bal rqqs, we calculate that the jet is likely partially covered inmany bal rlqs. we comment briefly on implications for geometries and sourceages in bal rlqs.

0910.0021	confirmation of and variable energy injection by a near-relativistic  outflow in apm 08279+5255	we present results from multi-epoch spectral analysis of xmm-newton andchandra observations of the broad absorption line (bal) quasar apm 08279+5255.our analysis shows significant x-ray bals in all epochs with rest-frameenergies lying in the range of ~ 6.7-18 kev. the x-ray bals and 0.2-10 kevcontinuum show significant variability on timescales as short as 3.3 days(proper time) implying a source size-scale of ~ 10 r_g, where r_g is thegravitational radius. we find a large gradient in the outflow velocity of thex-ray absorbers with projected outflow velocities of up to 0.76 c. the maximumoutflow velocity constrains the angle between the wind velocity and our line ofsight to be less than ~ 22 degrees. we identify the following components of theoutflow: (a) highly ionized x-ray absorbing material (2.9 &lt; logxi &lt; 3.9) and acolumn density of log n_h ~ 23 outflowing at velocities of up to 0.76 c. (b)low-ionization x-ray absorbing gas with log n_h ~ 22.8. we find that flatterspectra appear to result in lower outflow velocities. based on our spectralanalysis of observations of apm 08279+5255 over a period of 1.2 years (propertime) we estimate the mass-outflow rate and efficiency of the outflow to havevaried between 16(-8,+12) m_solar yr^-1 and 64(-40,+66) m_solar yr^-1 and0.18(-0.11,+0.15) to 1.7(-1.2+1.9), respectively. assuming that the outflowproperties of apm 08279+5255 are a common property of most quasars at similarredshifts, our results then imply that quasar winds are massive and energeticenough to influence significantly the formation of the host galaxy, providesignificant metal enrichment to the interstellar medium and intergalacticmedium, and are a viable mechanism for feedback at redshifts near the peak inthe number density of galaxy mergers.

0704.2079	x-ray emission from the planet pulsar b1257+12	we report the detection of the millisecond pulsar b1257+12 with the chandrax-ray observatory. in a 20 ks exposure we detected 25 photons from the pulsar,with energies between 0.4 and 2.0 kev, corresponding to the flux f_x=(4.4+/-0.9)*10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in this energy range. the x-ray spectrum canbe described by a power-law model with photon index gamma = 2.8 and luminosityl_x \approx 2.5*10^{29} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.3--8 kev band, for a plausibledistance of 500 pc and hydrogen column density n_h=3*10^{20} cm^{-2}.alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with kt ~ 0.22kev and projected emitting area ~2000 m^2. if the thermal x-rays are emittedfrom two symmetric polar caps, the bolometric luminosity of the two caps is 2l_bol ~ 3*10^{29} ergs s^{-1}. we compared our results with the data on other30 millisecond pulsars observed in x-rays and found that the apparent x-rayefficiency of psr b1257+12, l_x/edot ~ 3*10^{-5} for d=500 pc, is lower thanthose of most of millisecond pulsars. this might be explained by an unfavorableorientation of the x-ray pulsar beam if the radiation is magnetospheric, or bystrong asymmetry of polar caps if the radiation is thermal (e.g., one of thepolar caps is much brighter than the other and remains invisible for most partof the pulsar period). alternatively, it could be attributed to absorption ofx-rays in circumpulsar matter, such as a flaring debris disk left over afterformation of the planetary system around the pulsar.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

0712.2877	an x-ray, ir, and submillimeter flare of sagittarius a*	energetic flares are observed in the galactic supermassive black holesagittarius a* from radio to x-ray wavelengths. on a few occasions,simultaneous flares have been detected in ir and x-ray observations, but clearcounterparts at longer wavelengths have not been seen. we present a flareobserved over several hours on 2006 july 17 with the chandra x-ray observatory,the keck ii telescope, the caltech submillimeter observatory, and thesubmillimeter array. all telescopes observed strong flare events, but thesubmillimeter peak is found to occur nearly 100 minutes after the x-ray peak.submillimeter polarization data show linear polarization in the excess flareemission, increasing from 9% to 17% as the flare passes through its peak,consistent with a transition from optically thick to thin synchrotron emission.the temporal and spectral behavior of the flare require that the energeticelectrons responsible for the emission cool faster than expected from theirradiative output. this is consistent with adiabatic cooling in an expandingemission region, with x-rays produced through self-compton scattering, althoughnot consistent with the simplest model of such expansion. we also present asubmillimeter flare that followed a bright ir flare on 2005 july 31. comparedto 2006, this event had a larger peak ir flux and similar submillimeter flux,but it lacked measurable x-ray emission. it also showed a shorter delay betweenthe ir and submillimeter peaks. based on these events we propose a synchrotronand self-compton model to relate the submillimeter lag and the variableir/x-ray luminosity ratio.

0712.3165	polarized nir and x-ray flares from sgra*	stellar dynamics indicate the presence of a super massive 3-4x10^6 msun solmblack hole at the galactic center. it is associated with the variable radio,near-infrared, and x-ray counterpart sagittarius a* (sgra*). the goal is theinvestigation and understanding of the physical processes responsible for thevariable emission from sgra*. the observations have been carried out using thenaco adaptive optics (ao) instrument at the european southern observatory'svery large telescope (july 2005, may 2007) and the acis-i instrument aboard thechandra x-ray observatory (july 2005). we find that for the july 2005 flare thevariable and polarized nir emission of sgra* occurred synchronous with amoderately bright flare event in the x-ray domain with an excess 2 - 8 kevluminosity of about 8x10^33erg/s. we find no time lag between the flare eventsin the two wavelength bands with a lower limit of less than 10 minutes. the may2007 flare shows the highest sub-flare to flare contrast observed until now. itprovides evidence for a variation in the profile of consecutive sub-flares. weconfirm that highly variable and nir polarized flare emission is non-thermaland that there exists a class of synchronous nir/x-ray flares. we find that theflaring state can be explained via the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) processinvolving up-scattered sub-millimeter photons from a compact source component.the observations can be interpreted in a model involving a temporary disk witha short jet. in the disk component the flux density variations can be explaineddue to spots on relativistic orbits around the central super massive black hole(smbh). the profile variations for the may 2007 flare are interpreted as avariation of the spot structure due to differential rotation within the disk.

(2) most(86%) x-ray sources with optical or infrared identifications are clustermembers in comparison with a control field in the galactic plane. (3) a looseconstraint (2--5 kpc) for the distance to rcw49 is derived from the mean x-rayluminosity of t tauri stars. (4) the cluster x-ray population consists oflow-mass pre--main-sequence and early-type stars as obtained from x-ray and nirphotometry. about 30 new ob star candidates are identified.

astro-ph;0009380	peculiar extended x-ray emission around the "radio-loud" black hole  candidate 1e1740.7-2942	we present the discovery of peculiar extended x-ray emission around1e1740.7-2942, a black hole candidate that is known to produce prominent,persistent radio jets. the data was obtained with the high-energy transmissiongrating spectrometer (hetgs) aboard the chandra x-ray observatory. thezeroth-order image reveals an elongated feature about 3" in length that isroughly perpendicular to the radio lobes (or jets). the feature is roughlysymmetric about the point source. it is spatially resolved in the longdirection but not in the short direction.  the position of 1e1740.7-2942 was determined with a statistical accuracy of\~0.06" in the right ascension and ~0.04" in the declination, thanks tochandra's unprecedented spatial resolution. it is about 0.6" from the radioposition but the difference is well within the uncertainty in the absoluteaspect solutions of the observation. the dispersed hetgs spectra of1e1740.7-2942 show evidence for the presence of weak, narrow emission lines,although the statistics are quite limited. we discuss possible origins of theextended emission and the implications of the emission lines.

astro-ph;0010355	x-ray imaging of the seyfert 2 galaxy circinus with chandra	we present results from the zeroth-order imaging of a chandra hetgsobservation of the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy circinus. twelve x-ray sources weredetected in the acis-s image of the galaxy, embedded in diffuse x-ray emission.the latter shows a prominent (~18arcsec) soft ``plume'' in the n-w direction,coincident with the [oiii] ionization cone. the radial profiles of thebrightest x-ray source at various energies are consistent with an unresolved(fwhm ~0.8arcsec) component, which we identify as the active nucleus, plus twoextended components with fwhms ~ 2.3arcsec and 18arcsec, respectively. in aradius of 3arcsec, the nucleus contributes roughly the same flux as theextended components at the softest energies (&lt; 2 kev). however, at harderenergies (&gt; 2 kev), the contribution of the nucleus is dominant. thezeroth-order acis spectrum of the nucleus exhibits emission lines at both softand hard x-rays, including a prominent fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev, showing thatmost of the x-ray lines previously detected with asca originate in a compactregion (&lt;15 pc). based on its x-ray spectrum, we argue that the 2.3arcsecextended component is scattered nuclear radiation from nearby ionized gas. thelarge-scale extended component includes the emission from the n-w plume andpossibly from the outer starburst ring.

astro-ph;0010356	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the seyfert 2 galaxy circinus with  chandra	results from a 60 ks chandra hetgs observation of the nearby seyfert 2circinus are presented. the spectrum shows a wealth of emission lines at bothsoft and hard x-rays, including lines of ne, mg, si, s, ar, ca, and fe, and aprominent fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev. we identify several of the he-likecomponents and measure several of the lyman lines of the h-like ions. thelines' profiles are unresolved at the limited signal-to-noise ratio of thedata. our analysis of the zeroth-order image in a companion paper constrainsthe size of the emission region to be 20-60 pc, suggesting that emission withinthis volume is almost entirely due to the reprocessing of the obscured centralsource. here we show that a model containing two distinct components canreproduce almost all the observed properties of this gas. the ionized componentcan explain the observed intensities of the ionized species, assumingtwice-solar composition and an n \propto r^{-1.5} density distribution. theneutral component is highly concentrated, well within the 0.8arcsec pointsource, and is responsible for almost all of the observed kalpha (6.4 kev)emission. circinus seems to be different than mkn~3 in terms of its gasdistribution.

(2000) are detected in x-rays; these fourare among our hardest chandra sources, and we argue that they containmoderately luminous obscured agn. overall, however, the small chandra detectionfraction suggests a relatively small agn content in the optically selected veryred object population.

astro-ph;0104035	a chandra study of the circinus galaxy point-source population	we have used the chandra x-ray observatory to resolve spatially andspectrally the x-ray emission from the circinus galaxy. we report here on thenature of the x-ray emission from the off-nuclear point sources associated withthe disk of circinus. we find that many of the serendipitous x-ray sources areconcentrated along the optical disk of the galaxy, but few have opticalcounterparts within 1" of their x-ray positions down to v=23-25. at 3.8 mpc,their intrinsic 0.5-10 kev luminosities range from approx. 2e37 erg/s to 4e39erg/s. one quarter of the sources are variable over the duration of the 67 ksobservation, and spectral fitting of these off-nuclear sources shows a diverserange of spectral properties. the properties of the two strongest off-nuclearsources are remarkable, with average x-ray luminosities of 3.7e39 erg/s and3.4e39 erg/s. the former displays large and periodic flux variations every 7.5hr and is well fit by a multicolor blackbody accretion-disk model witht_in=1.35 kev, properties consistent with an eclipsing &gt;50 m_sun black-holebinary. the latter appears to be a young supernova remnant, as it coincideswith a non-thermal radio counterpart and an h\alpha-detected hii region. thissource exhibits both long-term (approx. 4 yr) x-ray variability and a 6.67-6.97kev iron emission-line blend with a 1.6 kev equivalent width. these two objectsfurther support the notion that super-eddington x-ray sources in nearbygalaxies can be explained by a mixture of intermediate-mass black holes inx-ray binaries and young supernova remnants.

astro-ph;0112002	the chandra deep field north survey. ix. extended x-ray sources	the ~1 ms chandra deep field north observation is used to study the extendedx-ray sources in the region surrounding the hubble deep field north (hdf-n),yielding the most sensitive probe of extended x-ray emission at cosmologicaldistances to date. a total of six such sources are detected, the majority ofwhich align with small numbers of optically bright galaxies. their angularsizes, band ratios, and x-ray luminosities -- assuming they lie at the samedistances as the galaxies coincident with the x-ray emission -- are generallyconsistent with the properties found for nearby groups of galaxies. one sourceis notably different and is likely to be a poor-to-moderate x-ray cluster athigh redshift (i.e., z &gt; 0.7). we are also able to place strong constraints onthe optically detected cluster of galaxies clg 1236+6215 at z=0.85 and thewide-angle-tail radio galaxy vla j123725.7+621128 at z~1-2. with rest-frame0.5--2.0 kev x-ray luminosities of &lt;(3-15)e42 ergs s^{-1}, the environments ofboth sources are either likely to have a significant deficit of hotintra-cluster gas compared to local clusters of galaxies, or they are x-raygroups. we find the surface density of extended x-ray sources in thisobservation to be 167 (+97,-67) deg^{-2} at a limiting soft-band flux ofapproximately 3e-16 ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. no evolution in the x-ray luminosityfunction of clusters is needed to explain this value.

astro-ph;0112257	x-raying the ultraluminous infrared starburst galaxy and broad  absorption line qso, markarian 231, with chandra	with 40 ks of chandra acis-s3 exposure, new information on both the starburstand qso components of the x-ray emission of markarian 231, an ultraluminousinfrared galaxy and broad absorption line qso, has been obtained. the bulk ofthe x-ray luminosity is emitted from an unresolved nuclear point source, andthe spectrum is remarkably hard with the majority of the flux emitted above 2kev. most notably, significant nuclear variability (a decrease of ~45% inapproximately 6 hours) at energies above 2 kev indicates that chandra hasprobed within light hours of the central black hole. though we concur withmaloney &amp; reynolds that the direct continuum is not observed, this variabilitycoupled with the 188 ev upper limit on the equivalent width of the fekalphaemission line argues against the reflection-dominated model put forth by theseauthors based on their asca data. instead, we favor a model in which a small,compton-thick absorber blocks the direct x-rays, and only indirect, scatteredx-rays from multiple lines of sight can reach the observer. extended soft,thermal emission encompasses the optical extent of the galaxy and exhibitsresolved structure. an off-nuclear x-ray source with a 0.35-8.0 kev luminosityof l_x=7x10^{39} erg s^{-1}, consistent with the ultraluminous x-ray sources inother nearby starbursts, is detected. we also present an unpublished fosspectrum from the hst archive showing the broad c iv absorption.

astro-ph;0207196	chandra detects relativistic broad absorption lines from apm 08279+5255	we report the discovery of x-ray broad absorption lines (bals) from thebalqso apm 08279+5255 originating from material moving at relativisticvelocities with respect to the central source. the large flux magnification bya factor of ~ 100 provided by the gravitational lens effect combined with thelarge redshift (z = 3.91) of the quasar have facilitated the acquisition of thefirst high signal-to-noise x-ray spectrum of a quasar containing x-ray bals.our analysis of the x-ray spectrum of apm 08279+5255 places the rest-frameenergies of the two observed absorption lines at 8.1 and 9.8 kev. the detectionof each of these lines is significant at the &gt; 99.9% confidence level based onthe f-test. assuming that the absorption lines are from fe xxv kalpha, theimplied bulk velocities of the x-ray bals are ~ 0.2c and ~ 0.4c, respectively.the observed high bulk velocities of the x-ray bals combined with therelatively short recombination time-scales of the x-ray absorbing gas implythat the absorbers responsible for the x-ray bals are located at radii of &lt; 2 x10^(17) cm, within the expected location of the uv absorber. with this impliedgeometry the x-ray gas could provide the necessary shielding to prevent the uvabsorber from being completely ionized by the central x-ray source, consistentwith hydrodynamical simulations of line-driven disk winds. estimatedmass-outflow rates for the gas creating the x-ray bals are typically less thana solar mass per year. our spectral analysis also indicates that the continuumx-ray emission of apm 08279+5255 is consistent with that of a typicalradio-quiet quasar with a spectral slope of gamma = 1.72(-0.05,+0.06).

astro-ph;0207433	the chandra deep field north survey. xii. the link between faint x-ray  and radio source populations	we investigate the relationship between faint x-ray and 1.4 ghz radio sourcepopulations detected within 3' of the hubble deep field north using the 1 mschandra and 40 ujy vla surveys. within this region, we find that ~42% of the 62x-ray sources have radio counterparts and ~71% of the 28 radio sources havex-ray counterparts; thus a 40 ujy vla survey at 1.4 ghz appears to bewell-matched to a 1 ms chandra observation. among the different sourcepopulations sampled, we find that the majority of the 18 x-ray detectedemission-line galaxies (elgs) have radio and mid-infrared isocam counterpartsand appear to be luminous star-forming galaxies at z=0.3-1.3. importantly, theradio-detected elgs make up ~35% of the x-ray source population at 0.5-8.0 kevx-ray fluxes between ~(1-5)x10e-16 erg/cm2/s and signal the emergence of theluminous, high-z starburst galaxy population in the x-ray band. we find thatthe locally-determined correlation between x-ray luminosities and 1.4 ghz radioluminosity densities of the late-type galaxies can easily be extended toinclude the luminous intermediate-redshift elgs, suggesting that the x-ray andradio emission processes are generally associated in star-forming galaxies.this result implies that the x-ray emission can be used as an indicator of starformation rate for star-forming galaxies. finally, we show that there appear tobe two statistically distinct types of isocam-detected star-forming galaxies:those with detectable radio and x-ray emission and those without. the lattertype may have stronger mid-infrared emission-line features that increase theirdetectability at mid-infrared wavelengths.

astro-ph;0210475	x-ray lighthouses of the high-redshift universe. probing the most  luminous z&gt;4 palomar digital sky survey quasars with chandra	we present the results from exploratory chandra observations of nine high-z(z=4.1-4.5) optically selected quasars. these quasars, taken from the dposs,are among the optically most luminous z&gt;4 quasars known (m_b=-28.4 to -30.2).all have been detected by chandra in exposure times of 5-6 ks, tripling thenumber of highly luminous quasars with x-ray detections at z&gt;4. these quasars'average broad-band seds are characterized by steeper aox values(&lt;aox&gt;=-1.81+/-0.03) than those of lower-luminosity, lower-redshift samples ofquasars. we confirm the presence of a significant correlation between the uvmagnitude and soft x-ray flux previously found for z&gt;4 quasars. the joint 2-30kev rest-frame x-ray spectrum of the nine quasars is well parameterized by asimple power-law model with gamma=2.0+/-0.2, consistent with those of lower-zquasars. no evidence for significant amounts of intrinsic absorption has beenfound (n_h&lt;8.8x10^21 cm^-2 at 90% confidence). in general, our results showthat z=4.1-4.5 quasars and local quasars have reasonably similar x-ray andbroad-band spectra (once luminosity effects are taken into account), suggestingthat the accretion mechanisms in these objects are similar. we also presentoptical spectra for these quasars obtained with the het; this is the first timeoptical spectra have been published for seven of these objects. the objectspresented in this paper are among the best z&gt;4 targets for x-ray spectroscopywith xmm-newton and next-generation large-area x-ray telescopes. these willdetect or constrain fek_alpha emission lines down to rest-frame ews of about 50ev and intrinsic column densities down to n_h=a few x 10^21 cm^-2 at z=4. wealso present 45 new rosat upper limits for z&gt;4 quasars and a likely (3sigma)hri detection of the blazar gb 1713+2148 at z=4.01.

astro-ph;0211487	the weak outnumbering the mighty: normal galaxies in deep chandra  surveys	chandra is detecting a significant population of normal and starburstgalaxies in extremely deep x-ray exposures. for example, approximately 15% ofthe sources arising in the 2 ms chandra deep field-north survey are fairlynormal galaxies, where "normal" means "milky way-type" x-ray emission ratherthan simply exhibiting an "optically normal" spectrum. many of these galaxiesare being detected at large look-back times z=0.1-0.5, allowing the study ofthe evolution of x-ray binary populations over significant cosmologicaltimescales. we are also detecting individual off-nuclear ultraluminous x-raysources (e.g., x-ray binaries), providing the first direct constraints on theprevalence of lower-mass black holes at significantly earlier times. the x-rayemission from such "normal" galaxies may also be a useful star-formation rateindicator, based on radio/x-ray cross-identifications. we describe thecontribution of normal galaxies to the populations which make up the x-raybackground and present their directly measured x-ray number counts. we findthat normal and starburst galaxies should dominate the 0.5--2 kev number countsat x-ray fluxes fainter than 7e-18 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} (thus they will outnumberthe "mighty" agn). finally, we look to the future, suggesting that it isimportant that the population of x-ray faint normal and starburst galaxies bewell constrained in order to design the next generation of x-ray observatories.

astro-ph;0301231	the redshift evolution of the 2-8 kev x-ray luminosity function	the high angular resolution and sensitivity of the chandra x-ray observatoryhas yielded large numbers of faint x-ray sources with measured redshifts in thesoft (0.5-2 kev) and hard (2-8 kev) energy bands. many of these sources showfew obvious optical signatures of active galactic nuclei (agn). we use chandraobservations of the hubble deep field north region, a370, and the hawaii surveyfields ssa13 and ssa22, together with the rosat ultra deep survey soft sampleand the asca large sky survey hard sample, to construct rest-frame 2-8 kevluminosity functions versus redshift for all the x-ray sources, regardless oftheir optical agn characteristics. at z=0.1-1 most of the 2-8 kev light densityarises in sources with luminosities in the 10^42 erg/s to 10^44 erg/s range. weshow that the number density of sources in this luminosity range is rising, oris at least constant, with decreasing redshift. broad-line agn are the dominantpopulation at higher luminosities, and these sources show the well-known rapidpositive evolution with increasing redshift to z~3. we argue that the dominantsupermassive black hole formation has occurred at recent times in objects withlow accretion mass flow rates rather than at earlier times in more x-rayluminous objects with high accretion mass flow rates.

astro-ph;0301371	a deep chandra catalog of x-ray point sources toward the galactic center	(abridged) we present a catalog of 2357 point sources detected during 590 ksof chandra observations of the 17-by-17 arcminute field around sgr a*. thisfield encompasses a physical area of 40 by 40 pc at a distance of 8 kpc. thecompleteness limit of the sample at the galactic center is 10^{31} erg s^{-1}(2.0--8.0 kev), while the detection limit is an order of magnitude lower. the281 sources detected below 1.5 kev are mainly in the foreground of the galacticcenter, while comparisons to the chandra deep fields at high galactic latitudessuggest that only about 100 of the observed sources are background agn. thesurface density of absorbed sources (not detected below 1.5 kev) falls off as1/theta away from sgr a*, in agreement with the distribution of stars ininfrared surveys. point sources brighter than our completeness limit produce10% of the flux previously attributed to diffuse emission. the log(n)-log(s)distribution of the galactic center sources is extremely steep (power-law slopealpha = 1.7). if this distribution extends down to a flux of 10^{-17} ergcm^{-1} s^{-1} (10^{29} erg s^{-1} at 8 kpc, 2.0--8.0 kev) with the same slope,then point sources would account for all of the previously reported diffuseemission. therefore, the 2.0--8.0 kev luminosity distribution must flattenbetween 10^{29} - 10^{31} erg s^{-1}. finally, the spectra of more than half ofthe galactic center sources are very hard, and can be described by a power law($e^{-gamma}) with photon index gamma &lt; 1. such hard spectra have been seenpreviously only from magnetically accreting white dwarfs and wind-accretingneutron stars, suggesting that there are large numbers of these systems in ourfield.

astro-ph;0305133	ten million degree gas in m 17 and the rosette nebula: x-ray flows in  galactic h ii regions	we present the first high-spatial-resolution x-ray images of two high-massstar forming regions, the omega nebula (m 17) and the rosette nebula (ngc2237--2246), obtained with the chandra x-ray observatory advanced ccd imagingspectrometer (acis) instrument. the massive clusters powering these h iiregions are resolved at the arcsecond level into &gt;900 (m 17) and &gt;300 (rosette)stellar sources similar to those seen in closer young stellar clusters.however, we also detect soft diffuse x-ray emission on parsec scales that isspatially and spectrally distinct from the point source population. the diffuseemission has luminosity l_x ~ 3.4e33 ergs/s in m~17 with plasma energycomponents at kt ~0.13 and ~0.6 kev (1.5 and 7 mk), while in rosette it has l_x\~6e32 ergs/s with plasma energy components at kt ~0.06 and ~0.8 kev (0.7 and 9mk). this extended emission most likely arises from the fast o-star windsthermalized either by wind-wind collisions or by a termination shock againstthe surrounding media. we establish that only a small portion of the windenergy and mass appears in the observed diffuse x-ray plasma; in these blisterh ii regions, we suspect that most of it flows without cooling into thelow-density interstellar medium. these data provide compelling observationalevidence that strong wind shocks are present in h ii regions.

astro-ph;0402087	diffuse x-ray emission in a deep chandra image of the galactic center	we examine the spectrum of diffuse emission detected in the 17' by 17' fieldaround sgr a* during 625 ks of chandra observations. the spectrum exhibitshe-like and h-like lines from si, s, ar, ca, and fe, that are consistent withoriginating in a two-temperature plasma, as well as a prominent low-ionizationfe line. the cooler, kt=0.8 kev plasma differs in surface brightness across theimage by a factor of 9. this soft plasma is probably heated by supernovae. theradiative cooling rate of the plasma within the inner 20 pc of the galaxy couldbe balanced by 1% of the kinetic energy of one supernova every 300,000 y. thehotter, kt=8 kev component is more spatially uniform, ranging over a factor of2 in surface brightness. the intensity of the hard plasma is correlated withthat of the soft, but they are probably only indirectly related, becausesupernova remnants are not observed to produce thermal plasma hotter than kt=3kev. moreover, a kt=8 kev plasma is too hot to be bound to the galactic center,and therefore would form a slow wind or fountain of plasma. the energy requiredto sustain such a freely-expanding plasma within the inner 20 pc of the galaxyis ~10^40 erg/s, which corresponds to the entire kinetic energy of onesupernova every 3000 y. this rate is unreasonably high. however, alternativeexplanations for the kt=8 kev diffuse emission are equally unsatisfying. we areleft to conclude that either the diffuse emission is heated by an unanticipatedsource of energy, or that a population of faint (&lt; 10^31 erg/s), hard x-raysources that are a factor of 10 more numerous than cvs remains to bediscovered.

astro-ph;0403463	the spectra and variability of x-ray sources in a deep chandra  observation of the galactic center	we examine the x-ray spectra and variability of the sample of x-ray sourceswith l_x = 10^{31}-10^{33} erg s^{-1} identified within the inner 9' of thegalaxy. very few of the sources exhibit intra-day or inter-month variations. wefind that the spectra of the point sources near the galactic center are veryhard between 2--8 kev, even after accounting for absorption. when modeled aspower laws the median photon index is gamma=0.7, while when modeled as thermalplasma we can only obtain lower limits to the temperature of kt&gt;8 kev. thecombined spectra of the point sources is similarly hard, with a photon index ofgamma=0.8. strong line emission is observed from low-ionization, he-like, andh-like fe, both in the average spectra and in the brightest individual sources.the line ratios of the highly-ionized fe in the average spectra are consistentwith emission from a plasma in thermal equilibrium. this line emission isobserved whether average spectra are examined as a function of the count ratefrom the source, or as a function of the hardness ratios of individual sources.this suggests that the hardness of the spectra may in fact to due localabsorption that partially-covers the x-ray emitting regions in the galacticcenter systems. we suggest that most of these sources are intermediate polars,which (1) often exhibit hard spectra with prominent fe lines, (2) rarelyexhibit either flares on short time scales or changes in their mean x-ray fluxon long time scales, and (3) are the most numerous hard x-ray sources withcomparable luminosities in the galaxy.

astro-ph;0403577	first simultaneous nir/x-ray detection of a flare from sgra*	we report on the first simultaneous near-infrared/x-ray detection of the sgra* counterpart which is associated with the massive black hole at the center ofthe milky way. the observations have been carried out using the naco adaptiveoptics (ao) instrument at the european southern observatory's very largetelescope and the acis-i instrument aboard the chandra x-ray observatory. wealso report on quasi-simultaneous observations at a wavelength of 3.4 mm usingthe berkeley-illinois-maryland association (bima) array. a flare was detectedin the x-domain with an excess 2-8 kev luminosity of about 6$\times10^{33}$erg/s. a fading flare of sgr a* with $&gt;$2 times the interim-quiescent flux wasalso detected at the beginning of the nir observations, that overlapped withthe fading part of the x-ray flare. compared to 8-9 hours before the nir/x-rayflare we detected a marginally significant increase in the millimeter fluxdensity of sgr a* during measurements about 7-9 hours afterwards. we find thatthe flaring state can be conveniently explained with a synchrotron self-comptonmodel involving up-scattered sub-millimeter photons from a compact sourcecomponent, possibly with modest bulk relativistic motion. the size of thatcomponent is assumed to be of the order of a few times the schwarzschildradius. the overall spectral indices $\alpha_{nir/x-ray}$($s_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu^{-\alpha}$) of both states are quite comparable with avalue of $\sim$1.3. since the interim-quiescent x-ray emission is spatiallyextended, the spectral index for the interim-quiescent state is probably only alower limit for the compact source sgr a*. a conservative estimate of the upperlimit of the time lag between the ends of the nir and x-ray flare is of theorder of 15 minutes.

astro-ph;0404543	chandra observations of radio-loud quasars at z &gt; 4: x-rays from the  radio beacons of the early universe	we present the results of chandra observations of six radio-loud quasars(rlqs) and one optically bright radio-quiet quasar (rqq) at z = 4.1-4.4. theseobservations cover a representative sample of rlqs with moderate radio-loudness(r ~ 40-400), filling the x-ray observational gap between optically selectedrqqs and the five known blazars at z &gt; 4 (r ~ 800-27000). we study therelationship between x-ray luminosity and radio-loudness for quasars at highredshift and constrain rlq x-ray continuum emission and absorption. from ajoint spectral fit of nine moderate-r rlqs observed by chandra, we findtentative evidence for absorption above the galactic n_h, with a best-fitneutral intrinsic column density of n_h = 2.4^{+2.0}_{-1.8} x 10^{22} cm^{-2},consistent with earlier claims of increased absorption toward high-redshiftrlqs. we also search for evidence of an enhanced jet-linked component in thex-ray emission due to the increased energy density of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) at high redshift, but we find neither spatial detections ofx-ray jets nor a significant enhancement in the x-ray emission relative tocomparable rlqs at low-to-moderate redshifts. overall, the z ~ 4-5 rlqs havebasic x-ray properties consistent with comparable rlqs in the local universe,suggesting that the accretion/jet mechanisms of these objects are similar aswell.

astro-ph;0405026	the chandra deep field-north survey: xvii. evolution of magnetic  activity in old late-type stars	the extremely sensitive chandra deep field-north (cdf-n) pencil-beam x-raysurvey is used to identify and characterize the x-ray emission from oldhigh-latitude main sequence galactic stars. our principal goal is toinvestigate the expected long-term decay of magnetic activity of late-typestars due to the gradual spindown of stellar rotation from a magnetized stellarwind. eleven x-ray sources constitute a well-defined sample of 2 g, 2 k0-k4,and 7 m2-m5 stars with median distance around 300 pc. x-ray luminosities aretypically log lx ~ 27 erg/s and is dominated by flares rather than quiescentcoronal emission. models of the population indicates that the cdf-n stars arethe most magnetically active old disk stars. a substantial decline in x-rayluminosities over the 1&lt;t&lt;11 gyr age interval is required. this is the firstdemonstration that the coronal and flaring components of stellar magneticactivity -- and presumably the interior magnetic dynamos responsible for thereconnecting fields at the stellar surface -- exhibit long-term decay over theage of the galactic disk. the model that best fits the magnitudes, spectraltypes and x-ray luminosities of the sample has lx ~ 1/t^2 erg/s which is fasterthan the 1/t decay rate predicted from widely accepted rotational spindownrates and x-ray-activity relations.

astro-ph;0408001	the fall of agn and the rise of star-forming galaxies: a close look at  the chandra deep field x-ray number counts	we investigate the x-ray number counts in the 1-2 ms chandra deep fields(cdfs) to determine the contributions of faint x-ray source populations to theextragalactic x-ray background (xrb). x-ray sources were separated into activegalactic nuclei (agn), star-forming galaxies, and galactic stars based onseveral criteria. we find that agn continue to dominate the number counts inthe 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev bands. at flux limits of ~2.5e-17 erg cm-2 s-1(0.5-2.0 kev) and ~1.4e-16 erg cm-2 s-1 (2-8 kev), the overall agn sourcedensities are 7166 (+304/-292) and 4558 (+216/-207) sources deg-2,respectively; these are factors of ~10-20 higher than found in the deepestoptical spectroscopic surveys. while still a minority, the number counts ofstar-forming galaxies climb steeply such that they eventually achieve sourcedensities of 1727 (+187/-169) and 711 (+270/-202) sources deg-2 at the cdf0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev flux limits, respectively. adopting recent xrb fluxdensities measurements, the cdfs resolve a total of 89.5% (+5.9%/-5.7%) and86.9% (+6.6%/-6.3%) of the extragalactic 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev xrbs,respectively. extrapolation of the number-count slopes can easily account forthe entire 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev xrbs to within statistical errors. we alsorevisit the reported differences between the cdf-north and cdf-south numbercounts, finding that the two fields are consistent except for sources in the2-8 kev band below f(2-8 kev)~1e-15 erg cm-2 s-1, where deviations graduallyincrease to ~3.9 sigma.

astro-ph;0503572	a remarkable low-mass x-ray binary within 0.1 pc of the galactic center	recent x-ray and radio observations have identified a transient low-massx-ray binary (lmxb) located only 0.1 pc in projection from the galactic center,cxogc j174540.0-290031. in this paper, we report the detailed analysis of x-rayand infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. chandrabservations detect the source at a flux of f_x = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8kev). after accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and inmaterial local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only l_x= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 kev; d=8 kpc). however, the diffuse x-ray emission near thesource also brightened by a factor of 2. the enhanced diffuse x-ray emissionlies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infraredimages. we interpret the x-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,and determine that the peak luminosity of cxogc j174540.0-290031 was &gt;2e36erg/s. we suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the factthat the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion diskintercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. we compare theinferred peak x-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. the ratio of the x-rayto radio luminosities, l_x/l_r&lt;1e4, is considerably smaller than in other knownlmxbs (&gt; 1e5). this is probably because the jets are radiating with unusuallyhigh efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellarmedium. this hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared imagesof the surrounding dust. finally, we find that the minimum power required toproduce the jet, l_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak x-rayluminosity. this is the most direct evidence yet obtained that lmxbs accretingat low rates release about half of their energy as jets.

(2004) which usedsimilar methods to examine z &gt; 4 rlqs with moderate radio-loudness (r=40-400).all of our targets are clearly detected. a search for extended x-ray emissionassociated with kpc-scale radio jets revealed only limited evidence for x-rayextension in our sample: three sources showed no evidence of x-ray extension,and the other three had 3-30% of their total x-ray fluxes extended &gt;1 arcsecaway from their x-ray cores. additionally, we do not observe any systematicflattening of the optical-to-x-ray spectral index (alpha_{ox}) compared tolow-redshift quasars. these results suggest that kpc-scale x-ray jet emissionis not dominated by inverse-compton scattering of cmb-seed photons off jetelectrons. we measured x-ray continuum shapes and performed individual andjoint spectral fits of our data combined with eight archival rlqs. a singlepower-law model acceptably fit the data. we added an intrinsic absorptioncomponent to our model, and neither the moderate-r nor the high-r fits set alower bound on n_h. our spectral results suggest that intrinsic absorption doesnot strongly depend on radio-loudness, and high-r sources have flatter powerlaws than moderate-r sources. overall, our high-redshift rlqs have basic x-rayproperties consistent with similar rlqs in the local universe.

astro-ph;0601105	a chandra/acis study of 30 doradus i. superbubbles and supernova  remnants	we present an x-ray tour of diffuse emission in the 30 doradus star-formingcomplex in the large magellanic cloud using high-spatial-resolution x-rayimages and spatially-resolved spectra obtained with the advanced ccd imagingspectrometer aboard the chandra x-ray observatory. the dominant x-ray featureof the 30 doradus nebula is the intricate network of diffuse emission generatedby interacting stellar winds and supernovae working together to create vastsuperbubbles filled with hot plasma. we construct maps of the region showingvariations in plasma temperature (t = 3--9 million degrees), absorption (n_h =1--6 x 10^{21} cm^{-2}), and absorption-corrected x-ray surface brightness (s_x= 3--126 x 10^{31} ergs s^{-1} pc^{-2}). enhanced images reveal the pulsar windnebula in the composite supernova remnant n157b and the chandra data showspectral evolution from non-thermal synchrotron emission in the n157b core to athermal plasma in its outer regions. in a companion paper we show that r136,the central massive star cluster, is resolved at the arcsecond level intoalmost 100 x-ray sources. through x-ray studies of 30 doradus the complete lifecycle of such a massive stellar cluster can be revealed.

astro-ph;0601106	a chandra/acis study of 30 doradus ii. x-ray point sources in the  massive star cluster r136 and beyond	we have studied the x-ray point source population of the 30 doradusstar-forming complex in the large magellanic cloud usinghigh-spatial-resolution x-ray images and spatially-resolved spectra obtainedwith the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer (acis) aboard the chandra x-rayobservatory. here we describe the x-ray sources in a 17' x 17' field centeredon r136, the massive star cluster at the center of the main 30 dor nebula. wedetect 20 of the 32 wolf-rayet stars in the acis field. r136 is resolved at thesubarcsecond level into almost 100 x-ray sources, including many typical o3--o5stars as well as a few bright x-ray sources previously reported. over twoorders of magnitude of scatter in l_x is seen among r136 o stars, suggestingthat x-ray emission in the most massive stars depends critically on the detailsof wind properties and binarity of each system, rather than reflecting thewidely-reported characteristic value l_x/l_bol ~ 10^{-7}. such a canonicalratio may exist for single massive stars in r136, but our data are too shallowto confirm this relationship. through this and future x-ray studies of 30doradus, the complete life cycle of a massive stellar cluster can be revealed.

0809.1105	a catalog of x-ray point sources from two megaseconds of chandra  observations of the galactic center	we present a catalog of 9017 x-ray sources identified in chandra observationsof a 2 by 0.8 degree field around the galactic center. we increase the numberof known x-ray sources in the region by a factor of 2.5. the catalogincorporates all of the acis-i observations as of 2007 august, which total 2.25msec of exposure. at the distance to the galactic center (8 kpc), we aresensitive to sources with luminosities &gt;4e32 erg/s (0.5-8.0 kev; 90%confidence) over an area of one square degree, and up to an order of magnitudemore sensitive in the deepest exposure (1.0 msec) around sgr a*. the positionsof 60% of our sources are accurate to &lt;1" (95% confidence), and 20% havepositions accurate to &lt;0.5". we search for variable sources, and find that 3%exhibit flux variations within an observation, 10% exhibit variations fromobservation-to-observation. we also find one source, cxougc j174622.7-285218,with a periodic 1745 s signal (1.4% chance probability), which is probably amagnetically-accreting cataclysmic variable. we compare the spatialdistribution of x-ray sources to a model for the stellar distribution, and find2.8 sigma evidence for excesses in the numbers of x-ray sources in the regionof recent star formation encompassed by the arches, quintuplet, and galacticcenter star clusters. these excess sources are also seen in the luminositydistribution of the x-ray sources, which is flatter near the arches andquintuplet than elsewhere in the field. these excess point sources, along witha similar longitudinal asymmetry in the distribution of diffuse iron emissionthat has been reported by other authors, probably have their origin in theyoung stars that are prominent at l~0.1 degree.

astro-ph;0602550	an exploratory chandra survey of a well-defined sample of 35 large  bright quasar survey broad absorption line quasars	we present 4-7 ks chandra observations of 35 broad absorption line (bal)quasars from the large bright quasar survey, the largest sample of sensitive,0.5-8.0 kev x-ray observations of this class of quasars to date. the limitedranges in both redshift (z=1.42-2.90) and uv luminosity (a factor of ~12) ofthe sample also make it relatively uniform. of 35 targets, 27 are detected fora detection fraction of 77%, and we confirm previous studies that find balquasars to be generally x-ray weak. five of the eight non-detections are knownlow-ionization bal quasars, confirming reports of extreme x-ray weakness inthis subset (~10% of optically selected bal quasars). those bal quasars withthe hardest x-ray spectra are also the x-ray weakest, consistent with theinterpretation that intrinsic absorption is the primary cause of x-ray weaknessin this class of quasars as a whole. furthermore, the observed trend is notconsistent with simple neutral absorption, supporting findings fromspectroscopic observations of individual targets that bal quasars typicallyexhibit complex x-ray absorption (e.g., partially covering or ionizedabsorbers). in sum, high-ionization bal quasars are typically neitherintrinsically x-ray weak nor suffer from compton-thick absorption. in general,we find no evidence for correlations between x-ray weakness and uvabsorption-line properties, with the exception of a likely correlation betweenthe maximum outflow velocity of civ absorption and the magnitude of x-rayweakness. we discuss the implications of our results for disk-wind models ofbal outflows in quasars.

astro-ph;0603853	x-ray emission from the double neutron star binary b1534+12: powered by  the pulsar wind?	we report the detection of the double neutron star binary (dnsb) b1534+12 (=j1537+1155) with the chandra x-ray observatory. this dnsb (orbital period 10.1hr) consists of the millisecond (recycled) pulsar j1537+1155a (p_a=37.9 ms) anda neutron star not detected in the radio. after the remarkable double pulsarbinary j0737-3039, it is the only other dnsb detected in x-rays. we measuredthe flux of (2.2\pm 0.6)\times10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 kevband. the small number of collected counts allows only crude estimates ofspectral parameters. the power-law fit yields the photon index of 3.2\pm 0.5and the unabsorbed 0.2-10 kev luminosity l_x=6\times10^{29} ergs s^{-1} =3\times 10^{-4}edot_a, where edot_a is the spin-down power of j1537+1155a.alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with t = 2.2 mkand the projected emitting area of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. the distribution ofphoton arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of x-rayemission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused byinteraction of the relativistic wind from j1537+1155a with its neutron starcompanion. we also reanalyzed the chandra and xmm-newton observations ofj0737-3039 and found that its x-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum ofb1534+12, and its x-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of edot_a, whichsuggests similar x-ray emission mechanisms. however, the x-ray emission fromj0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. this difference can beexplained by the smaller eccentricity of j0737-3039 or a smaller misalignmentbetween the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane ofthe binary.

astro-ph;0607031	x-ray absorption and an x-ray jet in the radio-loud broad absorption  line quasar pg 1004+130	we investigate the x-ray properties of pg 1004+130, a low-redshift radio-loudbroad absorption line (bal) quasar with a hybrid fr i/fr ii radio morphology.the 22.2 ks xmm-newton and 41.6 ks chandra observations presented here are thefirst x-ray detections of pg 1004+130 and constitute the highest spectralquality x-ray observations of a radio-loud bal quasar available to date. thechandra acis-s spectrum shows evidence for complex soft x-ray absorption notdetected in the data obtained 1.7 yr previously with xmm-newton, with abest-fit intrinsic column density of n_h=1.2e22 cm-2 for the preferredpartial-covering model. there is no significant difference in the hard-bandpower-law photon index of ~1.5 between the two observations. the chandra imagealso reveals extended x-ray emission ~8'' (30 kpc) south-east of the nucleus,aligned with the fr i jet but upstream of the 1.4 ghz radio-brightness peak.the jet is not detected by hst, and the optical upper limit rules out a simplesingle-component synchrotron interpretation of the radio-to-x-ray emission. themultiwavelength characteristics of the pg 1004+130 jet, including itsrelatively flat x-ray power law and concave spectral energy distribution, aresimilar to those of powerful fr ii jets. the lack of strong beaming in pg1004+130 limits the efficiency of inverse compton upscattering, and we considerthe x-ray emission to most likely arise from a second synchrotron componentgenerated by highly energetic electrons.

astro-ph;0611599	x-ray emission from psr b1800-21, its wind nebula, and similar systems	we detected x-ray emission from psr b1800-21 and its synchrotron nebula withthe chandra x-ray observatory. the pulsar's observed flux is (1.4+/-0.2)10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 1-6 kev band. the spectrum can be describedby a two-component pl+bb model, suggesting a mixture of thermal andmagnetospheric emission. for a plausible hydrogen column density n_{h}=1.410^{22} cm^{-2}, the pl component has a slope gamma=1.4+/-0.6 and a luminosityl_{psr}^{nonth}=4 10^{31}(d/4 kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}. the properties of the thermalcomponent (kt=0.1-0.3 kev, l^{bol}=10^{31}-10^{33} ergs s^{-1}) are very poorlyconstrained because of the strong interstellar absorption. the compact,7''\times4'', inner pulsar-wind nebula (pwn), elongated perpendicular to thepulsar's proper motion, is immersed in a fainter asymmetric emission. theobserved flux of the pwn is (5.5+/-0.6) 10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 1-8kev band. the pwn spectrum fits by a pl model with gamma=1.6+/-0.3, l=1.610^{32} (d/4 kpc})^2 ergs s^{-1}. the shape of the inner pwn suggests that thepulsar moves subsonically and x-ray emission emerges from a torus associatedwith the termination shock in the equatorial pulsar wind. the inferredpwn-pulsar properties (e.g., the pwn x-ray efficiency, l_{pwn}/\dot{e}~10^{-4};the luminosity ratio, l_{pwn}/l_{psr}^{nonth}=4; the pulsar wind pressure atthe termination shock, p_s=10^{-9} ergs cm^{-3}) are very similar to those ofother subsonically moving vela-like objects detected with chandra(l_{pwn}/\dot{e}=10^{-4.5}-10^{-3.5}, l_{pwn}/l_{psr}^{nonth}~5,p_s=10^{-10}-10^{-8} ergs cm^{-1}).

astro-ph;0701069	tev source hess j1804-216 in x-rays and other wavelengths	the field of the extended tev source hess j1804-216 was serendipitouslyobserved with the chandra acis detector. the data reveal several x-ray sourceswithin the bright part of hess j1804-216. the brightest of these objects, cxouj180432.4-214009, which has been also detected with swift and suzaku, isconsistent with being a point-like source, with the 0.3-7 kev flux of(1.7\pm0.2)\times10^{-13} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. its hard and strongly absorbedspectrum can be fitted by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit photonindex of 0.45 and hydrogen column density of 4\times10^{22} cm^{-2}, both withlarge uncertainties due to the strong correlation between these parameters. asearch for pulsations resulted in a 106 s period candidate, which however has alow significance of 97.9%. we found no infrared-optical counterparts for thissource. the second brightest source, cxou j180441.9-214224, which has beendetected with suzaku, is either extended or multiple, with the flux of about10^{-13} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}. we found a nearby m dwarf within the x-ray sourceextension, which could contribute a fraction of the observed x-ray flux. theremaining sources are very faint (&lt;3\times 10^{-14} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}), andat least some of them are likely associated with nearby stars. although one orboth of the two brighter x-ray sources could be faint accreting binaries orremote pulsars with pulsar wind nebulae (hence possible tev sources), theirrelation to hess j1804-216 remains elusive. the possibility that hess j1804-216is powered by the relativistic wind from the young pulsar b1800-21, located ata distance of about 10 pc from the tev source, still remains a more plausibleoption.
