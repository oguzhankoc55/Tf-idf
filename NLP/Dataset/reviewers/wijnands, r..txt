0908.1098	relativistic lines and reflection from the inner accretion disks around  neutron stars	a number of neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries have recently beendiscovered to show broad, asymmetric fe k emission lines in their x-rayspectra. these lines are generally thought to be the most prominent part of areflection spectrum, originating in the inner part of the accretion disk wherestrong relativistic effects can broaden emission lines. we present acomprehensive, systematic analysis of suzaku and xmm-newton spectra of 10neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries, all of which display broad fe k emissionlines. of the 10 sources, 4 are z sources, 4 are atolls and 2 are accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars (also atolls). the fe k lines are well fit by arelativistic line model for a schwarzschild metric, and imply a narrow range ofinner disk radii (6 - 15 gm/c^2) in most cases. this implies that the accretiondisk extends close to the neutron star surface over a range of luminosities.continuum modeling shows that for the majority of observations, a blackbodycomponent (plausibly associated with the boundary layer) dominates the x-rayemission from 8 - 20 kev. thus it appears likely that this spectral componentproduces the majority of the ionizing flux that illuminates the accretion disk.therefore, we also fit the spectra with a blurred reflection model, wherein ablackbody component illuminates the disk. this model fits well in most cases,supporting the idea that the boundary layer is illuminating a geometricallythin disk.

0909.2632	following the 2008 outburst decay of the black hole candidate h1743-322  in x-ray and radio	in this paper we report on radio (vla and atca) and x-ray (rxte, chandra andswift) observations of the outburst decay of the transient black hole candidateh1743-322 in early 2008. we find that the x-ray light curve followed anexponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. the exponentialdecay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosityof 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. this together with the relation betweenquiescent x-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literaturesuggests that h1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. both theradio and x-ray light curve show evidence for flares. the radio - x-raycorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. this is muchlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black holetransients before. the radio spectral index measured during one of the radioflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, whichindicates that the radio emission is optically thin. this is unlike what hasbeen found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. we attribute theradio flares and the low index for the radio - x-ray correlation to thepresence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection eventsearlier in the outburst. we find no evidence for a change in x-ray power lawspectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of n_h=2.3x10^22 cm^-2 limits the detected number of soft photons and thus theaccuracy of the spectral fits.

0911.0435	discovery of a 205.89 hz accreting-millisecond x-ray pulsar in the  globular cluster ngc 6440	we report the discovery of the second accreting millisecond x-ray pulsar(amxp) in the globular cluster ngc 6440. pulsations with a frequency of 205.89hz were detected with the rossi x-ray timing explorer on august 30th, october1st and october 28th, 2009, during the decays of ~4 day outbursts of a newlyx-ray transient source in ngc 6440. by studying the doppler shift of thepulsation frequency, we find that the system is an ultra-compact binary with anorbital period of 57.3 minutes and a projected semi-major axis of 6.22light-milliseconds. based on the mass function, we estimate a lower limit tothe mass of the companion to be 0.0067 m_sun (assuming a 1.4 m_sun neutronstar). this new pulsar shows the shortest outburst recurrence time among amxps(~1 month). if this behavior does not cease, this amxp has the potential to beone of the best sources in which to study how the binary system and the neutronstar spin evolve. furthermore, the characteristics of this new source indicatethat there might exist a population of amxps undergoing weak outbursts whichare undetected by current all-sky x-ray monitors. ngc 6440 is the only globularcluster to host two known amxps, while no amxps have been detected in any otherglobular cluster.

0911.0444	discovery of a second transient low-mass x-ray binary in the globular  cluster ngc 6440	we have identified a new transient luminous low-mass x-ray binary, ngc 6440x-2, with chandra/acis, rxte/pca, and swift/xrt observations of the globularcluster ngc 6440. the discovery outburst (july 28-31, 2009) peaked atl_x~1.5*10^36 ergs/s, and lasted for &lt;4 days above l_x=10^35 ergs/s. four otheroutbursts (may 29-june 4, aug. 29-sept. 1, oct. 1-3, and oct. 28-31 2009) havebeen observed with rxte/pca (identifying millisecond pulsations, altamirano etal. 2009a) and swift/xrt (confirming a positional association with ngc 6440x-2), with similar peak luminosities and decay times. optical and infraredimaging did not detect a clear counterpart, with best limits of v&gt;21, b&gt;22 inquiescence from archival hst imaging, g'&gt;22 during the august outburst fromgemini-south gmos imaging, and j&gt;~18.5$ and k&gt;~17 during the july outburst fromctio 4-m ispi imaging.  archival chandra x-ray images of the core do not detect the quiescentcounterpart, and place a bolometric luminosity limit of l_{ns}&lt; 6*10^31 ergs/s(one of the lowest measured) for a hydrogen atmosphere neutron star. a shortchandra observation 10 days into quiescence found two photons at ngc 6440 x-2'sposition, suggesting enhanced quiescent emission at l_x~6*10^31 ergs/s .  ngc 6440 x-2 currently shows the shortest recurrence time (~31 days) of anyknown x-ray transient, although regular outbursts were not visible in the bulgescans before early 2009. fast, low-luminosity transients like ngc 6440 x-2 maybe easily missed by current x-ray monitoring.

1001.2273	optical/infrared observations of the x-ray burster ks1731-260 in  quiescence	we performed an optical/infrared study of the counterpart of the low-massx-ray binary ks1731-260 to test its identification and obtain information aboutthe donor. optical and infrared images of the counterpart of ks1731-260 weretaken in two different epochs (2001 and 2007) after the source returned toquiescence in x-rays. we compared those observations with obtained when ks1731-260 was still active. we confirm the identification of ks1731-260 with thepreviously proposed counterpart and improve its position to ra=17:34:13.46 anddec=-26:05:18.60. the h-band magnitude of this candidate showed a decline of~1.7 mags from outburst to quiescence. in 2007 april we obtained r=22.8+-0.1and i=20.9+-0.1 for ks1731-260. similar optical brightness was measured in june2001 and july 2007. the intrinsic optical color r-i is consistent with spectraltypes from f to g for the secondary although there is a large excess over thatfrom the secondary at the infrared wavelengths. this may be due to emissionfrom the cooler outer regions of the accretion disk. we cannot rule out a browndwarf as a donor star, although it would require that the distance to thesource is significantly lower than the 7 kpc reported by muno et al. 2000.

1004.1066	investigating the disc-jet coupling in accreting compact objects using  the black hole candidate swift j1753.5-0127	in studies of accreting black holes in binary systems, empirical relationshave been proposed to quantify the coupling between accretion processes andejection mechanisms. these processes are probed respectively by means of x-rayand radio/optical-infrared observations. the relations predict, given certainaccretion conditions, the expected energy output in the form of a jet. weinvestigated this coupling by studying the black hole candidate swiftj1753.5-0127, via multiwavelength coordinated observations over a period of ~4years. we present the results of our campaign showing that, all along theoutburst, the source features a jet that is fainter than expected from theempirical correlation between the radio and the x-ray luminosities in hardspectral state. because the jet is so weak in this system the near-infraredemission is, unusually for this state and luminosity, dominated by thermalemission from the accretion disc. we briefly discuss the importance and theimplications of a precise determination of both the slope and the normalisationof the correlations, listing some possible parameters that broadband jet modelsshould take into account to explain the population of sources characterized bya dim jet. we also investigate whether our data can give any hint about thenature of the compact object in the system, since its mass has not beendynamically measured.

0708.1316	intermittent millisecond x-ray pulsations from the neutron-star x-ray  transient sax j1748.9-2021 in the globular cluster ngc 6440	we report on intermittent x-ray pulsations with a frequency of 442.36 hz fromthe neutron-star x-ray binary sax j1748.9--2021 in the globular cluster ngc6440. the pulsations were seen during both 2001 and 2005 outbursts of thesource, but only intermittently, appearing and disappearing on timescales ofhundreds of seconds. we find a suggestive relation between the occurrence oftype-i x-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations but the relation isnot strict. this behavior is very similar to that of the intermittent accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsar hete j1900.1--2455. the reason for the intermittenceof the pulsations remains unclear. however it is now evident that a strictdivision between pulsating and non-pulsating does not exist. by studying thedoppler shift of the pulsation frequency we determine an orbit with a period of8.7 hrs and an projected semi major axis of 0.39 lightsec. the companion starmight be a main--sequence or a slightly evolved star with a mass of $\sim$1$m_\odot$. therefore, sax j1748.9--2021 has a longer period and may have a moremassive companion star than all the other accreting millisecond x-ray pulsarsexcept for aql x-1.

1111.6967	accelerated orbital expansion and secular spin down of the accreting  millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658	the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 has shown a peculiarorbital evolution in the past with an orbital expansion much faster thanexpected from standard binary evolutionary scenarios. previous limits on thepulsar spin frequency derivative during transient accretion outbursts weresmaller than predicted by standard magnetic accretion torque theory, while thespin evolution between outbursts was consistent with magnetic dipole spin-down.in this paper we present the results of a coherent timing analysis of the 2011outburst observed by the rossi x-ray timing explorer and extend our previouslong-term measurements of the orbital and spin evolution over a baseline ofthirteen years. we find that the expansion of the 2 hr orbit is accelerating ata rate 1.6e-20 s/s^2 and we interpret this as the effect of short-term angularmomentum exchange between the mass donor and the orbit. the gravitationalquadrupole coupling due to variations in the oblateness of the companion can bea viable mechanism for explaining the observations. no significant spinfrequency derivatives are detected during the 2011 outburst (&lt;4e-13 hz/s) andthe long term spin down remains stable over thirteen years with a rate ofapproximately -1e-15 hz/s.

(2000) for grs 1915+105, we findthat igr j17091-3624 shows the \nu, \rho, \alpha, \lambda, \beta and \muclasses as well as quiet periods which resemble the \chi class, all occurringat 2-60 kev count rate levels which can be 10-50 times lower than observed ingrs 1915+105. the so-called \rho class "heartbeats" occur as fast as every fewseconds and as slow as ~100 seconds, tracing a loop in the hardness-intensitydiagram which resembles that previously seen in grs 1915+105. however, whilegrs 1915+105 traverses this loop clockwise, igr j17091-3624 does so in theopposite sense. we briefly discuss our findings in the context of the modelsproposed for grs 1915+105 and find that either all models requiring neareddington luminosities for grs 1915+105-like variability fail, or igrj17091-3624 lies at a distance well in excess of 20 kpc or, it harbors one ofthe least massive black holes known (&lt; 3 m_sun).

1112.3965	swift follow-up observations of unclassified asca sources	we present swift follow-up observations of a sample of 35 unclassified faintx-ray sources drawn from the asca galactic centre and plane surveys. our shortpointed xrt observations allow detections down to a limiting 0.3-10 kev flux of~1e-13 erg cm-2 s-1, which translates into a luminosity of ~1e33 erg s-1 for anassumed distance of d=8 kpc. the brightest source in our sample reaches amaximum 0.3-10 kev luminosity of ~2e36 (d/8kpc)^2 erg s-1 during ourobservations. we detect 16 (46%) of the asca sources with the xrt, while 19were not detected during our program. since we are probing the faint end of theasca source populations, we expect a large fraction of the non-detections to bedue to the eddington bias. this is strengthened by the fact that we find theobserved xrt count rates to be predominantly lower than expected based on thereported asca intensities. investigation of the asca properties and long-termx-ray variability leads us to conclude that the non-detections likely includetwo spurious asca detections and three objects that are variable or transientx-ray sources. for the 16 xrt-detected sources we obtain positional accuraciesof ~2-4", which significantly improves upon their asca uncertainties of ~1'. weuse the x-ray spectra and variability to characterise these objects. mostappear to be faint, persistent x-ray emitters that have highly absorbedspectra. based on their x-ray properties we identify three accreting compactobjects: one confirmed (ax j1754.2-2754) and one candidate (ax j1538.3-5541)x-ray binary, and one possible magnetically accreting white dwarf (axj1620.1-5002). furthermore, we use the improved positions of xrt-detectedsources to search for counterparts in simultaneously obtained swift/uvot imagesand possible associations with cataloged sources at various wavelengths. thisreveals three possible main sequence stars amongst our sample.

1207.5530	a superburst candidate in exo 1745--248 as a challenge to thermonuclear  ignition models	we report on chandra, rxte, swift/bat and maxi observations of a ~1 day x-rayflare and subsequent outburst of a transient x-ray source observed inoctober-november 2011 in the globular cluster terzan 5. we show that the sourceis the same as the transient that was active in 2000, i.e., the neutron starlow-mass x-ray binary exo 1745-248. for the x-ray flare we estimate a 6-11 hrexponential decay time and a radiated energy of 2-9 x 10^42 erg. theseproperties, together with strong evidence of decreasing blackbody temperatureduring the flare decay, are fully consistent with what is expected for athermonuclear superburst. we use the most recent superburst models and estimatean ignition column depth of ~10^12 g cm^-2 and an energy release between 0.1-2x 10^18 erg g^-1, also consistent with expected superburst values. we concludetherefore that the flare was most probably a superburst. we discuss our resultsin the context of theoretical models and find that even when assuming a fewdays of low level accretion before the superburst onset (which is more thanwhat is suggested by the data), the observations of this superburst are verychallenging for current superburst ignition models.

1210.4510	an x-ray-uv correlation in cen x-4 during quiescence	quiescent emission from the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary cen x-4 isseen to be variable on timescales from hundreds of seconds to years, suggestingthat at least in this object, low-level accretion is important duringquiescence. here we present results from recent xmm-newton and swiftobservations of cen x-4, where the x-ray flux (0.5 - 10 kev) varies by a factorof 6.5 between the brightest and faintest states. we find a positivecorrelation between the x-ray flux and the simultaneous near-uv flux, where asthere is no significant correlation between the x-ray and simultaneous optical(v, b) fluxes. this suggests that while the x-ray and uv emitting regions aresomehow linked, the optical region originates elsewhere. comparing theluminosities, it is plausible that the uv emission originates due toreprocessing of the x-ray flux by the accretion disk, with the hot inner regionof the disk being a possible location for the uv emitting region. the opticalemission, however, could be dominated by the donor star. the x-ray/uvcorrelation does not favour the accretion stream-impact point as the source ofthe uv emission.

1212.1453	a direct measurement of the heat release in the outer crust of the  transiently accreting neutron star xte j1709-267	the heating and cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars provides apowerful probe of the structure and composition of their crust. observations ofsuperbursts and crust cooling of accretion-heated neutron stars require moreheat release than is accounted for in current models. obtaining firmconstraints on the depth and magnitude of this extra heat is challenging andtherefore its origin remains uncertain. we report on swift and xmm-newtonobservations of the transient neutron star low-mass x-ray binary xte j1709-267,which were made in 2012 september-october when it transitioned to quiescenceafter a ~10-week long accretion outburst. the source is detected withxmm-newton at a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of lx~2e34 (d/8.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. the x-rayspectrum consists of a thermal component that fits to a neutron star atmospheremodel and a non-thermal emission tail, which each contribute ~50% to the totalemission. the neutron star temperature decreases from ~158 to ~152 ev duringthe ~8-hour long observation. this can be interpreted as cooling of a crustallayer located at a column density of y~5e12 g/cm^2 (~50 m inside the neutronstar), which is just below the ignition depth of superbursts. the required heatgeneration in the layers on top would be ~0.06-0.13 mev per accreted nucleon.the magnitude and depth rule out electron captures and nuclear fusion reactionsas the heat source, but it may be accounted for by chemical separation of lightand heavy nuclei. low-level accretion offers an alternative explanation for theobserved variability.

1307.2492	daily, multiwavelength swift monitoring of the neutron star low-mass  x-ray binary cen x-4: evidence for accretion and reprocessing during  quiescence	we conducted the first long-term (60 days), multiwavelength (optical,ultraviolet, and x-ray) simultaneous monitoring of cen x-4 with daily swiftobservations from june to august 2012, with the goal of understandingvariability in the low mass x-ray binary cen x-4 during quiescence. we foundcen x-4 to be highly variable in all energy bands on timescales from days tomonths, with the strongest quiescent variability a factor of 22 drop in thex-ray count rate in only 4 days. the x-ray, uv and optical (v band) emissionare correlated on timescales down to less than 110 s. the shape of thecorrelation is a power law with index gamma about 0.2-0.6. the x-ray spectrumis well fitted by a hydrogen ns atmosphere (kt=59-80 ev) and a power law (withspectral index gamma=1.4-2.0), with the spectral shape remaining constant asthe flux varies. both components vary in tandem, with each responsible forabout 50% of the total x-ray flux, implying that they are physically linked. weconclude that the x-rays are likely generated by matter accreting down to thens surface. moreover, based on the short timescale of the correlation, we alsounambiguously demonstrate that the uv emission can not be due to either thermalemission from the stream impact point, or a standard optically thick,geometrically thin disc. the spectral energy distribution shows a small uvemitting region, too hot to arise from the accretion disk, that we identifiedas a hot spot on the companion star. therefore, the uv emission is most likelyproduced by reprocessing from the companion star, indeed the vertical size ofthe disc is small and can only reprocess a marginal fraction of the x-rayemission. we also found the accretion disc in quiescence to likely be uv faint,with a minimal contribution to the whole uv flux.

1312.0632	the youngest known x-ray binary: circinus x-1 and its natal supernova  remnant	because supernova remnants are short lived, studies of neutron star x-raybinaries within supernova remnants probe the earliest stages in the life ofaccreting neutron stars. however, such objects are exceedingly rare: none wereknown to exist in our galaxy. we report the discovery of the natal supernovaremnant of the accreting neutron star circinus x-1, which places an upper limitof t &lt; 4, 600 years on its age, making it the youngest known x-ray binary and aunique tool to study accretion, neutron star evolution, and core collapsesupernovae. this discovery is based on a deep 2009 chandra x-ray observationand new radio observations of circinus x-1. circinus x-1 produces type i x-raybursts on the surface of the neutron star, indicating that the magnetic fieldof the neutron star is small. thus, the young age implies either that neutronstars can be born with low magnetic fields or that they can rapidly becomede-magnetized by accretion. circinus x-1 is a microquasar, creatingrelativistic jets which were thought to power the arcminute scale radio nebulasurrounding the source. instead, this nebula can now be attributed tonon-thermal synchrotron emission from the forward shock of the supernovaremnant. the young age is consistent with the observed rapid orbital evolutionand the highly eccentric orbit of the system and offers the chance to test thephysics of post-supernova orbital evolution in x-ray binaries in detail for thefirst time.

1403.2385	probing the crust of the neutron star in exo 0748-676	x-ray observations of quiescent x-ray binaries have the potential to provideinsight into the structure and the composition of neutron stars. exo 0748-676had been actively accreting for over 24 yr before its outburst ceased in late2008. subsequent x-ray monitoring revealed a gradual decay of the quiescentthermal emission that can be attributed to cooling of the accretion-heatedneutron star crust. in this work, we report on new chandra and swiftobservations that extend the quiescent monitoring to ~5 yr post-outburst. wefind that the neutron star temperature remained at ~117 ev between 2009 and2011, but had decreased to ~110 ev in 2013. this suggests that the crust hasnot fully cooled yet, which is supported by the lower temperature of ~95 evthat was measured ~4 yr prior to the accretion phase in 1980. comparing thedata to thermal evolution simulations reveals that the apparent lack of coolingbetween 2009 and 2011 could possibly be a signature of convection driven byphase separation of light and heavy nuclei in the outer layers of the neutronstar.

1404.2065	the return to quiescence of aql x-1 following the 2010 outburst	aql x-1 is the most prolific low mass x-ray binary transient hosting aneutron star. in this paper we focus on the return to quiescence following the2010 outburst of the source. this decay was monitored thanks to 11 pointedobservations taken with xmm-newton, chandra and swift. the decay from outburstto quiescence is very fast, with an exponential decay characteristic time scaleof ~2 d. once in quiescence the x-ray flux of aql x-1 remained constant, withno further signs of variability or decay. the comparison with the only otherwell-monitored outburst from aql x-1 (1997) is tail-telling. the luminositiesat which the fast decay starts are fully compatible for the two outbursts,hinting at a mechanism intrinsic to the system and possibly related to theneutron star rotation and magnetic field (i.e., the propeller effect). inaddition, for both outbursts, the decay profiles are also very similar, likelyresulting from the shut-off of the accretion process onto the neutron starsurface. finally, the quiescent neutron star temperatures at the end of theoutbursts are well consistent with one another, suggesting a hot neutron starcore dominating the thermal balance. small differences in the quiescent x-rayluminosity among the two outbursts can be attributed to a different level ofthe power law component.

1409.6265	low-level accretion in neutron-star x-ray binaries	we search the literature for reports on the spectral properties ofneutron-star low-mass x-ray binaries when they have accretion luminositiesbetween 1e34 and 1e36 ergs/s. we found that in this luminosity range the photonindex (obtained from fitting a simple absorbed power-law in the 0.5-10 kevrange) increases with decreasing 0.5-10 kev x-ray luminosity (i.e., thespectrum softens). such behaviour has been reported before for individualsources, but here we demonstrate that very likely most (if not all)neutron-star systems behave in a similar manner and possibly even follow auniversal relation. when comparing the neutron-star systems with black-holesystems, it is clear that most black-hole binaries have significantly harderspectra at luminosities of 1e34 - 1e35 erg/s. despite a limited number of datapoints, there are indications that these spectral differences also extend tothe 1e35 - 1e36 erg/s range. this observed difference between the neutron-starbinaries and black-hole ones suggests that the spectral properties (between0.5-10 kev) at 1e34 - 1e35 erg/s can be used to tentatively determine thenature of the accretor in unclassified x-ray binaries. we discuss our resultsin the context of properties of the accretion flow at low luminosities and wesuggest that the observed spectral differences likely arise from theneutron-star surface becoming dominantly visible in the x-ray spectra. we alsosuggest that both the thermal component and the non-thermal component might becaused by low-level accretion onto the neutron-star surface for luminositiesbelow a few times 1e34 erg/s.

1501.03312	pulsar polarisation below 200 mhz: average profiles and propagation  effects	we present the highest-quality polarisation profiles to date of 16non-recycled pulsars and four millisecond pulsars, observed below 200 mhz withthe lofar high-band antennas. based on the observed profiles, we perform aninitial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from thepropagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and theinterstellar medium.  the predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been testedusing spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation frommultifrequency data. the derived spectra offer only partial support for theexpected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with onlyabout half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. it isnoted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effectsof interstellar scattering. for a number of pulsars in our sample, we haveobserved significant variations in the amount of faraday rotation as a functionof pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. these variationsare typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 mhz bynoutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. in thispaper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of thiseffect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. finally, we haveestimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation fromfour pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the paprofiles, and the theoretical framework of blaskiewicz, cordes &amp; wasserman(1991). these estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for psrb1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based onradius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recentupper limit based on pulsar timing.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1512.00014	lofar msss: detection of a low-frequency radio transient in 400 hrs of  monitoring of the north celestial pole	we present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequencyradio transients near the north celestial pole with the low-frequency array(lofar), as part of the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss). the datawere recorded between 2011 december and 2012 april and comprised 2149 11-minutesnapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. we have found one convincing candidateastrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at60 mhz of 15-25 jy. the transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical orhigh-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. thedetection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 mhz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)x 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,at a 7.9-jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. the campaign datawere also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60mhz as a function of observation duration.

1512.06129	constraining the properties of neutron star crusts with the transient  low-mass x-ray binary aql x-1	aql x-1 is a prolific transient neutron star low-mass x-ray binary thatexhibits an accretion outburst approximately once every year. whether thethermal x-rays detected in intervening quiescent episodes are the result ofcooling of the neutron star or due to continued low-level accretion remainsunclear. in this work we use swift data obtained after the long and bright 2011and 2013 outbursts, as well as the short and faint 2015 outburst, toinvestigate the hypothesis that cooling of the accretion-heated neutron starcrust dominates the quiescent thermal emission in aql x-1. we demonstrate thatthe x-ray light curves and measured neutron star surface temperatures areconsistent with the expectations of the crust cooling paradigm. by using athermal evolution code, we find that ~1.2-3.2 mev/nucleon of shallow heatrelease describes the observational data well, depending on the assumedmass-accretion rate and temperature of the stellar core. we find no evidencefor varying strengths of this shallow heating after different outbursts, butthis could be due to limitations of the data. we argue that monitoring aql x-1for up to ~1 year after future outbursts can be a powerful tool to break modeldegeneracies and solve open questions about the magnitude, depth and origin ofshallow heating in neutron star crusts.

0807.3458	the behavior of subluminous x-ray transients near the galactic center as  observed using the x-ray telescope aboard swift	in this paper we report on the spectral analysis of seven x-ray transients,which were found to be active during a monitoring campaign of the galacticcenter carried out in 2006 and 2007 using the x-ray telescope aboard the swiftsatellite. this campaign detected new outbursts of five known x-ray transientsand discovered two new systems. their 2-10 kev peak luminosities range from1e34 to 6e36 erg/s. two of the sources discussed in this paper are confirmedneutron star systems (ax j1745.6-2901 and grs 1741-2853), while the five othershave an unknown nature. we discuss the characteristics of the observedoutbursts and the duty cycles of the various systems. several of the detectedtransients seem to undergo enhanced x-ray activity with levels intermediatebetween quiescence and full outburst. we discuss the possibility that thesubluminous appearance of the eclipsing x-ray burster ax j1745.6-2901 is due toline-of-sight effects. we detected two type-i x-ray bursts with a duration of50-60 seconds from ax j1745.6-2901, which we discuss in view of the burstingbehavior of low-luminosity x-ray transients. assuming that we are dealing withaccreting neutron stars and black holes, we estimate the time-average accretionrate, mdot, of the transients, which is an important input parameter for binaryevolution models that attempt to explain the nature of subluminous x-raytransients. our estimates lie in the range of 3e-13 msun/yr &lt; mdot &lt; 1e-10msun/yr, if the systems are neutron star x-ray binaries and between 4e-14msun/yr &lt; mdot &lt; 2e-11 msun/yr for a scenario where the accreting object is ablack hole. some of the systems have such low estimated mass-accretion ratesthat they possibly pose a challenge for binary evolution models.

astro-ph;0202083	resolving the composite fe k-alpha emission line in the galactic black  hole cygnus x-1 with chandra	we observed the galactic black hole cygnus x-1 with the chandra high energytransmission grating spectrometer for 30 kiloseconds on 4 january, 2001. thesource was in an intermediate state, with a flux that was approximately twicethat commonly observed in its persistent low/hard state. our best-fit model forthe x-ray spectrum includes narrow gaussian emission line (e = 6.415 +/- 0.007kev, fwhm = 80 (+28, -19) ev, w = 16 (+3, -2) ev) and broad line (e = 5.82(+0.06, -0.07) kev, fwhm = 1.9 (+0.5, -0.3) kev, w = 140 (+70, -40) ev)components, and a smeared edge at 7.3 +/- 0.2 kev (tau ~ 1.0). the broad lineprofile is not as strongly skewed as those observed in some seyfert galaxies.we interpret these features in terms of an accretion disk with irradiation ofthe inner disk producing a broad fe k-alpha emission line and edge, andirradiation of the outer disk producing a narrow fe k-alpha emission line. thebroad line is likely shaped predominantly by doppler shifts and gravitationaleffects, and to a lesser degree by compton scattering due to reflection. wediscuss the underlying continuum x-ray spectrum and these line features in thecontext of diagnosing the accretion flow geometry in cygnus x-1 and othergalactic black holes.

astro-ph;0202375	evidence for spin and energy extraction in a galactic black hole  candidate: the xmm-newton/epic-pn spectrum of xte j1650-500	we observed the galactic black hole candidate xte j1650-500 early in itsfall, 2001 outburst with the xmm-newton european photon imaging pn camera(epic-pn). the observed spectrum is consistent with the source having been inthe "very high" state. we find a broad, skewed fe k-alpha emission line whichsuggests that the primary in this system may be a kerr black hole, and whichindicates a steep emissivity profile that is hard to explain in terms of astandard accretion disk model. these results are quantitatively andqualitatively similar to those from an xmm-newton observation of the seyfertgalaxy mcg--6-30-15. the steep emissivity in mcg--6-30-15 may be explained bythe extraction and dissipation of rotational energy from a black hole withnearly- maximal angular momentum or material in the plunging region viamagnetic connections to the inner accretion disk. if this process is at work inboth sources, an exotic but fundamental general relativistic prediction may beconfirmed across a factor of 10^6 in black hole mass. we discuss these resultsin terms of the accretion flow geometry in stellar-mass black holes, and thevariety of enigmatic phenomena often observed in the very high state.

astro-ph;0206467	a relativistic fe k-alpha emission line in the intermediate luminosity  bepposax spectrum of the galactic microquasar v4641 sgr	broad fe k-alpha emission lines have recently been reported in a number ofgalactic black holes. such lines are useful accretion flow diagnostics becausethey may be produced at the inner accretion disk and shaped by relativisticeffects, but in general they have only been observed at luminosities of l_x ~10^(37-38) erg/s in soft x-rays. the galactic microquasar v4641 sgr -- widelyknown for its 12.2 crab (1.5-12 kev) outburst in 1999 september -- displayedlow-level activity in 1999 march. bepposax observed the source in this stateand fe k-alpha line emission was found (in 't zand et al. 2000). inre-analyzing these data, we find strong evidence that the fe k-alpha lineprofile is broadened. for the most likely values of the source distance andblack hole mass measured by orosz et al. (2001), our fits to the total spectrumindicate that the source was observed at a luminosity of l_x = 1.9 (+1.0, -0.8)* 10^(36) erg/s (2-10 kev), or l_x/l_edd. = 1.8 (+0.9, -0.8) * 10^(-3).advection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) models predict a radially-recesseddisk in this regime. in contrast, fits to the observed fe k-alpha emission lineprofile with a relativistic line model constrain the inner disk to beconsistent with the marginally stable circular orbit of a schwarzschild blackhole.

(1998)and the value of n_h we derived from our spectral fits, the distance to rxj170930.2-263927 can be constrained to 2.5-10 kpc. rx j170930.2-263927 isprobably associated with the low-metalicity globular cluster ngc 6293, whichhas a tidal radius of 14.2 arcminutes, since the projected distance to thecentre of the cluster is approximately 25 parsec (9-10 arcminutes). if theassociation is correct, rx j170930.2-263927 would be at ~8.5 kpc. we determinedthat l_outburst / l_quiescence is approximately 10^5 for this outburst. if thequiescent luminosity is caused by cooling of the neutron star core thenenhanced core cooling processes were at work implying a neutron star mass of\~1.7-1.8 msun. combining our chandra observations with archival rosatobservations we show that the source most likely exhibits periods of sustainedlow-level accretion. variable, low-level activity could provide an alternativeexplanation for some of the sources in the recently proposed category of faintsoft x-ray transients. we found excess emission at ~0.6 kev. if such an excessis a unique feature of ultracompact systems, as was recently proposed, rxj170930.2-263927 must have a short orbital period as well. from the constraintson the distance and the non-detection of the optical counterpart with m_v&lt;20.5,we conclude that this system must have a low-mass companion.

astro-ph;0508648	the xmm-newton/chandra monitoring campaign of the galactic center  region: description of the program and preliminary results	we present the first results of our x-ray monitoring campaign on a 1.7 squaredegree region centered on sgr a* using the satellites xmm-newton and chandra.the purpose of this campaign is to monitor the behavior (below 10 kev) of x-raysources (both persistent and transient) which are too faint to be detected bymonitoring instruments aboard other satellites currently in orbit (e.g., rossix-ray timing explorer; integral). our first monitoring observations (using thehrc-i aboard chandra) were obtained on june 5, 2005. most of the sourcesdetected could be identified with foreground sources, such as x-ray activestars. in addition we detected two persistent x-ray binaries (1e 1743.1-2843;1a 1742-294), two faint x-ray transients (grs 1741.9-2853; xmm j174457-2850.3),as well as a possible new transient source at a luminosity of a few times 1e34erg/s. we report on the x-ray results on these systems and on the non-detectionof the transients in follow-up radio data using the very large array. wediscuss how our monitoring campaign can help to improve our understanding ofthe different types of x-ray transients (i.e., the very faint ones).

astro-ph;0512168	a chandra x-ray observation of the globular cluster terzan 1	we present a 19 ks chandra acis-s observation of the globular cluster terzan1. fourteen sources are detected within 1.4 arcmin of the cluster center with 2of these sources predicted to be not associated with the cluster (backgroundagn or foreground objects). the neutron star x-ray transient, x1732-304, haspreviously been observed in outburst within this globular cluster with theoutburst seen to last for at least 12 years. here we find 4 sources that areconsistent with the rosat position for this transient, but none of the sourcesare fully consistent with the position of a radio source detected with the vlathat is likely associated with the transient. the most likely candidate for thequiescent counterpart of the transient has a relatively soft spectrum and anunabsorbed 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 2.6e32 ergs/s, quite typical of otherquiescent neutron stars. assuming standard core cooling, from the quiescentflux of this source we predict long (&gt;400 yr) quiescent episodes to allow theneutron star to cool. alternatively, enhanced core cooling processes are neededto cool down the core. however, if we do not detect the quiescent counterpartof the transient this gives an unabsorbed 0.5-10 kev luminosity upper limit of8e31 ergs/s. we also discuss other x-ray sources within the globular cluster.  from the estimated stellar encouter rate of this cluster we find that thenumber of sources we detect is significantly higher than expected by therelationship of pooley et al. (2003).

0809.1105	a catalog of x-ray point sources from two megaseconds of chandra  observations of the galactic center	we present a catalog of 9017 x-ray sources identified in chandra observationsof a 2 by 0.8 degree field around the galactic center. we increase the numberof known x-ray sources in the region by a factor of 2.5. the catalogincorporates all of the acis-i observations as of 2007 august, which total 2.25msec of exposure. at the distance to the galactic center (8 kpc), we aresensitive to sources with luminosities &gt;4e32 erg/s (0.5-8.0 kev; 90%confidence) over an area of one square degree, and up to an order of magnitudemore sensitive in the deepest exposure (1.0 msec) around sgr a*. the positionsof 60% of our sources are accurate to &lt;1" (95% confidence), and 20% havepositions accurate to &lt;0.5". we search for variable sources, and find that 3%exhibit flux variations within an observation, 10% exhibit variations fromobservation-to-observation. we also find one source, cxougc j174622.7-285218,with a periodic 1745 s signal (1.4% chance probability), which is probably amagnetically-accreting cataclysmic variable. we compare the spatialdistribution of x-ray sources to a model for the stellar distribution, and find2.8 sigma evidence for excesses in the numbers of x-ray sources in the regionof recent star formation encompassed by the arches, quintuplet, and galacticcenter star clusters. these excess sources are also seen in the luminositydistribution of the x-ray sources, which is flatter near the arches andquintuplet than elsewhere in the field. these excess point sources, along witha similar longitudinal asymmetry in the distribution of diffuse iron emissionthat has been reported by other authors, probably have their origin in theyoung stars that are prominent at l~0.1 degree.

astro-ph;0602633	a long, hard look at the low-hard state in accreting black holes	we present the first results of coordinated multi-wavelength observations ofthe galactic black hole gx 339-4 in a canonical low-hard state, obtained duringits 2004 outburst. xmm-newton observed the source for 2 revolutions, orapproximately 280 ksec; rxte monitored the source throughout this long stare.the resulting data offer the best view yet obtained of the inner accretion flowgeometry in the low-hard state, which is thought to be analogous to thegeometry in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. the xmm-newton spectraclearly reveal the presence of a cool accretion disk component, and arelativistic fe k emission line. the results of fits made to both componentsstrongly suggest that a standard thin disk remains at or near to the innermoststable circular orbit, at least in bright phases of the low-hard state. thesefindings indicate that potential links between the inner disk radius and theonset of a steady compact jet, and the paradigm of a radially-recessed disk inthe low-hard state, do not hold universally. the results of our observationscan best be explained if a standard thin accretion disk fuels a corona which isclosely related to, or consistent with, the base of a compact jet. in a briefexamination of archival data, we show that cygnus x-1 supports this picture ofthe low/hard state. we discuss our results within the context of disk-jetconnections and prevailing models for accretion onto black holes.

astro-ph;0608089	discovery of twin khz qpos in the peculiar x-ray binary circinus x-1	we report the discovery with the rxte/pca of twin khz qpos in cir x-1. elevencases of simultaneous double qpos occurred, with significances of up to 6.3 and5.5 sigma and centroid frequencies ranging between approximately 56-225 and230-500 hz for the two qpo peaks, respectively, i.e., for the most part atfrequencies well below those of other sources. the qpo properties clearlyindicate that these double peaks are the khz qpos known from low magnetic fieldneutron stars, and not black-hole high-frequency qpos, confirming that cir x-1is a neutron star. the khz qpo peak separation varies over a wide range,\~175-340 hz, and increases with qpo frequency. this is contrary to what isseen in other sources but agrees with predictions of the relativisticprecession model and alfven wave models; beat-frequency models requiremodification to accommodate this. in other observations single khz qpos can beseen down to frequencies as low as ~12 hz, as well as a strong low-frequency(lf) qpo between 1 and 30 hz. the relations between the frequencies of the khzqpos and the lf qpo are in good agreement with those found previously in zsources, confirming that cir x-1 may be a peculiar z source. we suggest thatthe low frequencies of the khz qpos in cir x-1 and to a lesser extent in(other) z sources might be due to a relatively stronger radial inflow to theneutron star than in other khz qpo sources.

astro-ph;0612232	constraints on thermal x-ray radiation from sax j1808.4-3658 and  implications for neutron star neutrino emission	thermal x-ray radiation from neutron star soft x-ray transients in quiescenceprovides the strongest constraints on the cooling rates of neutron stars, andthus on the interior composition and properties of matter in the cores ofneutron stars. we analyze new (2006) and archival (2001) xmm-newtonobservations of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 inquiescence, which provide the most stringent constraints to date. the x-rayspectrum of sax j1808.4-3658 in the 2006 observation is consistent with apower-law of photon index 1.83\pm0.17, without requiring the presence of ablackbody-like component from a neutron star atmosphere. our 2006 observationshows a slightly lower 0.5-10 kev x-ray luminosity, at a level of68^{+15}_{-13}% that inferred from the 2001 observation. simultaneous fittingof all available xmm data allows a constraint on the quiescent neutron star(0.01-10 kev) luminosity of l_{ns}&lt;1.1*10^{31} erg/s. this limit excludes somecurrent models of neutrino emission mediated by pion condensates, and providesfurther evidence for additional cooling processes, such as neutrino emissionvia direct urca processes involving nucleons and/or hyperons, in the cores ofmassive neutron stars.

astro-ph;0701244	the integral galactic bulge monitoring program: the first 1.5 years	the galactic bulge region is a rich host of variable high-energy pointsources. since 2005, february 17 we are monitoring the source activity in thisregion about every three days with integral. thanks to the large field of view,the imaging capabilities and the sensitivity at hard x-rays, we are able topresent for the first time a detailed homogeneous (hard) x-ray view of a sampleof 76 sources in the galactic bulge region. we describe the successfulmonitoring program and show the first results for a period of about one and ahalf year. we focus on the short (hour), medium (month) and long-term (year)variability in the 20-60 kev and 60-150 kev bands. when available, we discussthe simultaneous observations in the 3-10 kev and 10-25 kev bands. pervisibility season we detect 32/33 sources in the 20-60 kev band and 8/9 sourcesin the 60-150 kev band. on average, we find per visibility season one activebright (&gt;~100 mcrab, 20-60 kev) black-hole candidate x-ray transient and threeactive weaker (&lt;~25 mcrab, 20-60 kev) neutron star x-ray transients. most ofthe time a clear anti-correlation can be seen between the soft and hard x-rayemission in some of the x-ray bursters. hard x-ray flares or outbursts in x-raybursters, which have a duration of the order of weeks, are accompanied by softx-ray drops. on the other hand, hard x-ray drops can be accompanied by softx-ray flares/outbursts. we found a number of new sources, igr j17354-3255, igr17453-2853, igr j17454-2703, igr j17456-2901b, igr j17536-2339, and igrj17541-2252. we report here on some of the high-energy properties of thesesources. the high-energy light curves of all the sources in the field of view,and the high-energy images of the region, are made available through the www athttp://isdc.unige.ch/science/bulge/.

astro-ph;0703371	investigating the nature of absorption lines in the chandra x-ray  spectra of the neutron star binary 4u 1820-30	we use four chandra gratings spectra of the neutron star low-mass x-raybinary 4u 1820-30 to better understand the nature of certain x-ray absorptionlines in x-ray binaries, including the neii, neiii, neix, ovii, and oviiilines. the equivalent widths of the lines are generally consistent between theobservations, as expected if these lines originate in the hot interstellarmedium. no evidence was found that the lines were blueshifted, again supportingthe interstellar medium origin, though this may be due to poor statistics.there is apparent variability in the oviii ly-alpha line equivalent widthproviding some evidence that at least some of the oviii absorption ariseswithin the system. however, the significance is marginal (2.4-sigma), and thelack of variation in the other lines casts some doubt on the reality of thevariability. from calculating the equivalent hydrogen column densities for arange of doppler parameters, we find they are consistent with the interstellarorigin of the lines. additionally we fit the spectra with photoionizationmodels for locally absorbing material, and find that they can reproduce thespectrum well, but only when there is an extremely low filling factor. weconclude that both the ism and local absorption remain possible for the originof the lines, but that more sensitive observations are needed to search forlow-level variability.

0809.3171	a search for iron emission lines in the chandra x-ray spectra of neutron  star low-mass x-ray binaries	while iron emission lines are well studied in black hole systems, both inx-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, there has been less of a focus onthese lines in neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). however, recentobservations with suzaku and xmm-newton have revealed broad asymmetric ironline profiles in 4 neutron star lmxbs, confirming an inner disk origin forthese lines in neutron star systems. here, we present a search for iron linesin 6 neutron star lmxbs. for each object we have simultaneous chandra and rxteobservations at 2 separate epochs, allowing for both a high resolutionspectrum, as well as broadband spectral coverage. out of the six objects in thesurvey, we only find significant iron lines in two of the objects, gx 17+2 andgx 349+2. however, we cannot rule out that there are weak, broad lines presentin the other sources. the equivalent width of the line in gx 17+2 is consistentbetween the 2 epochs, while in gx 349+2 the line equivalent width increases bya factor of ~3 between epochs as the source flux decreases by a factor of 1.3.this suggests that the disk is highly ionized, and the line is dominated byrecombination emission. we find that there appears to be no specific locationsin the long-term hardness-intensity diagrams where iron emission lines areformed, though more sources and further observations are required.

0810.0497	further constraints on thermal quiescent x-ray emission from sax  j1808.4-3658	we observed sax j1808.4-3658 (1808), the first accreting millisecond pulsar,in deep quiescence with xmm-newton and (near-simultaneously) gemini-south. thex-ray spectrum of 1808 is similar to that observed in quiescence in 2001 and2006, describable by an absorbed power-law with photon index 1.74+-0.11 andunabsorbed x-ray luminosity l_x=7.9+-0.7*10^{31} ergs/s, for n_h=1.3*10^{21}cm^{-2}. fitting all the quiescent xmm-newton x-ray spectra with a power-law,we constrain any thermally emitting neutron star with a hydrogen atmosphere tohave a temperature less than 30 ev and l_{ns}(0.01-10 kev)&lt;6.2*10^{30} ergs/s.a thermal plasma model also gives an acceptable fit to the continuum. adding aneutron star component to the plasma model produces less stringent constraintson the neutron star; a temperature of 36^{+4}_{-8} ev and l_{ns}(0.01-10kev)=1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}*10^{31} ergs/s. in the framework of the current theoryof neutron star heating and cooling, the constraints on the thermal luminosityof 1808 and 1h 1905+000 require strongly enhanced cooling in the cores of theseneutron stars.  we compile data from the literature on the mass transfer rates and quiescentthermal flux of the largest possible sample of transient neutron star lmxbs. weidentify a thermal component in the quiescent spectrum of the accretingmillisecond pulsar igr j00291+5934, which is consistent with the standardcooling model. the contrast between the cooling rates of igr j00291+5934 and1808 suggests that 1808 may have a significantly larger mass. this can beinterpreted as arising from differences in the binary evolution history orinitial neutron star mass in these otherwise similar systems.
