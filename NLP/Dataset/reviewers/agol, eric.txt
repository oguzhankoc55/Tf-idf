0901.0343	transit timing observations of the extrasolar hot-neptune planet gl 436b	gliese 436 is an m dwarf with a mass of 0.45 msun and hosts the extrasolarplanet gl 436b [3, 6, 7, 2], which is currently the least massive transitingplanet with a mass of ~23.17 mearth [10], and the only planet known to transitan m dwarf. gl 436b represents the first transiting detection of the class ofextrasolar planets known as "hot neptunes" that have masses within a few timesthat of neptune's mass (~17 mearth) and orbital semimajor axis &lt;0.1 au aboutthe host star. unlike most other known transiting extrasolar planets, gl 436bhas a high eccentricity (e~0.16). this brings to light a new parameter spacefor habitability zones of extrasolar planets with host star masses much smallerthan typical stars of roughly a solar mass. this unique system is an idealcandidate for orbital perturbation and transit-time variation (ttv) studies todetect smaller, possibly earth-mass planets in the system. in april 2008 webegan a long-term intensive campaign to obtain complete high-precision lightcurves using the apache point observatory's 3.5-meter telescope, nmsu's 1-metertelescope (located at apo), and sommers bausch observatory's 24" telescope.these light curves are being analyzed together, along with amateur and otherprofessional astronomer observations. results of our analysis are discussed.continued measurements over the next few years are needed to determine ifadditional planets reside in the system, and to study the impact of othermanifestations on the light curves, such as star spots and active regions.

0904.0275	detection of a companion lens galaxy using the mid-infrared flux ratios  of the gravitationally lensed quasar h1413+117	we present the first resolved mid-ir (11 micron) observations of thefour-image quasar lens h1413+117 using the michelle camera on gemini north. allprevious observations (optical, near-ir, and radio) of this lens show a "fluxanomaly," where the image flux ratios cannot be explained by a simple, centrallens galaxy. we attempt to reproduce the mid-ir flux ratios, which areinsensitive to extinction and microlensing, by modeling the main lens as asingular isothermal ellipsoid. this model fails to reproduce the flux ratios.however, we can explain the flux ratios simply by adding to the model a nearbygalaxy detected in the h-band by hst/nicmos-nic2. this perturbing galaxy lies4.0" from the main lens and it has a critical radius of 0.63" +/- 0.02" whichis similar to that of the main lens, as expected from their similar h-bandfluxes. more remarkably, this galaxy is not required to obtain a good fit tothe system astrometry, so this represents the first clear detection of anobject through its effect on the image fluxes of a gravitational lens. this isa parallel to the detections of visible satellites from astrometric anomalies,and provides a proof of the concept of searching for substructure in galaxiesusing anomalous flux ratios.

0905.1177	spitzer observations of a gravitationally lensed quasar, qso 2237+0305	the four-image gravitationally lensed quasar qso 2237+0305 is microlensed bystars in the lens galaxy. the amplitude of microlensing variability can be usedto infer the relative size of the quasar as a function of wavelength; thisprovides a test of quasar models. toward this end, we present spitzer spacetelescope infrared spectrograph and infrared array camera (irac) observationsof qso 2237+0305, finding the following. (1) the infrared (ir) spectral energydistribution (sed) is similar to that of other bright radio-quiet quasars,contrary to an earlier claim. (2) a dusty torus model with a small openingangle fits the overall shape of the ir sed well, but the quantitative agreementis poor due to an offset in wavelength of the silicate feature. (3) the fluxratios of the four lensed images can be derived from the irac data despitebeing unresolved. we find that the near-ir fluxes are increasingly affected bymicrolensing toward shorter wavelengths. (4) the wavelength dependence of theirac flux ratios is consistent with the standard quasar model in which anaccretion disk and a dusty torus both contribute near 1 micron in the restframe. this is also consistent with recent ir spectropolarimetry of nearbyquasars.

0906.3899	imaging an event horizon: submm-vlbi of a super massive black hole	a long standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe the immediateenvironment of a black hole with angular resolution comparable to the eventhorizon. realizing this goal would open a new window on the study of generalrelativity in the strong field regime, accretion and outflow processes at theedge of a black hole, the existence of an event horizon, and fundamental blackhole physics (e.g., spin). steady long-term progress on improving thecapability of very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) at short wavelengths hasnow made it extremely likely that this goal will be achieved within the nextdecade. the most compelling evidence for this is the recent observation by1.3mm vlbi of schwarzschild radius scale structure in sgra*, the compact sourceof radio, submm, nir and xrays at the center of the milky way. sgra* is thoughtto mark the position of a ~4 million solar mass black hole, and because of itsproximity and estimated mass presents the largest apparent event horizon sizeof any black hole candidate in the universe. over the next decade, existing andplanned mm/submm facilities will be combined into a high sensitivity, highangular resolution "event horizon telescope" that will bring us as close to theedge of black hole as we will come for decades. this white paper describes thescience case for mm/submm vlbi observations of both sgra* and m87 (a radio loudagn of a much more luminous class that sgra*). we emphasize that while there isdevelopment and procurement involved, the technical path forward is clear, andthe recent successful observations have removed much of the risk that wouldnormally be associated with such an ambitious project.

0908.1977	the 8 micron phase variation of the hot saturn hd 149026b	we monitor the star hd 149026 and its saturn-mass planet at 8.0 micron overslightly more than half an orbit using the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. we find an increase of 0.0227% +/- 0.0066% (3.4 sigmasignificance) in the combined planet-star flux during this interval. theminimum flux from the planet is 45% +/- 19% of the maximum planet flux,corresponding to a difference in brightness temperature of 480 +/- 140 kbetween the two hemispheres. we derive a new secondary eclipse depth of 0.0411%+/- 0.0076% in this band, corresponding to a dayside brightness temperature of1440 +/- 150 k. our new secondary eclipse depth is half that of a previousmeasurement (3.0 sigma difference) in this same bandpass by harrington et al.(2007). we re-fit the harrington et al. (2007) data and obtain a comparablygood fit with a smaller eclipse depth that is consistent with our new value. incontrast to earlier claims, our new eclipse depth suggests that this planet'sdayside emission spectrum is relatively cool, with an 8 micron brightnesstemperature that is less than the maximum planet-wide equilibrium temperature.we measure the interval between the transit and secondary eclipse and find thatthat the secondary eclipse occurs 20.9 +7.2 / -6.5 minutes earlier (2.9 sigma)than predicted for a circular orbit, a marginally significant result. thiscorresponds to e*cos(omega) = -0.0079 +0.0027 / -0.0025 where e is the planet'sorbital eccentricity and omega is the argument of pericenter.

0909.0267	millimeter flares and vlbi visibilities from relativistic simulations of  magnetized accretion onto the galactic center black hole	the recent vlbi observation of the galactic center black hole candidate sgra* at 1.3mm shows source structure on event-horizon scales. this detectionenables a direct comparison of the emission region with models of the accretionflow onto the black hole. we present the first results from time-dependentradiative transfer of general relativistic mhd simulation data, and comparesimulated synchrotron images at black hole spin a=0.9 with the vlbimeasurements. after tuning the accretion rate to match the millimeter flux, wefind excellent agreement between predicted and observed visibilities, even whenviewed face-on (i &lt; 30 degrees). vlbi measurements on 2000-3000km baselinesshould constrain the inclination. the data constrain the accretion rate to be(1.0-2.3)x10^-9 m_sun / yr with 99% confidence, consistent with but independentof prior estimates derived from spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements.finally, we compute light curves, which show that magnetic turbulence candirectly produce flaring events with .5 hour rise times, 2-3.5 hour durationsand 40-50% flux modulation, in agreement with observations of sgr a* atmillimeter wavelengths.

1001.0012	the statistics of albedo and heat recirculation on hot exoplanets	[abridged] if both the day-side and night-side effective temperatures of aplanet can be measured, it is possible to estimate its bond albedo, 0&lt;a_b&lt;1, aswell as its day-night heat redistribution efficiency, 0&lt;epsilon&lt;1. we attempt astatistical analysis of the albedo and redistribution efficiency for 24transiting exoplanets that have at least one published secondary eclipse. foreach planet, we show how to calculate a sub-stellar equilibrium temperature,t_0, and associated uncertainty. we then use a simple model-independenttechnique to estimate a planet's effective temperature from planet/star fluxratios. we use thermal secondary eclipse measurements -those obtained atlambda&gt;0.8 micron- to estimate day-side effective temperatures, t_d, andthermal phase variations -when available- to estimate night-side effectivetemperature. we strongly rule out the "null hypothesis" of a single a_b andepsilon for all 24 planets. if we allow each planet to have differentparameters, we find that low bond albedos are favored (a_b&lt;0.35 at 1 sigmaconfidence), which is an independent confirmation of the low albedos inferredfrom non-detection of reflected light. our sample exhibits a wide variety ofredistribution efficiencies. when normalized by t_0, the day-side effectivetemperatures of the 24 planets describe a uni-modal distribution. thedimensionless quantity t_d/t_0 exhibits no trend with the presence or absenceof stratospheric inversions. there is also no clear trend between t_d/t_0 andt_0. that said, the 6 planets with the greatest sub-stellar equilibriumtemperatures (t&gt;2400 k) have low epsilon, as opposed to the 18 cooler planets,which show a variety of recirculation efficiencies. this hints that the veryhottest transiting giant planets are qualitatively different from the merelyhot jupiters.

1005.4062	the submillimeter bump in sgr a* from relativistic mhd simulations	recent high resolution observations of the galactic center black hole allowfor direct comparison with accretion disk simulations. we comparetwo-temperature synchrotron emission models from three dimensional, generalrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to millimeter observations of sgra*. fits to very long baseline interferometry and spectral index measurementsdisfavor the monochromatic face-on black hole shadow models from our previouswork. inclination angles \le 20 degrees are ruled out to 3 \sigma. we estimatethe inclination and position angles of the black hole, as well as the electrontemperature of the accretion flow and the accretion rate, to be i=50+35-15degrees, \xi=-23+97-22 degrees, t_e=(5.4 +/- 3.0)x10^10 k andmdot=(5+15-2)x10^-9 m_sun / yr respectively, with 90% confidence. the blackhole shadow is unobscured in all best fit models, and may be detected byobservations on baselines between chile and california, arizona or mexico at1.3mm or .87mm either through direct sampling of the visibility amplitude orusing closure phase information. millimeter flaring behavior consistent withthe observations is present in all viable models, and is caused by magneticturbulence in the inner radii of the accretion flow. the variability atoptically thin frequencies is strongly correlated with that in the accretionrate. the simulations provide a universal picture of the 1.3mm emission regionas a small region near the midplane in the inner radii of the accretion flow,which is roughly isothermal and has \nu/\nu_c ~ 1-20, where \nu_c is thecritical frequency for thermal synchrotron emission.

1011.0428	a model for thermal phase variations of circular and eccentric  exoplanets	we present a semi-analytic model atmosphere for close-in exoplanets thatcaptures the essential physics of phase curves: orbital and viewing geometry,advection, and re-radiation. we calibrate the model with the well-characterizedtransiting planet, hd 189733b, then compute light curves for seven of the mosteccentric transiting planets. we present phase variations for a variety ofdifferent radiative times and wind speeds. in the limit of instantre-radiation, the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet'seccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads ortrails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from orapproaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. for a planet withnon-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super- rotatingwinds, and late for sub-rotating winds. we find that for a circular orbit, thetiming of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunctionindicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracybetween wind speed and radiative time. for circular planets the phase minimumoccurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum -despite the fact that thecoolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator- and therefore does notconvey any additional information. in general, increasing the advectivefrequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-troughamplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to thesetrends. lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longerthan their radiative time exhibit "ringing" whereby the hot spot generated atperiastron rotates in and out of view. the existence of ringing makes itpossible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) andthe radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing).

1011.1019	warm spitzer photometry of the transiting exoplanets corot-1 and corot-2  at secondary eclipse	we measure secondary eclipses of the hot giant exoplanets corot-1 at 3.6 and4.5 microns, and corot-2 at 3.6 microns, both using warm spitzer. we find thatthe warm spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science. forconsistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic spitzer datafor secondary eclipses of corot-2 at 4.5 and 8 microns. we compare the totaldata for both planets, including optical eclipse measurements by the corotmission, and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 microns, to existingmodels. both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 microns,which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. the spectrumof corot-1 is best reproduced by a 2460k blackbody, due either to a highaltitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermalregion in the planetary atmosphere. the spectrum of corot-2 is unusual becausethe 8 micron contrast is anomalously low. non-inverted atmospheres couldpotentially produce the corot-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emissionfrom co at 4.5 microns, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. however, theviability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannotbe more than about 30-percent larger than the planet's transit radius, based onthe ingress and egress times at eclipse. an alternative possibility to accountfor the spectrum of corot-2 is an additional opacity source that acts stronglyat wavelengths less than 5 microns, heating the upper atmosphere while allowingthe deeper atmosphere seen at 8 microns to remain cooler. we obtain a similarresult as gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of corot-2,implying an eccentric orbit with e*cos(omega)=-0.0030 +/- 0.0004.

1011.4066	secondary eclipse photometry of wasp-4b with warm spitzer	we present photometry of the giant extrasolar planet wasp-4b at 3.6 and 4.5micron taken with the infrared array camera on board the spitzer spacetelescope as part of spitzer's extended warm mission. we find secondary eclipsedepths of 0.319+/-0.031% and 0.343+/-0.027% for the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands,respectively and show model emission spectra and pressure-temperature profilesfor the planetary atmosphere. these eclipse depths are well fit by modelemission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption, similar to thoseused for tres-3 and hd 189733b. depending on our choice of model, these resultsindicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or noinversion at all. the absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highlyirradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets areexpected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber inthe upper atmosphere. this result might be explained by the modestly enhancedactivity level of wasp-4b's g7v host star, which could increase the amount ofuv flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknownstratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in knutson etal. (2010). we also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of thesecondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain thisplanet's inflated radius.

1012.3169	quasar accretion disks are strongly inhomogeneous	active galactic nuclei (agn) have been observed to vary stochastically with10-20 rms amplitudes over a range of optical wavelengths where the emissionarises in an accretion disk. since the accretion disk is unlikely to varycoherently, local fluctuations may be significantly larger than the global rmsvariability. we investigate toy models of quasar accretion disks consisting ofa number of regions, n, whose temperatures vary independently with an amplitudeof \sigma_t in dex. models with large fluctuations (\sigma_t=0.35-0.50) in100-1000 independently fluctuating zones for every factor of two in radius canexplain the observed discrepancy between thin accretion disk sizes inferredfrom microlensing events and optical luminosity while matching the observedoptical variability. for the same range of \sigma_t, inhomogeneous disk spectraprovide excellent fits to the hst quasar composite without invoking globalcompton scattering atmospheres to explain the high levels of observed uvemission. simulated microlensing light curves for the einstein cross from ourtime-varying toy models are well fit using a time-steady power-law temperaturedisk, and produce magnification light curves that are consistent with currentmicrolensing observations. deviations due to the inhomogeneous, time-dependentdisk structure should occur above the 1% level in the light curves, detectablein future microlensing observations with millimag sensitivity.

1102.4345	rotational variability of earth's polar regions: implications for  detecting snowball planets	we have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations ofearth's poles with the deep impact spacecraft as part of the epoxi mission ofopportunity. these data mimic what we will see when we point next-generationspace telescopes at nearby exoplanets. we use principal component analysis(pca) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneitiesand map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as acomplement to the equatorial views presented in cowan et al. (2009). we alsoperform the same pca on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurvesfrom nasa's virtual planetary laboratory 3d spectral earth model. thisnumerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features pcacan robustly identify. we find that the epoxi polar observations have similarbroadband colors as the equatorial earth, but with 20-30% greater apparentalbedo. this is because the polar observations are most sensitive tomid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudesemphasized by the original epoxi earth observations. the cloudiness of themid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability atshort wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolorin the south polar observation. we construct a simple reflectance model for asnowball earth. by construction, our model has a higher bond albedo than themodern earth; its surface albedo is so high that rayleigh scattering does notnoticeably affect its spectrum. the rotational color variations occur at shortwavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land inthose wavebands. thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal colorvariations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-dayearth, regardless of viewing angle.

1104.2901	a spitzer transmission spectrum for the exoplanet gj 436b, evidence for  stellar variability, and constraints on dayside flux variations	in this paper we describe a uniform analysis of eight transits and elevensecondary eclipses of the extrasolar planet gj 436b obtained in the 3.6, 4.5,and 8.0 micron bands using the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescopebetween ut 2007 june 29 and ut 2009 feb 4. we find that the best-fit transitdepths for visits in the same bandpass can vary by as much as 8% of the total(4.7 sigma significance) from one epoch to the next. although we cannotentirely rule out residual detector effects or a time-varying, high-altitudecloud layer in the planet's atmosphere as the cause of these variations, weconsider the occultation of active regions on the star in a subset of thetransit observations to be the most likely explanation. we reconcile thepresence of magnetically active regions with the lack of significant visible orinfrared flux variations from the star by proposing that the star's spin axisis tilted with respect to our line of sight, and that the planet's orbit istherefore likely to be misaligned. these observations serve to illustrate thechallenges associated with transmission spectroscopy of planets orbitinglate-type stars; we expect that other systems, such as gj 1214, may displaycomparably variable transit depths. our measured 8 micron secondary eclipsedepths are consistent with a constant value, and we place a 1 sigma upper limitof 17% on changes in the planet's dayside flux in this band. averaging over theeleven visits gives us an improved estimate of 0.0452% +/- 0.0027% for thesecondary eclipse depth. we combine timing information from our observationswith previously published data to produce a refined orbital ephemeris, anddetermine that the best-fit transit and eclipse times are consistent with aconstant orbital period.

1111.5858	warm spitzer photometry of xo-4b, hat-p-6b and hat-p-8b	we have analyzed warm spitzer/irac observations of the secondary eclipses ofthree planets, xo-4b, hat-p-6b and hat-p-8b. we measure secondary eclipseamplitudes at 3.6{\mu}m and 4.5{\mu}m for each target. xo-4b exhibits astronger eclipse depth at 4.5{\mu}m than at 3.6{\mu}m, which is consistent withthe presence of a temperature inversion. hat-p-8b shows a stronger eclipseamplitude at 3.6{\mu}m, and is best-described by models without a temperatureinversion. the eclipse depths of hat-p-6b can be fitted with models with asmall or no temperature inversion. we consider our results in the context of apostulated relationship between stellar activity and temperature inversions anda relationship between irradiation level and planet dayside temperature, asdiscussed by knutson et al. (2010) and cowan &amp; agol (2011), respectively. ourresults are consistent with these hypotheses, but do not significantlystrengthen them. to measure accurate secondary eclipse central phases, werequire accurate ephemerides. we obtain primary transit observations andsupplement them with publicly available observations to update the orbitalephemerides of the three planets. based on the secondary eclipse timing, we setupper boundaries for e cos(\omega) for hat-p-6b, hat-p-8b and xo-4b and findthat the values are consistent with circular orbits.

0710.4145	observations of extrasolar planets during the non-cryogenic spitzer  space telescope mission	precision infrared photometry from spitzer has enabled the first directstudies of light from extrasolar planets, via observations at secondary eclipsein transiting systems. current spitzer results include the first longitudinaltemperature map of an extrasolar planet, and the first spectra of theiratmospheres. spitzer has also measured a temperature and precise radius for thefirst transiting neptune-sized exoplanet, and is beginning to make precisetransit timing measurements to infer the existence of unseen low mass planets.the lack of stellar limb darkening in the infrared facilitates precise radiusand transit timing measurements of transiting planets. warm spitzer will becapable of a precise radius measurement for earth-sized planets transitingnearby m-dwarfs, thereby constraining their bulk composition. it will continueto measure thermal emission at secondary eclipse for transiting hot jupiters,and be able to distinguish between planets having broad band emission versusabsorption spectra. it will also be able to measure the orbital phase variationof thermal emission for close-in planets, even non-transiting planets, andthese measurements will be of special interest for planets in eccentric orbits.warm spitzer will be a significant complement to kepler, particularly asregards transit timing in the kepler field. in addition to studying close-inplanets, warm spitzer will have significant application in sensitive imagingsearches for young planets at relatively large angular separations from theirparent stars.

(2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1206.4695	rapid dynamical chaos in an exoplanetary system	we report on the long-term dynamical evolution of the two-planet kepler-36system, which we studied through numerical integrations of initial conditionsthat are consistent with observations of the system. the orbits are chaoticwith a lyapunov time of only ~10 years. the chaos is a consequence of aparticular set of orbital resonances, with the inner planet orbiting 34 timesfor every 29 orbits of the outer planet. the rapidity of the chaos is due tothe interaction of the 29:34 resonance with the nearby first order 6:7resonance, in contrast to the usual case in which secular terms in thehamiltonian play a dominant role. only one contiguous region of phase space,accounting for ~4.5% of the sample of initial conditions studied, correspondsto planetary orbits that do not show large scale orbital instabilities on thetimescale of our integrations (~200 million years). the long-lived subset ofthe allowed initial conditions are those that satisfy the hill stabilitycriterion by the largest margin. any successful theory for the formation ofthis system will need to account for why its current state is so close tounstable regions of phase space.

1211.1709	three dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulations of the highly  irradiated short period exoplanet hd189733b	we present a detailed three-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamical simulationof the well known irradiated exoplanet hd189733b. our model solves the fullycompressible navier-stokes equations coupled to wavelength-dependent radiativetransfer throughout the entire planetary envelope. we provide detailedcomparisons between the extensive observations of this system and predictionscalculated directly from the numerical models. the atmospheric dynamics ischaracterized by supersonic winds that fairly efficiently advect energy fromthe dayside to the nightside. super-rotating equatorial jets form for a widerange of pressures from 10^-5 to 10 bars while counter rotating jets form athigher latitudes. calculated transit spectrum agree well with the data from theinfrared to the uv including the strong rayleigh scattering seen at shortwavelength, though we slightly under-predict the observations at wavelengthsshorter then ~0.6 microns. our predicted emission spectrum agrees remarkablywell at 5.8 and 8 microns, but slightly over-predicts the emission at 3.6 and4.5 microns when compared to the latest analysis by knutson et. al (2012). oursimulated irac phasecurves agree fairly well with the amplitudes of variations,shape, and phases of minimum and maximum flux. however, we over-predict thepeak amplitude at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and slightly under-predict the locationof the phasecurve maximum and minimum. these simulations include, for the firsttime in a multi-dimensional simulation, a strong rayleigh scattering componentto the absorption opacity, necessary to explain observations in the optical anduv. the agreement between our models and observations suggest that includingthe effects of condensates in simulations as the dominant form of opacity willbe very important in future models.

(2009), the a2/a1 flux ratio is nearly 5-sigma from the expected ratiofor a model based on the two visible lens galaxies. the mid-ir flux ratioanomaly can be explained by a satellite (substructure), 0.3" northeast of imagea2, as can the detailed vlbi structures of the jet produced by the quasar. whenwe combine the mid-ir flux ratios with high-resolution vlbi measurements, wefind a best-fit mass between 10^(6.2) and 10^(7.5) m_sol inside the einsteinradius for a satellite substructure modeled as a singular isothermal sphere atthe redshift of the main lens (z_l=0.96). we are unable to set an interestinglimit on the mass to light ratio due to its proximity to the quasar image a2.while the observations used here were technically difficult, surveys of fluxanomalies in gravitational lenses with the james webb space telescope will besimple, fast, and should well constrain the abundance of substructure in darkmatter haloes.

1301.3955	observations of the wasp-2 system by the apostle program	we present transit observations of the wasp-2 exoplanet system by the apachepoint survey of transit lightcurves of exoplanets (apostle) program. modelfitting to these data allows us to improve measurements of the hot-jupiterexoplanet wasp-2b and its orbital parameters by a factor of ~2 over priorstudies; we do not find evidence for transit depth variations. we do findreduced chi^2 values greater than 1.0 in the observed minus computed transittimes. a sinusoidal fit to the residuals yields a timing semi-amplitude of 32seconds and a period of 389 days. however, random rearrangements of the dataprovide similar quality fits, and we cannot with certainty ascribe the timingvariations to mutual exoplanet interactions. this inconclusive result isconsistent with the lack of incontrovertible transit timing variations (ttvs)observed in other hot-jupiter systems. this outcome emphasizes that uniquerecognition of ttvs requires dense sampling of the libration cycle (e.g.continuous observations from space-based platforms). however, even in systemsobserved with the kepler spacecraft, there is a noted lack of transitingcompanions and ttvs in hot-jupiter systems. this result is more meaningful, andindicates that hot-jupiter systems, while they are easily observable from theground, do not appear to be currently configured in a manner favorable to thedetection of ttvs. the future of ground-based ttv studies may reside inresolving secular trends, and/or implementation at extreme quality observingsites to minimize atmospheric red noise.

1301.6147	a search for exozodiacal clouds with kepler	planets embedded within dust disks may drive the formation of large scaleclumpy dust structures by trapping dust into resonant orbits. detection andsubsequent modeling of the dust structures would help constrain the mass andorbit of the planet and the disk architecture, give clues to the history of theplanetary system, and provide a statistical estimate of disk asymmetry forfuture exoearth-imaging missions. here we present the first search for theseresonant structures in the inner regions of planetary systems by analyzing thelight curves of hot jupiter planetary candidates identified by the keplermission. we detect only one candidate disk structure associated with koi 838.01at the 3-sigma confidence level, but subsequent radial velocity measurementsreveal that koi 838.01 is a grazing eclipsing binary and the candidate diskstructure is a false positive. using our null result, we place an upper limiton the frequency of dense exozodi structures created by hot jupiters. we findthat at the 90% confidence level, less than 21% of kepler hot jupiters createresonant dust clumps that lead and trail the planet by ~90 degrees with opticaldepths &gt;~5*10^-6, which corresponds to the resonant structure expected for alone hot jupiter perturbing a dynamically cold dust disk 50 times as dense asthe zodiacal cloud.

(2002). model atmospheres havinguniformly-distributed extra opacity of 0.012 cm^2 per gram accountapproximately for both our water measurement and the sodium absorption in thisplanet. our results for hd209458b support the picture advocated by pont et al.(2013) in which weak molecular absorptions are superposed on a transmissionspectrum that is dominated by continuous opacity due to haze and/or dust.however, the extra opacity needed for hd209458b is grayer than for hd189733b,with a weaker rayleigh component.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

1309.0009	habitable planets around white dwarfs: an alternate mission for the  kepler spacecraft	a large fraction of white dwarfs (wds) may host planets in their habitablezones. these planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on atransiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between theearth-sized wd and its earth-sized planets. the jwst is capable of obtainingthe first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no knownplanets around wds. here we propose to take advantage of the unique capabilityof the kepler spacecraft in the 2-wheels mode to perform a transit survey thatis capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a wd. wepropose to obtain kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 wds in the sdssimaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. thanks to the largefield of view of kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of wdscan be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.our proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and willfind up to 100 planets in the wd habitable zone. this survey will maintainkepler's spirit of searching for habitable earths, but near new hosts. withfew-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up acompletely unexplored discovery space. in addition to planets, this survey issensitive to pulsating wds, as well as eclipsing short period stellar andsubstellar companions. these have important implications for constraining thedouble wd merger rate and their contribution to type ia supernovae and thegravitational wave foreground. given the relatively low number density of ourtargets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefitfrom high cadence and many-fields observations with kepler, e.g. a transitsurvey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby m dwarfs orasteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. rr lyrae) in the same fields.

0705.0993	a map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet hd 189733b	"hot jupiter" extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked becausethey are close (&lt;0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average sun-earthdistance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides andnightsides. by observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipseeach other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of thedaysides of these planets. a key question is whether the atmosphere is able totransport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which willdetermine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. here wereport observations of hd 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetarysystems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' ofthe distribution of temperatures. we detected the increase in brightness as thedayside of the planet rotated into view. we estimate a minimum brightnesstemperature of 973 +/- 33 k and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11k at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiateddayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast toa recent claim for another hot jupiter. our data indicate that the peakhemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16$\pm$6 degrees before opposition,corresponding to a hot spot shifted east of the substellar point. the secondaryeclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later thanpredicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.

0802.1705	multi-wavelength constraints on the day-night circulation patterns of hd  189733b	we present new spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot jupiterhd 189733b in the mips 24 micron bandpass, spanning the same part of theplanet's orbit as our previous observations in the irac 8 micron bandpass(knutson et al. 2007). we find that the minimum hemisphere-averaged flux fromthe planet in this bandpass is 76 +/- 3% of the maximum flux; this correspondsto minimum and maximum hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/-48 k and 1220 +/- 47 k, respectively. the planet reaches its maximum flux at anorbital phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20-30degrees east of the substellar point. because tidally locked hot jupiters wouldhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, thesmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet'satmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the nightside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperaturedifferences. the similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for hd189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in afundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these twowavelengths. one-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8micron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,although the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. ifthese two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that thetemperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence thatthe atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.

1401.1211	evidence for large temperature fluctuations in quasar accretion disks  from spectral variability	the well-known bluer-when-brighter trend observed in quasar variability is asignature of the complex processes in the accretion disk, and can be a probe ofthe quasar variability mechanism. using a sample of 604 variable quasars withrepeat spectra in sdss-i/ii, we construct difference spectra to investigate thephysical causes of this bluer-when-brighter trend. the continuum of ourcomposite difference spectrum is well-fit by a power-law, with a spectral indexin excellent agreement with previous results. we measure the spectralvariability relative to the underlying spectra of the quasars, which isindependent of any extinction, and compare to model predictions. we show thatour sdss spectral variability results cannot be produced by global accretionrate fluctuations in a thin disk alone. however, we find that a simple model ofa inhomogeneous disk with localized temperature fluctuations will producepower-law spectral variability over optical wavelengths. we show that theinhomogeneous disk will provide good fits to our observed spectral variabilityif the disk has large temperature fluctuations in many independently varyingzones, in excellent agreement with independent constraints from quasarmicrolensing disk sizes, their strong uv spectral continuum, and single-bandvariability amplitudes. our results provide an independent constraint on quasarvariability models, and add to the mounting evidence that quasar accretiondisks have large localized temperature fluctuations.

1403.1895	ttvfast: an efficient and accurate code for transit timing inversion  problems	transit timing variations (ttvs) have proven to be a powerful technique forconfirming kepler planet candidates, for detecting non-transiting planets, andfor constraining the masses and orbital elements of multi-planet systems. thesettv applications often require the numerical integration of orbits forcomputation of transit times (as well as impact parameters and durations);frequently tens of millions to billions of simulations are required whenrunning statistical analyses of the planetary system properties. we havecreated a fast code for transit timing computation, ttvfast, which uses asymplectic integrator with a keplerian interpolator for the calculation oftransit times (nesvorny et al. 2013). the speed comes at the expense ofaccuracy in the calculated times, but the accuracy lost is largely unnecessary,as transit times do not need to be calculated to accuracies significantlysmaller than the measurement uncertainties on the times. the time step can betuned to give sufficient precision for any particular system. we find aspeed-up of at least an order of magnitude relative to dynamical integrationswith high precision using a bulirsch-stoer integrator.

0803.3622	inverting phase functions to map exoplanets	we describe how to generate a longitudinal brightness map for a tidallylocked exoplanet from its phase function light curve. we operate under a numberof simplifying assumptions, neglecting limb darkening/brightening, star spots,detector ramps, as well as time-variability over a single planetary rotation.we develop the transformation from a planetary brightness map to a phasefunction light curve and simplify the expression for the case of an edge-onsystem. we introduce two models--composed of longitudinal slices of uniformbrightness, and sinusoidally varying maps, respectively--which greatly simplifythe transformation from map to light curve. we discuss numerical approaches toextracting a longitudinal map from a phase function light curve, explaining howto estimate the uncertainty in a computed map and how to choose an appropriatenumber of fit parameters. we demonstrate these techniques on a simulated mapand discuss the uses and limitations of longitudinal maps. the sinusoidal modelprovides a better fit to the planet's underlying brightness map, although theslice model is more appropriate for light curves which only span a fraction ofthe planet's orbit. regardless of which model is used, we find that there is amaximum of ~5 free parameters which can be meaningfully fit based on a fullphase function light curve, due to the insensitivity of the latter to certainmodes of the map.

1411.0004	measurement of planet masses with transit timing variations due to  synodic "chopping" effects	gravitational interactions between planets in transiting exoplanetary systemslead to variations in the times of transit that are diagnostic of the planetarymasses and the dynamical state of the system. here we show that synodic"chopping" contributions to these transit timing variations (ttvs) can be usedto uniquely measure the masses of planets without full dynamical analysesinvolving direct integration of the equations of motion. we present simpleanalytic formulae for the chopping signal, which are valid (generally &lt;10%error) for modest eccentricities e &lt;~ 0.1. importantly, these formulaeprimarily depend on the mass of the perturbing planet, and therefore thechopping signal can be used to break the mass/free-eccentricity degeneracywhich can appear for systems near first order mean motion resonances. using aharmonic analysis, we apply these ttv formulae to a number of kepler systemswhich had been previously analyzed with full dynamical analyses. we show thatwhen chopping is measured, the masses of both planets can be determineduniquely, in agreement with previous results, but without the need fornumerical orbit integrations. this demonstrates how mass measurements from ttvsmay primarily arise from an observable chopping signal. the formula forchopping can also be used to predict the number of transits and timingprecision required for future observations, such as those made by tess orplato, in order to infer planetary masses through analysis of ttvs.

0704.0632	detecting and characterizing planetary systems with transit timing	in the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance twogoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar tothe earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. we present anew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towardsboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that isable to make the requisite observations. in a system where a known planettransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the timebetween transits to vary. these transit timing variations can be used to inferthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a massthat is smaller than the mass of the earth. this detection techniquecomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motionresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reducedsensitivity. small ground-based observatories have already exceeded thephotometric precision necessary to detect sub-earth mass planets. however, ttvplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number ofhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existingtelescopes. these issues will be compounded as the number of known transitingplanets suitable for ttv study will increase substantially in the near future.a relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramaticallyincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

1505.03158	3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m phase curves of the highly-irradiated eccentric hot  jupiter wasp-14b	we present full-orbit phase curve observations of the eccentric ($e\sim0.08$) transiting hot jupiter wasp-14b obtained in the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m bandsusing the \textit{spitzer space telescope}. we use two different methods forremoving the intrapixel sensitivity effect and compare their efficacy indecoupling the instrumental noise. our measured secondary eclipse depths of$0.1882\%\pm 0.0048\%$ and $0.2247\%\pm 0.0086\%$ at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m,respectively, are both consistent with a blackbody temperature of $2402\pm 35$k. we place a $2\sigma$ upper limit on the nightside flux at 3.6 $\mu$m andfind it to be $9\%\pm 1\%$ of the dayside flux, corresponding to a brightnesstemperature of 1079 k. at 4.5 $\mu$m, the minimum planet flux is $30\%\pm 5\%$of the maximum flux, corresponding to a brightness temperature of $1380\pm 65$k. we compare our measured phase curves to the predictions of one-dimensionalradiative transfer and three-dimensional general circulation models. we findthat wasp-14b's measured dayside emission is consistent with a model atmospherewith equilibrium chemistry and a moderate temperature inversion. these samemodels tend to over-predict the nightside emission at 3.6 $\mu$m, whileunder-predicting the nightside emission at 4.5 $\mu$m. we propose that thisdiscrepancy might be explained by an enhanced global c/o ratio. in addition, wefind that the phase curves of wasp-14b ($7.8 m_{\mathrm{jup}}$) are consistentwith a much lower albedo than those of other jovian mass planets with thermalphase curve measurements, suggesting that it may be emitting detectable heatfrom the deep atmosphere or interior processes.

1508.00902	spitzer secondary eclipse observations of five cool gas giant planets  and empirical trends in cool planet emission spectra	in this work we present spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron secondary eclipseobservations of five new cool (&lt;1200 k) transiting gas giant planets:hat-p-19b, wasp-6b, wasp-10b, wasp-39b, and wasp-67b. we compare our measuredeclipse depths to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and toeclipse depths for planets with previously published observations in order toconstrain the temperature- and mass-dependent properties of gas giant planetatmospheres. we find that the dayside emission spectra of planets less massivethan jupiter require models with efficient circulation of energy to the nightside and/or increased albedos, while those with masses greater than that ofjupiter are consistently best-matched by models with inefficient circulationand low albedos. at these relatively low temperatures we expect the atmosphericmethane to co ratio to vary as a function of metallicity, and we therefore useour observations of these planets to constrain their atmospheric metallicities.we find that the most massive planets have dayside emission spectra that arebest-matched by solar metallicity atmosphere models, but we are not able toplace strong constraints on metallicities of the smaller planets in our sample.interestingly, we find that the ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron brightnesstemperatures for these cool transiting planets is independent of planettemperature, and instead exhibits a tentative correlation with planet mass. ifthis trend can be confirmed, it would suggest that the shape of these planets'emission spectra depends primarily on their masses, consistent with thehypothesis that lower-mass planets are more likely to have metal-richatmospheres.

1511.06064	spectral eclipse timing	we utilize multi-dimensional simulations of varying equatorial jet strengthto predict wavelength dependent variations in the eclipse times of gas-giantplanets. a displaced hot-spot introduces an asymmetry in the secondary eclipselight curve that manifests itself as a measured offset in the timing of thecenter of eclipse. a multi-wavelength observation of secondary eclipse, oneprobing the timing of barycentric eclipse at short wavelengths and anotherprobing at longer wavelengths, will reveal the longitudinal displacement of thehot-spot and break the degeneracy between this effect and that associated withthe asymmetry due to an eccentric orbit. the effect of time offsets was firstexplored in the irac wavebands by williams et. al (2006). here we improve upontheir methodology, extend to a broad ranges of wavelengths, and demonstrate ourtechnique on a series of multi-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamical simulationsof hd 209458b with varying equatorial jet strength and hot-spot displacement.simulations with the largest hot-spot displacement result in timing offsets ofup to 100 seconds in the infrared. though we utilize a particular radiativehydrodynamical model to demonstrate this effect, the technique is modelindependent. this technique should allow a much larger survey of hot-spotdisplacements with jwst then currently accessible with time-intensive phasecurves, hopefully shedding light on the physical mechanisms associated withthermal energy advection in irradiated gas-giants.

astro-ph;0203257	finding black holes with microlensing	the macho and ogle collaborations have argued that the three longest durationbulge microlensing events are likely caused by nearby black holes, given thesmall velocities measured with microlensing parallax and nondetection of thelenses. however, these events may be due to lensing by more numerous lower massstars at greater distances. we find a posteriori probabilities of 76%, 16%, and4% that the three longest events are black holes, assuming a salpeter initialmass function (imf) and a 40 m cutoff for neutron star progenitors; the numbersdepend strongly on the assumed mass function but favor a black hole for thelongest event for most standard imfs. the longest events (&gt;600 days) have an apriori 26% probability of being black holes for a standard mass function. wepropose a new technique for measuring the lens mass function using the massdistribution of long events measured with the advanced camera for surveys onthe hubble space telescope, the very large telescope interferometer, the spaceinterferometry mission, or the global astrometric interferometer forastrophysics.

astro-ph;0303457	microlensing of large sources	we prove a gravitational lensing theorem: the magnification of a source ofuniform brightness by a foreground spherical lens is mu =1+pi(2r_e^2-r_l^2)/a,where a is the area of the source and r_e and r_l are the einstein radius andsize of the lens projected into the source plane; this provides an accurateapproximation to the exact magnification for r_l^2,r_e^2 &lt;&lt; a. remarkably, thisresult is independent of the shape of the source or position of the lens(except near the edges). we show that this formula can be generalized toinclude limb-darkening of a circular source by simply inserting thesurface-brightness at the position of the foreground object (divided by theaverage surface-brightness of the star). we also show that similar formulaeapply for a point-mass lens contained in a shear field and mass sheet, and foran ensemble of point masses as long as the einstein radii are much smaller thanthe source size. this theorem may be used to compute transit or microlensinglightcurves for which the foreground star or planet has a size and einsteinradius much smaller than the background star.

astro-ph;0610697	rounding up the wanderers: optimizing coronagraphic searches for  extrasolar planets	i derive analytic scalings for coronagraphic imaging searches for extrasolarplanets. i compute the efficiency of detecting planets about any given star,and from this compute dimensionless distribution functions for the detectedplanets as a function of planet-star distance and distance to the host stars. ifind the following for blind planet surveys: (1) the optimum wavelength isbetween 4000-5000 angstroms for earth-like planets and 4200-5800 angstroms forjovian planets; (2) between 21-32% of the number of planets per decade ofradius can be detected with an optimized survey; (3) target stars should beranked from greatest to least by their luminosity divided by distance to thesixth or eighth power, depending on the dominant source of noise for thesurvey; (4) surveys targeting all main sequence stars will detect ~3 times asmany planets as surveys only targeting g-type stars; and (5) stellarpopulations with different metallicities should have exposure times that varywith the cube of the metallicity. i apply these results to the current suite ofproposed coronagraphic satellite telescopes, of which tpf-c is the mostpowerful, but a much smaller telescope, tops, may have a significant chance ofdetecting earth-sized planets due to its small inner working angle and highthroughput. the most significant uncertainty in these results is the noisecontribution of exo-zodiacal light. these results can be applied to designingcoronagraphs, comparing proposed telescope designs, optimizing the observingstrategies, determining the properties of detected planet populations, andselecting target stars.

astro-ph;0612442	developments in planet detection using transit timing variations	in a transiting planetary system, the presence of a second planet will causethe time interval between transits to vary. these transit timing variations(ttv) are particularly large near mean-motion resonances and can be used toinfer the orbital elements of planets with masses that are too small to detectby any other means. i present the results of a study of simulated data where ishow the potential that this planet detection technique has to detect andcharacterize secondary planets in transiting systems. these results haveimportant ramifications for planetary transit searches since each transitingsystem presents an opportunity for additional discoveries through a ttvanalysis. i present such an analysis for 13 transits of the hd 209458 systemthat were observed with the hubble space telescope. this analysis indicatesthat a putative companion in a low-order, mean-motion resonance can be nolarger than the mass of the earth and constitutes, to date, the most sensitiveprobe for extrasolar planets that orbit main sequence stars. the presence orabsence of small planets in low-order, mean-motion resonances has implicationsfor theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. since ttv ismost sensitive in these regimes, it should prove a valuable tool not only forthe detection of additional planets in transiting systems, but also as a way todetermine the dominant mechanisms of planet formation and the evolution ofplanetary systems.

astro-ph;9612171	polarization from magnetized accretion discs: ii. the effects of  absorption opacity on faraday rotation	equipartition magnetic fields can dramatically affect the polarization ofradiation emerging from accretion disk atmospheres in active galactic nuclei.we extend our previous work on this subject by exploring the interactionbetween faraday rotation and absorption opacity in local, plane-parallelatmospheres with parameters appropriate for accretion discs. faraday rotationin pure scattering atmospheres acts to depolarize the radiation field byrotating the polarization planes of photons after last scattering. absorptionopacity in an unmagnetized atmosphere can increase or decrease the polarizationcompared to the pure scattering case, depending on the thermal source functiongradient. combining both faraday rotation and absorption opacity, we find thefollowing results. if absorption opacity is much larger than scattering opacitythroughout the atmosphere, then faraday rotation generally has only a smalleffect on the emerging polarization because of the small electron columndensity along a photon mean free path. however, if the absorption opacity isnot too large and it acts alone to increase the polarization, then the effectsof faraday rotation can be enhanced over those in a pure scattering atmosphere.finally, while faraday rotation often depolarizes the radiation field, it canin some cases increase the polarization when the thermal source function doesnot rise too steeply with optical depth. we confirm the correctness of thesilant'ev (1979) analytic calculation of the high magnetic field limit of thepure scattering atmosphere, which we incorrectly disputed in our previouspaper.

astro-ph;9905111	imaging a quasar accretion disk with microlensing	we show how analysis of a quasar high-magnification microlensing event may beused to construct a map of the frequency-dependent surface brightness of thequasar accretion disk. the same procedure also allows determination of the diskinclination angle, the black hole mass (modulo the caustic velocity), andpossibly the black hole spin. this method depends on the validity of oneassumption: that the optical and ultraviolet continuum of the quasar isproduced on the surface of an azimuthally symmetric, flat equatorial disk,whose gas follows prograde circular orbits in a kerr spacetime (and plungesinside the marginally stable orbit). given this assumption, we advocate using avariant of first-order linear regularization to invert multi-frequencymicrolensing lightcurves to obtain the disk surface brightness as a function ofradius and frequency. the other parameters can be found by minimizingchi-square in a fashion consistent with the regularized solution for thesurface brightness.  we present simulations for a disk model appropriate to the einstein crossquasar, an object uniquely well-suited to this approach. these simulationsconfirm that the surface brightness can be reconstructed quite well near itspeak, and that there are no systematic errors in determining the other modelparameters. we also discuss the observational requirements for successfulimplementation of this technique.

astro-ph;9908049	magnetic stress at the marginally stable orbit: altered disk structure,  radiation, and black hole spin evolution	magnetic connections to the plunging region can exert stresses on the inneredge of an accretion disk around a black hole. we recompute the relativisticcorrections to the thin-disk dynamics equations when these stresses take theform of a time-steady torque on the inner edge of the disk. the additionaldissipation associated with these stresses is concentrated relatively closeoutside the marginally stable orbit, scaling as r to the -7/2 at large radius.as a result of these additional stresses: spin-up of the central black hole isretarded; the maximum spin-equilibrium accretion efficiency is 36%, and occursat a/m=0.94; the disk spectrum is extended toward higher frequencies; lineprofiles (such as fe k-alpha) are broadened if the line emissivity scales withlocal flux; limb-brightening, especially at the higher frequencies, isenhanced; and the returning radiation fraction is substantially increased, upto 58%. this last effect creates possible explanations for both synchronizedcontinuum fluctuations in agn, and polarization rises shortward of the lymanedge in quasars. we show that no matter what additional stresses occur, whena/m &lt; 0.36, the second law of black hole dynamics sets an absolute upper boundon the accretion efficiency.

astro-ph;9912263	viewing the shadow of the black hole at the galactic center	in recent years, the evidence for the existence of an ultra-compactconcentration of dark mass associated with the radio source sgr a* in thegalactic center has become very strong. however, an unambiguous proof that thisobject is indeed a black hole is still lacking. a defining characteristic of ablack hole is the event horizon. to a distant observer, the event horizon castsa relatively large ``shadow'' with an apparent diameter of ~10 gravitationalradii due to bending of light by the black hole, nearly independent of theblack hole spin or orientation. the predicted size (~30 micro-arcseconds) ofthis shadow for sgr a* approaches the resolution of currentradio-interferometers. if the black hole is maximally spinning and viewededge-on, then the shadow will be offset by ~8 micro-arcseconds from the centerof mass, and will be slightly flattened on one side. taking into accountscatter-broadening of the image in the interstellar medium and the finiteachievable telescope resolution, we show that the shadow of sgr a* may beobservable with very long-baseline interferometry at sub-millimeterwavelengths, assuming that the accretion flow is optically thin in this regionof the spectrum. hence, there exists a realistic expectation of imaging theevent horizon of a black hole within the next few years.
