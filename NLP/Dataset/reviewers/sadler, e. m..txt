0911.4571	atlbs: the australia telescope low-brightness survey	we present a radio survey carried out with the australia telescope compactarray. a motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of thediffuse emission components as a step towards a study of the cosmic evolutionin radio source structure and the contribution from radio-mode feedback ongalaxy evolution. the australia telescope low-brightness survey (atlbs) at 1388mhz covers 8.42 sq deg of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield imageswith exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. the atlbsradio images, made with 0.08 mjy/beam rms noise and 50" beam, detect a total of1094 sources with peak flux exceeding 0.4 mjy/beam. the atlbs source countswere corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beamattenuation; the normalized differential source counts are consistent with noupturn down to 0.6 mjy. the percentage integrated polarization pi_0 wascomputed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarizedintensity; pi_0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing flux density.simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images,with 5" beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. theobservations provide a measurement of the complexity and diffuse emissionassociated with mjy and sub-mjy radio sources. 10% of the atlbs sources havemore than half of their flux density in extended emission and the fractionalflux in diffuse components does not appear to vary with flux density, althoughthe percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with fluxdensity. the observations are consistent with a transition in the nature ofextended radio sources from fr-ii radio source morphology, which dominates themjy population, to fr-i structure at sub-mjy flux density.

1003.0667	the evolution of extragalactic radio sources	a model for the evolution of low-luminosity radio galaxies is presented. inthe model, the lobes inflated by low-power jets are assumed to expand in nearpressure-balance against the external medium. both cases of constant externalpressure and decreasing external pressure are considered. evolution of anindividual source is described by the power-size track. the source appears asits lobe is inflated and radio luminosity increases to above the detectionlevel; the source then moves along the track and eventually disappears as itsluminosity drops below the detection limit. the power-size tracks arecalculated including the combined energy losses due to synchrotron radiation,adiabatic expansion, and inverse compton scattering. it is shown that ingeneral, the constant-pressure model predicts an excess number of luminous,small-size sources while underpredicting large-size sources in the power-sizediagram. the predicted spectra are steep for most sources, which isinconsistent with observations. by comparison, the pressure-limiting model fitsobservations better. in this model, low-luminosity sources undergo substantialexpansion losses in the initial phase and as a result, it predicts fewerluminous, small-size sources. the resultant spectra are flat for most sourcesexcept for the oldest ones, which seems consistent with observations. thepower-size tracks, in contrast to that of high-luminosity radio galaxies, arecharacterized by a slow increase in luminosity for most of the source's life,followed by a rapid decline when the synchrotron or inverse compton scatteringlosses set in.

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.5806	co observations of high-z radio galaxies mrc 2104-242 and mrc 0943-242:  spectral-line performance of the compact array broadband backend	we present the first 7-millimetre observations of two high-redshift,lya-bright radio galaxies (mrc 2104-242 and mrc 0943-242) performed with the 2x 2 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of the compact array broadband backend (cabb)at the australia telescope compact array (atca). the aim was to search for12co(1-0) emission in these systems and test the millimetre capabilities ofcabb for performing spectral line observations at high redshifts. we show thatthe stable band and enhanced velocity coverage of cabb, combined with hybridarray configurations, provide the atca with excellent 7-mm capabilities thatallow reliable searches for the ground transition of co at high redshifts. inthis paper we explicitly discuss the calibration procedures used to reach ourresults. we set a firm upper limit to the mass of molecular gas in mrc 2104-242(z = 2.5) of m(h2) &lt; 2 x 10^10 (alpha_x/0.8) m_sun. for mrc 0943-242 (z=2.9) wederive an upper limit of m(h2) &lt; 6 x 10^10 (alpha_x/0.8) m_sun. we also find atentative 3-sigma co detection in the outer part of the giant lya halo thatsurrounds mrc 0943-242. the 30-33 ghz radio continuum of mrc 2104-242 and mrc0943-242 is reliably detected. both radio sources show a spectral index ofalpha ~ -1.5 between 1.4 and 30 ghz, with no evidence for spectral curvaturewithin this range of frequencies.

1202.5406	spectral properties and the effect on redshift cut-off of compact agns  from the at20g survey	we use high angular resolution data, measured from visibility of sources atthe longest baseline of 4500 m of the australia telescope compact array (atca),for the australia telescope 20 ghz (at20g) survey to obtain angular sizeinformation for &gt; 94% of at20g sources. we confirm the previous at20g resultthat due to the high survey frequency of 20 ghz, the source population isstrongly dominated by compact sources (79%). at 0.15 arcseconds angularresolution limit, we show a very strong correlation between the compact andextended sources with flat and steep-spectrum sources respectively. thus, weprovide a firm physical basis for the traditional spectral classification intoflat and steep-spectrum sources to separate compact and extended sources. wefind the cut-off of -0.46 to be optimum for spectral indices between 1 and 5ghz and, hence, recommend the continued use of -0.5 for future studies.  we study the effect of spectral curvature on redshift cut-off of compact agnsusing recently published redshift data. using spectral indices at differentfrequencies, we correct for the redshift effect and produce restframe frequencyspectra for compact sources for redshift up to ~5. we show that the flatspectra of most compact sources start to steepen at ~30 ghz. at higherfrequencies, the spectra of both populations are steep so the use of spectralindex does not separate the compact and extended source populations as well asin lower frequencies. we find that due to the spectral steepening, surveys ofcompact sources at higher frequencies (&gt;5 ghz) will have redshift cut-off dueto spectral curvature but at lower frequencies, the surveys are notsignificantly affected by spectral curvature, thus, the evidence for a strongredshift cut-off in agns found in lower frequency surveys is a real cut-off andnot a result of k-correction.

1204.1391	a search for 21 cm hi absorption in at20g compact radio galaxies	we present results from a search for 21 cm associated hi absorption in asample of 29 radio sources selected from the australia telescope 20 ghz survey.observations were conducted using the australia telescope compact arraybroadband backend, with which we can simultaneously look for 21 cm absorptionin a redshift range of 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.08, with a velocity resolution of 7 km/s .in preparation for future large-scale h i absorption surveys we test aspectral-line finding method based on bayesian inference. we use this to assignsignificance to our detections and to determine the best-fitting number ofspectral-line components. we find that the automated spectral-line search islimited by residuals in the continuum, both from the band-pass calibration andspectral-ripple subtraction, at spectral-line widths of \deltav_fwhm &gt; 103 km/s. using this technique we detect two new absorbers and a third, previouslyknown, yielding a 10 per cent detection rate. of the detections, thespectral-line profiles are consistent with the theory that we are seeingdifferent orientations of the absorbing gas, in both the host galaxy andcircumnuclear disc, with respect to our line-of-sight to the source. in orderto spatially resolve the spectral-line components in the two new detections,and so verify this conclusion, we require further high-resolution 21 cmobservations (~0.01 arcsec) using very long baseline interferometry.

1205.3368	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy environments and star formation  rate variations	we present a detailed investigation into the effects of galaxy environment ontheir star formation rates (sfr) using galaxies observed in the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). we use three independent volume-limited samples ofgalaxies within z &lt; 0.2 and mr &lt; -17.8. we investigate the known sfr-densityrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of sfr on stellar mass anddensity. we show that the sfr-density trend is only visible when we include thepassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. thissfr-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-formingpopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. while there is a strongdependence of the ewh?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that thesetrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationshipis absent when considering a "star-forming" sample of galaxies. we find thatstellar mass has the strongest influence on sfr and ewh?a with the environmenthaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the starforming population. we also show that the sfr-density relationship is absentfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. we conclude that thestellar mass has the largest impact on the current sfr of a galaxy, and anyenvironmental effect is not detectable. the observation that the trends withdensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies thatthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the sfr in infallinggalaxies. alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into denseenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

1209.5796	probing the cool ism in galaxies via 21cm hi absorption	recent targeted studies of associated hi absorption in radio galaxies arestarting to map out the location, and potential cosmological evolution, of thecold gas in the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (agn). the observed 21cm absorption profiles often show two distinct spectral-line components:narrow, deep lines arising from cold gas in the extended disc of the galaxy,and broad, shallow lines from cold gas close to the agn (e.g. morganti et al.2011). here, we present results from a targeted search for associated hiabsorption in the youngest and most recently-triggered radio agn in the localuniverse (allison et al. 2012b). so far, by using the recently commissionedaustralia telescope compact array broadband backend (cabb; wilson et al. 2011),we have detected two new absorbers and one previously-known system. while twoof these show both a broad, shallow component and a narrow, deep component (seefig. 1), one of the new detections has only a single broad, shallow component.interestingly, the host galaxies of the first two detections are classified asgas-rich spirals, while the latter is an early-type galaxy. these detectionswere obtained using a spectral-line finding method, based on bayesianinference, developed for future large-scale absorption surveys (allison et al.2012a).

1210.1886	a survey for the missing hydrogen in high redshift radio sources	unlike at lower redshift, where there is a 40% detection rate, surveys for21-cm absorption arising within the hosts of z &gt; 1 radio galaxies and quasarshave been remarkably unsuccessful. curran et al.(2008) suggest that this is dueto the high redshift selection biasing towards the most optically brightobjects (those most luminous in the ultra-violetin the rest-frame), where thegas is ionised by the active galactic nucleus. they therefore argue that theremust be a population of fainter objects in which the hydrogen is not ionisedand which exhibit a similar detection rate as at lower redshifts. in order tofind this "missing" gas at high redshift, we have therefore undertaken a surveyof z &gt; 2 radio sources, selected by optical faintness. despite having opticalmagnitudes which indicate that the targets have ultra-violet luminosities belowthe threshold where all of the gas is ionised, there were no detections in anyof the eight sources for which useable data were obtained. upon an analysis ofthe spectral energy distributions, ionising photon rates can only be determinedfor three of these, all of which suggest that the objects are above the highestluminosity of a current 21-cm detection. the possibility that the other fivecould be located at lower photon rates cannot be ruled out, although zerodetections out of five is not statistically significant. another possible causeof the non-detections is that our selection biases the sample towards sourceswhich are very steep in the radio band, with a mean spectral index of = -1.0,cf. -0.3 for both the 21-cm detections and uv luminous non-detections. thisadds the further possibility that the sources have very extended emission,which would have the effect of reducing the coverage by the putative absorbinggas, thus decreasing the sensitivity of the observation.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1303.1604	on the hi column density - radio source size anti-correlation in compact  radio sources	existing studies of the atomic hydrogen gas content in distant galaxies,through the absorption of the 21-cm line, often infer that the total columndensity is anti-correlated with the linear extent of the background radiosource. we investigate this interpretation, by dissecting the variousparameters from which the column density is derived, and find that therelationship is driven primarily by the observed optical depth, which, for agiven absorber size, is anti-correlated with the linear size. therefore, theinferred anti-correlation is merely the consequence of geometry, in conjunctionwith the assumption of a common spin temperature/covering factor ratio for eachmember of the sample, an assumption for which there is scant observationaljustification. while geometry can explain the observed correlation, many radiosources comprise two radio lobes and so we model the projected area of a twocomponent emitter intercepted by a foreground absorber. from this, the observedoptical depth/linear size relationship is best reproduced through models whichapproximate either of the two fanaroff &amp; riley classifications, although theobserved scatter in the sample cannot be duplicated using a single deprojectedradio source size. furthermore, the trend is best reproduced using an absorberof diameter ~100 - 1000 pc, which is also the range of values of linear sizesat which the 21-cm detection rate peaks. this may indicate that this is thecharacteristic linear size of the absorbing gas structure.

1312.2301	deep 20-ghz survey of the chandra deep field south and sdss stripe 82:  source catalogue and spectral properties	we present a source catalogue and first results from a deep, blind radiosurvey carried out at 20 ghz with the australia telescope compact array, withfollow-up observations at 5.5, 9 and 18 ghz. the australia telescope 20 ghz(at20g) deep pilot survey covers a total area of 5 deg^2 in the chandra deepfield south and in stripe 82 of the sloan digital sky survey. we estimate thesurvey to be 90% complete above 2.5 mjy. of the 85 sources detected, 55% havesteep spectra (alpha_{1.4}^{20} &lt; -0.5) and 45% have flat or inverted spectra(alpha_{1.4}^{20} &gt;= -0.5).  the steep-spectrum sources tend to have single power-law spectra between 1.4and 18 ghz, while the spectral indices of the flat- or inverted-spectrumsources tend to steepen with frequency. among the 18 inverted-spectrum(alpha_{1.4}^{20} &gt;= 0.0) sources, 10 have clearly defined peaks in theirspectra with alpha_{1.4}^{5.5} &gt; 0.15 and alpha_{9}^{18} &lt; -0.15. on a 3-yrtimescale, at least 10 sources varied by more than 15% at 20 ghz, showing thatvariability is still common at the low flux densities probed by the at20g-deeppilot survey.  we find a strong and puzzling shift in the typical spectral index of the15-20 ghz source population when combining data from the at20g, ninth cambridgeand tenth cambridge surveys: there is a shift towards a steeper-spectrumpopulation when going from ~1 jy to ~5 mjy, which is followed by a shift backtowards a flatter-spectrum population below ~5 mjy. the 5-ghz source-countmodel by jackson &amp; wall (1999), which only includes contributions from fri andfrii sources, and star-forming galaxies, does not reproduce the observedflattening of the flat-spectrum counts below ~5 mjy. it is therefore possiblethat another population of sources is contributing to this effect.

1503.01265	discovery of hi gas in a young radio galaxy at $z = 0.44$ using the  australian square kilometre array pathfinder	we report the discovery of a new 21-cm hi absorption system usingcommissioning data from the boolardy engineering test array of the australiansquare kilometre array pathfinder (askap). using the 711.5 - 1015.5 mhz band ofaskap we were able to conduct a blind search for the 21-cm line in a continuousredshift range between $z = 0.4$ and 1.0, which has, until now, remainedlargely unexplored. the absorption line is detected at $z = 0.44$ towards theghz-peaked spectrum radio source pks b1740$-$517 and demonstrates askap'sexcellent capability for performing a future wide-field survey for hiabsorption at these redshifts. optical spectroscopy and imaging using thegemini-south telescope indicates that the hi gas is intrinsic to the hostgalaxy of the radio source. the narrow oiii emission lines show cleardouble-peaked structure, indicating either large-scale outflow or rotation ofthe ionized gas. archival data from the \emph{xmm-newton} satellite exhibit anabsorbed x-ray spectrum that is consistent with a high column density obscuringmedium around the active galactic nucleus. the hi absorption profile iscomplex, with four distinct components ranging in width from 5 to 300 kms$^{-1}$ and fractional depths from 0.2 to 20 per cent. in addition to systemichi gas, in a circumnuclear disc or ring structure aligned with the radio jet,we find evidence for a possible broad outflow of neutral gas moving at a radialvelocity of $v \sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$. we infer that the expanding young radiosource ($t_{\rm age} \approx 2500$ yr) is cocooned within a dense medium andmay be driving circumnuclear neutral gas in an outflow of $\sim$ 1$\mathrm{m}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

1503.01846	hi emission and absorption in nearby, gas-rich galaxies	we present the results of a targeted search for intervening hi absorption insix nearby, gas-rich galaxies using the australia telescope compact array(atca). the sightlines searched have impact parameters of 10-20 kpc. bytargeting nearby galaxies we are also able to map their hi emission, allowingus to directly relate the absorption-line detection rate to the extended hidistribution. the continuum sightlines intersect the hi disk in four of the sixgalaxies, but no intervening absorption was detected. of these four galaxies,we find that three of the non-detections are the result of the backgroundsource being too faint. in the fourth case we find that the ratio of the spintemperature to the covering factor ($t_{\mathrm{s}}/f$) must be much higherthan expected ($\gtrsim$5700 k) in order to explain the non-detection. wediscuss how the structure of the background continuum sources may have affectedthe detection rate of hi absorption in our sample, and the possibleimplications for future surveys. future work including an expanded sample, andvlbi observations, would allow us to better investigate the expected detectionrate, and influence of background source structure, on the results of futuresurveys.

1505.00949	a co-rich merger shaping a powerful and hyper-luminous infrared radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy	in the low-redshift universe, the most powerful radio sources are oftenassociated with gas-rich galaxy mergers or interactions. we here presentevidence for an advanced, gas-rich (`wet') merger associated with a powerfulradio galaxy at a redshift of z~2. this radio galaxy, mrc 0152-209, is the mostinfrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the southern hemisphere.using the australia telescope compact array, we obtained high-resolutionco(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with hst/wfpc2 imagingand wht long-slit spectroscopy. we find that, while roughly m(h2) ~ 2 x10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,another m(h2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of~60 kpc. most of this widespread co(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidalfeatures visible in the rest-frame near-uv hst/wfpc2 imaging. ly$\alpha$emission shows an excess over heii, but a deficiency over l(ir), which islikely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured starformation that was triggered by the merger. in terms of feedback, the radiosource is aligned with widespread co(1-0) emission, which suggests that thereis a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of coldmolecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. its optical appearance, combinedwith the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of mrc0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `dragonfly galaxy'.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

1511.03067	tracing the neutral gas environments of young radio agn with askap	at present neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) gas in galaxies at redshifts above $z\sim 0.3$ (the extent of 21-cm emission surveys in individual galaxies) andbelow $z \sim 1.7$ (where the lyman-$\alpha$ line is not observable withground-based telescopes) has remained largely unexplored. the advent ofprecursor telescopes to the square kilometre array will allow us to conduct thefirst systematic radio-selected 21-cm absorption surveys for hi over theseredshifts. while hi absorption is a tracer of the reservoir of cold neutral gasin galaxies available for star formation, it can also be used to reveal theextreme kinematics associated with jet-driven neutral outflows in radio-loudactive galactic nuclei. using the six-antenna boolardy engineering test arrayof the australian square kilometre array pathfinder, we have demonstrated thatin a single frequency tuning we can detect hi absorption over a broad range ofredshifts between $z = 0.4$ and $1.0$. as part of our early science andcommissioning program, we are now carrying out a search for absorption towardsa sample of the brightest gps and css sources in the southern sky. theseintrinsically compact sources present us with an opportunity to study thecircumunuclear region of recently re-started radio galaxies, in some casesshowing direct evidence of mechanical feedback through jet-driven outflows.with the sensitivity of the full askap array we will be able to study thekinematics of atomic gas in a few thousand radio galaxies, testing models ofradio jet feedback well beyond the nearby universe

1601.00003	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 325 mhz radio luminosity function  of agn and star forming galaxies	measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (agn) andstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution overcosmic time. radio continuum observations can provide key information on thesetwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jetsin agn, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formationrates. in this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 mhz for asample of agn and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio surveyconducted with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), with optical imagingand redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we find that theradio luminosity function at 325 mhz for star-forming galaxies closely followsthat measured at 1.4 ghz. by fitting the agn radio luminosity function out to$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\phi}\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pureluminosity evolution. we find that the low excitation radio galaxies are thedominant population in space density at lower luminosities. comparing our 325mhz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 ghz, we determine separateradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum agn, and show that thebeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted innumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population ofsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification ofagn.

astro-ph;0005267	an extragalactic hi cloud with no optical counterpart?	we report the discovery, from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass), of anisolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic. the himass of the cloud (hipass j1712-64) is very low, 1.7 x 10^7 msun, using anestimated distance of ~3.2 mpc. most significantly, we have found no opticalcompanion to this object to very faint limits (mu(b)~ 27 mag arcsec^-2). hipassj1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,hi 1225+01 (the virgo hi cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. the meanvelocity dispersion, measured with the australia telescope compact array(atca), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak ornon-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (t&lt;2000 k)rather than bulk motion or turbulence. the peak column density for hipassj1712-64, from the combined parkes and atca data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for starformation. apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties ofhipass j1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact highvelocity clouds. we therefore consider the evidence for a local group orgalactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712-64was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud/galaxy system atperigalacticon ~ 2 x 10^8 yr ago.

astro-ph;0407130	first results from the atca 18 ghz pilot survey	as a pilot study for the first all-sky radio survey at short wavelengths, wehave observed 1216 sq. deg. of the southern sky at 18ghz (16mm) using a novelwide-band (3.4ghz bandwidth) analogue correlator on one baseline of theaustralia telescope compact array (atca). we scanned a region of sky betweendeclination -71 and -59 degrees with an rms noise level of 15mjy. follow-upradio imaging of candidate sources above a 4 sigma detection limit of 60mjyresulted in 221 confirmed detections, for which we have measured accuratepositions and flux densities. for extragalactic sources, the survey is roughly70% complete at a flux density of 126mjy and 95% complete above 300mjy. almosthalf the detected sources lie within a few degrees of the galactic plane, butthere are 123 sources with |b|&gt;5 degrees which can be assumed to beextragalactic. the differential source counts for extragalactic sources in therange 0.1jy &lt; s_{18ghz} &lt; 3jy are well fitted by a relation of the formn(s)=57(s/{jy})^{-2.2\pm0.2} [jy^-1 sr^-1], in good agreement with the 15ghzcounts published by taylor et al. (2001) and waldram et al. (2003). over 70% ofthe extragalactic sources have a flat radio spectrum (\alpha_{0.843}^{18}&gt;-0.5, s_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}), and 29% have inverted radio spectra(\alpha_{0.843}^{18}&gt; 0). the optical identification rate is high: 51% of theextragalactic sources are identified with stellar objects (candidate qsos), 22%with galaxies and only 27% with faint optical objects or blank fields.

astro-ph;0411058	from gas to galaxies	the unsurpassed sensitivity and resolution of the square kilometer array(ska) will make it possible for the first time to probe the continuum emissionof normal star forming galaxies out to the edges of the universe. this opensthe possibility for routinely using the radio continuum emission from galaxiesfor cosmological research as it offers an independent probe of the evolution ofthe star formation density in the universe. in addition it offers thepossibility to detect the first star forming objects and massive black holes.  in deep surveys ska will be able to detect hi in emission out to redshifts of$z \approx 2.5$ and hence be able to trace the conversion of gas into starsover an era where considerable evolution is taking place. such surveys will beable to uniquely determine the respective importance of merging and accretinggas flows for galaxy formation over this redshift range (i.e. out to when theuniverse was only one third its present age). it is obvious that only ska willable to see literally where and how gas is turned into stars.  these and other aspects of ska imaging of galaxies will be discussed.

astro-ph;0505591	the hipass catalogue: iii - optical counterparts &amp; isolated dark  galaxies	we present the largest catalogue to date of optical counterparts for hiradio-selected galaxies, hopcat. of the 4315 hi radio-detected sources from thehi parkes all sky survey (hipass) catalogue, we find optical counterparts for3618 (84%) galaxies. of these, 1798 (42%) have confirmed optical velocities and848 (20%) are single matches without confirmed velocities. some galaxy matchesare members of galaxy groups. from these multiple galaxy matches, 714 (16%)have confirmed optical velocities and a further 258 (6%) galaxies are withoutconfirmed velocities. for 481 (11%), multiple galaxies are present but nosingle optical counterpart can be chosen and 216 (5%) have no obvious opticalgalaxy present. most of these 'blank fields' are in crowded fields along thegalactic plane or have high extinctions.  isolated 'dark galaxy' candidates are investigated using an extinction cut ofabj &lt; 1 mag and the blank fields category. of the 3692 galaxies with an abjextinction &lt; 1 mag, only 13 are also blank fields. of these, 12 are eliminatedeither with follow-up parkes observations or are in crowded fields. theremaining one has a low surface brightness optical counterpart. hence, noisolated optically dark galaxies have been found within the limits of thehipass survey.

astro-ph;0606469	a search for distant radio galaxies from sumss and nvss: iii. radio  spectral energy distributions and the z-alpha correlation	this is the third in a series of papers that present observations and resultsfor a sample of 76 ultra-steep-spectrum radio sources designed to find galaxiesat high redshift. here we present multi-frequency radio observations, from theaustralia telescope compact array, for a subset of 37 galaxies from the sample.matched resolution observations at 2.3, 4.8 and 6.2ghz are presented for allgalaxies, with the z&lt;2 galaxies additionally observed at 8.6 and 18ghz. newangular size constraints are reported for 19 sources based on high resolution4.8 and 6.2ghz observations. functional forms for the rest-frame spectralenergy distributions are derived: 89% of the sample is well characterised by asingle power law, whilst the remaining 11% show some flattening toward higherfrequencies: not one source shows any evidence for high frequency steepening.we discuss the implications of this result in light of the empiricalcorrelation between redshift and spectral index seen in flux limited samples ofradio galaxies. finally, a new physical mechanism to explain the redshift --spectral index correlation is posited: extremely steep spectrum radio galaxiesin the local universe usually reside at the centres of rich galaxy clusters. weargue that if a higher fraction of radio galaxies, as a function of redshift,are located in environments with densities similar to nearby rich clusters,then this could be a natural interpretation for the correlation. we brieflyoutline our plans to pursue this line of investigation.

astro-ph;0610176	the 2df bl lac survey ii	we report on our further analysis of the expanded and revised sample ofpotential bl lac objects (the 2bl) optically identified from two catalogues ofblue-selected (uv excess) point sources, the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys(2qz and 6qz). the 2bl comprises 52 objects with no apparent proper motion,over the magnitude range 16.0 &lt; bj&lt; 20.0. follow-up high signal-to-noisespectra of 36 2bl objects and nir imaging of 18 objects, together with data for19 2bl objects found in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), show 17 objects tobe stellar, while a further 16 objects have evidence of weak, broad emissionfeatures, although for at least one of these the continuum level has clearlyvaried. classification of three objects remains uncertain,with nir resultsindicating a marked reduction in flux as compared to sdss optical magnitudes.seven objects have neither high signal-to-noise spectra nor nir imaging. deepradio observations of 26 2bl objects at the vla resulted in only three furtherradio-detections, however none of the three is classed as a featurelesscontinuum object. seven 2bl objects with a radio detection are confirmed ascandidate bl lac objects while one extragalactic (z=0.494) continuum object isundetected at radio frequencies. one further radio-undetected object is also apotential bl lac candidate. however it would appear that there is nosignificant population of radio-quiet bl lac objects.

astro-ph;0701716	extended, regular hi structures around early-type galaxies	we discuss the morphology and kinematics of the hi of a sample of 30 southerngas-rich early-type galaxies selected from the  hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass). this is the largest collection ofhigh-resolution hi data of a homogeneously selected sample. given thesensitivity of hipass, these galaxies represent the most hi-rich early-typegalaxies. in two-thirds of the galaxies, we find the hi to be in a large,regular disk- or ring-like structure that in some cases is strongly warped. inthe remaining cases we find the hi distributed in irregular tails or cloudsoffset from the galaxy. the giant, regular hi structures can be up to ~200 kpcin diameter and contain up to 10^10 m_sun of hi. the incidence of irregular histructures appears to be somewhat higher in elliptical galaxies, but the large,regular structures are observed in both elliptical and s0 galaxies and are notstrictly connected to the presence of a stellar disk. if these two types ofgalaxies are the result of different formation paths, this is not stronglyreflected in the characteristics of the hi. the size and the regular kinematicsof the hi structures imply that the neutral hydrogen must have settled in thesegalaxies several gyr ago. merging as well as gas accretion from the igm areviable explanations for the origin of the gas in these galaxies. the averagecolumn density of the hi is low so that little star formation is expected tooccur and these early-type galaxies can remain gas rich for very long periodsof time. the large hi structures likely represent key structures for tracingthe origin and evolution of these galaxies.

astro-ph;9808023	the disruption of nearby galaxies by the milky way	interactions between galaxies are common and are an important factor indetermining their physical properties such as position along the hubblesequence and star-formation rate. there are many possible galaxy interactionmechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression,gravitational interaction and cluster tides. the relative importance of thesemechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly knownparameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halosthat surround galaxies. a nearby example of a galaxy interaction where themechanism is controversial is that between our own galaxy and two of itsneighbours -- the large and small magellanic clouds. here we present the firstresults of a new hi survey which provides a spectacular view of thisinteraction. in addition to the previously known magellanic stream, whichtrails 100 degrees behind the clouds, the new data reveal a counter-streamwhich lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the clouds. thisresult supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streamsare tidally torn from the body of the magellanic clouds.

astro-ph;9808164	new hi-detected galaxies in the zone of avoidance	we present the first results of a blind hi survey for galaxies in thesouthern zone of avoidance with a multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope.this survey is eventually expected to catalog several thousand galaxies withingalactic latitude |b|&lt;5 degrees, mostly unrecognised before due to galacticextinction and confusion. we present here results of the first three detectionsto have been imaged with the australia telescope compact array (atca). thegalaxies all lie near galactic longitude 325 degrees and were selected becauseof their large angular sizes, up to 1.3 degrees. linear sizes range from 53 to108 kpc. the first galaxy is a massive 5.7x10^11 solar mass disk galaxy with afaint optical counterpart, sgc 1511.1--5249. the second is probably aninteracting group of galaxies straddling the galactic equator. no opticalidentification is possible. the third object appears to be an interacting pairof low column density galaxies, possibly belonging to an extended circinus orcentaurus a galaxy group. no optical counterpart has been seen despite thepredicted extinction (a(b) = 2.7 - 4.4 mag) not being excessive. we discuss theimplications of the results, in particular the low hi column densities (~10^19atoms/sq.cm) found for two of the three galaxies.
