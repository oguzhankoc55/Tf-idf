hep-ph;9610405	baryogenesis during reheating in natural inflation and comments on  spontaneous baryogenesis	we calculate the baryon asymmetry created by the decay of a pseudonambu-goldstone boson whose interactions violate baryon number conservation.our results are in disagreement with previous results in the originalspontaneous baryogenesis models for the asymmetry produced by the decay of anoscillating scalar field with b number violating derivative couplings; we findthat the net baryon number density is proportional to $\th_i^3$, where $\th_i$is the amplitude of the pngb-field in natural inflation at the onset ofreheating. we also discuss our disagreement with the interpretation of$\dot\theta$ as an effective chemical potential for baryon number inspontaneous baryogenesis models. while our calculation of the asymmetry iscarried out in the context of natural inflation our approach is generally validfor baryogenesis models using decaying classical fields. in the appendices, weinclude a complete derivation of the number density of particles produced bythe decay of a classical scalar field; this number density is proportional tothe integral over momenta of the one pair production amplitude.

hep-ph;9906542	cosmological challenges in theories with extra dimensions and remarks on  the horizon problem	we consider the cosmology that results if our observable universe is a3-brane in a higher dimensional universe. in particular, we focus on the casewhere our 3-brane is located at the $z_2$ symmetry fixed plane of a $z_2$symmetric five-dimensional spacetime, as in the ho\v{r}ava-witten modelcompactified on a calabi-yau manifold. as our first result, we find that therecan be substantial modifications to the standard friedmann-robertson-walker(frw) cosmology; as a consequence, a large class of such models isobservationally inconsistent. in particular, any relationship between thehubble constant and the energy density on our brane is possible, including (butnot only) frw. generically, due to the existence of the bulk and the boundaryconditions on the orbifold fixed plane, the relationship is not frw, and hencecosmological constraints coming from big bang nucleosynthesis, structureformation, and the age of the universe difficult to satisfy. we do wish topoint out, however, that some specific choices for the bulk stress-energytensor components do reproduce normal frw cosmology on our brane, and we haveconstructed an explicit example. as our second result, for a broad class ofmodels, we find a somewhat surprising fact: the stabilization of the radius ofthe extra dimension and hence the four dimensional planck mass requiresunrealistic fine-tuning of the equation of state on our 3-brane. in the lastthird of the paper, we make remarks about causality and the horizon problemthat apply to {\it any} theory in which the volume of the extra dimensiondetermines the four-dimensional gravitational coupling. we point out that someof the assumptions that lead to the usual inflationary requirements aremodified.

0901.2713	compatibility of dama/libra dark matter detection with other searches in  light of new galactic rotation velocity measurements	the dama/nai and dama/libra annual modulation data, which may be interpretedas a signal for the existence of weakly interacting dark matter (wimps) in ourgalactic halo, are re-examined in light of new measurements of the localvelocity relative to the galactic halo. in the vicinity of the sun, thevelocity of the galactic disk has been estimated to be 250 km/s rather than 220km/s. our analysis is performed both with and without the channeling effectincluded. the best fit regions to the dama data are shown to move to slightlylower wimp masses. compatibility of dama data with null results from otherexperiments (cdms, xenon10, and cresst i) is investigated given these newvelocities. a small region of spin-independent (elastic) scattering for 7-8 gevwimp masses remains at 3$\sigma$. spin-dependent scattering off of protons isviable for 5-15 gev wimp masses for direct detection experiments (but has beenargued by others to be further constrained by super-kamiokande due toannihilation in the sun).

0903.0101	dark stars: a new study of the first stars in the universe	we have proposed that the first phase of stellar evolution in the history ofthe universe may be dark stars (ds), powered by dark matter heating rather thanby nuclear fusion. weakly interacting massive particles, which may be their ownantipartners, collect inside the first stars and annihilate to produce a heatsource that can power the stars. a new stellar phase results, a dark star,powered by dark matter annihilation as long as there is dark matter fuel, withlifetimes from millions to billions of years. we find that the first stars arevery bright ($\sim 10^6 l_\odot$) and cool ($t_{surf} &lt; 10,000$k) during the dsphase, and grow to be very massive (500-1000 times as massive as the sun).these results differ markedly from the standard picture in the absence of dmheating, in which the maximum mass is about 140$m_\odot$ and the temperaturesare much hotter ($t_{surf} &gt; 50,000$k); hence ds should be observationallydistinct from standard pop iii stars. once the dark matter fuel is exhausted,the ds becomes a heavy main sequence star; these stars eventually collapse toform massive black holes that may provide seeds for supermassive black holesobserved at early times as well as explanations for recent arcade data and forintermediate black holes.

0904.3331	constraints on dark matter particles charged under a hidden gauge group  from primordial black holes	in order to accommodate increasingly tighter observational constraints ondark matter, several models have been proposed recently in which dark matterparticles are charged under some hidden gauge group. hidden gauge charges areinvisible for the standard model particles, hence such scenarios are verydifficult to constrain directly. however black holes are sensitive to all gaugecharges, whether they belong to the standard model or not. here, we examine theconstraints on the possible values of the dark matter particle mass and hiddengauge charge from the evolution of primordial black holes. we find that theexistence of the primordial black holes with reasonable mass is incompatiblewith dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is of the order of one.for dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is much less than one, weare able to exclude only heavy dark matter in the mass range of 10^(11) gev -10^(16) gev. finally, for dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio ismuch greater than one, there are no useful limits coming from primordial blackholes.

0910.1634	accretion process onto super-spinning objects	the accretion process onto spinning objects in kerr spacetimes is studiedwith numerical simulations. our results show that accretion onto compactobjects with kerr parameter (characterizing the spin) $|a| &lt; m$ and $|a| &gt; m$is very different. in the super-spinning case, for $|a|$ moderately larger than$m$, the accretion onto the central object is extremely suppressed due to arepulsive force at short distance. the accreting matter cannot reach thecentral object, but instead is accumulated around it, forming a high densitycloud that continues to grow. the radiation emitted in the accretion processwill be harder and more intense than the one coming from standard black holes;e.g. $\gamma$-rays could be produced as seen in some observations.gravitational collapse of this cloud might even give rise to violent bursts. as$|a|$ increases, a larger amount of accreting matter reaches the central objectand the growth of the cloud becomes less efficient. our simulations find that aquasi-steady state of the accretion process exists for $|a|/m \gtrsim 1.4$,independently of the mass accretion rate at large radii. for such high valuesof the kerr parameter, the accreting matter forms a thin disk at very smallradii. we provide some analytical arguments to strengthen the numericalresults; in particular, we estimate the radius where the gravitational forcechanges from attractive to repulsive and the critical value $|a|/m \approx 1.4$separating the two qualitatively different regimes of accretion. we brieflydiscuss the observational signatures which could be used to look for suchexotic objects in the galaxy and/or in the universe.

1002.2233	supermassive dark stars: detectable in jwst	the first phase of stellar evolution in the history of the universe may bedark stars, powered by dark matter heating rather than by nuclear fusion.weakly interacting massive particles, which may be their own antipartners,collect inside the first stars and annihilate to produce a heat source that canpower the stars for millions to billions of years. in this paper we show thatthese objects can grow to be supermassive dark stars (smds) with masses$\gtrsim (10^5-10^7) \msun$. the growth continues as long as dark matterheating persists, since dark stars are large and cool (surface temperature$\lesssim 5\times 10^4$k) and do not emit enough ionizing photons to preventfurther accretion of baryons onto the star. the dark matter may be provided bytwo mechanisms: (1) gravitational attraction of dark matter particles on avariety of orbits not previously considered, and (2) capture of wimps due toelastic scattering. once the dark matter fuel is exhausted, the smds becomes aheavy main sequence star; these stars eventually collapse to form massive blackholes that may provide seeds for supermassive black holes in the universe. smdsare very bright, with luminosities exceeding $(10^9-10^{11}) l_\odot$. wedemonstrate that for several reasonable parameters, these objects will bedetectable with jwst. such an observational discovery would confirm theexistence of a new phase of stellar evolution powered by dark matter.

1008.0348	dark stars and boosted dark matter annihilation rates	dark stars (ds) may constitute the first phase of stellar evolution, poweredby dark matter (dm) annihilation. we will investigate here the properties of dsassuming the dm particle has the required properties to explain the excesspositron and elec- tron signals in the cosmic rays detected by the pamela andfermi satellites. any possible dm interpretation of these signals requiresexotic dm candidates, with an- nihilation cross sections a few orders ofmagnitude higher than the canonical value required for correct thermal relicabundance for weakly interacting dark matter can- didates; additionally in mostmodels the annihilation must be preferentially to lep- tons. secondly, we studythe dependence of ds properties on the concentration pa- rameter of the initialdm density profile of the halos where the first stars are formed. we restrictour study to the dm in the star due to simple (vs. extended) adiabaticcontraction and minimal (vs. extended) capture; this simple study is sufficientto illustrate dependence on the cross section and concentration parameter. ourbasic results are that the final stellar properties, once the star enters themain sequence, are always roughly the same, regardless of the value of boostedannihilation or concentration parameter in the range between c=2 and c=5:stellar mass ~ 1000m\odot, luminosity ~ 10^7 l\odot, lifetime ~ 10^6 yrs (forthe minimal dm models considered here; additional dm would lead to more massivedark stars). however, the lifetime, final mass, and final luminosity of the dsshow some dependence on boost factor and concentration parameter as discussedin the paper.

1102.2548	predictive signatures of supersymmetry: measuring the dark matter mass  and gluino mass with early lhc data	we present a focused study of a predictive unified model whose measurableconsequences are immediately relevant to early discovery prospects ofsupersymmetry at the lhc. atlas and cms have released their analysis with35~pb$^{-1}$ of data and the model class we discuss is consistent with thisdata. it is shown that with an increase in luminosity the lsp dark matter massand the gluino mass can be inferred from simple observables such as kinematicedges in leptonic channels and peak values in effective mass distributions.specifically, we consider cases in which the neutralino is of low mass andwhere the relic density consistent with wmap observations arises via theexchange of higgs bosons in unified supergravity models. the magnitudes of thegaugino masses are sharply limited to focused regions of the parameter space,and in particular the dark matter mass lies in the range $\sim (50-65) ~\rmgev$ with an upper bound on the gluino mass of $575~{\rm gev}$, with a typicalmass of $450~{\rm gev}$. we find that all model points in this paradigm arediscoverable at the lhc at $\sqrt s = 7 \rm ~tev$. we determine lower bounds onthe entire sparticle spectrum in this model based on existing experimentalconstraints. in addition, we find the spin-independent cross section forneutralino scattering on nucleons to be generally in the range of $\sigma^{\rmsi}_{\na p} = 10^{-46 \pm 1}~\rm cm^2$ with much higher cross sections alsopossible. thus direct detection experiments such as cdms and xenon alreadyconstrain some of the allowed parameter space of the low mass gaugino modelsand further data will provide important cross-checks of the model assumptionsin the near future.

1109.0014	probing dark matter streams with cogent	we examine the future sensitivity of cogent to the presence of dark matterstreams and find that consideration of streams in the data may lead todifferences in the interpretation of the results. we show the allowed particlemass and cross section for different halo parameters, assuming spin-independentelastic scattering. as an example, we choose a stream with the same velocityprofile as that of the sagittarius stream (and in the solar neighborhood) andfind that, with an exposure of $\sim$ 10 kg year, the cogent results can beexpected to exclude the shm-only halo in favor of an shm+stream halo at the 95%(99.7%) confidence level provided the stream contributes 3% (5%) of the localdark matter density. the presence of a significant stream component may resultin incorrect estimates of the particle mass and cross section unless thepresence of the stream is taken into account. we conclude that the cogentexperiment is sensitive to streams and care should be taken to include thepossibility of streams when analyzing experimental results.

1112.2150	the "goldstone exception" ii: absence of a higgs fine-tuning problem in  the spontaneously broken limit of the gell mann levy linear sigma model: o(4)  with pcac and su(2)_l with pcac and standard model quarks and leptons	more than four decades ago, lee and symanzik proved that, in the gellmann-levy (gml) model with partially conserved axial-vector currents (pcac),tadpole renormalization (a higgs vacuum stability condition) forces alls-matrix ultra-violet quadratic divergences (uvqd) to be absorbed into thephysical renormalized pseudo-scalar pion (pole) mass squared. we show that thisincludes "new" uvqd (widely unfamiliar to modern audiences). we also show thattadpole renormalization is an automatic consequence of ward-takahashiidentities.  we prove that all uvqd therefore vanish identically in the goldstone-modelimit, where pions are nambu-goldstone bosons (ngb), and where lee andsymanzik's goldstone symmetry restoration condition (a renormalizationprescription) enforces spontaneous symmetry breaking and the massless-ness ofngb. axial-vector current conservation is restored as is su(2)(l-r) chiralsymmetry: the vanishing of uvqd is therefore achieved in the goldstone-mode byrestoration of an exact symmetry, and therefore (by definition) withoutfine-tuning!  a weak-scale higgs mass is therefore not uvqd fine-tuned in the spontaneouslybroken gml lsm. that is simply another (albeit unfamiliar) consequence of thegoldstone theorem. hence goldstone-mode o(4) lsm symmetries are sufficient toensure that the theory does not suffer from the higgs fine tuning problem. thisis contrary to the widely accepted belief that uvqd in the higgs mass lead tosuch problems in the o(4) lsm, which are then presumed to be inherited by thestandard model (sm). the key observation is to regard the spontaneously brokeno(4) lsm as the goldstone-mode limit of the gml lsm.  we prove this first at 1-loop then at all loop orders for the pure scalar gmlmodel. we then break the o(4) symmetry to su(2)l with sm yukawa couplings, andshow that the above remains true.

1204.1339	dark matter collisions with the human body	we investigate the interactions of weakly interacting massive particles(wimps) with nuclei in the human body. we are motivated by the fact that wimpsare excellent candidates for the dark matter in the universe. our estimates usea 70 kg human and a variety of wimp masses and cross-sections. thecontributions from individual elements in the body are presented and it isfound that the dominant contribution is from scattering off of oxygen(hydrogen) nuclei for the spin-independent (spin-dependent) interactions. forthe case of 60 gev wimps, we find that, of the billions of wimps passingthrough a human body per second, roughly ~10 wimps hit one of the nuclei in thehuman body in an average year, if the scattering is at the maximum consistentwith current bounds on wimp interactions. we also study the 10-20 gev wimpswith much larger cross-sections that best fit the dama, cogent, and cresst datasets and find much higher rates: in this case as many as $10^5$ wimps hit anucleus in the human body in an average year, corresponding to almost one aminute. though wimp interactions are a source of radiation in the body, theannual exposure is negligible compared to that from other natural sources(including radon and cosmic rays), and the wimp collisions are harmless tohumans.

1206.6809	new dark matter detectors using dna or rna for nanometer tracking	weakly interacting massive particles (wimps) may constitute most of thematter in the universe. the ability to detect the directionality of recoilnuclei will considerably facilitate detection of wimps. in this paper wepropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of dna or rnacould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5kev, and can operate at room temperature. when a wimp from the galactic haloelastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector, the recoiling nucleusthen traverses hundreds of strings of single stranded nucleic acids (ssna) withknown base sequences and severs ssna strands along its trajectory. the locationof the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments ofcut ssna using techniques well known to biologists. thus the path of therecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy. in one such detectorconcept, the transducers are nanometer-thick au-foils of 1m x 1m, and thedirection of recoiling nuclei is measured by "na tracking chamber" consistingof ordered array of ssna strands. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and ssnasequencing are used to read-out the detector. the proposed detector is smallerand cheaper than other alternatives: 1 kg of gold and 0.1 to 4 kg of ssna(depending on length and strand density), packed into 0.01m$^3$, can be used tostudy 10 gev wimps. a variety of other detector target elements could be usedin this detector to optimize for different wimp masses and to identify wimpproperties. by leveraging advances in molecular biology, we aim to achieveabout 1,000-fold better spatial resolution than in conventional wimp detectorsat reasonable cost.

1403.5277	natural inflation: consistency with cosmic microwave background  observations of planck and bicep2	natural inflation is a good fit to all cosmic microwave background (cmb) dataand may be the correct description of an early inflationary expansion of theuniverse. the large angular scale cmb polarization experiment bicep2 hasannounced a major discovery, which can be explained as the gravitational wavesignature of inflation, at a level that matches predictions by naturalinflation models. the natural inflation (ni) potential is theoreticallyexceptionally well motivated in that it is naturally flat due to shiftsymmetries, and in the simplest version takes the form $v(\phi) = \lambda^4 [1\pm \cos(n\phi/f)]$. a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&gt;0.1 $ as seen by bicep2requires the height of any inflationary potential to be comparable to the scaleof grand unification and the width to be comparable to the planck scale. thecosine natural inflation model agrees with all cosmic microwave backgroundmeasurements as long as $f \geq m_{\rm pl}$ (where $m_{\rm pl} = 1.22 \times10^{19}\ {\rm gev}$) and $\lambda \sim m_{\rm gut} \sim 10^{16}\ {\rm gev}$.this paper also discusses other variants of the natural inflation paradigm: weshow that axion monodromy with potential $v\propto \phi^{2/3}$ is inconsistentwith the bicep2 limits at the 95\% confidence level, and low-scale inflation isstrongly ruled out. linear potentials $v \propto \phi$ are inconsistent withthe bicep2 limit at the 95\% confidence level, but are marginally consistentwith a joint planck/bicep2 limit at 95\%. we discuss the pseudo-nambu goldstonemodel proposed by kinney and mahanthappa as a concrete realization of low-scaleinflation. while the low-scale limit of the model is inconsistent with thedata, the large-field limit of the model is marginally consistent with bicep2.all of the models considered predict negligible running of the scalar spectralindex, and would be ruled out by a detection of running.

1403.8115	new dark matter detector using nanoscale explosives	we present nanoscale explosives as a novel type of dark matter detector andstudy the ignition properties. when a weakly interacting massive particle wimpfrom the galactic halo elastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector,the small amount of energy deposited can trigger an explosion. for specificity,this paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as ananothermite, consisting of a metal and an oxide in close proximity. when thetwo components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction --- anexplosion. as a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nmradius embedded in an oxide. one cell contains more than a few millionnanoparticles, and a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detectormass. a wimp interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles, depositingenough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers.when one nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout thecell. a number of possible thermite materials are studied. excellent backgroundrejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale granularity of the detector:whereas a wimp will cause a single cell to explode, backgrounds will insteadset off multiple cells.  if the detector operates at room temperature, we find that wimps with massesabove 100 gev (or for some materials above 1 tev) could be detected; theydeposit enough energy ($&gt;$10 kev) to cause an explosion. when operatingcryogenically at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures, the nanoexplosive wimp detector can detect energy deposits as low as 0.5 kev, makingthe nano explosive detector more sensitive to very light $&lt;$10 gev wimps,better than other dark matter detectors.

1408.2082	dark stars: improved models and first pulsation results	we use the stellar evolution code mesa to study dark stars. dark stars (dss),which are powered by dark matter (dm) self-annihilation rather than by nuclearfusion, may be the first stars to form in the universe. we compute stellarmodels for accreting dss with masses up to 10^6 m_{sun}. the heating due to dmannihilation is self-consistently included, assuming extended adiabaticcontraction of dm within the minihalos in which dss form. we find remarkablygood overall agreement with previous models, which assumed polytropicinteriors. there are some differences in the details, with positiveimplications for observability. we found that, in the mass range of 10^4 -10^5m_{sun}, our dss are hotter by a factor of 1.5 than those in freese etal.(2010), are smaller in radius by a factor of 0.6, denser by a factor of 3 -4, and more luminous by a factor of 2. our models also confirm previousresults, according to which supermassive dss are very well approximated by(n=3)-polytropes. we also perform a first study of dark star pulsations. our dsmodels have pulsation modes with timescales ranging from less than a day tomore than two years in their rest frames, at z ~ 15, depending on dm particlemass and overtone number. such pulsations may someday be used to identifybright, cool objects uniquely as dss; if properly calibrated, they might, inprinciple, also supply novel standard candles for cosmological studies.

0805.3540	dark matter densities during the formation of the first stars and in  dark stars	the first stars in the universe form inside $\sim 10^6 m_\odot$ dark matter(dm) haloes whose initial density profiles are laid down by gravitationalcollapse in hierarchical structure formation scenarios. during the formation ofthe first stars in the universe, the baryonic infall compresses the dark matterfurther. the resultant dark matter density is presented here, using analgorithm originally developed by young to calculate changes to the profile asthe result of adiabatic infall in a spherical halo model; the youngprescription takes into account the non-circular motions of halo particles. thedensity profiles obtained in this way are found to be within a factor of two ofthose obtained using the simple adiabatic contraction prescription ofblumenthal et al. our results hold regardless of the nature of the dark matteror its interactions and rely merely on gravity. if the dark matter consists ofweakly interacting massive particles, which are their own antiparticles, theirdensities are high enough that their annihilation in the first protostars canindeed provide an important heat source and prevent the collapse all the way tofusion. in short, a ``dark star'' phase of stellar evolution, powered by dmannihilation, may indeed describe the first stars in the universe.

0806.0617	stellar structure of dark stars: a first phase of stellar evolution due  to dark matter annihilation	dark stars are the very first phase of stellar evolution in the history ofthe universe: the first stars to form (typically at redshifts $z \sim 10-50$)are powered by heating from dark matter (dm) annihilation instead of fusion (ifthe dm is made of particles which are their own antiparticles). we findequilibrium polytropic configurations for these stars; we start from the timedm heating becomes important ($m \sim 1-10 m_\odot$) and build up the star viaaccretion up to 1000 m$_\odot$. the dark stars, with an assumed particle massof 100 gev, are found to have luminosities of a few times $10^6$ l$_\odot$,surface temperatures of 4000--10,000 k, radii $\sim 10^{14}$ cm, lifetimes ofat least $ 0.5$ myr, and are predicted to show lines of atomic and molecularhydrogen. dark stars look quite different from standard metal-free starswithout dm heating: they are far more massive (e.g. $\sim 800 m_\odot$ for 100gev wimps), cooler, and larger, and can be distinguished in futureobservations, possibly even by jwst or tmt.

astro-ph;0007444	death of stellar baryonic dark matter candidates	the nature of the dark matter in the universe is one of the outstandingquestions in astrophysics. in this talk, i address possible stellar baryoniccontributions to the 50-90% of our galaxy that is made of unknown dark matter.first i show that faint stars and brown dwarfs constitute only a few percent ofthe mass of the galaxy. next, i show that stellar remnants, including whitedwarfs and neutron stars, are also insufficient in abundance to explain all thedark matter of the galaxy. high energy gamma-rays observed in hegra data placethe most robust constraints, $\omega_{wd} &lt; 3 \times 10^{-3} h^{-1}$, where $h$is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$. overproductionof chemical abundances (carbon, nitrogen, and helium) provide the moststringent constraints, $\omega_{wd} &lt; 2 \times 10^{-4} h^{-1}$. comparison withrecent updates of microlensing data are also made. according to the gamma-raylimit, all massive compact halo objects seen by the experiments (machos) can bewhite dwarfs if one takes the extreme numbers; however, from chemicaloverproduction limits, not all machos can be white dwarfs. comments on recentobservations of the infrared background and of white dwarfs are also made. inconclusion, a nonbaryonic component in the halo seems to be required.

astro-ph;0106480	on the direct detection of extragalactic wimps	we consider the direct detection of wimps reaching the earth from outside themilky way. if these wimps form a distinct population they will, although ofmuch lower flux than typical galactic halo wimps, have a number of featureswhich might aid in their ultimate detectability: a high and essentially uniquevelocity ($\sim 600$ km/s in the galactic rest frame) due to their accelerationin entering the milky way, and most likely one or two unique flight directionsat the earth. this high velocity may be experimentally advantageous in directdetection experiments, since it gives a recoil signal at relatively high energywhere background is generally much reduced. for a density of extragalacticwimps comparable to the critical density of the universe the count rateexpected is very roughly the same as that of fast galactic wimps. if there isan increased density relative to critical associated with the local group ofgalaxies, say 10-30 times the critical density, there is a correspondingincrease in rate and the extragalactic wimps would show up as a high energyshoulder in the recoil energy distribution. evidence of such wimps as aseparate population with these distinct properties would offer interestinginformation on the formation and prehistory of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0201229	cardassian expansion: a model in which the universe is flat, matter  dominated, and accelerating	a modification to the friedmann robertson walker equation is proposed inwhich the universe is flat, matter dominated, and accelerating. an additionalterm, which contains only matter or radiation (no vacuum contribution), becomesthe dominant driver of expansion at a late epoch of the universe. during theepoch when the new term dominates, the universe accelerates; we call thisperiod of acceleration the cardassian era. the universe can be flat and yetconsist of only matter and radiation, and still be compatible withobservations. the energy density required to close the universe is much smallerthan in a standard cosmology, so that matter can be sufficient to provide aflat geometry. the new term required may arise, e.g., as a consequence of ourobservable universe living as a 3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensionaluniverse. the cardassian model survives several observational tests, includingthe cosmic background radiation, the age of the universe, the cluster baryonfraction, and structure formation.

astro-ph;0202066	lensed density perturbations in braneworlds: an alternative to  perturbations from inflation	we consider a scenario in which our observable universe is a 3-dimensionalsurface (3-brane) living in extra dimensions with a warped geometry. we showthat ``lensed'' density perturbations from other branes serve as possible seedsfor structure formation on our observable brane (without inflation), and, inaddition, provide constraints on braneworld scenarios with warped bulkgeometry. due to the warped bulk metric, any perturbation generated on onebrane (or in the bulk matter) appears to an observer on a second brane to havea significantly different amplitude. we analyze lensed perturbations in therandall-sundrum type scenarios and the ``shortcut metric'' scenarios. forlorentz violating metrics in the bulk, we find the attractive possibility thatlarge density fluctuations that are causally produced elsewhere can lead tosmall density fluctuations on our brane on superhorizon (acausal) lengthscales, as required by structure formation. our most interesting result is thatthe ``shortcut metrics'' in which geodesics traverse the extra dimensionsprovide an alternative to inflation with two important features: a possiblesolution to the horizon problem and a mechanism to generate perturbationsnecessary for structure formation.

astro-ph;0203497	a wavelet analysis of solar climate forcing: i) solar cycle timescales	we use the technique of wavelet analysis to quantitatively investigate therole of solar variability in forcing terrestrial climate change on solar cycletimescales (roughly 11 years). we examine the connection between mean annualsolar irradiance, as reconstructed from sunspot and isotope records, and theclimate, as proxied by two northern hemisphere surface air temperaturereconstructions. by applying wavelet transforms to these signals, we are ableto analyze both the frequency content of each signal, and also the timedependence of that content. after computing wavelet transforms of the data, weperform correlation analyses on the wavelet transforms of irradiance andtemperature via two techniques: the pearson's method and the conditionalprobability method. we thus track the correlation between individual frequencycomponents of both signals as a function of time. a nonzero correlation betweenthe irradiance and temperature wavelet spectra requires a phase lag between thetwo data sets (i.e., terrestrial response to solar output is notinstantaneous). we search for the optimal phase lag that maximizes thecorrelation. by choosing an appropriate phase for each year, we find asignificant, positive sun-climate correlation for most of the period ad1720-1950. we find that this phase-optimized correlation varies in time,oscillating between 0.12 and 0.71 throughout the past 400 years. we find thatthe phase lag varies from 0-10 years. we also present a test to determinewhether terrestrial response to solar output is enhanced via stochasticresonance, wherein the weak periodic solar signal is amplified by terrestrialnoise.

astro-ph;0302064	future type ia supernova data as tests of dark energy from modified  friedmann equations	in the cardassian model, dark energy density arises from modifications to thefriedmann equation, which becomes $h^2 = g(\rhom)$, where $g(\rhom)$ is a newfunction of the energy density. the universe is flat, matter dominated, andaccelerating. the distance redshift relation predictions of generalizedcardassian models can be very different from generic quintessence models, andcan be differentiated with data from upcoming pencil beam surveys of type iasupernovae such as snap. we have found the interesting result that, once$\omega_m$ is known to 10% accuracy, snap will be able to determine the sign ofthe time dependence of the dark energy density. knowledge of this sign (whichis related to the weak energy condition) will provide a first discriminationbetween various cosmological models that fit the current observational data(cosmological constant, quintessence, cardassian expansion). further, we haveperformed monte carlo simulations to illustrate how well one can reproduce theform of the dark energy density with snap.  to be concrete we study a class of two parameter ($n$,$q$) generalizedcardassian models that includes the original cardassian model (parametrized by$n$ only) as a special case. examples are given of mp cardassian models thatfit current supernovae and cmb data, and prospects for differentiating betweenmp cardassian and other models in future data are discussed. we also note thatsome cardassian models can satisfy the weak energy condition $w&gt;-1$ even with adark energy component that has an effective equation of state $w_x &lt; -1$.

astro-ph;0307190	the phase of the annual modulation as a tool for determining the wimp  mass	the count rate of weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) dark mattercandidates in direct detection experiments experiences an annual modulation dueto the earth's motion around the sun. in the standard isothermal halo model,the signal peaks near june 2nd at high recoil energies; however, the signalexperiences a phase reversal and peaks in december at low energy recoils. weshow that this phase reversal may be used to determine the wimp mass. if anannual modulation were observed with the usual phase ({\it i.e.}, peaking onjune 2nd) in the lowest accessible energy recoil bins of the dama, cdms-ii,cresst-ii, edelweiss-ii, genius-tf, zeplin-ii, xenon, or zeplin-iv detectors,one could immediately place upper bounds on the wimp mass of [103, 48, 6, 97,10, 52, 29, 29] gev, respectively. in addition, detectors with adequate energyresolution and sufficiently low recoil energy thresholds may determine thecrossover recoil energy at which the phase reverses, thereby obtaining anindependent measurement of the wimp mass. we study the capabilities of variousdetectors, and find that cresst-ii, zeplin-ii, and genius-tf should be able toobserve the phase reversal in a few years of runtime, and can thus determinethe mass of the wimp if it is $\mathcal{o}(100$ gev). xenon based detectorswith 1000 kg (xenon and zeplin-iv) and with energy recoil thresholds of a fewkev require 25 kg-yr exposure, which will be readily attained in upcomingexperiments.

astro-ph;0402080	probing the evolution of the dark energy density with future supernova  surveys	the time dependence of the dark energy density can be an important clue tothe nature of dark energy in the universe. we show that future supernova datafrom dedicated telescopes (such as snap), when combined with data of nearbysupernovae, can be used to determine how the dark energy density $\rho_x(z)$depends on redshift, if $\rho_x(z)$ is not too close to a constant. forquantitative comparison, we have done an extensive study of a number of darkenergy models. based on these models we have simulated data sets in order toshow that we can indeed reconstruct the correct sign of the time dependence ofthe dark energy density, outside of a degeneracy region centered on $1+w_0 =-w_1 z_{max}/3$ (where $z_{max}$ is the maximum redshift of the survey, e.g.,$z_{max}=1.7$ for snap). we emphasize that, given the same data, one can obtainmuch more information about the dark energy density directly (and its timedependence) than about its equation of state.

0808.3607	compatibility of dama/libra dark matter detection with other searches	the dama/nai and dama/libra annual modulation data, which may be interpretedas a signal for the existence of weakly interacting dark matter (wimps) in ourgalactic halo, are examined in light of null results from other experiments. weuse the energy spectrum of the combined dama modulation data given in 36 bins,and include the effect of channeling. several statistical tools are implementedin our study: likelihood ratio with a global fit and with raster scans in thewimp mass and goodness-of-fit (g.o.f.). these approaches allow us todifferentiate between the preferred (global best fit) and allowed (g.o.f.)parameter regions. it is hard to find wimp masses and couplings consistent withall existing data sets. for spin-independent (si) interactions, the best fitdama regions are ruled out to the 3$\sigma$ c.l., even with channeling takeninto account. however, for wimp masses of ~8 gev some parameters outside theseregions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the dama data and arecompatible with all 90% c.l. upper limits from negative searches, whenchanneling is included. for spin-dependent (sd) interactions with proton-onlycouplings, a range of masses below 10 gev is compatible with dama and otherexperiments, with and without channeling, when superk indirect detectionconstraints are included; without the superk constraints, masses as high as ~20gev are compatible. for sd neutron-only couplings we find no parameterscompatible with all the experiments. mixed sd couplings are examined: e.g. ~8gev mass wimps with a_n = +/- a_p are found to be consistent with allexperiments. in short, there are surviving regions at low mass for both si andsd interactions; if indirect detection limits are relaxed, some sd proton-onlycouplings at high masses also survive.

astro-ph;0501675	cardassian expansion: dark energy density from modified friedmann  equations	the cardassian universe is a proposed modification to the friedmann equationin which the universe is flat, matter dominated, and accelerating. in theordinary friedmann equation, the right hand side is a linear function of theenergy density, $h^2 \sim \rho$. here, instead, the right hand side of thefriedmann equation is a different function of the energy density, $h^2 \simg(\rho)$. this function returns to ordinary friedmann at early times, butdrives acceleration of the universe at the current epoch. the only ingredientsin this universe are matter and radiation: in particular, there is no vacuumcontribution. the new term required may arise, e.g., as a consequence of ourobservable universe living as a 3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensionaluniverse. a second possible interpretation of cardassian expansion isdeveloped, in which we treat the modified friedman equations as due to a fluid,in which the energy density has new contributions with negative pressure(possibly due to dark matter with self-interactions). predictions are shown forobservational tests of generalized cardassian models in future supernovasurveys.

astro-ph;0607121	annual modulation of dark matter in the presence of streams	in addition to a smooth component of wimp dark matter in galaxies, there maybe streams of material; the effects of wimp streams on direct detectionexperiments is examined in this paper. the contribution to the count rate dueto the stream cuts off at some characteristic energy. near this cutoff energy,the stream contribution to the annual modulation of recoils in the detector iscomparable to that of the thermalized halo, even if the stream represents onlya small portion (~5% or less) of the local halo density. consequently the totalmodulation may be quite different than would be expected for the standard halomodel alone: it may not be cosine-like and can peak at a different date thanexpected. the effects of speed, direction, density, and velocity dispersion ofa stream on the modulation are examined. we describe how the observation of amodulation can be used to determine these stream parameters. alternatively, thepresence of a dropoff in the recoil spectrum can be used to determine the wimpmass if the stream speed is known. the annual modulation of the cutoff energytogether with the annual modulation of the overall signal provide a "smokinggun" for wimp detection.

astro-ph;9804232	massive compact halo objects viewed from a cosmological perspective:  contribution to the baryonic mass density of the universe	[abridged] we estimate the contribution of massive compact halo objects(machos) and their stellar progenitors to the mass density of the universe. ifthe machos that have been detected reside in the halo of our galaxy, then asimple extrapolation of the galactic population (out to 50 kpc) of machos tocosmic scales gives a cosmic density $\rho_{macho} = (1-5) \times 10^9 h \msun\mpc^{-3}$, which in terms of the critical density corresponds to$\omega_{macho}=(0.0036-0.017) h^{-1}$. such a mass density is comparable tothe baryon density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis. if we take the centralvalues of the estimates, then machos dominate the baryonic content of theuniverse today, with $\omega_{macho}/\omega_{baryon} \sim 0.7 h$. however, thecumulative uncertainties in the density determinations only require that$\omega_{macho}/\omega_{baryon} \geq 1/6 h f_{gal}$, where the fraction ofgalaxies that contain machos $f_{gal} &gt; 0.17$, and $h$ is the hubble constantin units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$. our best estimate for $\omega_{macho}$is hard to reconcile with the current best estimates of the baryonic content ofthe intergalactic medium indicated by measurements of the lyman-$\alpha$forest. we explore the addition constraints that arise if the machos are whitedwarfs as suggested by the present microlensing data. we discuss the challengesthis scenario presents at both the local and cosmic scales, emphasizing inparticular the constraints on the required mass budget and nucleosynthesisproducts (particularly carbon).

astro-ph;9904291	chemical abundance constraints on white dwarfs as halo dark matter	we examine the chemical abundance constraints on a population of white dwarfsin the halo of our galaxy. we are motivated by microlensing evidence formassive compact halo objects (machos) in the galactic halo, but our workconstrains white dwarfs in the halo regardless of what the machos are. we focuson the composition of the material that would be ejected as the white dwarfsare formed; abundance patterns in the ejecta strongly constrain white dwarfproduction scenarios. using both analytical and numerical chemical evolutionmodels, we confirm that very strong constraints come from galactic pop ii andextragalactic carbon abundances. we also point out that depending on thestellar model, significant nitrogen is produced rather than carbon. thecombined constraints from c and n give $\omega_{wd} h &lt; 2 \times 10^{-4}$ fromcomparison with the low c and n abundances in the ly$\alpha$ forest. we note,however, that these results are subject to uncertainties regarding thenucleosynthesis of low-metallicity stars. we thus investigate additionalconstraints from d and $^4$he, finding that these light elements can be keptwithin observational limits only for $\omega_{wd} \la 0.003$ and for a whitedwarf progenitor initial mass function sharply peaked at low mass (2$m_\odot$).finally, we consider a galactic wind, which is required to remove the ejectaaccompanying white dwarf production from the galaxy. we show that such a windcan be driven by type ia supernovae arising from the white dwarfs themselves,but these supernovae also lead to unacceptably large abundances of iron. weconclude that abundance constraints exclude white dwarfs as machos.

0810.0228	slow nucleation rates in chain inflation with qcd axions or monodromy	the previous proposal (by two of us) of chain inflation with the qcd axion isshown to fail. the proposal involved a series of fast tunneling events, yethere it is shown that tunneling is too slow. we calculate the bubble nucleationrates for phase transitions in the thick wall limit, approximating the barrierby a triangle. a similar problem arises in realization of chain inflation inthe string landscape that uses series of minima along the monodromy staircasearound the conifold point. the basic problem is that the minima of thepotential are too far apart to allow rapid enough tunneling in these twomodels. we entertain the possibility of overcoming this problem by modifyingthe gravity sector to a brans-dicke theory. however, one would need extremelysmall values for the brans-dicke parameter. many successful alternatives exist,including other "axions" (with mass scales not set by qcd) or potentials withcomparable heights and widths that do not suffer from the problem of slowtunneling and provide successful candidates for chain inflation.

hep-ph;0208264	generalized cardassian expansion: models in which the universe is flat,  matter dominated, and accelerating	the cardassian universe is a proposed modification to the friedmann robertsonwalker (frw) equation in which the universe is flat, matter dominated, andaccelerating. here we generalize the original cardassian proposal to includeadditional variants on the frw equation. specific examples are presented.  in the ordinary frw equation, the right hand side is a linear function of theenergy density, $h^2 \sim \rho$. here, instead, the right hand side of the frwequation is a different function of the energy density, $h^2 \sim g(\rho)$.this function returns to ordinary frw at early times, but modifies theexpansion at a late epoch of the universe. the only ingredients in thisuniverse are matter and radiation: in particular, there is {\it no} vacuumcontribution. currently the modification of the frw equation is such that theuniverse accelerates. the universe can be flat and yet consist of only matterand radiation, and still be compatible with observations. the energy densityrequired to close the universe is much smaller than in a standard cosmology, sothat matter can be sufficient to provide a flat geometry. the modifications mayarise, e.g., as a consequence of our observable universe living as a3-dimensional brane in a higher dimensional universe. the cardassian modelsurvives several observational tests, including the cosmic backgroundradiation, the age of the universe, the cluster baryon fraction, and structureformation. as will be shown in future work, the predictions for observationaltests of the generalized cardassian models can be very different from genericquintessence models, whether the equation of state is constant or timedependent.

hep-ph;0209322	fluid interpretation of cardassian expansion	a fluid interpretation of cardassian expansion is developed. here, thefriedmann equation takes the form $h^2 = g(\rho_m)$ where $\rho_m$ containsonly matter and radiation (no vacuum). the function $g(\rhom)$ returns to theusual $8\pi\rhom/(3 m_{pl}^2)$ during the early history of the universe, buttakes a different form that drives an accelerated expansion after a redshift $z\sim 1$. one possible interpretation of this function (and of the right handside of einstein's equations) is that it describes a fluid with total energydensity $\rho_{tot} = {3 m_{pl}^2 \over 8 \pi} g(\rhom) = \rhom + \rho_k$containing not only matter density (mass times number density) but alsointeraction terms $\rho_k$. these interaction terms give rise to an effectivenegative pressure which drives cosmological acceleration. these interactionsmay be due to interacting dark matter, e.g. with a fifth force betweenparticles $f \sim r^{\alpha -1}$. such interactions may be intrinsically fourdimensional or may result from higher dimensional physics. a fully relativisticfluid model is developed here, with conservation of energy, momentum, andparticle number. a modified poisson's equation is derived. a study offluctuations in the early universe is presented, although a fully relativistictreatment of the perturbations including gauge choice is as yet incomplete.

hep-ph;0211250	observational tests of open strings in braneworld scenarios	we consider some consequences of describing the gauge and matter degrees offreedom in our universe by open strings, as suggested by the braneworldscenario. we focus on the geometric effects described by the open string metricand investigate their observational implications. the causal structure ofspacetime on the brane is altered; it is described not by the usual metric$g_{\mu\nu}$, but instead by the open string metric, that incorporates theelectromagnetic background, $g_{\mu\nu} = g_{\mu\nu} - (2\pi \alpha^\prime)^2(f^2)_{\mu\nu}$. the speed of light is now slower when propagating alongdirections transverse to electromagnetic fields or an ns-ns two form, so thatlorentz invariance is explicitly broken. a generalized equivalence principleguarantees that the propagation of {\it all} particles, not just photons, (withthe exception of gravitons) is slower in these transverse directions. wedescribe a variety of astrophysical and laboratory-based experiments designedto detect the predicted variations in the causal structure. we show thatcurrent technology cannot probe beyond open string lengths of $10^{-13}$ cm,corresponding to mev string scales. we also point out that in a braneworldscenario, constraints on large scale electromagnetic fields together with amodest phenomenological bound on the ns-ns two-form naturally lead to a boundon the scale of canonical noncommutativity that is two orders of magnitudebelow the string length. by invoking theoretical constraints on the ns-nstwo-form this bound can be improved to give an extremely strong bound on thenoncommutative scale well below the planck length, $\sqrt{|\theta|_{max}} &lt;10^{-35} {\rm cm} \times ({{\rm tev} \over {\rm string} {\rm scale}}

hep-ph;0211397	an accelerating universe from dark matter interactions with negative  pressure	as an explanation for the acceleration of the universe, we propose darkmatter with self-interactions characterized by a negative pressure; there is novacuum energy whatsoever in this cardassian model. these self-interactions mayarise due to a long-range "fifth force" which grows with the distance betweenparticles. we use the ordinary friedmann equation, $h^2 = 8 \pi g \rho/3$, andtake the energy density to be the sum of two terms: $\rho = \rho_m + \rho_k$.here $\rho_m \equiv m n_m$ is the ordinary mass density and $\rho_k \equiv\rho_k(\rho_m)$ is a new interaction term which depends only on the matterdensity. for example, in the original version of the cardassian model, $\rho_k= b \rho_m^n$ with $n&lt;2/3$; other examples are studied as well. we use theordinary four-dimensional einstein's equations $g_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi g t_{\mu\nu}$ and assume a perfect fluid form for the energy momentum tensor. given thisansatz, we can compute the accompanying pressure, and use the conservation ofthe energy-momentum tensor to obtain modified forms of the euler's equation,poisson equation, and continuity equation. with this fully relativisticdescription, one will then be able to compute growth of density perturbations,effects on the cosmic background radiation, and other effects with an eye toobservational tests of the model.

hep-ph;0609144	natural inflation: status after wmap 3-year data	the model of natural inflation is examined in light of recent 3-year datafrom the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe and shown to provide a good fit.the inflaton potential is naturally flat due to shift symmetries, and in thesimplest version takes the form $v(\phi) = \lambda^4 [1 \pm \cos(n\phi/f)]$.the model agrees with wmap3 measurements as long as $f &gt; 0.7 m_{pl}$ (where$m_{pl} = 1.22 \times 10^{19}$gev) and $\lambda \sim m_{gut}$. the running ofthe scalar spectral index is shown to be small -- an order of magnitude belowthe sensitivity of wmap3. the location of the field in the potential whenperturbations on observable scales are produced is examined; for $f &gt; 5m_{pl}$, the relevant part of the potential is indistinguishable from aquadratic, yet has the advantage that the required flatness is well-motivated.depending on the value of $f$, the model falls into the large field ($f \ge 1.5m_{pl}$) or small field ($f &lt; 1.5 m_{pl}$) classification scheme that has beenapplied to inflation models. natural inflation provides a good fit to wmap3data.

hep-ph;9207245	natural inflation: particle physics models, power law spectra for large  scale structure, and constraints from cobe	a pseudo-nambu-goldstone boson, with a potential of the form $v(\phi) =\lambda^4[1 \pm \cos(\phi/f)], naturally gives rise to inflation if $f \simm_{pl}$ and $\lambda \sim m_{gut}$. we show how this can arise intechnicolor-like and superstring models, and work out an explicit stringexample in the context of multiple gaugino condensation models. we study thecosmology of this model in detail, and find that sufficient reheating to ensurethat baryogenesis can take place requires $f &gt; 0.3 m_{pl}$. the primordialdensity fluctuation spectrum generated is a non-scale-invariant power law,$p(k) \propto k^{n_s}$, with $n_s \simeq 1 - (m^2_{pl}/8\pi f^2)$, leading tomore power on large length scales than the $n_s = 1$ harrison-zeldovichspectrum. the standard cdm model with $0 \la n_s \la 0.6-0.7$ could inprinciple explain the large-scale clustering observed in the apm and irasgalaxy surveys as well as large-scale flows, but the cobe microwave anisotropyimplies such low amplitudes (or high bias factors, $b&gt;2$) for these cdm modelsthat galaxy formation occurs too late to be viable; combining cobe withsufficiently early galaxy formation or the large-scale flows leads to $n_s&gt;0.6$, or $f &gt; 0.3 m_{pl}$ as well. for extended and power law inflationmodels, this constraint is even tighter, $n_s &gt; 0.7$; combined with otherbounds on large bubbles in extended inflation, this leaves little room for mostextended models.
