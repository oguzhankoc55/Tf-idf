physics;0505079	fundamental factors versus herding in the 2000-2005 us stock market and  prediction	we present a general methodology to incorporate fundamental economic factorsto our previous theory of herding to describe bubbles and antibubbles. we startfrom the strong form of rational expectation and derive the general method toincorporate factors in addition to the log-periodic power law (lppl) signatureof herding developed in ours and others' works. these factors include interestrate, interest spread, historical volatility, implied volatility and exchangerates. standard statistical aic and wilks tests allow us to compare theexplanatory power of the different proposed factor models. we find that thehistorical volatility played the key role before august of 2002. around october2002, the interest rate dominated. in the first six months of 2003, the foreignexchange rate became the key factor. since the end of 2003, all factors haveplayed an increasingly large role. however, the most surprising result is thatthe best model is the second-order lppl without any factor. we thus present ascenario for the future evolution of the us stock market based on theextrapolation of the fit of the second-order lppl formula, which suggests thatherding is still the dominating force and that the unraveling of the us stockmarket antibubble since 2000 is still qualitatively similar to (butquantitatively different from) the japanese nikkei case after 1990.

physics;0607197	lead-lag cross-sectional structure and detection of  correlated-anticorrelated regime shifts: application to the volatilities of  inflation and economic growth rates	we have recently introduced the ``thermal optimal path'' (top) method toinvestigate the real-time lead-lag structure between two time series. the topmethod consists in searching for a robust noise-averaged optimal path of thedistance matrix along which the two time series have the greatest similarity.here, we generalize the top method by introducing a more general definition ofdistance which takes into account possible regime shifts between positive andnegative correlations. this generalization to track possible changes ofcorrelation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention(or consensus) to another. numerical simulations on synthetic time seriesverify that the new top method performs as expected even in the presence ofsubstantial noise. we then apply it to investigate changes of convention in thedependence structure between the historical volatilities of the usa inflationrate and economic growth rate. several measures show that the new top methodsignificantly outperforms standard cross-correlation methods.

physics;0701017	quantifying bid-ask spreads in the chinese stock market using  limit-order book data: intraday pattern, probability distribution, long  memory, and multifractal nature	the statistical properties of the bid-ask spread of a frequently tradedchinese stock listed on the shenzhen stock exchange are investigated using thelimit-order book data. three different definitions of spread are consideredbased on the time right before transactions, the time whenever the highestbuying price or the lowest selling price changes, and a fixed time interval.the results are qualitatively similar no matter linear prices or logarithmicprices are used. the average spread exhibits evident intraday patternsconsisting of a big l-shape in morning transactions and a small l-shape in theafternoon. the distributions of the spread with different definitions decay aspower laws. the tail exponents of spreads at transaction level are well withinthe interval $(2,3)$ and that of average spreads are well in line with theinverse cubic law for different time intervals. based on the detrendedfluctuation analysis, we found the evidence of long memory in the bid-askspread time series for all three definitions, even after the removal of theintraday pattern. using the classical box-counting approach for multifractalanalysis, we show that the time series of bid-ask spread does not possessmultifractal nature.

physics;0701171	a case study of speculative financial bubbles in the south african stock  market 2003-2006	we tested 45 indices and common stocks traded in the south african stockmarket for the possible existence of a bubble over the period from jan. 2003 tomay 2006. a bubble is defined by a faster-than-exponential acceleration withsignificant log-periodic oscillations. the faster-than-exponential accelerationcharacteristics are tested with several different metrics, includingnonlinearity on the logarithm of the price and power law fits. the log-periodicproperties are investigated in detail using the first-order log-periodicpower-law (lppl) formula, the parametric detrending method, the$(h,q)$-analysis, and the second-order weierstrass-type model, resulting in aconsistent and robust estimation of the fundamental angular log-frequency$\omega_1 =7\pm 2$, in reasonable agreement with previous estimations on manyother bubbles in developed and developing markets. sensitivity tests of theestimated critical times and of the angular log-frequency are performed byvarying the first date and the last date of the stock price time series. thesetests show that the estimated parameters are robust. with the insight of 6additional month of data since the analysis was performed, we observe that manyof the stocks on the south africa market experienced an abrupt drop mid-june2006, which is compatible with the predicted $t_c$ for several of the stocks,but not all. this suggests that the mini-crash that occurred around mid-june of2006 was only a partial correction, which has resumed into a renewed bubblyacceleration bound to end some times in 2007, similarly to what happened on thes&amp;p500 us market from oct. 1997 to aug. 1998.

0905.0582	empirical regularities of opening call auction in chinese stock market	we study the statistical regularities of opening call auction using theultra-high-frequency data of 22 liquid stocks traded on the shenzhen stockexchange in 2003. the distribution of the relative price, defined as therelative difference between the order price in opening call auction and theclosing price of last trading day, is asymmetric and that the distributiondisplays a sharp peak at zero relative price and a relatively wide peak atnegative relative price. the detrended fluctuation analysis (dfa) method isadopted to investigate the long-term memory of relative order prices. wefurther study the statistical regularities of order sizes in opening callauction, and observe a phenomenon of number preference, known as order sizeclustering. the probability density function (pdf) of order sizes could be wellfitted by a $q$-gamma function, and the long-term memory also exists in ordersizes. in addition, both the average volume and the average number of ordersdecrease exponentially with the price level away from the best bid or ask pricelevel in the limit-order book (lob) established immediately after the openingcall auction, and a price clustering phenomenon is observed.

0907.3284	modified detrended fluctuation analysis based on empirical mode  decomposition	detrended fluctuation analysis (dfa) is a simple but very efficient methodfor investigating the power-law long-term correlations of non-stationary timeseries, in which a detrending step is necessary to obtain the localfluctuations at different timescales. we propose to determine the local trendsthrough empirical mode decomposition (emd) and perform the detrending operationby removing the emd-based local trends, which gives an emd-based dfa method.similarly, we also propose a modified multifractal dfa algorithm, called anemd-based mfdfa. the performance of the emd-based dfa and mfdfa methods isassessed with extensive numerical experiments based on fractional brownianmotion and multiplicative cascading process. we find that the emd-based dfamethod performs better than the classic dfa method in the determination of thehurst index when the time series is strongly anticorrelated and the emd-basedmfdfa method outperforms the traditional mfdfa method when the moment order $q$of the detrended fluctuations is positive. we apply the emd-based mfdfa to theone-minute data of shanghai stock exchange composite index, and the presence ofmultifractality is confirmed.

0908.1089	the components of empirical multifractality in financial returns	we perform a systematic investigation on the components of the empiricalmultifractality of financial returns using the daily data of dow jonesindustrial average from 26 may 1896 to 27 april 2007 as an example. thetemporal structure and fat-tailed distribution of the returns are considered aspossible influence factors. the multifractal spectrum of the original returnseries is compared with those of four kinds of surrogate data: (1) shuffleddata that contain no temporal correlation but have the same distribution, (2)surrogate data in which any nonlinear correlation is removed but thedistribution and linear correlation are preserved, (3) surrogate data in whichlarge positive and negative returns are replaced with small values, and (4)surrogate data generated from alternative fat-tailed distributions with thetemporal correlation preserved. we find that all these factors have influenceon the multifractal spectrum. we also find that the temporal structure (linearor nonlinear) has minor impact on the singularity width $\delta\alpha$ of themultifractal spectrum while the fat tails have major impact on $\delta\alpha$,which confirms the earlier results. in addition, the linear correlation isfound to have only a horizontal translation effect on the multifractal spectrumin which the distance is approximately equal to the difference between its dfascaling exponent and 0.5. our method can also be applied to other financial orphysical variables and other multifractal formalisms.

0909.1007	bubble diagnosis and prediction of the 2005-2007 and 2008-2009 chinese  stock market bubbles	by combining (i) the economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, (ii)behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders and (iii)the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions,the log-periodic power law model has been developed as a flexible tool todetect bubbles. the lppl model considers the faster-than-exponential (power lawwith finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated byaccelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. it embodies apositive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negativefeedback spirals of crash expectations. we use the lppl model in one of itsincarnations to analyze two bubbles and subsequent market crashes in twoimportant indexes in the chinese stock markets between may 2005 and july 2009.both the shanghai stock exchange composite and shenzhen stock exchangecomponent indexes exhibited such behavior in two distinct time periods: 1) frommid-2005, bursting in oct. 2007 and 2) from nov. 2008, bursting in thebeginning of aug. 2009. we successfully predicted time windows for both crashesin advance with the same methods used to successfully predict the peak inmid-2006 of the us housing bubble and the peak in july 2008 of the global oilbubble. the more recent bubble in the chinese indexes was detected and its endor change of regime was predicted independently by two groups with similarresults, showing that the model has been well-documented and can be replicatedby industrial practitioners. here we present more detailed analysis of theindividual chinese index predictions and of the methods used to make and testthem.

0911.0057	scaling and memory in the non-poisson process of limit order cancelation	the order submission and cancelation processes are two crucial aspects in theprice formation of stocks traded in order-driven markets. we investigate thedynamics of order cancelation by studying the statistical properties ofinter-cancelation durations defined as the waiting times between consecutiveorder cancelations of 22 liquid stocks traded on the shenzhen stock exchange ofchina in year 2003. three types of cancelations are considered includingcancelation of any limit orders, of buy limit orders and of sell limit orders.we find that the distributions of the inter-cancelation durations of individualstocks can be well modeled by weibulls for each type of cancelation and thedistributions of rescaled durations of each type of cancelations exhibit ascaling behavior for different stocks. complex intraday patterns are alsounveiled in the inter-cancelation durations. the detrended fluctuation analysis(dfa) and the multifractal dfa show that the inter-cancelation durationspossess long-term memory and multifractal nature, which are not influenced bythe intraday patterns. no clear crossover phenomenon is observed in thedetrended fluctuation functions with respect to the time scale. these findingsindicate that the cancelation of limit orders is a non-poisson process, whichhas potential worth in the construction of order-driven market models.

0912.4782	finite-size effect and the components of multifractality in financial  volatility	many financial variables are found to exhibit multifractal nature, which isusually attributed to the influence of temporal correlations and fat-tailednessin the probability distribution (pdf). based on the partition function approachof multifractal analysis, we show that there is a marked finite-size effect inthe detection of multifractality, and the effective multifractality is theapparent multifractality after removing the finite-size effect. we find thatthe effective multifractality can be further decomposed into two components,the pdf component and the nonlinearity component. referring to the normaldistribution, we can determine the pdf component by comparing the effectivemultifractality of the original time series and the surrogate data that have anormal distribution and keep the same linear and nonlinear correlations as theoriginal data. we demonstrate our method by taking the daily volatility data ofdow jones industrial average from 26 may 1896 to 27 april 2007 as an example.extensive numerical experiments show that a time series exhibits effectivemultifractality only if it possesses nonlinearity and the pdf has impact on theeffective multifractality only when the time series possesses nonlinearity. ourmethod can also be applied to judge the presence of multifractality anddetermine its components of multifractal time series in other complex systems.

1001.3176	analyzing the prices of the most expensive sheet iron all over the  world: modeling, prediction and regime change	the private car license plates issued in shanghai are bestowed the title of"the most expensive sheet iron all over the world", more expensive than gold. acitizen has to bid in an monthly auction to obtain a license plate for his newprivate car. we perform statistical analysis to investigate the influence ofthe minimal price $p_{\min}$ of the bidding winners, the quota $n_{\rm{quota}}$of private car license plates, the number $n_{\rm{bidder}}$ of bidders, as wellas two external shocks including the legality debate of the auction in 2004 andthe auction regime reform in january 2008 on the average price $p_{\rm{mean}}$of all bidding winners. it is found that the legality debate of the auction hadmarginal transient impact on the average price in a short time period. incontrast, the change of the auction rules has significant permanent influenceon the average price, which reduces the price by about 3020 yuan renminbi. itmeans that the average price exhibits nonlinear behaviors with a regime change.the evolution of the average price is independent of the number$n_{\rm{bidder}}$ of bidders in both regimes. in the early regime beforejanuary 2008, the average price $p_{\rm{mean}}$ was influenced only by theminimal price $p_{\min}$ in the preceding month with a positive correlation. inthe current regime since january 2008, the average price is positivelycorrelated with the minimal price and the quota in the preceding month andnegatively correlated with the quota in the same month. we test the predictivepower of the two models using 2-year and 3-year moving windows and find thatthe latter outperforms the former. it seems that the auction market becomesmore efficient after the auction reform since the prediction error increases.

1003.0168	order flow dynamics around extreme price changes on an emerging stock  market	we study the dynamics of order flows around large intraday price changesusing ultra-high-frequency data from the shenzhen stock exchange. we find asignificant reversal of price for both intraday price decreases and increaseswith a permanent price impact. the volatility, the volume of different types oforders, the bid-ask spread, and the volume imbalance increase before theextreme events and decay slowly as a power law, which forms a well-establishedpeak. the volume of buy market orders increases faster and the correspondingpeak appears earlier than for sell market orders around positive events, whilethe volume peak of sell market orders leads buy market orders in the magnitudeand time around negative events. when orders are divided into four groupsaccording to their aggressiveness, we find that the behaviors of order volumeand order number are similar, except for buy limit orders and canceled ordersthat the peak of order number postpones two minutes later after the peak oforder volume, implying that investors placing large orders are more informedand play a central role in large price fluctuations. we also study the relativerates of different types of orders and find differences in the dynamics ofrelative rates between buy orders and sell orders and between individualinvestors and institutional investors. there is evidence showing thatinstitutions behave very differently from individuals and that they have moreaggressive strategies. combing these findings, we conclude that institutionalinvestors are more informed and play a more influential role in driving largeprice fluctuations.

0708.3198	universal price impact functions of individual trades in an order-driven  market	the trade size $\omega$ has direct impact on the price formation of the stocktraded. econophysical analyses of transaction data for the us and australianstock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws, where a master curveof price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization $c$ isincluded as an argument in the scaling relation. however, the rationale ofintroducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalousnegative correlation between price change $r$ and trade size $\omega$ for smalltrades is unexplained. here we show that these issues can be addressed bytaking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades togetherwith a proper normalization technique. using order book data from the chinesemarket, we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders havevery different price impact. the price impact of trades from partially filledorders is constant when the volume is not too large, while that of filledorders shows power-law behavior $r\sim \omega^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx2/3$.when returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages,capitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades.however, no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can beconstructed. in addition, the relation $\alpha=\alpha_\omega/\alpha_r$ isverified, where $\alpha_\omega$ and $\alpha_r$ are the tail exponents of tradesizes and returns. these observations also enable us to explain the anomalousnegative correlation between $r$ and $\omega$ for small-size trades. weanticipate that these regularities may hold in other order-driven markets.

1102.2138	the us stock market leads the federal funds rate and treasury bond  yields	using a recently introduced method to quantify the time varying lead-lagdependencies between pairs of economic time series (the thermal optimal pathmethod), we test two fundamental tenets of the theory of fixed income: (i) thestock market variations and the yield changes should be anti-correlated; (ii)the change in central bank rates, as a proxy of the monetary policy of thecentral bank, should be a predictor of the future stock market direction. usingboth monthly and weekly data, we found very similar lead-lag dependence betweenthe s&amp;p500 stock market index and the yields of bonds inside two groups: bondyields of short-term maturities (federal funds rate (ffr), 3m, 6m, 1y, 2y, and3y) and bond yields of long-term maturities (5y, 7y, 10y, and 20y). in allcases, we observe the opposite of (i) and (ii). first, the stock market andyields move in the same direction. second, the stock market leads the yields,including and especially the ffr. moreover, we find that the short-term yieldsin the first group lead the long-term yields in the second group before thefinancial crisis that started mid-2007 and the inverse relationship holdsafterwards. these results suggest that the federal reserve is increasinglymindful of the stock market behavior, seen at key to the recovery and health ofthe economy. long-term investors seem also to have been more reactive andmindful of the signals provided by the financial stock markets than the federalreserve itself after the start of the financial crisis. the lead of the s&amp;p500stock market index over the bond yields of all maturities is confirmed by thetraditional lagged cross-correlation analysis.

1103.2577	multifractal detrending moving average cross-correlation analysis	there are a number of situations in which several signals are simultaneouslyrecorded in complex systems, which exhibit long-term power-lawcross-correlations. the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis(mf-dcca) approaches can be used to quantify such cross-correlations, such asthe mf-dcca based on detrended fluctuation analysis (mf-x-dfa) method. wedevelop in this work a class of mf-dcca algorithms based on the detrendingmoving average analysis, called mf-x-dma. the performances of the mf-x-dmaalgorithms are compared with the mf-x-dfa method by extensive numericalexperiments on pairs of time series generated from bivariate fractionalbrownian motions, two-component autoregressive fractionally integrated movingaverage processes and binomial measures, which have theoretical expressions ofthe multifractal nature. in all cases, the scaling exponents $h_{xy}$ extractedfrom the mf-x-dma and mf-x-dfa algorithms are very close to the theoreticalvalues. for bivariate fractional brownian motions, the scaling exponent of thecross-correlation is independent of the cross-correlation coefficient betweentwo time series and the mf-x-dfa and centered mf-x-dma algorithms havecomparative performance, which outperform the forward and backward mf-x-dmaalgorithms. we apply these algorithms to the return time series of two stockmarket indexes and to their volatilities. for the returns, the centeredmf-x-dma algorithm gives the best estimates of $h_{xy}(q)$ since its$h_{xy}(2)$ is closest to 0.5 as expected, and the mf-x-dfa algorithm has thesecond best performance. for the volatilities, the forward and backwardmf-x-dma algorithms give similar results, while the centered mf-x-dma and themf-x-dfa algorithms fails to extract rational multifractal nature.

1112.6085	the position profiles of order cancellations in an emerging stock market	order submission and cancellation are two constituent actions of stocktrading behaviors in order-driven markets. order submission dynamics has beenextensively studied for different markets, while order cancellation dynamics isless understood. there are two positions associated with a cancellation, thatis, the price level in the limit-order book (lob) and the position in the queueat each price level. we study the profiles of these two order cancellationpositions through rebuilding the limit-order book using the order flow data of23 liquid stocks traded on the shenzhen stock exchange in the year 2003. wefind that the profiles of relative price levels where cancellations occur obeya log-normal distribution. after normalizing the relative price level byremoving the factor of order numbers stored at the price level, we find thatthe profiles exhibit a power-law scaling behavior on the right tails for bothbuy and sell orders. when focusing on the order cancellation positions in thequeue at each price level, we find that the profiles increase rapidly in thefront of the queue, and then fluctuate around a constant value till the end ofthe queue. these profiles are similar for different stocks. in addition, theprofiles of cancellation positions can be fitted by an exponent function forboth buy and sell orders. these two kinds of cancellation profiles seemuniversal for different stocks investigated and exhibit minor asymmetry betweenbuy and sell orders. our empirical findings shed new light on the ordercancellation dynamics and pose constraints on the construction of order-drivenstock market models.

1201.2825	effects of long memory in the order submission process on the properties  of recurrence intervals of large price fluctuations	understanding the statistical properties of recurrence intervals of extremeevents is crucial to risk assessment and management of complex systems. theprobability distributions and correlations of recurrence intervals for manysystems have been extensively investigated. however, the impacts of microscopicrules of a complex system on the macroscopic properties of its recurrenceintervals are less studied. in this letter, we adopt an order-driven stockmarket model to address this issue for stock returns. we find that thedistributions of the scaled recurrence intervals of simulated returns have apower law scaling with stretched exponential cutoff and the intervals possessmultifractal nature, which are consistent with empirical results. we furtherinvestigate the effects of long memory in the directions (or signs) andrelative prices of the order flow on the characteristic quantities of theseproperties. it is found that the long memory in the order directions (hurstindex $h_s$) has a negligible effect on the interval distributions and themultifractal nature. in contrast, the power-law exponent of the intervaldistribution increases linearly with respect to the hurst index $h_x$ of therelative prices, and the singularity width of the multifractal naturefluctuates around a constant value when $h_x&lt;0.7$ and then increases with$h_x$. no evident effects of $h_s$ and $h_x$ are found on the long memory ofthe recurrence intervals. our results indicate that the nontrivial propertiesof the recurrence intervals of returns are mainly caused by traders' behaviorsof persistently placing new orders around the best bid and ask prices.

1201.5448	determinants of immediate price impacts at the trade level in an  emerging order-driven market	the common wisdom argues that, in general, large trades cause large pricechanges, while small trades cause small price changes. however, for extremelylarge price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while theliquidity (especially price gaps on the limit order book) is a more influencingfactor. hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate priceimpacts of trades. in this paper, through mechanical analysis of pricevariations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that thetrade size, the bid-ask spread, the price gaps and the outstanding volumes atthe bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes ofprices. we propose two regression models to investigate the influences of thesemicroscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filledtrades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filledtrades, and seller-initiated filled trades. we find that they havequantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for upto 44% of the price impacts. large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, highliquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause alarge price impact. we also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has amore influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side. our results shednew lights on the determinants of immediate price impacts.

1211.5502	extreme value statistics and recurrence intervals of nymex energy  futures volatility	energy markets and the associated energy futures markets play a crucial rolein global economies. we investigate the statistical properties of therecurrence intervals of daily volatility time series of four nymex energyfutures, which are defined as the waiting times $\tau$ between consecutivevolatilities exceeding a given threshold $q$. we find that the recurrenceintervals are distributed as a stretched exponential $p_q(\tau)\sime^{(a\tau)^{-\gamma}}$, where the exponent $\gamma$ decreases with increasing$q$, and there is no scaling behavior in the distributions for differentthresholds $q$ after the recurrence intervals are scaled with the meanrecurrence interval $\bar\tau$. these findings are significant under thekolmogorov-smirnov test and the cram{\'e}r-von mises test. we show thatempirical estimations are in nice agreement with the numerical integrationresults for the occurrence probability $w_q(\delta{t}|t)$ of a next event abovethe threshold $q$ within a (short) time interval after an elapsed time $t$ fromthe last event above $q$. we also investigate the memory effects of therecurrence intervals. it is found that the conditional distributions of largeand small recurrence intervals differ from each other and the conditional meanof the recurrence intervals scales as a power law of the preceding interval$\bar\tau(\tau_0)/\bar\tau \sim (\tau_0/\bar\tau)^\beta$, indicating that therecurrence intervals have short-term correlations. detrended fluctuationanalysis and detrending moving average analysis further uncover that therecurrence intervals possess long-term correlations. we confirm that the"clustering" of the volatility recurrence intervals is caused by the long-termcorrelations well known to be present in the volatility.

1402.6573	a comparative analysis of the statistical properties of large mobile  phone calling networks	mobile phone calling is one of the most widely used communication methods inmodern society. the records of calls among mobile phone users provide us avaluable proxy for the understanding of human communication patterns embeddedin social networks. mobile phone users call each other forming a directedcalling network. if only reciprocal calls are considered, we obtain anundirected mutual calling network. the preferential communication behaviorbetween two connected users can be statistically tested and it results in twobonferroni networks with statistically validated edges. we perform acomparative analysis of the statistical properties of these four networks,which are constructed from the calling records of more than nine millionindividuals in shanghai over a period of 110 days. we find that these networksshare many common structural properties and also exhibit idiosyncratic featureswhen compared with previously studied large mobile calling networks. theempirical findings provide us an intriguing picture of a representative largesocial network that might shed new lights on the modelling of large socialnetworks.

1403.3478	empirical properties of inter-cancellation durations in the chinese  stock market	order cancellation process plays a crucial role in the dynamics of priceformation in order-driven stock markets and is important in the constructionand validation of computational finance models. based on the order flow data of18 liquid stocks traded on the shenzhen stock exchange in 2003, we investigatethe empirical statistical properties of inter-cancellation durations in unitsof events defined as the waiting times between two consecutive cancellations.the inter-cancellation durations for both buy and sell orders of all the stocksfavor a $q$-exponential distribution when the maximum likelihood estimationmethod is adopted; in contrast, both cancelled buy orders of 6 stocks andcancelled sell orders of 3 stocks prefer weibull distribution when thenonlinear least-square estimation is used. applying detrended fluctuationanalysis (dfa), centered detrending moving average (cdma) and multifractaldetrended fluctuation analysis (mf-dfa) methods, we unveil that theinter-cancellation duration time series process long memory and multifractalnature for both buy and sell cancellations of all the stocks. our findings showthat order cancellation processes exhibit long-range correlated burstybehaviors and are thus not poissonian.

1403.3785	statistically validated mobile communication networks: evolution of  motifs in european and chinese data	big data open up unprecedented opportunities to investigate complex systemsincluding the society. in particular, communication data serve as major sourcesfor computational social sciences but they have to be cleaned and filtered asthey may contain spurious information due to recording errors as well asinteractions, like commercial and marketing activities, not directly related tothe social network. the network constructed from communication data can only beconsidered as a proxy for the network of social relationships. here we apply asystematic method, based on multiple hypothesis testing, to statisticallyvalidate the links and then construct the corresponding bonferroni network,generalized to the directed case. we study two large datasets of mobile phonerecords, one from europe and the other from china. for both datasets we comparethe raw data networks with the corresponding bonferroni networks and point outsignificant differences in the structures and in the basic network measures. weshow evidence that the bonferroni network provides a better proxy for thenetwork of social interactions than the original one. by using the filterednetworks we investigated the statistics and temporal evolution of smalldirected 3-motifs and conclude that closed communication triads have aformation time-scale, which is quite fast and typically intraday. we also findthat open communication triads preferentially evolve to other open triads witha higher fraction of reciprocated calls. these stylized facts were observed forboth datasets.

1404.1051	microscopic determinants of the weak-form efficiency of an artificial  order-driven stock market	stock markets are efficient in the weak form in the sense that no significantautocorrelations can be identified in the returns. however, the microscopicmechanisms are unclear. we aim at understanding the impacts of order flows onthe weak-form efficiency through computational experiments based on anempirical order-driven model. three possible determinants embedded in the modelare investigated, including the tail heaviness of relative prices of the placedorders characterized by the tail index $\alpha_x$, the degree of long memory inrelative prices quantified by its hurst index $h_x$, and the strength of longmemory in order direction depicted by $h_x$. it is found that the degree ofautocorrelations in returns (quantified by its hurst index $h_r$) is negativelycorrelated with $\alpha_x$ and $h_x$ and positively correlated with $h_s$. inaddition, the values of $\alpha_x$ and $h_x$ have negligible impacts on $h_r$,whereas $h_s$ exhibits a dominating impact on $h_r$. our results suggest thatstock markets are complex adaptive systems and self-organize to a criticalstate in which the returns are not correlated.

1408.5618	symmetric thermal optimal path and time-dependent lead-lag relationship:  novel statistical tests and application to uk and us real-estate and monetary  policies	we present the symmetric thermal optimal path (tops) method to determine thetime-dependent lead-lag relationship between two stochastic time series. thisnovel version of the previously introduced top method alleviates someinconsistencies by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariantwith respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. thismeans that, if `$x$ comes before $y$', this transforms into `$y$ comes before$x$' under a time reversal. we show that previously proposed bootstrap testlacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that thereis no lead-lag correlation when it is present. we introduce instead two noveltests. the first free energy p-value $\rho$ criterion quantifies theprobability that a given lead-lag structure could be obtained from random timeseries with similar characteristics except of the lead-lag information. thesecond self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the lead-lag path to besignificant, synchronising the two time series using the time varying lead-lagpath should lead to a statistically significant correlation. we performintensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations.finally, we apply the tops method with the two new tests to the time dependentlead-lag structures of house price and monetary policy of the united kingdom(uk) and united states (us) from 1991 to 2011. the tops approach stresses theimportance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces ofinformation or policies may have drastically different impacts anddevelopments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopoliticalconditions. this study reinforces the view that the hypothesis of statisticalstationarity is highly questionable.

0804.3431	scaling in the distribution of intertrade durations of chinese stocks	the distribution of intertrade durations, defined as the waiting timesbetween two consecutive transactions, is investigated based upon the limitorder book data of 23 liquid chinese stocks listed on the shenzhen stockexchange in the whole year 2003. a scaling pattern is observed in thedistributions of intertrade durations, where the empirical density functions ofthe normalized intertrade durations of all 23 stocks collapse onto a singlecurve. the scaling pattern is also observed in the intertrade durationdistributions for filled and partially filled trades and in the conditionaldistributions. the ensemble distributions for all stocks are modeled by theweibull and the tsallis $q$-exponential distributions. maximum likelihoodestimation shows that the weibull distribution outperforms the $q$-exponentialfor not-too-large intertrade durations which account for more than 98.5% of thedata. alternatively, nonlinear least-squares estimation selects the$q$-exponential as a better model, in which the optimization is conducted onthe distance between empirical and theoretical values of the logarithmicprobability densities. the distribution of intertrade durations is weibullfollowed by a power-law tail with an asymptotic tail exponent close to 3.

1503.03745	weiqi games as a tree: zipf's law of openings and beyond	weiqi is one of the most complex board games played by two persons. theplacement strategies adopted by weiqi players are often used to analog thephilosophy of human wars. contrary to the western chess, weiqi games are lessstudied by academics partially because weiqi is popular only in east asia,especially in china, japan and korea. here, we propose to construct a directedtree using a database of extensive weiqi games and perform a quantitativeanalysis of the weiqi tree. we find that the popularity distribution of weiqiopenings with a same number of moves is distributed according to a power lawand the tail exponent increases with the number of moves. intriguingly, thesuperposition of the popularity distributions of weiqi openings with the numberof moves no more than a given number also has a power-law tail in which thetail exponent increases with the number of moves, and the superposeddistribution approaches to the zipf law. these findings are the same as forchess and support the conjecture that the popularity distribution of board gameopenings follows the zipf law with a universal exponent. we also find that thedistribution of out-degrees has a power-law form, the distribution of branchingratios has a very complicated pattern, and the distribution of uniquenessscores defined by the path lengths from the root vertex to the leaf verticesexhibits a unimodal shape. our work provides a promising direction for thestudy of the decision making process of weiqi playing from the angle ofdirected branching tree.

1505.00328	profitability of contrarian strategies in the chinese stock market	this paper reexamines the profitability of loser, winner and contrarianportfolios in the chinese stock market using monthly data of all stocks tradedon the shanghai stock exchange and shenzhen stock exchange covering the periodfrom january 1997 to december 2012. we find evidence of short-term andlong-term contrarian profitability in the whole sample period when theestimation and holding horizons are 1 month or longer than 12 months and theannualized returns of contrarian portfolios increases with the estimation andholding horizons. we perform subperiod analysis and find that the long-termcontrarian effect is significant in both bullish and bearish states while theshort-term contrarian effect disappears in bullish states. we compare theperformance of contrarian portfolios based on different grouping manners in theestimation period and unveil that decile grouping outperforms quintile groupingand tertile grouping, which is more evident and robust in the long run.generally, loser portfolios and winner portfolios have positive returns andloser portfolios perform much better than winner portfolios. both loser andwinner portfolios in bullish states perform better than those in the wholesample period. in contrast, loser and winner portfolios have smaller returns inbearish states in which loser portfolio returns are significant only in thelong term and winner portfolio returns become insignificant. these results arerobust to the one-month skipping between the estimation and holding periods andfor the two stock exchanges. our findings show that the chinese stock market isnot efficient in the weak form. these findings also have obvious practicalimplications for financial practitioners.

1505.02750	effects of polynomial trends on detrending moving average analysis	the detrending moving average (dma) algorithm is one of the best performingmethods to quantify the long-term correlations in nonstationary time series.many long-term correlated time series in real systems contain various trends.we investigate the effects of polynomial trends on the scaling behaviors andthe performances of three widely used dma methods including backward algorithm(bdma), centered algorithm (cdma) and forward algorithm (fdma). we derive ageneral framework for polynomial trends and obtain analytical results forconstant shifts and linear trends. we find that the behavior of the cdma methodis not influenced by constant shifts. in contrast, linear trends cause acrossover in the cdma fluctuation functions. we also find that constant shiftsand linear trends cause crossovers in the fluctuation functions obtained fromthe bdma and fdma methods. when a crossover exists, the scaling behavior atsmall scales comes from the intrinsic time series while that at large scales isdominated by the constant shifts or linear trends. we also derive analyticallythe expressions of crossover scales and show that the crossover scale dependson the strength of the polynomial trend, the hurst index, and in some cases(linear trends for bdma and fdma) the length of the time series. in all cases,the bdma and the fdma behave almost the same under the influence of constantshifts or linear trends. extensive numerical experiments confirm excellentlythe analytical derivations. we conclude that the cdma method outperforms thebdma and fdma methods in the presence of polynomial trends.

0805.3593	on the probability distribution of stock returns in the mike-farmer  model	recently, mike and farmer have constructed a very powerful and realisticbehavioral model to mimick the dynamic process of stock price formation basedon the empirical regularities of order placement and cancelation in a purelyorder-driven market, which can successfully reproduce the whole distribution ofreturns, not only the well-known power-law tails, together with several otherimportant stylized facts. there are three key ingredients in the mike-farmer(mf) model: the long memory of order signs characterized by the hurst index$h_s$, the distribution of relative order prices $x$ in reference to the samebest price described by a student distribution (or tsallis' $q$-gaussian), andthe dynamics of order cancelation. they showed that different values of thehurst index $h_s$ and the freedom degree $\alpha_x$ of the student distributioncan always produce power-law tails in the return distribution $f(r)$ withdifferent tail exponent $\alpha_r$. in this paper, we study the origin of thepower-law tails of the return distribution $f(r)$ in the mf model, based onextensive simulations with different combinations of the left part $f_l(x)$ for$x&lt;0$ and the right part $f_r(x)$ for $x&gt;0$ of $f(x)$. we find that power-lawtails appear only when $f_l(x)$ has a power-law tail, no matter $f_r(x)$ has apower-law tail or not. in addition, we find that the distributions of returnsin the mf model at different timescales can be well modeled by the studentdistributions, whose tail exponents are close to the well-known cubic law andincrease with the timescale.

1508.07503	two-state markov-chain poisson nature of individual cellphone call  statistics	humans are heterogenous and the behaviors of individuals could be differentfrom that at the population level. we conduct an in-depth study of the temporalpatterns of cellphone conversation activities of 73'339 anonymous cellphoneusers with the same truncated weibull distribution of inter-call durations. wefind that the individual call events exhibit a pattern of bursts, in which highactivity periods are alternated with low activity periods. surprisingly, thenumber of events in high activity periods are found to conform to a power-lawdistribution at the population level, but follow an exponential distribution atthe individual level, which is a hallmark of absence of memory in individualcall activities. such exponential distribution is also observed for the numberof events in low activity periods. together with the exponential distributionsof inter-call durations within bursts and of the intervals between consecutivebursts, we demonstrate that the individual call activities are driven by twoindependent poisson processes, which can be combined within a minimal model interms of a two-state first-order markov chain giving very good agreement withthe empirical distributions using the parameters estimated from real data forabout half of the individuals in our sample. by measuring directly thedistributions of call rates across the population, which exhibit power-lawtails, we explain the difference with previous population level studies,purporting the existence of power-law distributions, via the "superposition ofdistributions" mechanism: the superposition of many exponential distributionsof activities with a power-law distribution of their characteristic scalesleads to a power-law distribution of the activities at the population level.

1508.07505	early warning of large volatilities based on recurrence interval  analysis in chinese stock markets	being able to forcast extreme volatility is a central issue in financial riskmanagement. we present a large volatility predicting method based on thedistribution of recurrence intervals between volatilities exceeding a certainthreshold $q$ for a fixed expected recurrence time $\tau_q$. we find that therecurrence intervals are well approximated by the $q$-exponential distributionfor all stocks and all $\tau_q$ values. thus a analytical formula fordetermining the hazard probability $w(\delta t |t)$ that a volatility above $q$will occur within a short interval $\delta t$ if the last volatility exceeding$q$ happened $t$ periods ago can be directly derived from the $q$-exponentialdistribution, which is found to be in good agreement with the empirical hazardprobability from real stock data. using these results, we adopt adecision-making algorithm for triggering the alarm of the occurrence of thenext volatility above $q$ based on the hazard probability. using a "receiveroperator characteristic" (roc) analysis, we find that this predicting methodefficiently forecasts the occurrance of large volatility events in real stockdata. our analysis may help us better understand reoccurring large volatilitiesand more accurately quantify financial risks in stock markets.

0807.4639	emergence of long memory in stock volatility from a modified mike-farmer  model	the mike-farmer (mf) model was constructed empirically based on thecontinuous double auction mechanism in an order-driven market, which cansuccessfully reproduce the cubic law of returns and the diffusive behavior ofstock prices at the transaction level. however, the volatility (defined byabsolute return) in the mf model does not show sound long memory. we propose amodified version of the mf model by including a new ingredient, that is, longmemory in the aggressiveness (quantified by the relative prices) of incomingorders, which is an important stylized fact identified by analyzing the orderflows of 23 liquid chinese stocks. long memory emerges in the volatilitysynthesized from the modified mf model with the dfa scaling exponent close to0.76, and the cubic law of returns and the diffusive behavior of prices arealso produced at the same time. we also find that the long memory of ordersigns has no impact on the long memory property of volatility, and the memoryeffect of order aggressiveness has little impact on the diffusiveness of stockprices.

cond-mat;0110436	evidence of intermittent cascades from discrete hierarchical dissipation  in turbulence	we present the results of a search of log-periodic corrections to scaling inthe moments of the energy dissipation rate in experiments at high reynoldsnumber (2500) of three-dimensional fully developed turbulence. a simpledynamical representation of the richardson-kolmogorov cartoon of a cascadeshows that standard averaging techniques erase by their very construction thepossible existence of log-periodic corrections to scaling associated with adiscrete hierarchy. to remedy this drawback, we introduce a novel ``canonical''averaging that we test extensively on synthetic examples constructed to mimickthe interplay between a weak log-periodic component and rather strongmultiplicative and phase noises. our extensive tests confirm the remarkableobservation of statistically significant log-periodic corrections to scaling,with a prefered scaling ratio for length scales compatible with the value gamma= 2. a strong confirmation of this result is provided by the identification ofup to 5 harmonics of the fundamental log-periodic undulations, associated withup to 5 levels of the underlying hierarchical dynamical structure. a naturalinterpretation of our results is that the richardson-kolmogorov mental pictureof a cascade becomes a realistic description if one allows for intermittentbirths and deaths of discrete cascades at varying scales.

cond-mat;0110445	statistical significance of periodicity and log-periodicity with  heavy-tailed correlated noise	we estimate the probability that random noise, of several plausible standarddistributions, creates a false alarm that a periodicity (or log-periodicity) isfound in a time series. we investigate general situations with non-gaussiancorrelated noises and present synthetic tests on the detectability andstatistical significance of periodic components. increasing heavy-tailness(respectively correlations describing persistence) tends to decrease(respectively increase) the false-alarm probability of finding a large spuriouslomb peak. increasing anti-persistence tends to decrease the false-alarmprobability. we also study the interplay between heavy-tailness and long-rangecorrelations. in order to fully determine if a lomb peak signals a genuinerather than a spurious periodicity, one should in principle characterize thelomb peak height, its width and its relations to other peaks in the completespectrum. as a step towards this full characterization, we construct thejoint-distribution of the frequency position (relative to other peaks) and ofthe height of the highest peak of the power spectrum. we also provide thedistributions of the ratio of the second highest lomb peak to the maximum peak.using the insight obtained by the present statistical study, we re-examinepreviously reported claims of ``log-periodicity'' and find that the credibilityfor log-periodicity in 2d-freely decaying turbulence is weakened while it isstrengthened for fracture, for the ion-signature prior to the kobe earthquakeand for financial markets.

cond-mat;0410225	inverse statistics in stock markets: universality and idiosyncracy	investigations of inverse statistics (a concept borrowed from turbulence) instock markets, exemplified with filtered dow jones industrial average, s&amp;p 500,and nasdaq, have uncovered a novel stylized fact that the distribution of exittime follows a power law $p(\tau_\rho) \sim \tau\rho^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\approx 1.5$ at large $\tau_\rho$ and the optimal investment horizon$\tau_\rho^*$ scales as $\rho^\gamma$ [1-3]. we have performed an extensiveanalysis based on unfiltered daily indices and stock prices and high-frequency(5-min) records as well in the markets all over the world. our analysisconfirms that the power-law distribution of the exit time with an exponent ofabout $\alpha=1.5$ is universal for all the data sets analyzed. in addition,all data sets show that the power-law scaling in the optimal investment horizonholds, but with idiosyncratic exponent. specifically, $\gamma \approx 1.5$ forthe daily data in most of the developed stock markets and the five-minutehigh-frequency data, while the $\gamma$ values of the daily indexes and stockprices in emerging markets are significantly less than 1.5. we show that thereis of little chance that this discrepancy in $\gamma$ stems from the differenceof record sizes in the two kinds of stock markets.

cond-mat;0503607	importance of positive feedbacks and over-confidence in a  self-fulfilling ising model of financial markets	following a long tradition of physicists who have noticed that the isingmodel provides a general background to build realistic models of socialinteractions, we study a model of financial price dynamics resulting from thecollective aggregate decisions of agents. this model incorporates imitation,the impact of external news and private information. it has the structure of adynamical ising model in which agents have two opinions (buy or sell) withcoupling coefficients which evolve in time with a memory of how past news haveexplained realized market returns. we study two versions of the model, whichdiffer on how the agents interpret the predictive power of news. we show thatthe stylized facts of financial markets are reproduced only when agents areover-confident and mis-attribute the success of news to predict return toherding effects, thereby providing positive feedbacks leading to the modelfunctioning close to the critical point. our model exhibits a rich multifractalstructure characterized by a continuous spectrum of exponents of the power lawrelaxation of endogenous bursts of volatility, in good agreement with previousanalytical predictions obtained with the multifractal random walk model andwith empirical facts.

cond-mat;0605676	exploring self-similarity of complex cellular networks: the  edge-covering method with simulated annealing and log-periodic sampling	song, havlin and makse (2005) have recently used a version of thebox-counting method, called the node-covering method, to quantify theself-similar properties of 43 cellular networks: the minimal number $n_v$ ofboxes of size $\ell$ needed to cover all the nodes of a cellular network wasfound to scale as the power law $n_v \sim (\ell+1)^{-d_v}$ with a fractaldimension $d_v=3.53\pm0.26$. we propose a new box-counting method based onedge-covering, which outperforms the node-covering approach when applied tostrictly self-similar model networks, such as the sierpinski network. theminimal number $n_e$ of boxes of size $\ell$ in the edge-covering method isobtained with the simulated annealing algorithm. we take into account thepossible discrete scale symmetry of networks (artifactual and/or real), whichis visualized in terms of log-periodic oscillations in the dependence of thelogarithm of $n_e$ as a function of the logarithm of $\ell$. in this way, weare able to remove the bias of the estimator of the fractal dimension, existingfor finite networks. with this new methodology, we find that $n_e$ scales withrespect to $\ell$ as a power law $n_e \sim \ell^{-d_e}$ with $d_e=2.67\pm0.15$for the 43 cellular networks previously analyzed by song, havlin and makse(2005). bootstrap tests suggest that the analyzed cellular networks may have asignificant log-periodicity qualifying a discrete hierarchy with a scalingratio close to 2. in sum, we propose that our method of edge-covering withsimulated annealing and log-periodic sampling minimizes the significant bias inthe determination of fractal dimensions in log-log regressions.
