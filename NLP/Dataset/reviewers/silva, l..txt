0901.1207	modeling the effects of dust evolution on the seds of galaxies of  different morphological type	we present photometric evolution models of galaxies, in which, in addition tothe stellar component, the effects of an evolving dusty interstellar mediumhave been included with particular care. starting from the work of calura,pipino &amp; matteucci (2008), in which chemical evolution models have been used tostudy the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellarmedium in the solar neighbourhood, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it hasbeen possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar codethat includes dust reprocessing (grasil) (silva et al. 1998) to analyse theevolution of the spectral energy distributions (sed) of these galaxies. we testour models against observed seds both in the local universe and at highredshift and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlightevolves for each type of galaxy. the importance of following the dust evolutionis investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simpleassumptions to treat this component.

0902.1202	the energetic environment and the dense interstellar medium in ulirgs	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of a sampleof 30 luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with models that includeboth starburst and agn components. the aim of the work was to determineimportant physical parameters for this kind of objects such as the opticaldepth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, the starformation efficiency and the agn fraction. we found that although about half ofour sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30 % havean agn which accounts for more than 10 % of the infrared luminosity whereas allhave an energetically dominant starburst. our models also determine the mass ofdense molecular gas. assuming that this mass is that traced by the hcnmolecule, we reproduce the observed linear relation between hcn luminosity andinfrared luminosity found by gao and solomon (2004). however, our derivedconversion factor between hcn luminosity and the mass of dense molecular gas isa factor of 2 smaller than that assumed by these authors. finally, we find thatthe star formation efficiency falls as the starburst ages.

0906.3522	modelling the dusty universe i: introducing the artificial neural  network and first applications to luminosity and colour distributions	we introduce a new technique based on artificial neural networks which allowsus to make accurate predictions for the spectral energy distributions (seds) oflarge samples of galaxies, at wavelengths ranging from the far-ultra-violet tothe sub-millimetre and radio. the neural net is trained to reproduce the sedspredicted by a hybrid code comprised of the galform semi-analytical model ofgalaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy mergerhistories, and the grasil spectro-photometric code, which carries out aself-consistent calculation of the sed, including absorption and emission ofradiation by dust. using a small number of galaxy properties predicted bygalform, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority ofcases to within 10% of those computed directly using grasil. the methodperforms best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and thefar-ultra-violet. the luminosity error introduced by the method has negligibleimpact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions orcolour distributions of galaxies. we use the neural net to predict the overlapbetween galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv and in the observer-frame sub-mmat z=2. we find that around half of the galaxies with a 850um flux above 5 mjyshould have optical magnitudes brighter than r_ab &lt; 25 mag. however, only 1% ofthe galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv down to r_ab &lt; 25 mag should have850um fluxes brighter than 5 mjy. our technique will allow the generation ofwide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame uv or mid- andfar-infrared wavelengths.

0909.1567	predictions for herschel from lambdacdm: unveiling the cosmic star  formation history	we use a model for the evolution of galaxies in the far-ir based on thelambdacdm cosmology to make detailed predictions for upcoming cosmologicalsurveys with the herschel space observatory. we use the combined galformsemi-analytical galaxy formation model and grasil spectrophotometric code tocompute galaxy seds including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model,which is the same as that in baugh et al. (2005), assumes two different imfs: anormal solar neighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and avery top-heavy imf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shownpreviously that the top-heavy imf appears necessary to explain the numbercounts and redshifts of faint sub-mm galaxies. in this paper, we presentpredictions for galaxy luminosity functions, number counts and redshiftdistributions in the herschel imaging bands. we find that source confusion willbe a serious problem in the deepest planned surveys. we also show predictionsfor physical properties such as star formation rates and stellar, gas and halomasses, together with fluxes at other wavelengths (from the far-uv to theradio) relevant for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. we investigatewhat fraction of the total ir emission from dust and of the high-mass starformation over the history of the universe should be resolved by plannedsurveys with herschel, and find a fraction ~30-50%, depending on confusion.finally, we show that galaxies in herschel surveys should be significantlyclustered.

0704.1562	galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy  formation model with spitzer data	we present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,number counts and redshift distributions in the ir based on the lambda-cdmcosmological model. we use the combined galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model and grasil spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy sedsincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model, which is the sameas that in baugh et al (2005), assumes two different imfs: a normal solarneighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavyimf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shown previously thatthe top-heavy imf seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faintsub-mm galaxies. we compare the model with observational data from the spitzerspace telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen beforespitzer data became available. we find that the model matches the observedevolution in the ir remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probedby spitzer. in particular, the spitzer data show that there is strong evolutionin the mid-ir galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, andthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.on the other hand, a model with a normal imf in starbursts predicts far toolittle evolution in the mid-ir luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

0708.0149	modeling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs i: the radio spectra	as a constraint for new starburst/agn models of iras bright galaxies wedetermine the radio spectra of 31 luminous and ultraluminous iras galaxies(lirgs/ulirgs). we construct the radio spectra using both new and archivaldata. from our sample of radio spectra we find that very few have a straightpower-law slope. although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectralslope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radiospectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 ghz. this is unexpected because in sources with highrates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make asignificant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. despitethis trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 ghz are flatter forsources with higher values of the fir-radio flux density ratio q, when this iscalculated at 8.4 ghz. therefore, sources that are deficient in radio emissionrelative to fir emission (presumably younger sources) have a larger thermalcomponent to their radio emission. however, we find no correlation between theradio spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz and q at 8.4 ghz. because the lowfrequency spectral index is affected by free-free absorption, and this is afunction of source size for a given mass of ionized gas, this is evidence thatthe ionized gas in ulirgs shows a range of densities. the youngest lirgs andulirgs are characterized by a larger contribution to their high-frequency radiospectra from free-free emission. however, the youngest sources are not thosethat have the greatest free-free absorption at low radio frequencies. thesources in which the effects of free-free absorption are strongest are insteadthe most compact sources. although these have the warmest fir colours, they arenot necessarily the youngest sources.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1006.4637	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies: introducing the  artificial neural network	the spectral energy distribution of galaxies is a complex function of thestar formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas ingalaxies. the computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiationthrough the dust distribution is time-consuming. this aspect becomesunacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then comparedwith multi-wavelength surveys. mainly for this aim, we have implemented anartificial neural network algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiativetransfer code grasil in order to compute the spectral energy distribution ofgalaxies in a short computing time. this allows to avoid the adoption ofempirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies outputby models. the ann has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum(the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-formingmolecular clouds and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties anddependencies). we have defined the input neurons effectively determining theiremission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and isnot linked to a particular galaxy formation model. we have trained the net forthe disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce thesed of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model forspheroidal galaxies. we have checked that for this model both the seds and thegalaxy counts in the herschel bands obtained with the ann approximation arealmost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full grasil. weconclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present theapplication to a more complex sam in another paper.

1008.0009	unusual pah emission in nearby early-type galaxies: a signature of an  intermediate age stellar population?	we present the analysis of spitzer-irs spectra of four early-type galaxies,ngc 1297, ngc 5044, ngc 6868, and ngc 7079, all classified as liners in theoptical bands. their irs spectra present the full series of h2 rotationalemission lines in the range 5--38 microns, atomic lines, and prominent pahfeatures. we investigate the nature and origin of the pah emission,characterized by unusually low 6 -- 9/11.3 microns inter-band ratios. after thesubtraction of a passive early type galaxy template, we find that the 7 -- 9microns spectral region requires dust features not normally present in starforming galaxies. each spectrum is then analyzed with the aim of identifyingtheir components and origin. in contrast to normal star forming galaxies, wherecationic pah emission prevails, our 6--14 microns spectra seem to be dominatedby large and neutral pah emission, responsible for the low 6 -- 9/11.3 micronsratios, plus two broad dust emission features peaking at 8.2 microns and 12microns. theses broad components, observed until now mainly in evolved carbonstars and usually attributed to pristine material, contribute approximately30-50% of the total pah flux in the 6--14 microns region. we propose that thepah molecules in our etgs arise from fresh carbonaceous material which iscontinuously released by a population of carbon stars, formed in a rejuvenationepisode which occurred within the last few gyr. the analysis of the mir spectraallows us to infer that, in order to maintain the peculiar size and chargedistributions biased to large and neutral pahs, this material must be shocked,and excited by the weak uv interstellar radiation field of our etg.

1008.3875	the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies with stellar and qso dust  production	the presence of dust strongly affects the way we see galaxies and also thechemical abundances we measure in gas. it is therefore important to study hechemical evolution of galaxies by taking into account dust evolution. we aim atperforming a detailed study of abundance ratios of high redshift objects andtheir dust properties. we focus on lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) and quasar (qso)hosts and likely progenitors of low- and high-mass present-day ellipticalgalaxies, respectively. we have adopted a chemical evolution model forelliptical galaxies taking account the dust production from low andintermediate mass stars, supernovae ia, supernovae ii, qsos and both dustdestruction and accretion processes. by means of such a model we have followedthe chemical evolution of ellipticals of different baryonic masses. our modelcomplies with chemical downsizing. we made predictions for the abundance ratiosversus metallicity trends for models of differing masses that can be used toconstrain the star formation rate, initial mass function and dust mass inobserved galaxies. we predict the existence of a high redshift dustmass-stellar mass relationship. we have found a good agreement with theproperties of lbgs if we assume that they formed at redshift z=2-4. inparticular, a non-negligible amount of dust is needed to explain the observedabundance pattern. we studied the qso sdss j114816, one of the most distant qsoever observed (z=6.4), and we have been able to reproduce the amount of dustmeasured in this object. the dust is clearly due to the production fromsupernovae and the most massive agb stars as well as from the grain growth inthe interstellar medium. the qso dust is likely to dominate only in the verycentral regions of the galaxies and during the early development of thegalactic wind.

1201.1751	cosmic star formation rate: a theoretical approach	the cosmic star formation rate (csfr), is an important clue to investigatethe history of the assembly and evolution of galaxies. here, we develop amethod to study the csfr from a purely theoretical point of view. starting fromdetailed models of chemical evolution, we obtain the histories of starformation of galaxies of different morphological types. these histories arethen used to determine the luminosity functions of the same galaxies by meansof a spectro-photometric code. we obtain the csfr under different hypothesis.first, we study the hypothesis of a pure luminosity evolution scenario, inwhich all galaxies are supposed to form at the same redshift and then evolveonly in luminosity. then we consider scenarios in which the number density orthe slope of the lfs are assumed to vary with redshift. after comparison withavailable data we conclude that a pure luminosity evolution does not provide agood fit to the data, especially at very high redshift, although manyuncertainties are still present in the data. on the other hand, a variation inthe number density of ellipticals and spirals as a function of redshift canprovide a better fit to the observed csfr. we also explore cases of variableslope of the lfs with redshift and variations of number density and slope atthe same time. we cannot find any of those cases which can improve the fit tothe data respect to the solely number density variation. finally, we computethe evolution of the average cosmic metallicity in galaxies with redshift.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1412.3458	combining physical galaxy models with radio observations to constrain  the sfrs of high-z dusty star forming galaxies	we complement our previous analysis of a sample of z~1-2 luminous andultra-luminous infrared galaxies ((u)lirgs), by adding deep vla radioobservations at 1.4 ghz to a large data-set from the far-uv to the sub-mm,including spitzer and herschel data. given the relatively small number of(u)lirgs in our sample with high s/n radio data, and to extend our study to adifferent family of galaxies, we also include 6 well sampled near ir-selectedbzk galaxies at z~1.5. from our analysis based on the radiative transferspectral synthesis code grasil, we find that, while the ir luminosity may be abiased tracer of the star formation rate (sfr) depending on the age of starsdominating the dust heating, the inclusion of the radio flux offerssignificantly tighter constraints on sfr. our predicted sfrs are in goodagreement with the estimates based on rest-frame radio luminosity and the bell(2003) calibration. the extensive spectro-photometric coverage of our sampleallows us to set important constraints on the sf history of individual objects.for essentially all galaxies we find evidence for a rather continuous sfr and apeak epoch of sf preceding that of the observation by a few gyrs. this seems tocorrespond to a formation redshift of z~5-6. we finally show that our physicalanalysis may affect the interpretation of the sfr-m* diagram, by possiblyshifting, with respect to previous works, the position of the most dustobscured objects to higher m* and lower sfrs.

1504.07474	modeling the surface temperature of earth-like planets	we introduce a novel earth-like planet surface temperature model (estm) forhabitability studies based on the spatial-temporal distribution of planetarysurface temperatures. the estm adopts a surface energy balance modelcomplemented by: radiative-convective atmospheric column calculations, a set ofphysically-based parameterizations of meridional transport, and descriptions ofsurface and cloud properties more refined than in standard ebms. theparameterization is valid for rotating terrestrial planets with shallowatmospheres and moderate values of axis obliquity (epsilon &gt;= 45^o). comparisonwith a 3d model of atmospheric dynamics from the literature shows that theequator-to-pole temperature differences predicted by the two models agreewithin ~5k when the rotation rate, insolation, surface pressure and planetradius are varied in the intervals 0.5 &lt;= omega/omega_o &lt;= 2, 0.75 &lt;= s/s_o &lt;=1.25, 0.3 &lt;= p/(1 bar) &lt;= 10, and 0.5 &lt;= r/r_o &lt;= 2, respectively. the estm hasan extremely low computational cost and can be used when the planetaryparameters are scarcely known (as for most exoplanets) and/or whenever manyruns for different parameter configurations are needed. model simulations of atest-case exoplanet (kepler-62e) indicate that an uncertainty in surfacepressure within the range expected for terrestrial planets may impact the meantemperature by ~60 k. within the limits of validity of the estm, the impact ofsurface pressure is larger than that predicted by uncertainties in rotationrate, axis obliquity, and ocean fractions. we discuss the possibility ofperforming a statistical ranking of planetary habitability taking advantage ofthe flexibility of the estm.

0806.2410	amaze. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3	we present initial results of an eso-vlt large programme (amaze) aimed atdetermining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 by means ofdeep near-ir spectroscopy. gas metallicities are measured, for an initialsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebularlines redshifted into the near-ir. stellar masses are accurately determined byusing spitzer-irac data, which sample the rest-frame near-ir stellar light inthese distant galaxies. when compared with previous surveys, themass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much strongerthan observed at lower redshifts. the evolution is prominent even in massivegalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of starformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. there are alsoindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is strongerrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemicalversion of the galaxy downsizing. the mass-metallicity relation observed atz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchicalevolutionary models. such discrepancies suggest that at z&gt;3 galaxies areassembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies withlow star formation efficiency. the bulk of the star formation and metallicityevolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into biggersystems.

1512.05053	leading-order determination of the gluon polarisation using a novel  method	a re-evaluation of the gluon polarisation $\delta g/g$ in the nucleon ispresented, which is based on the measurement of the longitudinal double-spinasymmetry using semi-inclusive events with photon virtuality $q^2&gt;1~({\rmgev}/c)^2$. the data were obtained by the compass experiment at cern using a160 gev/$c$ polarised muon beam scattering off a polarised $^6$lid target. thegluon polarisation is evaluated for three intervals of the nucleon momentumfraction carried by gluons, $x_{\rm g}$, covering the range $0.04 \!&lt;\! x_{ \rmg}\! &lt;\! 0.28$ . a novel method covering the full range in hadron transversemomentum $p_{\rm t}$ and a neural network approach are used. the valuesobtained at leading order in pqcd do not show any significant dependence on$x_{\rm g}$. averaged over the three intervals, the result is $\langle \deltag/g \rangle = 0.113 \pm 0.038_{\rm (stat.)}\pm 0.036_{\rm (syst.)}$ at $\langlex_{\rm g} \rangle \approx 0.10$ and a hard scale of $\mu^2= \langle q^2 \rangle= 3 ({\rm gev}/c)^2$. the obtained result suggests that the gluon polarisationis positive in the measured $x_{\rm g}$ range.

0807.3335	extremely massive young clusters in ngc1365	in a previous work, three bright mir/radio sources were discovered in thenuclear region of ngc1365. we here confirm that these sources are young andmassive ``embedded'' clusters, and derive their parameters, such as extinction,age and mass. using isaac and visir at the vlt we obtained nir and mir maps andlr spectra. the dataset is first interpreted by comparing the observations withimages and spectra of the close-by young cluster r136 in the lmc and then byusing model predictions for both the nebular emission lines and the spectralenergy distribution of the sources. we produce maps of the region containingthe three sources in the r, j, ks, l' bands and at 12.8micro. we also providespectra in k, l and n. the spectral energy distribution of the three sourcesrises with wavelength. emission lines from ionised hydrogen and molecularhydrogen are detected, as well as pah emission. conspicuous [neii]12.8 line isalso present, while neither the [ariii] 8.9 nor the [siv] 10.4 lines aredetected. this provides a stringent constraint on the age of the sources: theyare relatively evolved young clusters (6-8 myr). owing to their ionising photonrates and ages, they must be extremely massive clusters (around 10^7 solarmasses). their mir spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of twocomponents: (1) an optically thin component, with a continuum comparable tothat of r136, and (2) an optically thick component which might be related tosubsequent or on-going episodes of star formation. these sources are goodcandidates for evolving according to a bi-modal hydrodynamical regime, in whichmatter is trapped at the centre of a compact and massive cluster.

astro-ph;0001308	the infrared side of galaxy formation. i. the local universe in the  semi-analytical framework	we present a new evolutionary model for the far-uv to sub-mm properties ofthe galaxy population. this combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelbased on hierarchical clustering (galform) with a spectro-photometric codewhich includes dust reprocessing (grasil). the former provides the starformation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass andvarious geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formedin different density environments. these quantities allow us to model the sedsof galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction andre-emission. two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. themodel includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starburststriggered by galaxy mergers. we test our models against the observedspectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local universe. the modelsreproduce fairly well the seds of normal spirals and starbursts, and theirinternal extinction properties. the starbursts follow the observed relationshipbetween the fir to uv luminosity ratio and the slope of the uv continuum. theyalso reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (calzetti et al 99). thisresult is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the milkyway extinction law. it suggests that the observed attenuation law is related tothe geometry of the stars and dust. we compute galaxy luminosity functions overour wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement withobservational data. the uv continuum turns out to be a poor star formationindicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

astro-ph;0008216	modelling the extinction properties of galaxies	recently (granato, lacey, silva et al. 2000, astro-ph/0001308) we havecombined our spectrophotometric galaxy evolution code which includes dustreprocessing (grasil, silva et al. 1998) with semi-analytical galaxy formationmodels (galform, cole et al. 1999). one of the most characteristic features ofthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloudcomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellarmedium. as a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have differentgeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential inunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular thoseundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. indeed, our mergedgrasil+galform model reproduces fairly well the seds of normal spirals andstarbursts from the far-uv to the sub-mm and their internal extinctionproperties. in particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law(calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,and has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.

astro-ph;0010131	spiral and irregular galaxies in the hubble deep field north -  comparison with early types and implications for the global sfr density	we analyze a morphologically-selected complete sample of 52 late-type (spiraland irregular) galaxies in the hubble deep field north with total k-magnitudesbrighter than k=20.47. this sample exploits in particular the ultimate imagingquality achieved by hst in this field, allowing us to clearly disentangle thegalaxy morphologies, based on accurate profiles of the surface brightnessdistributions. our purpose was to investigate systematic differences betweenthe two classes, as for colours, redshift distributions and ages of thedominant stellar populations. this sample appears to miss significantlygalaxies above z=1.4 (in a similar way as an early-type galaxy samplepreviously studied by us), a fact which may be explained as a global decline ofthe underlying mass function for galaxies at these high redshifts. differencesbetween early and late-types are apparent -particularly in the colourdistributions and the evolutionary star-formation (sf) rates per unit volume-,although the complication in spectro-photometric modelling introduced bydust-extinction in the gas-rich systems prevents us to reach conclusive resultson the single sources. however, we find that an integrated quantity like thecomoving star-formation rate density (sfr(t)) as a function of redshift is muchless affected by these uncertainties: by combining this with the previouslystudied early-type galaxy sample, we find a shallower dependence of sfr(t) on zbetween z=0.2 and z=1.5 than found by lilly et al.

(2002, paper i): eight of them were identifiedas stars, one is definitely an agn, a second seems likely to be an agn, too,while the remaining 22 appear to be normal spiral or starburst galaxies. usingmodel spectral energy distributions (seds) of similar galaxies, we comparemethods for estimating the star formation rates (sfrs) in these objects,finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) ir luminosityreproduces the model sfrs best. applying this estimator to model fits to theseds of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are formingstars at rates of ~1-100 m_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40m_sol/yr, assumingan einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of 50 km/s/mpc, andstar formation taking place according to a salpeter (1955) imf across the massrange 0.1-100m_sol. we split the redshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.6 into two equal-volumebins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed bythese sources, assuming the same cosmology and imf as above and computingerrors based on estimated uncertainties in the sfrs of individual galaxies. wecompare these results with other estimates of the sfr density made with thesame assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of flores etal. (1999) from their iso survey of the cfrs 1415+52 field. however, therelatively small volume of our survey means that our sfr density estimatessuffer from a large sampling variance, implying that our results, bythemselves, do not place tight constraints on the global mean sfr density.

0808.2899	the mid-infrared colour-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies in the  coma cluster as measured by spitzer-irs	we use 16 micron, spitzer-irs, blue peakup photometry of 50 early-typegalaxies in the coma cluster to define the mid-infrared colour-magnituderelation. we compare with recent simple stellar population models that includethe mid-infrared emission from the extended, dusty envelopes of evolved stars.the ks-[16] colour in these models is very sensitive to the relative populationof dusty asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. we find that the passivelyevolving early-type galaxies define a sequence of approximately constant age(~10 gyr) with varying metallicity. several galaxies that lie on theoptical/near-infrared colour-magnitude relation do not lie on the mid-infraredrelation. this illustrates the sensitivity of the ks-[16] colour to age. thefact that a colour-magnitude relation is seen in the mid-infrared underlinesthe extremely passive nature of the majority (68%) of early-type galaxies inthe coma cluster. the corollary of this is that 32% of the early-type galaxiesin our sample are not `passive', insofar as they are either significantlyyounger than 10 gyr or they have had some rejuvenation episode within the lastfew gyr.

astro-ph;0307096	dust and nebular emission. i. models for normal galaxies	we present a model for nebular emission in star forming galaxies, which takesinto account the effects of dust reprocessing. the nebular emissions have beencomputed with cloudy and then included into grasil, our spectrophotometric codespecifically developed for dusty galaxies. the interface between nebularemission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed hii regionemission models covering a wide range of physical quantities. concerning theextinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpretthe observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at halpha andin the uv band as a consequence of age selective extinction. we also find that,for these galaxies with modest sfr, the ratio fir/uv provides the bestconstraints on the uv attenuation. our model also allows to deal with differentsfr estimators in a consistent way, from the uv to radio wavelengths, and todiscuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditionsencountered in star forming galaxies. we provide our best estimates ofsfr/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation.it results that sfr derived through halpha, even when corrected for extinctionusing the balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to ageselective extinction. another remarkable result is that sfr from uv luminositycorrected by means of the ratio fir/uv has a small uncertainty. finally, ourmodel provides a calibration of sfr from radio luminosity; we are also able toreproduce the observed fir/radio ratio.

(2000). this normalizationyields, for the first model, r_0=8.3$ mpc/h, and, for the second model, aneffective mass of dark matter haloes in which these sources reside ofm_halo=1.8*10^{13} m_sun/h. these results are consistent with independentestimates for scuba galaxies and for other, likely related, sources.

astro-ph;0403581	modelling the spectral energy distribution of compact luminous infrared  galaxies: constraints from high frequency radio data	we have performed 23 ghz vla observations of 7 compact, luminous infraredgalaxies, selected to have evidence of starburst activity. new and publishedmulti-frequency data are combined to obtain the spectral energy distributionsof all 7 galaxies from the near-infrared to the radio (at 1.4 ghz). these sedsare compared with new models, for dust enshrouded galaxies, which account forboth starburst and agn components. in all 7 galaxies the starburst provides thedominant contribution to the infrared luminosity; in 4 sources no contributionfrom an agn is required. although agn may contribute up to 50 percent of thetotal far--infrared emission, the starbursts always dominate in the radio. theseds of most of our sources are best fit with a very high optical depth of(&gt;=50) at 1 micron. the scatter in the far-infrared/radio correlation, foundamong luminous iras sources, is due mainly to the different evolutionary statusof their starburst components. the short time-scale of the star formationprocess amplifies the delay between the far-infrared and radio emission. thisbecomes more evident at low radio frequencies (below about 1 ghz) wheresynchrotron radiation is the dominant process. in the far-infrared (atwavelengths shorter than 100 micron) an additional source of scatter isprovided by agn, where present. agn may be detected in the near-infrared by theabsence of the knee, typical of stellar photospheres. however, near-infrareddata alone cannot constrain the level at which agn contribute because theinterpretation of their observed properties, in this wave-band, dependsstrongly on model parameters.

astro-ph;0610316	the star formation history of the virgo early-type galaxy ngc4435: the  spitzer mid infrared view	we present a population synthesis study of ngc4435, an early-type virgogalaxy interacting with ngc4438. we combine new spectroscopic observationsobtained with the spitzer space telescope irs instrument with irac archivaldata and broad band data from the literature. the irs spectrum shows prominentpah features, low ionization emission lines and h_2 rotational lines arisingfrom the dusty circumnuclear disk characterizing this galaxy. the central sed,from x-ray to radio, is well fitted by a model of an exponential burstsuperimposed on an old simple stellar population. from the lack of highexcitation nebular lines, the [neiii]15.5/[neii]12.8 ratio, the temperature ofmolecular hydrogen, and the fit to the full x-ray to radio sed we argue thatthe present activity of the galaxy is driven by star formation alone. the agncontribution to the ionizing flux is constrained to be less than 2%. the age ofthe burst is found to be around 190 myr and it is fully consistent with thenotion that the star formation process has been triggered by the interactionwith ngc4438. the mass involved in the rejuvenation episode turns out to beless than 1.5% of the stellar galaxy mass sampled in a 5" central aperture.this is enough to render ngc4435 closely similar to a typical interactingearly-type galaxy with inverted caii[h+k] lines that will later turn into atypical cluster e+a galaxy and enforces the notion that these objects are theresult of a recent rejuvenation episode rather than a genuine delayedformation.

astro-ph;0611409	a highly obscured and strongly clustered galaxy population discovered  with the spitzer space telescope	the ~800 optically unseen (r&gt;25.5) 24mum-selected sources in the completespitzer first look survey sample (fadda et al. 2006) with f[24mum]&gt;0.35 mjy arefound to be very strongly clustered. if, as indicated by several lines ofcircumstantial evidence, they are ultraluminous far-ir galaxies at z ~[1.6-2.7], the amplitude of their spatial correlation function is very high.the associated comoving clustering length is estimated to ber_0=14.0_{-2.4}^{+2.1} mpc, value which puts these sources amongst the moststrongly clustered populations of our known universe. their 8mum-24mum colourssuggest that the agn contribution dominates above f[24mum] ~ 0.8 mjy,consistent with earlier analyses. the properties of these objects (numbercounts, redshift distribution, clustering amplitude) are fully consistent withthose of proto-spheroidal galaxies in the process of forming most of theirstars and of growing their active nucleus, as described by the granato et al.(2004) model. in particular, the inferred space density of such galaxies at z ~2 is much higher than what expected from most semi-analytic models. matches ofthe observed projected correlation function w(\theta) with models derivedwithin the so-called halo occupation scenario show that these sources have tobe hosted by haloes more massive than ~10^{13.4} m_\odot. this value issignificantly higher than that for the typical galactic haloes hosting massiveelliptical galaxies, suggesting a duration of the starburst phase of massivehigh-redshift dusty galaxies of t_b ~ 0.5 gyr.

astro-ph;0612087	uv dust attenuation in spiral galaxies: the role of age-dependent  extinction and of the imf	we analyse the attenuation properties of a sample of uv selected galaxies,with the use of the spectrophotometric model grasil. in particular, we focus onthe relation between dust attenuation and the reddening in the uv spectralregion. we show that a realistic modelling of geometrical distribution of dustand of the different population of stars can explain the uv reddening of normalspiral galaxies also with a standard milky way dust. our results clearlyunderline that it is fundamental to take into account that younger stars suffera higher attenuation than older stars (the age-dependent extinction) becausestars are born in more-than-average dusty environments. in this work we alsofind that the concentration of young stars on the galactic plane of spirals hasa relevant impact on the expected uv colours, impact that has not been exploredbefore this paper. finally, we discuss the role of imf in shaping the relationbetween uv reddening and dust attenuation, and we show that a kroupa imf ismore consistent with observed data than the classical salpeter imf.

astro-ph;0703210	astrophysical and cosmological information from large-scale sub-mm  surveys of extragalactic sources	we present a quantitative analysis of the astrophysical and cosmologicalinformation that can be extracted from the many important wide-area, shallowsurveys that will be carried out in the next few years. our calculationscombine the predictions of the physical model by granato et al. (2004) for theformation and evolution of spheroidal galaxies with up-to-date phenomenologicalmodels for the evolution of starburst and normal late-type galaxies and ofradio sources. we compute the expected number counts and the redshiftdistributions of these source populations separately and then focus onproto-spheroidal galaxies. for the latter objects we predict the counts andredshift distributions of strongly lensed sources at 250, 350, 500, and 850micron, the angular correlation function of sources detected in the surveysconsidered, the angular power spectra due to clustering of sources below thedetection limit in herschel and planck surveys. an optimal survey for selectingstrongly lensed proto-spheroidal galaxies is described, and it is shown howthey can be easily distinguished from the other source populations. we alsodiscuss the detectability of the imprints of the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes onangular correlation functions and clustering power spectra, as well as theconstraints on cosmological parameters that can be obtained from thedeterminations of these quantities. the novel data relevant to derive the firstsub-millimeter estimates of the local luminosity functions of starburst andlate-type galaxies, and the constraints on the properties of rare sourcepopulations, such as blazars, are also briefly described.

astro-ph;9707080	source counts and background radiation	our present understanding of the extragalactic source counts and backgroundradiation at infrared and sub-mm wavelengths is reviewed. available count dataare used to constrain evolutionary models of galaxies and active nuclei. thecirb, on the other hand, provides crucial information on the integrated past iremissivity, including sources so faint to be never accessible. the near-ir andsub-mm are suited to search for the cirb. these cosmological windows are idealto detect redshifted photons from the two most prominent broad emissionfeatures in galaxy spectra: the stellar photospheric 1 micron peak and the oneat 100 micron due to dust re-radiation. the recently claimed detection of anisotropic diffuse component at 100-200 microns would support the evidence forstrong cosmic evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 2$ of faint gas-rich late-typegalaxies, as inferred from direct long-$\lambda$ counts. furthermore, anequally intense cirb flux measured in the wavelength range 200 to 500 $\mu m$may be in support of models envisaging a dust-enshrouded phase during formationof spheroidal galaxies (e.g. franceschini et al., 1994): the backgroundspectrum at such long wavelengths would indicate an high redshift ($z&gt;2-3$) forthis active phase of star formation, implying a relevant constraint onstructure formation scenarios. we argue that, given the difficulties for skysurveys in this spectral domain, only sporadic tests of these ideas will beachieved in the next several years. only a mission like first, in combinationwith large mm arrays and optical telescopes, will allow to thoroughlyinvestigate, via photometric and spectroscopic surveys, these ir-bright earlyphases in the evolution of galaxies and agns.

astro-ph;9709084	modelling intermediate age and old stellar populations in the infrared	we have investigated the spectro-photometric properties of the asymptoticgiant branch (agb) stars and their contribution to the integrated infraredemission in simple stellar populations (ssp). adopting analytical relationsdescribing the evolution of these stars in the hr diagram and empiricalrelations for the mass-loss rate and the wind terminal velocity, we were ableto model the effects of the dusty envelope around these stars, with a minimalnumber of parameters. we computed isochrones at different age and initial metalcontent. we compare our models with existing infrared colors of m giants andmira stars and with iras psc data. contrary to previous models, in the newisochrones the mass-loss rate, which establishes the duration of the agb phase,also determines the spectral properties of the stars. the contribution of thesestars to the integrated light of the population is thus obtained in aconsistent way. we find that the emission in the mid infrared is about oneorder of magnitude larger when dust is taken into account in an intermediateage population, irrespective of the particular mixture adopted. the dependenceof the integrated colors on the metallicity and age is discussed, withparticular emphasis on the problem of age-metallicity degeneracy. we show that,contrary to the case of optical or near infrared colors, the adoption of asuitable pass-band in the mid infrared allows a fair separation of the twoeffects. we suggest intermediate redshift elliptical galaxies as possibletargets of this method of solving the age-metallicity dilemma. the new sspmodels constitute a first step in a more extended study aimed at modelling thespectral properties of the galaxies from the ultraviolet to the far infrared.

astro-ph;9806077	early-type galaxies in the hubble deep field: the star formation history	we have investigated the properties of a complete k-band selected sample of35 elliptical and s0 galaxies brighter than k=20.15 in the hubble deep field,as representative of the field galaxy population. this sample has been derivedfrom deep k-band image by the kpno-irim camera, by applying a rigorousmorphological classification scheme based on quantitative analyses of thesurface brightness profiles. the broad-band spectra of the sample galaxiesallow us to date their dominant stellar populations. the majority of brightearly-types in this field are found at redshifts z&lt;1.3 to display colorsindicative of a fairly wide range of ages (typically 1.5 to 3 gyrs). we findthat the major episodes of star-formation building up typical m_star galaxieshave taken place during a wide redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;4 for q_0=0.5, whichbecomes 1&lt;z&lt;3 for q_0=0.15. our estimated galactic masses, for a salpeter imf,are found in the range from a few billion to a few 10^{11} solar masses alreadyat z=1. so the bright end of the e/s0 population is mostly in place by thatcosmic epoch, with space densities, masses and luminosities consistent withthose of the local field e/s0 population. what distinguishes the present sampleis a remarkable absence of objects at z&gt;1.3, which should be detectable duringthe luminous star-formation phase expected to happen at these redshifts.obvious solutions are a) that the merging events imply perturbed morphologieswhich prevent selecting them by our morphological classification filter, or b)that a dust-polluted ism obscures the (either continuous or episodic) events ofstar-formation. we conclude that the likely solution is a combination thereof,i.e. a set of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts occurring during thefirst few gyrs of the galaxy's lifetime.

astro-ph;9903349	new photometric models of galactic evolution applied to the hdf	we summarize our modelling of galaxy photometric evolution (grasil code). byincluding the effects of dust grains and pahs molecules in a two phases clumpymedium, where clumps are associated to star forming regions, we reproduce theobserved uv to radio seds of galaxies with star formation rates from zero toseveral hundreds $m_\odot/yr$. grasil is a powerful tool to investigate thestar formation, the initial mass function and the supernovae rate in nearbystarbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the evolution ofluminosity functions of different types of galaxies at wavelengths covering sixdecades. it may be interfaced with any device providing the star formation andmetallicity histories of a galaxy. as an application, we have investigated theproperties of early-type galaxies in the hdf, tracking the contribution of thispopulation to the cosmic star-formation history, which has a broad peak betweenz=1.5 and 4. to explain the absence of objects at z $\gsim$ 1.3, we suggest asequence of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts in the first few gyrs ofgalaxies lifetime. we are at present working on a complementary sample of latetype objects selected in a similar way.

astro-ph;9911304	joint formation of qsos and spheroids: qsos as clocks of star formation  in spheroids	direct and indirect observational evidence leads to the conclusion that highredshift qsos did shine in the core of early type proto-galaxies during theirmain episode of star formation. exploting this fact, we derive the rate offormation of this kind of stellar systems at high redshift by using the qsoluminosity function. the elemental proportions in elliptical galaxies, thedescendents of the qso hosts, suggest that the star formation was more rapid inmore massive objects. we show that this is expected to occur in dark matterhaloes, when the processes of cooling and heating is considered. this is alsoconfirmed by comparing the observed sub-mm counts to those derived by couplingthe formation rate and the star formation rate of the spheroidal galaxies witha detailed model for their sed evolution. in this scenario scuba galaxies andlyman break galaxies are early type proto-galaxies forming the bulk of theirstars before the onset of qso activity.
