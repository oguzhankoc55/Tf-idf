0706.2009	satellite galaxies and fossil groups in the millennium simulation	we use a semianalytic galaxy catalogue constructed from the millenniumsimulation to study the satellites of isolated galaxies in the lcdm cosmogony.this sample (~80,000$ bright primaries, surrounded by ~178,000 satellites)allows the characterization, with minimal statistical uncertainty, of thedynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a lcdm universe. wefind that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter ratherwell: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an nfwprofile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. their spatialdistribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined ``anti-holmberg''effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angularmomentum of the host halo. the isolation criteria for our primaries picks notonly galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at thecentre of ''fossil'' groups. we find that the abundance and luminosity functionof these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few availableobservational constraints. we recover the expected l_{host} \sigma_{sat}^3relation for lcdm models for truly-isolated primaries. less strict primaryselection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation.our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies thatrely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass ofthe primary galaxies.

0903.4559	effects of dark matter substructures on gravitational lensing: results  from the aquarius simulations	we use high-resolution aquarius simulations of milky way-sized haloes in thelcdm cosmology to study the effects of dark matter substructures ongravitational lensing. each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a massresolution ~ 10^3-4 m_sun/h) within its virial radius. subhaloes with masseslarger than 10^5 m_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least twoorders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. we incorporate a baryoniccomponent modelled as a hernquist profile and account for the response of thedark matter via adiabatic contraction. we focus on the "anomalous" flux ratioproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due tosubstructures. we find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 m_sun/h playan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have beenunresolved in previous studies. there is large scatter in the predicted fluxratios between different haloes and between different projections of the samehalo. in some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios iscomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it isnot. the probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violationsof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. we therefore conclude that the amount ofsubstructure in the central regions of the aquarius haloes is insufficient toexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.these conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignorethe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability.

0910.3211	galactic stellar haloes in the cdm model	we present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidaldisruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. ourmodel is based on the aquarius project, a suite of high resolution n-bodysimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we tag subsets of particles inthese simulations with stellar populations predicted by the galformsemi-analytic model. our method self-consistently tracks the dynamicalevolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. the luminosityfunction and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree wellwith observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. we find thataccreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1&lt;z&lt;7 from less than 5significant progenitors. these progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites withstellar masses similar to the brightest milky way dwarf spheroidals. incontrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of thesemajor contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. both thenumber of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherentlystochastic. this results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, whichamplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halohosts. the masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloesare consistent with expectations from the milky way and m31. each halo has acomplex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shellsand other subcomponents. this structure is not adequately described by smoothmodels. we find one example of an accreted thick disk. contrasts in age andmetallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broadagreement with recent observations.

0704.1770	satellites of simulated galaxies: survival, merging, and their relation  to the dark and stellar halos	we study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite ofn-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a lcdm universe. we findlittle spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellitepopulation. the velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator ofthe virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/v_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. applied tothe milky way and m31 this gives v_{vir}^{mw}=109 +/- 22$ km/s andv_{vir}^{m31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than therotation speed of their disk components. the detailed kinematics of simulatedsatellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. by contrast, the stellarhalo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from thepopulation of surviving satellites. this is because the survival of a satellitedepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biasedtoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. ourresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differencesbetween stars in the galactic halo and in galactic satellites: the elusive``building blocks'' of the milky way stellar halo were on average more massive,and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs thathas survived self-bound until the present.

0704.1773	cosmic m\'enage \`a trois: the origin of satellite galaxies on extreme  orbits	we examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite ofn-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of $l_*$ galaxies in a lcdmuniverse. most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around,they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radiiare steadily eroded by dynamical friction. however, a number of outliers arealso present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are onunorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. thispopulation of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faintmember of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbitduring its first approach to the primary. since the concurrent accretion ofmultiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models ofgalaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may bethe origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around m31(such as andromeda xiv); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding local groupmembers, such as leo i; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals cetusand tucana in the outskirts of the local group. our results suggest that caremust be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites toplace constraints on the total mass of the local group.

1003.0758	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models	(abridged) aims:we develop a method for deriving distances from spectroscopicdata and obtaining full 6d phase-space coordinates for the rave survey's seconddata release. methods: we used stellar models combined with atmosphericproperties from rave (teff, logg and [fe/h]) and (j-ks) photometry fromarchival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. we are able to derive the full6d phase-space coordinates for a large sample of rave stars. this method istested with artificial data, hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes andobservations of the open cluster m67. results: when we applied our method to aset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative(statistical) distance errors of &lt; 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) haverelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively. ourvarious tests show that we can reliably estimate distances for main-sequencestars, but there is an indication of potential systematic problems with giantstars. for the main-sequence star sample (defined as those with log(g) &gt; 4),25% (1 744) have relative distance errors &lt; 31%, while 50% (3 488) and 75% (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36% and 42%, respectively. our fulldataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a functionof distance from the galactic plane. the known kinematic substructures in the uand v velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset,confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. weprovide independent measurements of the orientation of the uv velocityellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement withprevious work. conclusions: the distance catalogue for the rave second datarelease is available at http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave

1006.2517	double-lined spectroscopic binary stars in the radial velocity  experiment survey	we devise a new method for the detection of double-lined binary stars in asample of the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey spectra. the method isboth tested against extensive simulations based on synthetic spectra, andcompared to direct visual inspection of all rave spectra. it is based on theproperties and shape of the cross-correlation function, and is able to recover~80% of all binaries with an orbital period of order 1 day. systems withperiods up to 1 year are still within the detection reach. we have applied themethod to 25,850 spectra of the rave second data release and found 123double-lined binary candidates, only eight of which are already marked asbinaries in the simbad database. among the candidates, there are seven thatshow spectral features consistent with the rs cvn type (solar type with activechromosphere) and seven that might be of w uma type (over-contact binaries).one star, hd 101167, seems to be a triple system composed of three nearlyidentical g-type dwarfs. the tested classification method could also beapplicable to the data of the upcoming gaia mission.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1008.5114	assembly history and structure of galactic cold dark matter halos	we use the aquarius simulation series to study the imprint of assemblyhistory on the structure of galaxy-mass cold dark matter halos. our resultsconfirm earlier work regarding the influence of mergers on the mass densityprofile and the inside-out growth of halos. the inner regions that contain thevisible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affectedonly by major mergers. particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers arefound predominantly in the outskirts of halos. our analysis reveals trends thatrun counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. for example,major mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)contribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20per cent for our six aquarius halos. the bulk is contributed roughly equally byminor mergers and by "diffuse" material which is not resolved into individualobjects. this is consistent with modeling based on excursion-set theory whichsuggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a haloof any scale. interestingly, the simulations themselves suggest that asignificantly fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlierhalos by mergers prior to their joining the main system. the aquariussimulations resolve halos to much lower mass scales than are expected to retaingas or form stars. these results thus confirm that most of the baryons fromwhich visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than throughmergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affectgalaxy structure at later times.

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

0709.4219	is the sky falling? searching for stellar streams in the local milky way  disc in the coravel and rave surveys	we have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local milky waydisc in the coravel and rave surveys. the coravel survey consists of localdwarf stars (nordstrom et al. geneva-copenhagen survey) and local famaey et al.giant stars. we select rave stars with radial velocities that are sensitive tothe galactic vertical space velocity (galactic latitude b &lt; -45 deg). kuiperstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the galactic verticalvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net verticalflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with verticallycoherent kinematics. in contrast to the `field of streams' found in the outerhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by thecoravel dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), coravel giants (completewithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and rave (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoidof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. this issufficiently sensitive to allow our rave sample to rule out the passing of thetidal stream of the disrupting sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solarneighbourhood. this agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit anddissociates it from the helmi et al. halo stream. our constraints on theabsence of the sgr stream near the sun could prove a useful tool fordiscriminating between galactic potential models. the lack of a net verticalflow through the solar neighbourhood in the coravel giants and rave samplesargues against the virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the sun. there areno vertical streams in the coravel giants and rave samples with stellardensities &gt;1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore noevidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

1107.1256	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models iii: the  nature of the rave survey and milky way chemistry	we apply the method of burnett &amp; binney (2010) for the determination ofstellar distances and parameters to the internal catalogue of the radialvelocity experiment (steinmetz et al. 2006). subsamples of stars that eitherhave hipparcos parallaxes or belong to well-studied clusters, inspireconfidence in the formal errors. distances to dwarfs cooler than ~6000 k appearto be unbiased, but those to hotter dwarfs tend to be too small by ~10% of theformal errors. distances to giants tend to be too large by about the sameamount. the median distance error in the whole sample of 216,000 stars is 28%and the error distribution is similar for both giants and dwarfs. roughly halfthe stars in the rave survey are giants. the giant fraction is largest at lowlatitudes and in directions towards the galactic centre. near the plane themetallicity distribution is remarkably narrow and centred on [m/h]-0.04 dex;with increasing |z| it broadens out and its median moves to [m/h] ~ -0.5. meanage as a function of distance from the galactic centre and distance |z| fromthe galactic plane shows the anticipated increase in mean age with |z|.

1112.0315	the aquila comparison project: the effects of feedback and numerical  methods on simulations of galaxy formation	we compare the results of thirteen cosmological gasdynamical codes used tosimulate the formation of a galaxy in the lcdm structure formation paradigm.the various runs differ in their hydrodynamical treatment (sph, moving-mesh andamr) but share the same initial conditions and adopt their latest publishedmodel of cooling, star formation and feedback. despite the common halo assemblyhistory, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size,morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=0, due mainly to the differentimplementations of feedback. compared with observation, most codes tend toproduce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas-rich than typicalspirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. a stellar disk isdiscernible in most simulations, though its prominence varies widely from codeto code. there is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and theseverity of the disagreement with observation. models that are more effectiveat limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observedgalaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disk component. ourconclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. some differences canalso be traced to the numerical techniques: more gas seems able to cool andbecome available for star formation in grid-based codes than in sph. however,this effect is small compared to the variations induced by different feedbackprescriptions. we conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yetuniquely predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, evenwhen the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. developingfeedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy withouthindering the formation of high-angular momentum stellar disks remains achallenge.

1201.1940	the phoenix project: the dark side of rich galaxy clusters	[abridged] we introduce the phoenix project, a set of $\lambda$cdmsimulations of the dark matter component of nine rich galaxy clusters. eachcluster is simulated at least at two different numerical resolutions. for eightof them, the highest resolution corresponds to $\sim 130$ million particleswithin the virial radius, while for one this number is over one billion. westudy the structure and substructure of these systems and contrast them withsix galaxy-sized dark matter haloes from the aquarius project, simulated atcomparable resolution. this comparison highlights the approximate massinvariance of cdm halo structure and substructure. we find little difference inthe spherically-averaged mass, pseudo-phase-space density, and velocityanisotropy profiles of aquarius and phoenix haloes. when scaled to the virialproperties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloesare also very similar, despite the fact that aquarius and phoenix haloes differby roughly three decades in virial mass. the most notable difference is thatcluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantlyless relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increasedhalo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. thisaccentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters onsurface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of three at a givenradius, depending on projection. the high apparent concentration reported forsome strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects. a morerecent assembly also explains why substructure in some phoenix haloes isslightly more abundant than in aquarius, especially in the inner regions.resolved subhaloes nevertheless contribute only $11 \pm 3%$ of the virial massin phoenix clusters. .

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1209.0456	thick disk kinematics from rave and the solar motion	radial velocity surveys such as the radial velocity experiment (rave) provideus with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby stars most of whichbelong to the galactic thin, thick disk or halo. ideally, to study the galacticdisks (both thin and thick) one should make use of the multi-dimensionalphase-space and the whole pattern of chemical abundances of their stellarpopulations. in this paper, with the aid of the rave survey, we study the thinand thick disks of the milky way, focusing on the latter. we present atechnique to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on thekinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of thestars. using the padova galaxy model, we checked the ability of our method tocorrectly isolate the thick disk component from the galaxy mixture of stellarpopulations. we introduce selection criteria in order to clean the observedradial velocities from the galactic differential rotation and to take intoaccount the partial sky coverage of rave. we developed a numerical technique tostatistically disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. we deducethe components of the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest (lsr)in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag of the thick diskcomponent relative to the lsr, and the square root of the absolute value of thevelocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk alone. the analysis of the thindisk is presented in another paper. we find good agreement with previousindependent parameter determinations. in our analysis we used photometricallydetermined distances. in the appendix we show that similar values can be foundfor the thick disk alone as derived in the main sections of our paper evenwithout the knowledge of photometric distances.

1302.2468	the wobbly galaxy: kinematics north and south with rave red clump giants	the rave survey, combined with proper motions and distance estimates, can beused to study in detail stellar kinematics in the extended solar neighbourhood(solar suburb). using the red clump, we examine the mean velocity components in3d between an r of 6 and 10 kpc and a z of -2 to 2 kpc, concentrating onnorth-south differences. simple parametric fits to the r, z trends for vphi andthe velocity dispersions are presented. we confirm the recently discoveredgradient in mean galactocentric radial velocity, vr, finding that the gradientis more marked below the plane, with a z gradient also present. the verticalvelocity, vz, also shows clear structure, with indications of ararefaction-compression pattern, suggestive of wave-like behaviour. we performa rigorous error analysis, tracing sources of both systematic and randomerrors. we confirm the north-south differences in vr and vz along theline-of-sight, with the vr estimated independent of the proper motions. thecomplex three-dimensional structure of velocity space presents challenges forfuture modelling of the galactic disk, with the galactic bar, spiral arms andexcitation of wave-like structures all probably playing a role.

1302.3466	the relation between chemical abundances and kinematics of the galactic  disc with rave	aims: we study the relations between stellar kinematics and chemicalabundances of a large sample of rave giants in search for selection criterianeeded for disentangling different galactic stellar populations. methods: weselect a sample of 2167 giant stars with signal-to-noise per spectralmeasurements above 75 from the rave chemical catalogue and follow the analysisperformed by gratton and colleagues on 150 subdwarf stars spectroscopicallyobserved at high-resolution. we then use a larger sample of 9131 giants (withsignal-to-noise above 60) to investigate the chemo-kinematical characteristicsof our stars by grouping them into nine subsamples with common eccentricity($e$) and maximum distance achieved above the galactic plane ($z_max$).results: the rave kinematical and chemical data proved to be reliable byreproducing the results by gratton et al. obtained with high-resolutionspectroscopic data. our analysis, based on the $e$-$z_max$ plane combined withadditional orbital parameters and chemical information, provides an alternativeway of identifying different populations of stars. in addition to extractingcanonical thick- and thin-disc samples, we find a group of stars in thegalactic plane ($z_max&lt;1$ kpc and 0.4 $&lt; e &lt; $0.6), which show homogeneouskinematics but differ in their chemical properties. we interpret this as aclear sign that some of these stars have experienced the effects of heatingand/or radial migration, which have modified their original orbits. theaccretion origin of such stars cannot be excluded.

0801.2120	galactic kinematics with rave data: i. the distribution of stars towards  the galactic poles	we analyze the distribution of g and k type stars towards the galactic polesusing rave and elodie radial velocities, 2mass photometric star counts, anducac2 proper motions. the combination of photometric and 3d kinematic dataallows us to disentangle and describe the vertical distribution of dwarfs,sub-giants and giants and their kinematics. we identify discontinuities withinthe kinematics and magnitude counts that separate the thin disk, thick disk anda hotter component. the respective scale heights of the thin disk and thickdisk are 225$\pm$10 pc and 1048$\pm$36 pc. we also constrain the luminosityfunction and the kinematic distribution function. the existence of a kinematicgap between the thin and thick disks is incompatible with the thick disk havingformed from the thin disk by a continuous process, such as scattering of starsby spiral arms or molecular clouds. other mechanisms of formation of the thickdisk such as `created on the spot' or smoothly `accreted' remain compatiblewith our findings.

1307.6073	the asymmetric drift, the local standard of rest, and implications from  rave data	the determination of the lsr is still a matter of debate. the classical valueof the tangential peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr waschallenged in recent years, claiming a significantly larger value. we show thatthe radial velocity experiment (rave) sample of dwarf stars is an excellentdata set to derive tighter boundary conditions to chemodynamical evolutionmodels of the extended solar neighbourhood. we present an improved jeansanalysis, which allows a better interpretation of the measured kinematics ofstellar populations in the milky way disc. we propose an improved version ofthe str\"omberg relation with the radial scalelengths as the only unknown.binning rave stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric drift(corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more metal-richpopulations. with the standard assumption of velocity-dispersion independentradial scalelengths in each metallicity bin, we redetermine the lsr. the newstr\"omberg equation yields a joint lsr value of v_\sun=3.06 \pm 0.68 km/s,which is even smaller than the classical value based on hipparcos data. thecorresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the metal-rich binto 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an even larger scalelengthfor young metal-poor stars. when adopting the recent sch\"onrich value ofv_\sun=12.24 km/s for the lsr, the new str\"omberg equation yields much largerindividual radial scalelengths of the rave subpopulations, which seemunphysical in part. the new str\"omberg equation allows a cleanerinterpretation of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radialscalelengths. lifting the lsr value by a few km/s compared to the classicalvalue results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of smallervalues for larger velocity dispersions.

1309.4274	chromospherically active stars in the rave survey. i. the catalogue	rave, the unbiased magnitude limited survey of the southern sky stars,contained 456,676 medium-resolution spectra at the time of our analysis.spectra cover the caii irt range which is a known indicator of chromosphericactivity. our previous work (matijevi\v{c} et al. 2012) classified all spectrausing locally linear embedding. it identified 53,347 cases with a suggestedemission component in calcium lines. here we use a spectral subtractiontechnique to measure the properties of this emission. synthetic templates arereplaced by the observed spectra of non-active stars to bypass the difficultcomputations of non-lte profiles of the line cores and stellar parameterdependence. we derive both the equivalent width of the excess emission for eachcalcium line on a 5\aa\ wide interval and their sum ew_irt for ~44,000candidate active dwarf stars with s/n&gt;20 and with no respect to the source oftheir emission flux. from these ~14,000 show a detectable chromospheric fluxwith at least 2\sigma\ confidence level. our set of active stars vastlyenlarges previously known samples. atmospheric parameters and in some casesradial velocities of active stars derived from automatic pipeline suffer fromsystematic shifts due to their shallower calcium lines. we re-estimate theeffective temperature, metallicity and radial velocities for candidate activestars. the overall distribution of activity levels shows a bimodal shape, withthe first peak coinciding with non-active stars and the second with the premain-sequence cases. the catalogue will be publicly available with the nextrave public data releases.

1309.4293	the rave survey: the galactic escape speed and the mass of the milky way	we construct new estimates on the galactic escape speed at variousgalactocentric radii using the latest data release of the radial velocityexperiment (rave dr4). compared to previous studies we have a database largerby a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selectedsample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from rave and a previously published dataset. we calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of milky way-sized galaxies. our best estimate ofthe local galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed requiredto reach three virial radii $r_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $r_{340}$ isthe galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times thecritical density for closure in the universe. from the escape speed we furtherderive estimates of the mass of the galaxy using a simple mass model with twooptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and anadiabatically contracted navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) sphere. if we fix thelocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher massthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on haloconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint wefind very similar masses for both models. our best estimate for $m_{340}$, themass interior to $r_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times 10^{12}$ m$_\odot$ (corresponding to $m_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times10^{12}$ m$_\odot$). this estimate is in good agreement with recently publishedindependent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more distant halo starsand the satellite galaxy leo i.

1310.1919	in the thick of it: metal-poor disc stars in rave	by selecting in the rave-dr4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpcabove the galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplestthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the milky way. weconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions ofthe thick disc are not gaussian. in particular, we find that the thick disc hasan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [m/h]=-2 dex, contributingroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorterscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. the mean azimuthal velocityof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between themetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on theformation mechanisms of the galactic thick disc. given our simple approach, wefind dvphi/d[m/h] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement withprevious literature values. we complete the study with a brief discussion onthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggestthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed byradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1406.4130	constraining the galaxy's dark halo with rave stars	we use the kinematics of $\sim200\,000$ giant stars that lie within $\sim1.5$ kpc of the plane to measure the vertical profile of mass density near thesun. we find that the dark mass contained within the isodensity surface of thedark halo that passes through the sun($(6\pm0.9)\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$), and the surface density within$0.9$ kpc of the plane ($(69\pm10)\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$) are almostindependent of the (oblate) halo's axis ratio $q$. if the halo is spherical, 46per cent of the radial force on the sun is provided by baryons, and only 4.3per cent of the galaxy's mass is baryonic. if the halo is flattened, thebaryons contribute even less strongly to the local radial force and to thegalaxy's mass. the dark-matter density at the location of the sun is$0.0126\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-3}}=0.48\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{gev\,cm^{-3}}$.when combined with other literature results we find hints for a mildly oblatedark halo with $q \simeq 0.8$. our value for the dark mass within the solarradius is larger than that predicted by cosmological dark-matter-onlysimulations but in good agreement with simulations once the effects of baryonicinfall are taken into account. our mass models consist of threedouble-exponential discs, an oblate bulge and a navarro-frenk-white dark-matterhalo, and we model the dynamics of the rave stars in the correspondinggravitational fields by finding distribution functions $f(\mathbf{j})$ thatdepend on three action integrals. statistical errors are completely swamped bysystematic uncertainties, the most important of which are the distance to thestars in the photometric and spectroscopic samples and the solar distance tothe galactic centre. systematics other than the flattening of the dark haloyield overall uncertainties $\sim 15$ per cent.

1412.5649	the rich are different: evidence from the rave survey for stellar radial  migration	using the radial velocity experiment fourth data release (rave dr4), and anew metallicity calibration that will be also taken into account in the futurerave dr5, we investigate the existence and the properties of super-solarmetallicity stars ([m/h] &gt; +0.1 dex) in the sample, and in particular in thesolar neighbourhood. we find that rave is rich in super-solar metallicitystars, and that the local metallicity distribution function declines remarkablyslowly up to +0.4 dex. our results show that the kinematics and heightdistributions of the super-solar metallicity stars are identical to those ofthe [m/h] &lt; 0 thin-disc giants that we presume were locally manufactured. theeccentricities of the super-solar metallicity stars indicate that half of themare on a roughly circular orbit (e &lt; 0.15), so under the assumption that themetallicity of the interstellar medium at a given radius never decreases withtime, they must have increased their angular momenta by scattering atcorotation resonances of spiral arms from regions far inside the solar annulus.the likelihood that a star will migrate radially does not seem to decreasesignificantly with increasing amplitude of vertical oscillations within rangeof oscillation amplitudes encountered in the disc.

1507.08350	the acs lcid project: on the origin of dwarf galaxy types: a  manifestation of the halo assembly bias?	we discuss how knowledge of the whole evolutionary history of dwarf galaxies,including details on the early star formation events, can provide insight onthe origin of the different dwarf galaxy types. we suggest that these types maybe imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only theresult of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmentaleffects. we present precise star formation histories of a sample of local groupdwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldestmain-sequence turnoffs. we argue that these galaxies can be assigned to twobasic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and shortstar formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of theirstars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (oralmost). these two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto thepresent-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). slow and fastdwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the milky wayand/or m31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lowerdensity environments than fast dwarfs. we propose that the distinction betweena fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density ofthe environment where they form. at a later stage, interaction with a largehost galaxy may play a role in the final gas removal and ultimate terminationof star formation.

astro-ph;0012337	the power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations	high-resolution n-body simulations are used to examine the power spectrumdependence of the concentration of galaxy-sized dark matter halos. it is foundthat dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations aswell as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. thisfinding is consistent with the original results of navarro, frenk &amp; white(nfw), and allows their model to be extended to include power spectrasubstantially different from cold dark matter (cdm). in particular, thesingle-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halomass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm darkmatter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for theconcentration of cdm halos than proposed by nfw. the latter conclusion confirmsrecent suggestions by bullock et al., although this new modeling differs fromtheirs in detail. these findings imply that observational limits on theconcentration, such as those provided by estimates of the dark matter contentwithin individual galaxies, may be used to constrain the amplitude of massfluctuations on galactic and subgalactic scales. the constraints on$\lambda$cdm models posed by the dark mass within the solar circle in the milkyway and by the zero-point of the tully-fisher relation are revisited, with theresult that neither dataset is clearly incompatible with the `concordance'($\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda_0=0.7$, $\sigma_8=0.9$) $\lambda$cdm cosmogony. thisconclusion differs from that reached recently by navarro &amp; steinmetz, adisagreement that can be traced to inconsistencies in the normalization of the$\lambda$cdm power spectrum used in that work.

astro-ph;0201544	the inner structure of lambdacdm halos i: a numerical convergence study	we present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role ofvarious numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated darkmatter halo. we report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art,multi-stepping, parallel n-body codes: pkdgrav and gadget. we find thatconvergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of thegravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, andparticle number. for softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effectsare negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii wherethe following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter thanthe local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristicacceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enoughparticles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longerthan the age of the universe. the most stringent requirement for convergence istypically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxationcriterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocitiesat radii where the density contrast may reach $\sim 10^6$, the region mustenclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times $10^6$ within thevirial radius). applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized $\lambda$cdm halo, wefind that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressivelyshallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slopeshallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, $r \sim 0.005 r_{200}$,with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the innerregions.

astro-ph;0310576	the inner structure of lcdm halos ii: halo mass profiles and lsb  rotation curves	we use a set of high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations toinvestigate the inner mass profile of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (cdm)halos. these simulations extend the thorough numerical convergence studypresented in paper i of this series (power et al. 2003), and demonstrate thatthe mass profile of cdm halos can be robustly estimated beyond a minimumconverged radius of order r_conv ~ 1 kpc/h in our highest resolution runs. thedensity profiles of simulated halos become progressively shallow from thevirial radius inwards, and show no sign of approaching a well-defined power-lawbehaviour near the centre. at r_conv, the logarithmic slope of the densityprofile is steeper than the asymptotic \rho \propto r^-1 expected from theformula proposed by navarro, frenk, and white (1996), but significantlyshallower than the steeply divergent \rho \propto r^-1.5 cusp proposed by mooreet al. (1999). we perform a direct comparison of the spherically-averaged darkmatter circular velocity (v_c) profiles with rotation curves of low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies from the samples of de blok et al. (2001), de blokand bosma (2002), and swaters et al. (2003). most (about two-thirds) lsbgalaxies in this dataset are roughly consistent with cdm halo v_c profiles.however, about one third of lsbs in these samples feature a sharp transitionbetween the rising and flat part of the rotation curve that is not seen in thev_c profiles of cdm halos. this discrepancy has been interpreted as excludingthe presence of cusps, but we argue that it might simply reflect the differencebetween circular velocity and gas rotation speed likely to arise in gaseousdisks embedded within realistic, triaxial cdm halos.

astro-ph;0408132	disk galaxy rotation curves in triaxial cdm halos	we use n-body hydrodynamical simulations to study the structure of disks intriaxial potentials resembling cdm halos. our analysis focuses on the accuracyof the dark mass distribution inferred from rotation curves derived fromsimulated long-slit spectra. we consider a massless disk embedded in a halowith axis ratios of 0.5:0.6:1.0 and with its rotation axis aligned with theminor axis of the halo. closed orbits for the gaseous particles deviate fromcoplanar circular symmetry, resulting in a variety of long-slit rotation curveshapes, depending on the orientation of the disk relative to the line of sight.rotation curves may thus differ significantly from the spherically-averagedcircular velocity profile of the dark matter halo. "solid-body" rotationcurves--typically interpreted as a signature of a constant density core in thedark matter distribution--are obtained about 25% of the time for randomorientations although the dark matter follows the cuspy density profileproposed by navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw). we conclude that the discrepanciesreported between the shape of the rotation curve of low surface brightnessgalaxies and the structure of cdm halos may be resolved once the complexeffects of halo triaxiality on the dynamics of the gas component is properlytaken into account.

astro-ph;0505401	pieces of the puzzle: ancient substructure in the galactic disk	we search for signatures of past accretion events in the milky way in therecently published catalogue by nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accuratespatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearbystars. to optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterizethe properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. we find that stars witha common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbitalparameters; in particular, between the apocentre a and pericentre p, as well astheir z-angular momentum (l_z). in the apl-space, such stars are expected tocluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity.  the apl space for the nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure,much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral armsand the galactic bar. however, our analysis also reveals a statisticallysignificant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity,analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. besides being dynamicallypeculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicityand age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-galacticprovenance. it is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent groupswith characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspondto the remains of disrupted satellites.

astro-ph;0508046	the many lives of active galactic nuclei: cooling flows, black holes and  the luminosities and colours of galaxies	we simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holesby implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the millenniumrun, a very large simulation of the concordance lcdm cosmogony. our proceduresfollow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track theevolution of all galaxies more massive than the small magellanic cloudthroughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. inthis first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activityof central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those agnthat lie at the centre of a quasistatic x-ray emitting atmosphere in a galaxygroup or cluster. we show that for energetically and observationally plausibleparameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed massdrop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright endof the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massivegalaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to containsystematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. this success occursbecause static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, andradio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback)can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring starformation. we discuss possible physical models which might explain theaccretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model tobe successful.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0510643	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the number density of groups	the abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass is determined usingthe 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue. this is used toestimate the amplitude of the matter fluctuation spectrum, parametrised by thelinear theory rms density fluctuations in spheres of 8mpc/h, sigma_8. thebest-fitting value for this parameter is highly correlated with the mean matterdensity in the universe, omega_m, and is found to satisfysigma_8=0.25omega_m^{-0.92-4.5(omega_m-0.22)^2}+/-10%(statistical)+/-20%(systematic) for 0.18&lt;omega_m&lt;0.50, assuming that omega_m+omega_lambda=1. thisgives sigma_8=0.89 when omega_m=0.25. a ~20% correction has been applied toundo the systematic bias inherent in the measurement procedure. mockcatalogues, constructed from large cosmological n-body simulations, are used tohelp understand and model these systematic errors. the abundance of galaxygroups as a function of group bj band luminosity is also determined. this isused in conjunction with the halo mass function, determined from simulations,to infer the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio over four orders ofmagnitude in halo mass. the mass-to-light ratio shows a minimum value of100hm_sol/l_sol in the bj band at a total group luminosity of l_bj ~5.10^9lsol/h^2. together with the observed tully-fisher relation, this impliesthat the observed rotation speed of tully-fisher galaxies is within ~10% of thetypical circular speed of haloes hosting brightest galaxies of the sameluminosity.

astro-ph;0606211	the radial velocity experiment (rave): first data release	we present the first data release of the radial velocity experiment (rave),an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellaratmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, surface gravity) of up to onemillion stars using the 6df multi-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidttelescope of the anglo-australian observatory (aao). the rave program startedin 2003, obtaining medium resolution spectra (median r=7,500) in the ca-tripletregion ($\lambda\lambda$ 8,410--8,795 \aa) for southern hemisphere stars drawnfrom the tycho-2 and supercosmos catalogs, in the magnitude range 9&lt;i&lt;12. thefirst data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocitiesfor 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when includingre-observations). those data were obtained on 67 nights between 11 april 2003to 03 april 2004. the total sky coverage within this data release is$\sim$4,760 square degrees. the average signal to noise ratio of the observedspectra is 29.5, and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties betterthan 3.4 km/s. combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode isfound to be 2 km/s. repeat observations are used to assess the stability of ourradial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km/s. we demonstratethat the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show anysystematic trend with color or signal to noise. the rave radial velocities arecomplemented in the data release with proper motions from starnet 2.0, tycho-2and supercosmos, in addition to photometric data from the major optical andinfrared catalogs (tycho-2, usno-b, denis and 2mass). the data release can beaccessed via the rave webpage: http://www.rave-survey.org.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.

astro-ph;0612327	the shape of the gravitational potential in cold dark matter halos	we use a set of cosmological n-body simulations to investigate the structuralshape of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (cdm) halos. unlike most previous workon the subject - which dealt with shapes as measured by the inertia tensor - wefocus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity moredirectly relevant to comparison with observational probes. a further advantageis that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, asa consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and wellapproximated by concentric ellipsoids. our main result is that the asphericityof the potential increases rapidly towards the center of the halo. the radialtrend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the massdistribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter halos to becomeincreasingly aspherical inwards. near the center the halo potential isapproximately prolate ((c/a)_0=0.72 +/- 0.04, (b/a)_0=0.78 +/- 0.08), but itbecomes increasingly spherical in the outer regions. the principal axes of theisopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most halos the angularmomentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the majoraxis. this suggests that galactic disks may form in a plane where the potentialis elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius. this canresult in significant deviations from circular motion in systems such as lowsurface brightness galaxies (lsbs), even for relatively minor deviations fromcircular symmetry. simulated long-slit rotation curves can appear similar tothose of lsbs often cited as evidence for constant density "cores". thissuggests that taking into account the 3d shape of the dark mass distributionmight help to reconcile such evidence with the cuspy mass profile of cdm halos.

astro-ph;9810359	the imprint of galaxy formation on x-ray clusters	it is widely believed that structure in the universe evolves hierarchically,as primordial density fluctuations, amplified by gravity, collapse and merge toform progressively larger systems. the structure and evolution of x-rayclusters, however, seems at odds with this hierarchical scenario for structureformation. poor clusters and groups, as well as most distant clusters detectedto date, are substantially fainter than expected from the tight relationsbetween luminosity, temperature and redshift predicted by these models. here weshow that these discrepancies arise because, near the centre, the entropy ofthe hot, diffuse intracluster medium (icm) is higher tha$ achievable throughgravitational collapse, indicating substantial non-gravitational heating of theicm. we estimate this excess entropy for the first time, and argue that itrepresents a relic of the energetic winds through which forming galaxiespolluted the icm with metals. energetically, this is onl$ possible if the icmis heated at modest redshift ($z \ltsim 2$) but prior to cluster collapse,indicating that the formation of galaxies precedes that of clusters and thatmost clusters have been assembled very recently.

astro-ph;9906160	the santa barbara cluster comparison project: a comparison of  cosmological hydrodynamics solutions	we have simulated the formation of an x-ray cluster in a cold dark matteruniverse using 12 different codes. the codes span the range of numericaltechniques and implementations currently in use, including sph and grid methodswith fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. the goal of this comparison is toassess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters inthe simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed tobe non-radiative. we compare images of the cluster at different epochs, globalproperties such as mass, temperature and x-ray luminosity, and radial profilesof various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. on the whole, theagreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number ofdiscrepancies exist. agreement is best for properties of the dark matter andworst for the total x-ray luminosity. even in this case, simulations thatadequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total x-rayluminosities that agree to within a factor of two. other quantities arereproduced to much higher accuracy. for example, the temperature and gas massfraction within the virial radius agree to about 10%, and the ratio of specifickinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5%. various factorscontribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, includingdifferences in the internal timing of the simulations. based on the overallconsistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of thecluster we have modelled.
