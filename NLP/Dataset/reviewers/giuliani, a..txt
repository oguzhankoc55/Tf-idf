0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

physics;9807059	oligopeptides' frequencies in the classification of proteins' primary  structures	this paper reports about an approach to the classification of proteins'primary structures taking advantage of the self organizing maps algorithm andof a numerical coding of the aminoacids based upon their physico-chemicalproperties. hydrophobicity, volume, surface area, hydrophilicity, bulkiness,refractivity and polarity were subjected to a principal component analysis andthe first two principal components, explaining 84.8 % of the total observedvariability, were used to cluster the aminoacids into 4 or 5 classes through ak-means algorithm. this leads to an economical representation of the primarystructures which, in the construction of the input vectors for the selforganizing maps algorithm, allows the consideration of up to tri- andtetrapeptides' frequency matrices with minimal computational overload. incomparison with previously explored conditions, namely symbolic coding ofaminoacids and dipeptides frequencies, no significant improvement was observedin the classification of 69 cytochromes of the c type, characterized by a highdegree of structural and functional similarity, while a substantial improvementoccurred in the case of a data set including quite heterogeneous primarystructures.

0906.1446	observation of grbs with agile	since its early phases of operation, the agile satellite is observing gammaray bursts (grbs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders ofmagnitude. in the hard x-ray band the superagile imager provides localizationof about one grb/month plus the detection of 1-2 grbs per month out of itsfield of view. the mini-calorimeter detects about one grb/week in the 350kev -100mev energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.in fact, the on-board mcal trigger logic, implemented for the first time ontime windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for veryshort bursts detection. the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid), sensitive in the30mev - 30gev range, firmly detected three grbs (grb080514b, grb090401b andgrb090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. moreover,all grbs localized by other spacecrafts inside the grid field of view arecurrently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. inthis paper we review the status of the observation of grbs with agile, withparticular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1009.5539	study of the gamma-ray source 1agl j2022+4032 in the cygnus region	identification of gamma-ray-emitting galactic sources is a long-standingproblem in astrophysics. one such source, 1agl j2022+4032, coincident with theinterior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant gamma cygni (snrg78.2+2.1) in the cygnus region, has recently been identified by fermi as agamma-ray pulsar, lat psr j2021+4026. we present long-term observations of 1aglj2022+4032 with the agile gamma-ray telescope, measuring its flux and lightcurve. we compare the light curve of 1agl j2022+4032 with that of 1aglj2021+3652 (psr j2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1aglj2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical andsystematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate theprobability of the apparent observed variability. we evaluate the possibilitythat the gamma-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or morepoint sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possiblecounterparts. we consider the possibility of a nearby x-ray quiet microquasarcontributing to the flux of 1agl j2022+4032 to be more likely than thehypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic gamma-ray variabilty of lat psrj2021+4026.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1106.5162	the brightest gamma-ray flaring blazar in the sky: agile and  multi-wavelength observations of 3c 454.3 during november 2010	since 2005, the blazar 3c 454.3 has shown remarkable flaring activity at allfrequencies, and during the last four years it has exhibited more than onegamma-ray flare per year, becoming the most active gamma-ray blazar in the sky.we present for the first time the multi-wavelength agile, swift, integral, andgasp-webt data collected in order to explain the extraordinary gamma-ray flareof 3c 454.3 which occurred in november 2010. on 2010 november 20 (mjd 55520),3c 454.3 reached a peak flux (e&gt;100 mev) of f_gamma(p) = (6.8+-1.0)e-5 ph/cm2/son a time scale of about 12 hours, more than a factor of 6 higher than the fluxof the brightest steady gamma-ray source, the vela pulsar, and more than afactor of 3 brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 december 2-3. themulti-wavelength data make a thorough study of the present event possible: thecomparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the onethat occurred in 2009. by comparing the broadband emission before, during, andafter the gamma-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical and x-ray emissionvaries within a factor 2-3, whereas the gamma-ray flux by a factor of 10. thisremarkable behavior is modeled by an external compton component driven by asubstantial local enhancement of soft seed photons.

1111.4868	neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant  w44	we present the agile gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 mev - 10gev of the supernova remnant (snr) w44, one of the most interesting systems forstudying cosmic-ray production. w44 is an intermediate-age snr (20, 000 years)and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,nearby molecular clouds, and bright [sii] emitting regions. we extend ourgamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurementswhich could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. we findthat gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape ofthe inner snr shocked plasma. furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows aprominent peak near 1 gev with a clear decrement at energies below a fewhundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay. here we demonstrate that:(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelengthconstraints derived from radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously thewell-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellardensity much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadronenergy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)and a low-energy cut-off at ec = 6 \pm 1 gev. direct evidence for pion emissionis then established in an snr for the first time.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1303.0161	gamma-ray observations of cygnus x-1 above 100 mev in the hard and soft  states	we present the results of multi-year gamma-ray observations by the agilesatellite of the black hole binary system cygnus x-1. in a previousinvestigation we focused on gamma-ray observations of cygnus x-1 in the hardstate during the period mid-2007/2009. here we present the results of thegamma-ray monitoring of cygnus x-1 during the period 2010/mid-2012 carried outfor which includes a remarkably prolonged `soft state' phase (june 2010 -- may2011). previous 1--10 mev observations of cyg x-1 in this state hinted at apossible existence of a non-thermal particle component with substantialmodifications of the comptonized emission from the inner accretion disk. ouragile data, averaged over the mid-2010/mid-2011 soft state of cygnus x-1,provide a significant upper limit for gamma-ray emission above 100 mev off_soft &lt; 20 x 10^{-8} ph/cm^2/s, excluding the existence of prominentnon-thermal emission above 100 mev during the soft state of cygnus x-1. wediscuss theoretical implications of our findings in the context of high-energyemission models of black hole accretion. we also discuss possible gamma-rayflares detected by agile. in addition to a previously reported episode observedby agile in october 2009 during the hard state, we report a weak but importantcandidate for enhanced emission which occurred at the end of june 2010(2010-06-30 10:00 - 2010-07-02 10:00 ut) exactly in coincidence with ahard-to-soft state transition and before an anomalous radio flare. an appendixsummarizes all previous high-energy observations and possible detections ofcygnus x-1 above 1 mev.

1303.1846	transient gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3 detected by agile: leptonic  and hadronic emission models	the agile satellite detected several episodes of transient gamma-ray emissionfrom cygnus x-3. cross-correlating the agile light curve with both x-ray andradio monitoring data, we found that the main events of gamma-ray activity weredetected while the system was in soft spectral x-ray states, that coincide withlocal and often sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux, a few days before intenseradio outbursts. this repetitive temporal coincidence between the gamma-raytransient emission and spectral state changes of the source turns out to be thespectral signature of high-energy activity from this microquasar. the gamma-raydifferential spectrum of cygnus x-3 (100 mev - 3 gev), which was obtained byaveraging the data collected by agile during the gamma-ray events, isconsistent with a power law of photon index {\alpha} = 2.0 +/- 0.2. finally, weexamined leptonic and hadronic emission models for the gamma-ray activity andfound that both scenarios are valid. in particular, in the leptonic model -based on inverse compton scatterings of mildly relativistic electrons on softphotons from both the wolf-rayet companion star and the accretion disk - theemitting particles may also contribute to the overall hard x-ray spectrum,possibly explaining the hard non-thermal power-law tail seen during specialsoft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1403.1250	the supernova remnant w44: confirmations and challenges for cosmic-ray  acceleration	the middle-aged supernova remnant (snr) w44 has recently attracted attentionbecause of its relevance regarding the origin of galactic cosmic-rays. thegamma-ray missions agile and fermi have established, for the first time for asnr, the spectral continuum below 200 mev which can be attributed to neutralpion emission. confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near100 mev is then of the greatest importance. our paper is focused on a globalre-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in w44,with the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptoniccontributions to the overall spectrum. we also present new gamma-ray and conanten2 data on w44, and compare them with recently published agile and fermidata. our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the w44complex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling.in particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regionsemitting 100 mev - 10 gev gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3).the hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of w44 is viable, andsupported by strong evidence. it implies a relatively large value for theaverage magnetic field (b &gt; 10^2 microg) in the snr surroundings, sign of fieldamplification by shock-driven turbulence. our new analysis establishes that thespectral index of the proton energy distribution function is p1 = 2.2 +/- 0.1at low energies and p2 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 at high energies. we critically discusshadronic versus leptonic-only models of emission taking into accountsimultaneously radio and gamma-ray data. we find that the leptonic models aredisfavored by the combination of radio and gamma-ray data. having determinedthe hadronic nature of the gamma-ray emission on firm ground, a number oftheoretical challenges remains to be addressed.

1404.1231	rejection of randomly coinciding events in znmoo$_4$ scintillating  bolometers	random coincidence of events (particularly from two neutrino double betadecay) could be one of the main sources of background in the search forneutrinoless double beta decay with cryogenic bolometers due to their poor timeresolution. pulse-shape discrimination by using front edge analysis, mean-timeand $\chi^2$ methods was applied to discriminate randomly coinciding events inznmoo$_4$ cryogenic scintillating bolometers. these events can be effectivelyrejected at the level of 99% by the analysis of the heat signals with rise-timeof about 14 ms and signal-to-noise ratio of 900, and at the level of 92% by theanalysis of the light signals with rise-time of about 3 ms and signal-to-noiseratio of 30, under the requirement to detect 95% of single events. theserejection efficiencies are compatible with extremely low background levels inthe region of interest of neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{100}$mo forenriched znmoo$_4$ detectors, of the order of $10^{-4}$ counts/(y kev kg).pulse-shape parameters have been chosen on the basis of the performance of areal massive znmoo$_4$ scintillating bolometer. importance of thesignal-to-noise ratio, correct finding of the signal start and choice of anappropriate sampling frequency are discussed.

1507.01475	on the angular resolution of the agile gamma-ray imaging detector	we present a study of the angular resolution of the agile gamma-ray imagingdetector (grid) that is operational in space since april 2007. the agileinstrument is made of an array of 12 planes each equipped with a tungstenconverter and silicon micros trip detectors and is sensitive in the energyrange 50 mev - 10 gev. among the space instruments devoted to gamma-rayastrophysics, agile uniquely exploits an analog readout system with dedicatedelectronics coupled with silicon detectors. we show the results of monte carlosimulations carried out to reproduce the gamma-ray detection by the grid, andwe compare them to in-flight data. we use the crab (pulsar + nebula) system fordiscussion of real data performance, since its e^{-2} energy spectrum isrepresentative of the majority of gamma-ray sources. for crab-like spectrumsources, the grid angular resolution (fwhm of ~4deg at 100 mev; ~0.8deg at 1gev; ~0.9deg integrating the full energy band from 100 mev to tens of gev) isstable across a large field of view, being characterized by a flat response upto 30deg off-axis. a comparison of the angular resolution obtained by the twooperational gamma-ray instruments, agile-grid and fermi-lat, is interesting inview of future gamma-ray missions, that are currently under study. the twoinstruments exploit different detector configurations affecting the angularresolution: the former being optimized in the readout and track reconstructionespecially in the low-energy band, the latter in terms of converter thicknessand power consumption. we show that, despite these differences, the angularresolution of both instruments is very similar between 100 mev and a few gev.

1510.03266	background suppression in massive teo$_2$ bolometers with neganov-luke  amplified light detectors	bolometric detectors are excellent devices for the investigation ofneutrinoless double-beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$). the observation of suchdecay would demonstrate the violation of lepton number, and at the same time itwould necessarily imply that neutrinos have a majorana character. thesensitivity of cryogenic detectors based on teo$_2$ is strongly limited by thealpha background in the region of interest for the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ of$^{130}$te. it has been demonstrated that particle discrimination in teo$_2$bolometers is possible measuring the cherenkov light produced by particleinteractions. however an event-by-event discrimination with ntd-based lightdetectors has to be demonstrated. we will discuss the performance of ahighly-sensitive light detector exploiting the neganov-luke effect for signalamplification. the detector, being operated with ntd-thermistor and coupled toa 750 g teo$_2$ crystal, shows the ability for an event-by-event identificationof electron/gamma and alpha particles. the extremely low detector baselinenoise, rms 19 ev, demonstrates the possibility to enhance the sensitivity ofteo$_2$-based 0$\nu\beta\beta$ experiment to an unprecedented level.

0810.1676	agile detection of intense gamma-ray emission from the blazar pks  1510-089	we report the detection by the agile (astro-rivelatore gamma a immaginileggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source aglj1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar pks 1510-089, during ten daysof observations from 23 august to 1 september 2007. during the observationperiod, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitoredby the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt). the simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us tostudy the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on thesynchrotron and inverse compton (ic) emission mechanisms. agile observed thesource with its two co-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector and thehard x-ray imager super-agile sensitive in the 30 mev - 50 gev and 18 - 60 kevbands, respectively. between 23 and 27 august 2007, agile detected gamma-rayemission from pks 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degreesoff-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}for photon energy above 100 mev. in the following period, 28 august - 1september, after a satellite re-pointing, agile detected the source at about 35degrees off-axis, with an average flux (e &gt; 100 mev) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no emission was detected by super-agile, with a 3-sigmaupper limit of 45 mcrab in 200 ksec. the spectral energy distribution ismodelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton (ssc) emissionplus contributions by external photons: the ssc emission contributes primarilyto the x-ray band, whereas the contribution of the ic from the external discand the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.

cond-mat;0404701	anomalous universality in the anisotropic ashkin-teller model	the ashkin-teller (at) model is a generalization of ising 2-d to a fourstates spin model; it can be written in the form of two ising layers (ingeneral with different couplings) interacting via a four-spin interaction. itwas conjectured long ago (by kadanoff and wegner, wu and lin, baxter andothers) that at has in general two critical points, and that universalityholds, in the sense that the critical exponents are the same as in the isingmodel, except when the couplings of the two ising layers are equal (isotropiccase). we obtain an explicit expression for the specific heat from which weprove this conjecture in the weakly interacting case and we locate preciselythe critical points. we find the somewhat unexpected feature that, despiteuniversality holds for the specific heat, nevertheless nonuniversal criticalindexes appear: for instance the distance between the critical points rescaleswith an anomalous exponent as we let the couplings of the two ising layerscoincide (isotropic limit); and so does the constant in front of the logarithmin the specific heat. our result also explains how the crossover from universalto nonuniversal behaviour is realized.

cond-mat;0412176	universality and non-universality in the ashkin-teller model	the ashkin-teller model can be formulated as a pair of 2d ising models,interacting via a four-spin interaction. i consider the case of weak anisotropy(slight a-symmetry between the two ising layers) and weak coupling. i show thatthe system admits two critical temperatures whose difference variescontinuously with the strength of the coupling, scaling with an anomalousexponent as one let the a-symmetry parameter go to zero. the specific heatdiverges logarithmically at the critical points (as for ising) but the constantin front of the logarithm is renormalized by an anomalous critical exponent.the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat dominates only in anexponentially small interval around the critical temperatures and outside it ismodified into an anomalous power law behaviour. the proof is based on an exactmapping of ashkin-teller into a model of (1+1)d interacting fermions and on theimplementation of constructive renormalization group methods on the fermionicsystem. this phd thesis includes: (1) a review of the exact solution of 2dising in terms of grassmann functional integrals; (2) a review of the grassmannrepresentation for a class of interacting ising models, including ashkin-tellerand the 8 vertex model; (3) a detailed discussion of the multiscale analysis ofthe ashkin-teller model, based on fermionic renormalization group methods,including the study of the flow of the effective coupling constants (inparticular a proof of vanishing of the beta function for this and similarluttinger-like models, based on modified approximate ward identities, isincluded). this thesis is based on joint work with v. mastropietro.

cond-mat;0412455	fluctuation relation beyond linear response theory	the fluctuation relation (fr) is an asymptotic result on the distribution ofcertain observables averaged over time intervals t as t goes to infinity and itis a generalization of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem to far fromequilibrium systems in a steady state which reduces to the usual green-kubo(gk) relation in the limit of small external non conservative forces. fr is atheorem for smooth uniformly hyperbolic systems, and it is assumed to be truein all dissipative ``chaotic enough'' systems in a steady state. in this paperwe develop a theory of finite time corrections to fr, needed to compare theasymptotic prediction of fr with numerical observations, which necessarilyinvolve fluctuations of observables averaged over finite time intervals t. weperform a numerical test of fr in two cases in which non gaussian fluctuationsare observable while gk does not apply and we get a non trivial verification offr that is independent of and different from linear response theory. ourresults are compatible with the theory of finite time corrections to fr, whilefr would be observably violated, well within the precision of our experiments,if such corrections were neglected.

cond-mat;0507672	chaotic hypothesis, fluctuation theorem and singularities	the chaotic hypothesis has several implications which have generated interestin the literature because of their generality and because a few exactpredictions are among them. however its application to physics problemsrequires attention and can lead to apparent inconsistencies. in particularthere are several cases that have been considered in the literature in whichsingularities are built in the models: for instance when among the forces thereare lennard-jones potentials (which are infinite in the origin) and theconstraints imposed on the system do not forbid arbitrarily close approach tothe singularity even though the average kinetic energy is bounded. thesituation is well understood in certain special cases in which the system issubject to gaussian noise; here the treatment of rather general singularsystems is considered and the predictions of the chaotic hypothesis for suchsituations are derived. the main conclusion is that the chaotic hypothesis isperfectly adequate to describe the singular physical systems we consider, i.e.deterministic systems with thermostat forces acting according to gauss'principle for the constraint of constant total kinetic energy (``isokineticgaussian thermostats''), close and far from equilibrium. near equilibrium iteven predicts a fluctuation relation which, in deterministic cases with moregeneral thermostat forces (i.e. not necessarily of gaussian isokinetic nature),extends recent relations obtained in situations in which the thermostattingforces satisfy gauss' principle. this relation agrees, where expected, with thefluctuation theorem for perfectly chaotic systems. the results are comparedwith some recent works in the literature.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.

hep-ex;0211071	a calorimetric search on double beta decay of 130te	we report on the final results of a series of experiments on double decay of130te carried out with an array of twenty cryogenic detectors. the set-up ismade with crystals of teo2 with a total mass of 6.8 kg, the largest operatingone for a cryogenic experiment. four crystals are made with isotopicallyenriched materials: two in 128te and two others in 130te. the remaining onesare made with natural tellurium, which contains 31.7 % and 33.8 % 128te and130te, respectively. the array was run under a heavy shield in the gran sassounderground laboratory at a depth of about 3500 m.w.e. by recording the pulsesof each detector in anticoincidence with the others a lower limit of 2.1e23years has been obtained at the 90 % c.l. on the lifetime for neutrinolessdouble beta decay of 130te. in terms of effective neutrino mass this is themost restrictive limit in direct experiments, after those obtained with gediodes. limits on other lepton violating decays of 130te and on theneutrinoless double beta decay of 128te to the ground state of 128xe are alsoreported and discussed. an indication is presented for the two neutrino doublebeta decay of 130te. some consequences of the present results in theinterpretation of geochemical experiments are discussed.

hep-ex;0302006	a bolometric measurement of the antineutrino mass	high statistics calorimetric measurements of the beta spectrum of 187re arebeing performed with arrays of silver perrhenate crystals operated at lowtemperature. after a modification of the experimental set-up, which allowed tosubstantially reduce the background of spurious counts and therefore toincrease the sensitivity on the electron antineutrino mass, a new measurementwith 10 silver perrhenate microbolometers is running since july 2002. thecrystals have masses between 250 and 350 micrograms and their average fwhmenergy resolution, constantly monitored by means of fluorescence x-rays, is of28.3 ev at the beta end-point. the kurie plot collected during 4485 hours x mgeffective running time has an end-point energy of 2466.1 +/- 0.8{stat} +/- 1.5{syst} ev, while the half lifetime of the decay is found to be 43.2 +/-0.2{stat} +/- 0.1{syst} gy. these values are the most precise obtained so farfor 187re. from the fit of the kurie plot we can deduce a value for the squaredelectron antineutrino mass m(nu)^2 of 147 +/- 237{stat} +/- 90{syst} ev^2. thecorresponding 90% c.l. upper limit for m(nu) is 21.7 ev.

hep-ex;0501034	a new limit on the neutrinoless dbd of 130te	we report the present results of cuoricino a cryogenic experiment onneutrinoless double beta decay (dbd) of 130te consisting of an array of 62crystals of teo2 with a total active mass of 40.7 kg. the array is framedinside of a dilution refrigerator, heavily shielded against environmentalradioactivity and high-energy neutrons, and operated at a temperature of ~8 mkin the gran sasso underground laboratory. temperature pulses induced byparticle interacting in the crystals are recorded and measured by means ofneutron transmutation doped thermistors. the gain of each bolometer isstabilized with voltage pulses developed by a high stability pulse generatoracross heater resistors put in thermal contact with the absorber.  the calibration is performed by means of two thoriated wires routinelyinserted in the set-up. no evidence for a peak indicating neutrinoless dbd of130te is detected and a 90% c.l. lower limit of 1.8e24 years is set for thelifetime of this process. taking largely into account the uncertainties in thetheoretical values of nuclear matrix elements, this implies an upper boud onthe effective mass of the electron neutrino ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 ev. thissensitivity is similar to those of the 76ge experiments.
