0901.3845	the building the bridge survey for z=3 ly-alpha emitting galaxies ii:  completion of the survey	(abridged). we aim at bridging the gap between absorption selected andemission selected galaxies at z~3 by probing the faint end of the luminosityfunction of star-forming galaxies at z~3. we have performed narrow-band imagingin three fields with intervening qso absorbers (a damped ly$\alpha$ absorberand two lyman-limit systems) using the vlt. we target ly-alpha at redshifts2.85, 3.15 and 3.20. we find a consistent surface density of about 10ly-alpha-emitters per square arcmin per unit redshift in all three fields downto our detection limit of about 3x10^41 ergs s^-1. the luminosity function isconsistent with what has been found by other surveys at similar redshifts.about 85% of the sources are fainter than the canonical limit of r=25.5 formost lyman-break galaxy surveys. in none of the three fields do we detect theemission counterparts of the qso absorbers. in particular we do not detect thecounterpart of the z=2.85 damped ly-alpha absorber towards q2138-4427.narrow-band surveys for ly-alpha emitters are excellent to probe the faint endof the luminosity function at z~3. there is a very high surface density of thisclass of objects. this is consistent with a very steep slope of the faint endof the luminosity function as has been inferred by other studies. this faintpopulation of galaxies is playing a central role in the early universe. thereis evidence that this population is dominating the integrated star-formationactivity, responsible for the bulk of the ionizing photons at z~3 and likelyalso responsible for the bulk of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

0906.1585	diffuse molecular gas at high redshift: detection of co molecules and  the 2175 {\aa} dust feature at z=1.64	we present the detection of carbon monoxide molecules (co) at z=1.6408towards the quasar sdssj160457.50+220300.5 using the vlt ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph. co absorption is detected in at least two components inthe first six a-x bands and one d-x(5-0) inter-band system. this is the seconddetection of this kind along a quasar line of sight. the co absorption profilesare well modelled assuming a rotational excitation of co in the range 6&lt;tex&lt;16k, which is consistent with or higher than the temperature of the cmb radiationat this redshift. we derive a total co column density of n(co)=4e14 cm^-2. themeasured column densities of si, mgi, znii, feii and siii indicate a dustdepletion pattern typical of cold gas in the galactic disc. the backgroundquasar spectrum is significantly reddened (u-k~4.5 mag) and presents apronounced 2175 a dust absorption feature at the redshift of the co absorber.using a control sample of ~500 quasars we find the chance probability for thisfeature to be spurious is ~0.3%. we show that the sed of the quasar is wellfitted with a qso composite spectrum reddened with a lmc supershell extinctionlaw at the redshift of the absorber. it is noticeable that this quasar isabsent from the colour-selected sdss quasar sample. this demonstrates ourcurrent view of the universe may be biased against dusty sightlines. thesedirect observations of carbonaceous molecules and dust open up the possibilityof studying physical conditions and chemistry of diffuse molecular gas in highredshift galaxies.

0907.1057	physical conditions in high-redshift grb-dla absorbers observed with  vlt/uves: implications for molecular hydrogen searches	we aim to understand the nature of the absorbing neutral gas in the galaxieshosting high-redshift long-duration grbs and to determine their physicalconditions. we report the detection of a significant number of previouslyunidentified allowed transition lines of fe+, involving the fine structure ofthe ground term and that of other excited levels, from the zabs=3.969, logn(h0)=22.10 dla system located in the host galaxy of grb 050730. thetime-dependent evolution of the observed fe+ energy-level populations ismodelled by assuming the excitation mechanism is fluorescence followingexcitation by ultraviolet photons. this uv pumping model successfullyreproduces the observations, yielding a burst/cloud distance (defined to thenear-side of the cloud) of d=440\pm 30 pc and a linear cloud size ofl=520{+240}{-190} pc. we discuss these results in the context of no detectionsof h2 and ci lines in a sample of seven z&gt;1.8 grb host galaxies observed withvlt/uves. we show that the lack of h2 can be explained by the lowmetallicities, [x/h]&lt;-1, low depletion factors and, at most, moderate particledensities of the systems. this points to a picture where grb-dlas typicallyexhibiting very high h0 column densities are diffuse metal-poor atomic cloudswith high kinetic temperatures, tkin&gt;~1000 k, and large physical extents,l&gt;~100 pc. the properties of grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolutiontowards bright grb afterglows differ markedly from the high metal and dustcontents of grb-dlas observed at lower resolution. this difference likelyresults from the effect of a bias, against systems of high metallicity and/orclose to the grb, due to dust obscuration in the magnitude-limited grbafterglow samples observed with high-resolution spectrographs.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0908.1574	evolution of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas from sloan  digital sky survey ii - data release 7	we present the results of a search for damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems inthe sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss), data release 7. we use a fullyautomatic procedure to identify dlas and derive their column densities. theprocedure is checked against the results of previous searches for dlas in sdss.we discuss the agreements and differences and show the robustness of ourprocedure. for each system, we obtain an accurate measurement of the absorber'sredshift, the hi column density and the equivalent width of associated metalabsorption lines, without any human intervention. we find 1426 absorbers with2.15 &lt; z &lt; 5.2 with log n(hi)&gt;=20, out of which 937 systems have log n(hi)&gt;=20.3. this is the largest dla sample ever built, made available to thescientific community through the electronic version of this paper. in thecourse of the survey, we discovered the intervening dla with highest hi columndensity known to date with log n(hi)=22.0+/-0.1. this single system provides astrong constraint on the high-end of the n(hi) frequency distribution nowmeasured with high accuracy. we show that the presence of a dla at the blue endof a qso spectrum can lead to important systematic errors and propose a methodto avoid them. this has important consequences for the measurement of thecosmological mass density of neutral gas at z~2.2 and therefore on ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution over the past 10 billion years.

0908.3893	uncovering strong mgii absorbing galaxies: imaging below the lyman limit	the nature of the galaxies that give rise to absorption lines, such as dampedlyman-alpha systems (dlas) or strong mgii lines, in quasar spectra is difficultto investigate in emission. taking advantage of the total absorption of the qsolight bluewards of the lyman limit of two dlas at z&gt;3.4, we look for thecontinuum emission from intervening galaxies at z~2 that are identified viastrong metal absorption lines. the mgii absorbers have equivalent width largeenough to be potential dla systems. deep images are obtained with the focalreducer and spectrograph (fors1) on the very large telescope for the fieldstowards sdss j110855+120953 and sdss j140850+020522. these quasars have mgiiabsorption lines at z=1.87 (w_r(mgii)=2.46 a) and z=1.98 (w_r(mgii)=1.89 a),respectively, and each qso has two intervening higher redshift dlas at z&gt;3. theu and r bands of fors1 lie blue and redwards of the lyman limit of thebackground dlas, allowing us to search for emission from the foregroundgalaxies directly along the lines of sight to the qsos. no galaxies are foundclose to the sight line of the qso to a point source limit of u_ab=28.0. inboth fields, the closest objects lie at an impact parameter of 5 arcseccorresponding to 40 kpc in projection at z=2, and have typical colours of starforming galaxies at that redshift. however, the currently available data do notallow us to confirm if the galaxies lie at the same redshifts as the absorptionsystems. a more extended structure is visible in the sdss j14085+020522 fieldat an impact parameter of 0.8 arcsec or 7 kpc. if these objects are at z~2their luminosities are 0.03-0.04 l* in both fields. the star formation ratesestimated from the uv flux are 0.5-0.6 m_sun yr^-1.

1002.2107	hd molecules at high redshift: the absorption system at z=2.3377 towards  q 1232+082	we present a detailed analysis of the h_2 and hd absorption lines detected inthe damped lyman-alpha (dla) system at z_abs=2.3377 towards the quasarq1232+082. we show that this intervening cloud has a covering factor smallerthan unity and covers only part of the qso broad emission line region. the zeroflux level has to be corrected at the position of the saturated h_2 andoptically thin hd lines by about 10%. we accurately determine the dopplerparameter for hd and ci lines (b = 1.86+/-0.20 km/s). we find a ration(hd)/n(h_2)=(7.1 +3.7 -2.2)x10^-5 that is significantly higher than what isobserved in molecular clouds of the galaxy. chemical models suggest that in thephysical conditions prevailing in the central part of molecular clouds,deuterium and hydrogen are mostly in their molecular forms. assuming this istrue, we derive d/h = (3.6 +1.9 -1.1)x10^-5. this implies that thecorresponding baryon density of the universe is \omega_b h^2 = (0.0182 +0.0047-0.0042). this value coincides within 1\sigma with that derived fromobservations of the cmbr as well as from observations of the d/h atomic ratioin low-metallicity qso absorption line systems. the observation of hd at highredshift is therefore a promising independent method to constrain \omega_b.this observation indicates as well a low astration factor of deuterium. thiscan be interpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gasonto the associated galaxy.

1002.4620	detection of 21-cm, h2 and deuterium absorption at z&gt;3 along the  line-of-sight to j1337+3152	we report the detection of 21-cm and h2 absorption lines in the same dlasystem (log n(hi)=21.36+-0.10) at zabs=3.17447 towards sdssj133724+315254(z=3.174). we estimate the spin temperature of the gas to be, ts~600 k,intermediate between the expected values for cold and warm neutral media. thissuggests that the hi absorption originates from a mixture of different phases.the total molecular fraction is low, f=10^-7, and h2 rotational levelpopulations are not in equilibrium. the average abundance of the alpha-elementsis, [s/h]=-1.45. n and fe are found underabundant with respect toalpha-elements by ~1.0 dex and ~0.5 dex respectively. using photoionizationmodels we conclude that the gas is located more than 270 kpc away from the qso.while the position of 21-cm absorption line coincides with the h2 velocityprofile, their centroid are shifted by 2.7+-1.0 km/s from each other. however,the position of the strongest metal absorption component matches the positionof the 21-cm absorption line within 0.5 km/s. from this, we constrain thevariation of the combination of fundamental constants x=alpha^2 gp/mu, deltax/x=-(1.7+-1.7)x10^-6. this system is unique as we can at the same time have anindependent constrain on mu using h2 lines. however only werner band absorptionlines are seen and the range of sensitivity coefficients is too narrow toprovide a stringent constraint: delta mu/mu &lt;= 4.0x10^-4. the vlt/uves spectrumreveals another dla at zabs=3.16768 with log n(hi)=20.41+-0.15 and lowmetallicity, [si/h]=-2.68+-0.11. we derive log n(di)/n(hi)=-(4.93+-0.15) inthis system. this is a factor of two smaller than the value expected from thebest fitted value of omega_b from the wmap 5 yr data. this confirms thepresence of astration of deuterium even at very low metallicity.

1002.4626	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - i: the  case of the z=2.35 dla towards q2222-0946	we have initiated a survey using the newly commissioned x-shooterspectrograph to target candidate relatively metal-rich damped lyman-alphaabsorbers (dlas). the spectral coverage of x-shooter allows us to search fornot only lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. wehave chosen dlas where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([oii], [oiii],hbeta and halpha) fall in the nir atmospheric transmission bands. in this firstpaper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxycounterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 dla towards the z=2.926 quasar q2222$-0946.this dla is amongst the most metal-rich z&gt;2 dlas studied so far at comparableredshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. we measure metallicities from znii, siii, niii, mniiand feii of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. the galaxy is detected in the lyman-alpha, [oiii]lambda4959,5007 halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8arcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). we infer a star-formation rate of 10 m_sunyr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. compared tothe recently determined halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies thedla-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of l~0.1l^*_halpha. the emission-lineratios are 4.0 (lyalpha/halpha) and 1.2 ([oiii]/halpha). the lyalpha line showsclear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,redshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weakerblueshifted component. the fact that the blueshifted component is relativelyweak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. the properties of the galaxycounterpart of this dla is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich dlasare associated with the most luminous of the dla-galaxy counterparts.

0707.4479	excitation mechanisms in newly discovered h2-bearing damped lyman-alpha  clouds: systems with low molecular fractions	we probe the physical conditions in high-redshift damped ly-alpha systemsusing the observed molecular fraction and the rotational excitation ofmolecular hydrogen. we report two new detections of h2 at z = 2.402 and 1.989toward, respectively, he 0027-1836 and he 2318-1107. we also present a detailedanalysis of our recent h2 detection toward q2343+125. all three systems havelow molecular fractions, log f &lt; -4, with f = 2n(h2)/(2n(h2) + n(hi)). only onesuch h2 system was known previously. the depletion patterns for si, s, ti, cr,mn, fe and ni in the three systems are found to be very similar to what isobserved in diffuse gas of the galactic halo. h2 absorption from rotationallevels up to j = 5 is observed in a single component toward he 0027-1836. weshow that the width (doppler parameter) of the h2 lines increases withincreasing j and that the kinetic energy derived from the doppler parameter islinearly dependent on the relative energy of the rotational levels. theexcitation temperature is found to be 90 k for j = 0 to j = 2 and ~500 k forhigher j levels. single isothermal pdr models fail to reproduce the observedrotational excitations. a two-component model is needed: one component of lowdensity (~50 cm-3) with weak illumination (chi = 1) to explain the j &lt;= 2rotational levels and another of high density (~500 cm-3) with strongillumination (chi = 30) for j &gt;= 3 levels. however, the juxtaposition of thesetwo pdr components may be ad-hoc and the multicomponent structure could resulteither from turbulent dissipation or c-shocks.

1008.0637	a translucent interstellar cloud at z=2.69: co, h2 and hd in the  line-of-sight to sdss j123714.60+064759.5	we present the analysis of a sub-dla system (log n(h^0)=20.0+/-0.15,z_abs=2.69) toward sdss j123714+064759 (z_em=2.78). using the vlt/uves andx-shooter spectrographs, we detect h2, hd and co molecules in absorption withlog n(h2,hd,co)=(19.21,14.48,14.17). the overall metallicity of the system issuper-solar ([zn/h]=+0.34) and iron is highly depleted ([fe/zn]=-1.39),revealing metal-rich and dusty gas. the strongest h2 component does notcoincide with the centre of the hi absorption. this implies that the molecularfraction in this component, f=2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(h^0)), is larger than the meanmolecular fraction &lt;f&gt;=1/4 in the system. this is supported by the detection ofcl^0 associated with this h2-component having n(cl^0)/n(cl^+)&gt;0.4. since cl^0is tied up to h2 by charge exchange reactions, this means that the molecularfraction in this component is not far from unity. the size of the molecularcloud is probably smaller than 1pc. both the co/h2=10^-5 and co/c^0~1 ratiosfor f&gt;0.24 indicate that the cloud classifies as translucent, i.e., a regimewhere carbon is found both in atomic and molecular form. the correspondingextinction, av=0.14, albeit lower than the definition of a translucentsightline (based on extinction properties), is high for the observed h^0 columndensity. this means that intervening clouds with similar local properties butwith larger column densities could be missed by current magnitude-limited qsosurveys. the excitation of co is dominated by radiative interaction with thecosmic microwave background radiation (cmbr) and we derive tex(co)=10.5+0.8-0.6k when tcmbr(z=2.69)=10.05 k is expected. the astration factor of deuterium-with respect to the primordial d/h ratio- is only about 3. this can be theconsequence of accretion of unprocessed gas from the intergalactic medium ontothe associated galaxy.

1011.5312	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - ii. a  solar-metallicity and dusty dla at z_abs=2.58	[abridged]. here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of thez_abs=2.58 dla on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar sdssj091826.16+163609.0. the galaxy counterpart of the dla is detected in the oiii5007 and oii 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the nir at an impactparameter of 16 kpc. ly-alpha emission is not detected. the upper limit impliesthat ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order ofmagnitude. the dla is amongst the most metal-rich dlas studied so far atcomparable redshifts. we find evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. fitting the main metal line component of the dla,which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the totalcolumn density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances fromznii, sii, siii, crii, mnii, feii and niii of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88,-0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. in addition, we detect absorption in thelyman and werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of h_2molecules with x-shooter. the background quasar q0918+1636 is amongst thereddest qsos at redshifts 3.02&lt;z&lt;3.12 from the sdss catalogue. its uv to nirspectrum is well fitted by a composite qso spectrum reddened by smc/lmc-likeextinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction givenby a_v = 0.2 mag. this supports previous claims that there may be moremetal-rich dlas missing from current samples due to dust reddening of thebackground qsos. the fact that there is evidence for dust both in the centralemitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of ly-alpha emission)and at an impact parameter of 16 kpc (as probed by the dla) suggests that dustis widespread in this system.

1011.6156	optical atmospheric extinction over cerro paranal	aims: the present study was conducted to determine the optical extinctioncurve for cerro paranal under typical clear-sky observing conditions, with anaccuracy of 0.01 mag/airmass. methods: the extinction curve of paranal wasobtained through low-resolution spectroscopy of 8 spectrophotometric standardstars observed with fors1 mounted at the 8.2 m very large telescope, covering aspectral range 3300-8000 a. a total of 600 spectra were collected on more than40 nights distributed over six months, from october 2008 to march 2009. theaverage extinction curve was derived using a global fit algorithm, whichallowed us to simultaneously combine all the available data. the mainatmospheric parameters were retrieved using the lblrtm radiative transfer code,which was also utilised to study the impact of variability of the mainmolecular bands of o2, o3, and h2o, and to estimate their column densities.results: in general, the extinction curve of paranal appears to conform tothose derived for other astronomical sites in the atacama desert, like la sillaand cerro tololo. however, a systematic deficit with respect to the extinctioncurve derived for cerro tololo before the el chichon eruption is detected below4000 a. we attribute this downturn to a non standard aerosol composition,probably revealing the presence of volcanic pollutants above the atacamadesert. an analysis of all spectroscopic extinction curves obtained since 1974shows that the aerosol composition has been evolving during the last 35 years.the persistence of traces of non meteorologic haze suggests the effect ofvolcanic eruptions, like those of el chichon and pinatubo, lasts severaldecades. the usage of the standard ctio and la silla extinction curvesimplemented in iraf and midas produce systematic over/under-estimates of theabsolute flux.

1107.4808	partial coverage of the broad line region of q1232+082 by an intervening  h2-bearing cloud	we present a detailed analysis of the partial coverage of the q1232+082 (z_em=2.57) broad line region by an intervening h_2-bearing cloud at z_abs=2.3377.using curve of growth analysis and line profile fitting, we demonstrate thatthe h_2-bearing component of the cloud covers the qso intrinsic continuumsource completely but only part of the broad line region (blr). we find thatonly 48\pm6 % of the c iv blr emission is covered by the c i absorbing gas. weobserve residual light (~6 %) as well in the bottom of the o i {\lambda}1302absorption from the cloud, redshifted on top of the qso lyman-{\alpha} emissionline. therefore the extent of the neutral phase of the absorbing cloud is notlarge enough to cover all of the background source. the most likely explanationfor this partial coverage is the small size of the intervening cloud, which iscomparable to the blr size. we estimate the number densities in the cloud:n_h2~110 cm^{-3} for the h_2-bearing core and n_h ~30 cm^{-3} for the neutralenvelope. given the column densities, n(h2)=(3.71\pm0.97)\times10^19 cm^{-2}and n(h i)=(7.94\pm1.6)\times10^20 cm^{-2}, we derive the linear size of theh_2-bearing core and the neutral envelope along the line of sight to bel_h2~0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.05} pc and l_hi~8.2^{+6.5}_{-4.1} pc, respectively. weestimate the size of the c iv blr by two ways (i) extrapolating size-luminosityrelations derived from reverberation observations and (ii) assuming that theh_2-bearing core and the blr are spherical in shape and the results are ~0.26and ~0.18 pc, respectively. the large size we derive for the extent of theneutral phase of the absorbing cloud together with a covering factor of ~0.94of the lyman-{\alpha} emission means that the lyman-{\alpha} blr is probablyfully covered but that the lyman-{\alpha} emission extends well beyond thelimits of the blr.

1112.1438	search for cold gas in z&gt;2 damped lyman-alpha systems: 21-cm and h_2  absorption	(abridged) we present the results of a systematic gbt and gmrt survey for21-cm absorption in a sample of 10 dlas at 2&lt;z_abs&lt;3.4. analysis of l-band vlbaimages of the background qsos are also presented. we detect 21-cm absorption inonly one dla (at z_abs = 3.1745 towards j1337+3152). combining our data withthe data from the literature (a sample of 28 dlas) and assuming the measuredcore fraction at milliarcsecond scale to represent the gas covering factor, wefind that the hi gas in dlas at z&gt; 2 is predominantly constituted by wnm. thedetection rate of 21-cm absorption seems to be higher for systems with highern(hi) or metallicity. however, no clear correlation is found between theintegrated 21-cm optical depth (or spin temperature) and either n(hi),metallicity or velocity spread of the low ionization species. there are 13 dlasin our sample for which high resolution optical spectra covering the expectedwavelength range of h_2 absorption are available. we report the detection ofh_2 molecules in the z_abs = 3.3871 21-cm absorber towards j0203+1134 (pks0201+113). in 8 cases, neither h_2 nor 21-cm absorption are detected. the lackof 21-cm and h_2 absorption in these systems can be explained if most of the hiin these dlas originate from low density high temperature gas. in one case wehave a dla with 21-cm absorption not showing h_2 absorption. in two cases, bothspecies are detected but do not originate from the same velocity component. inthe remaining 2 cases 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence ofh_2 with evidence for the presence of cold gas. all this is consistent with theidea that the h_2 components seen in dlas are compact (with sizes of &lt; 15 pc)and contain only a small fraction (i.e typically &lt;10%) of the total n(hi)measured in the dlas.

1202.0280	discovery of a compact gas-rich dla galaxy at z = 2.2: evidences for a  starburst-driven outflow	we present the detection of ly-alpha, [oiii] and h-alpha emission associatedwith an extremely strong dla system (n(hi) = 10^22.10 cm^-2) at z=2.207 towardsthe quasar sdss j113520-001053. this is the largest hi column density evermeasured along a qso line of sight, though typical of what is seen in grb-dlas.this absorption system also classifies as ultrastrong mgii system withw2796_r=3.6 a. the mean metallicity of the gas ([zn/h]=-1.1) and dust depletionfactors ([zn/fe]=0.72, [zn/cr]=0.49) are consistent with (and only marginallylarger than) the mean values found in the general qso-dla population. the[oiii]-ha emitting region has a very small impact parameter with respect to theqso line of sight, b=0.1", and is unresolved. from the ha line, we measuresfr=25 msun/yr. the ly-a line is double-peaked and is spatially extended. morestrikingly, the blue and red ly-a peaks arise from distinct regions extendedover a few kpc on either side of the star-forming region. we propose that thisis the consequence of ly-a transfer in outflowing gas. the presence ofstarburst-driven outflows is also in agreement with the large sfr together witha small size and low mass of the galaxy (mvir~10^10 msun). from the stellar uvcontinuum luminosity of the galaxy, we estimate an age of at most a few 10^7yr, again consistent with a recent starburst scenario. we interpret the data asthe observation of a young, gas rich, compact starburst galaxy, from whichmaterial is expelled through collimated winds powered by the vigorous starformation activity. we substantiate this picture by modelling the radiativetransfer of ly-a photons in the galactic counterpart. though our model (aspherical galaxy with bipolar outflowing jets) is a simplistic representationof the true gas distribution and velocity field, the agreement between theobserved and simulated properties is particularly good.

1204.2833	on the sizes of z&gt;2 damped lyman-alpha absorbing galaxies	recently, the number of detected galaxy counterparts of z &gt; 2 dampedlyman-alpha absorbers in qso spectra has increased substantially so that wetoday have a sample of 10 detections. m{\o}ller et al. in 2004 made theprediction, based on a hint of a luminosity-metallicity relation for dlas, thathi size should increase with increasing metallicity. in this paper weinvestigate the distribution of impact parameter and metallicity that wouldresult from the correlation between galaxy size and metallicity. we compare ourobservations with simulated data sets given the relation of size andmetallicity. the observed sample presented here supports the metallicity-sizeprediction: the present sample of dla galaxies is consistent with the modeldistribution. our data also show a strong relation between impact parameter andcolumn density of hi. we furthermore compare the observations with severalnumerical simulations and demonstrate that the observations support a scenariowhere the relation between size and metallicity is driven by feedbackmechanisms controlling the star-formation efficiency and outflow of enrichedgas.

1205.3777	deuterium at high-redshift: primordial abundance in the zabs = 2.621  damped ly-alpha system towards ctq247	the detection of neutral deuterium in the low-metallicity dampedlyman-{\alpha} system at zabs = 2.621 towards the quasar ctq247 is reported.using a high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution (r = 60000) spectrumfrom the very large telescope ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph, weprecisely measure the deuterium-to-oxygen ratio log n(di)/n(oi) = 0.74+/-0.04,as well as the overall oxygen abundance, log n(oi)/n(hi)=-5.29+/-0.10 (orequivalently [o/h]=-1.99+/-0.10 with respect to the solar value). assuminguniform metallicity throughout the system, our measurement translates to (d/h)= (2.8+0.8 -0.6)x10^-5. this ratio is consistent within errors (&lt;0.4sigma) withthe primordial ratio, (d/h)p = (2.59+/-0.15)x10^-5, predicted by standardbig-bang nucleosynthesis using the wmap7 value of the cosmological density ofbaryons (100 omega_b h^2 = 2.249+/-0.056). the di absorption lines are observedto be broader than the oi absorption lines. from a consistent fit of theprofiles we derive the turbulent broadening to be 5.2 km/s and the temperatureof the gas to be t = 8800+/-1500 k, corresponding to a warm neutral medium.

1207.1193	optical/near-infrared selection of red qsos: evidence for steep  extinction curves towards galactic centers?	we present the results of a search for red qsos using a selection based onoptical imaging from sdss and near-infrared imaging from ukidss. for a sampleof 58 candidates 46 (79%) are confirmed to be qsos. the qsos are predominantlydust-reddened except a handul at redshifts z&gt;3.5. the dust is most likelylocated in the qso host galaxies. 4 (7%) of the candidates turned out to belate-type stars, and another 4 (7%) are compact galaxies. the remaining 4objects we could not identify. in terms of their optical spectra the qsos aresimilar to the qsos selected in the first-2mass red quasar survey except theyare on average fainter, more distant and only two are detected in the firstsurvey. we estimate the amount of extinction using the sdss qso templatereddened by smc-like dust. it is possible to get a good match to the observed(restframe ultraviolet) spectra, but for nearly all the reddened qsos it is notpossible to match the near-ir photometry from ukidss. the likely reasons arethat the sdss qso template is too red at optical wavelengths due tocontaminating host galaxy light and that the assumed smc extinction curve istoo shallow. our survey has demonstrated that selection of qsos based onnear-ir photometry is an efficent way to select qsos, including reddened qsos,with only small contamination from late-type stars and compact galaxies. thiswill be useful with ongoing and future wide-field near-ir surveys such as thevista and euclid surveys.

1207.6088	galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z sub-dlas/dlas and mgii  absorbers towards gamma-ray bursts	we present the first search for galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z(2&lt;z&lt; 3.6) sub-dlas and dlas towards grbs. our final sample comprises of fiveintervening sub-dlas and dlas in four grb fields. to identify candidate galaxycounterparts of the absorbers we use deep optical and near-infrared imaging,and low-, mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy acquired with 6 to 10-m classtelescopes, the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes. furthermore, we usethe spectroscopic information and spectral-energy-distribution fittingtechniques to study them in detail. our main result is the detection andspectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy counterpart of the intervening dla atz=3.096 in the field of grb 070721b (z_grb=3.6298) as proposed by otherauthors. we also identify good candidates for the galaxy counterparts of thetwo strong mgii absorbers at z=0.6915 and 1.4288 towards grb 050820a(z_grb=2.615). the properties of the detected dla galaxy are typical forlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at similar redshifts; a young, highly starforminggalaxy that shows evidence for a galactic outflow. this supports the hypothesisthat a dla can be the gaseous halo of an lbg. in addition, we report a redshiftcoincidence of different objects associated with metal lines in the same field,separated by 130-161 kpc. the high detection rate of three correlatedstructures on a length scale as small as ~150 kpc in two pairs of lines ofsight is intriguing. the absorbers in each of these are most likely not part ofthe same gravitationally bound structure. they more likely represent groups ofgalaxies.

1207.6102	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of super iron-rich gas exposed  to grb 080310. evidence of ionization in action and episodic star formation  in the host	we analyse high-resolution near-uv and optical spectra of the afterglow ofgrb 080310, obtained with the very large telescope ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (vlt/uves), to investigate the circumburst environment andthe interstellar medium of the gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxy. the vltrapid-response mode (rrm) enabled the observations to start only 13 minutesafter the swift trigger and a series of four exposures to be collected beforedawn. a low neutral-hydrogen column-density (log n (hi) = 18.7) is measured atthe host-galaxy redshift of z = 2.42743. at this redshift, we also detect alarge number of resonance ground-state absorption lines (e.g., cii, mgii, alii,siii, crii, civ, siiv), as well as time-varying absorption from thefine-structure levels of feii. time-varying absorption from a highly excitedfeiii energy level (7s3), giving rise to the so-called uv34 line triplet, isalso detected, for the first time in a grb afterglow. the crii ground-state andall observed feii energy levels are found to depopulate with time, whilst thefeiii 7s3 level is increasingly populated. this absorption-line variability isclear evidence of ionization by the grb, which is for the first timeconclusively observed in a grb afterglow spectrum. we derive ionic columndensities at each epoch of observations by fitting absorption lines with afour-component voigt-profile model. we perform cloudy photo-ionizationmodelling of the expected pre-burst ionic column densities, to estimate that,before the onset of the burst, [c/h] = -1.3 \pm 0.2, [o/h] &lt; -0.8, [si/h] =-1.2 \pm 0.2, [cr/h] = +0.7 \pm 0.2, and [fe/h] = +0.2 \pm 0.2 for theintegrated line profile, indicating strong overabundances of iron and chromium.for one of the components, we observe even more extreme ratios of [si/fe] \leq-1.47 and [c/fe] \leq -1.74.

1209.1506	time-dependent excitation and ionization modelling of absorption-line  variability due to grb 080310	we model the time-variable absorption of feii, feiii, siii, cii and criidetected in uves spectra of grb 080310, with the afterglow radiation excitingand ionizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at a redshift ofz=2.42743. to estimate the rest-frame afterglow brightness as a function oftime, we use a combination of the optical vri photometry obtained by theraptor-t telescope array -- which are presented in this paper -- and swift'sx-ray telescope observations. excitation alone, which has been successfullyapplied for a handful of other grbs, fails to describe the observedcolumn-density evolution in the case of grb 080310. inclusion of ionization isrequired to explain the column-density decrease of all observed feii levels(including the ground state 6d9/2) and increase of the feiii 7s3 level. thelarge population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all feiii) can onlybe explained through ionization of feii, whereby a large fraction of theionized feii ions -- we calculate 31% using the flexible atomic (fac) and cowancodes -- initially populate the 7s3 level of feiii rather than the groundstate. this channel for producing a significant feiii 7s3 level population maybe relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level -- theuv34 triplet -- are observed, such as bal quasars and eta carinae. thisprovides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburstmedium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. however, the best-fitdistance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the grb is 200--400 pc, i.e. similarto grb-absorber distance estimates for grbs without any evidence forionization. we find that the presence of time-varying ionization in grb 080310is likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([fe/h]=+0.2)and the low hi column density (log n(hi)=18.7).

1301.5013	mass-metallicity relation from z=5 to the present: evidence for a  transition in the mode of galaxy growth at z=2.6 due to the end of sustained  primordial gas infall	we analyze the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation in asample of 110 damped ly$\alpha$ absorbers spanning the redshift range$z=0.11-5.06$ and find that the zero-point of the correlation changessignificantly with redshift. the evolution is such that the zero-point isconstant at the early phases of galaxy growth (i.e. no evolution) but thenfeatures a sharp break at $z=2.6\pm 0.2$ with a rapid incline towards lowerredshifts such that damped absorbers of identical masses are more metal rich atlater times than earlier. the slope of this mass metallicity correlationevolution is $0.35 \pm 0.07$ dex per unit redshift.  we compare this result to similar studies of the redshift evolution ofemission selected galaxy samples and find a remarkable agreement with the slopeof the evolution of galaxies of stellar mass log$(m_{*}/m_\odot) \approx 8.5$.this allows us to form an observational tie between damped absorbers andgalaxies seen in emission.  we use results from simulations to infer the virial mass of the dark matterhalo of a typical dla galaxy and find a ratio $(m_{vir}/m_{*}) \approx 30$.  we compare our results to those of several other studies that have reportedstrong transition-like events at redshifts around $z=2.5-2.6$ and argue thatall those observations can be understood as the consequence of a transitionfrom a situation where galaxies were fed more unprocessed infalling gas thanthey could easily consume to one where they suddenly become infall starved andturn to mainly processing, or re-processing, of previously acquired gas.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1305.1153	dust-to-metal ratios in damped lyman-alpha absorbers: fresh clues to the  origins of dust and optical extinction towards gamma-ray bursts	motivated by the anomalous dust-to-metal ratios derived in the literature forgamma-ray burst (grb) damped lyman-alpha absorbers (dlas), we measure theseratios using the dust-depletion pattern observed in uv/optical afterglowspectra associated with the ism at the grb host-galaxy redshifts. our sampleconsists of 20 grb absorbers and a comparison sample of 72 qso-dlas withredshift 1.2 &lt; z &lt; 4.0 and down to z = 0.002 z_sol metallicities. thedust-to-metal ratio in qso- and grb-dlas increases both with metallicity andmetal column density, spanning ~10--110% of the galactic value and pointing toa non universal dust-to-metal ratio. the low values of dust-to-metal ratiosuggest that low-metallicity systems have lower dust fractions than typicalspiral galaxies and perhaps that the dust in these systems is producedinefficiently, i.e. by grain growth in the low-metallicity regime withnegligible contribution from supernovae (sne) and asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars. on the other hand, some grb- and qso-dlas show high dust-to-metal ratiovalues out to z ~ 4, requiring rapid dust production, such as in sn ejecta, butalso in agb winds and via grain growth for the highest metallicity systems.grb-dlas overall follow the dust-to-metal-ratio properties of qso-dlas, grbsprobing up to larger column and volume densities. for comparison, thedust-to-metal ratio that we derive for the smc and lmc are ~82--100% and ~98%of the galactic value, respectively. the literature dust-to-metal ratio of thelow-metallicity galaxy i zw 18 (&lt; 37%) is consistent with the distribution thatwe find. the dust extinction av increases steeply with the column density ofiron in dust, n(fe)dust, calculated from relative metal abundances, confirmingthat dust extinction is mostly occurring in the host galaxy ism. most grb-dlasdisplay log n(fe)dust &gt; 14.7, above which several qso-dlas reveal h2(abridged).

1306.2940	the galaxy counterparts of the two high-metallicity dlas at z=2.412 and  z=2.583 towards q0918+1636	the quasar q0918+1636 (z=3.07) has two intervening high-metallicity dampedlyman-alpha absorbers (dlas) along the line of sight, at redshifts of z=2.412and 2.583. the z=2.583 dla is located at a large impact parameter of 16.2 kpc,and despite this large impact parameter it has a very high metallicity(consistent with solar), a substantial fraction of h_2 molecules, and it isdusty as inferred from the reddened spectrum of the background qso. the z=2.412dla has a metallicity of [m/h]=-0.6 (based on znii and siii). in this paper wepresent new observations of this interesting sightline. hst/wfc3 imaging wasobtained in the f606w, f105w and f160w bands. this is complemented byground-based imaging in the u-, g-bands as well as k_s observations in thenear-infrared (nir). in addition, we present further spectroscopy with theeso/vlt x-shooter spectrograph. based on these observations we obtain thefollowing results: by fitting stellar population synthesis models to thephotometric sed we constrain the physical properties of the z=2.583 dla galaxy,and we infer its morphology by fitting a sersic model to its surface brightnessprofile. we find it to be a relatively massive (m_star 10^10 m_sun), stronglystar-forming (sfr~30 m_sun / yr, dusty (e_(b-v)=0.4) galaxy with a disk-likemorphology. we detect most of the strong emission lines from the z=2.583 dla[oiii],3727, [oiii],4960, [oiii],5007, hbeta, and halpha, albeit at lowsignal-to-noise (sn) ratio except for the [oiii],5007 line. we also detect[oiii],5007 emission from the galaxy counterpart of the z=2.412 dla at a smallimpact parameter (&lt;2 kpc). overall our findings are consistent with theemerging picture that high-metallicity dlas are associated with relatively(compared to typical dlas) luminous and massive galaxy counterparts.

[o/h] = -1.63(0.07) and [zn/h] = - 0.57(0.05) relative tosolar). while the depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains in bothsub-dlas is not noteworthy, photoionization models show that ionization effectsare important in a part of the absorbing gas of the sub-dla at z_abs = 1.6359(hi is 95 percent ionized) and in part of the gas of the sub-dla at z_abs =1.6359. the civ clustering properties along the line of sight is studied inorder to investigate the nature of the observed overdensity. we conclude thatdespite the unusually high number of civ systems detected along the line ofsight, there is no compelling evidence for the presence of a single unusualoverdensity and that the situation is consistent with chance coincidence.

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1501.07165	neutral chlorine and molecular hydrogen at high redshift	chlorine and molecular hydrogen are known to be tightly linked together inthe cold phase of the local interstellar medium through rapid chemicalreactions. we present here the first systematic study of this relation at highredshifts using h$_2$-bearing damped ly$\alpha$ systems (dlas) detected alongquasar lines of sight. using high-resolution spectroscopic data from vlt/uvesand keck/hires, we report the detection of cl$\,$i in 9 dlas (including 5 newdetections) out of 18 high-$z$ dlas with $n($h$_2) \ge 10^{17.3}\,$cm$^{-2}$(including a new h$_2$ detection at $z=3.09145$ towards j$\,$2100$-$0641) andpresent upper limits for the remaining 9 systems. we find a $\sim$5$\,\sigma$correlation between $n$(cl$\,$i) and $n$(h$_2$) with only $\sim$0.2$\,$dexdispersion over the range 18.1$\,&lt;\,$log$\,n$(h$_2$)$\,&lt;\,$20.1, thus probingcolumn densities 10 times lower those seen towards nearby stars, roughlyfollowing the relation $n$(cl$\,$i$) \approx 1.5\times10^{-6} \times n($h$_2)$.this relation between column densities is surprisingly the same at low and highredshift suggesting that the physical and chemical conditions are similar for agiven h$_2$ (or cl$\,$i) column density. in turn, the $n({cl$\,$i})/n({\rmh_2})$ ratio is found to be uncorrelated with the overall metallicity in thedla. our results confirm that neutral chlorine is an excellent tracer ofmolecule-rich gas and show that the molecular fraction or/and metallicity inthe h$_2$-bearing component of dla could possibly be much higher than theline-of-sight average values usually measured in dlas.

1501.07210	partial covering of emission regions of q 0528-250 by intervening h$_2$  clouds	we present an analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption system at z$_{\rmabs}$ = 2.811 in the spectrum of the blazar q0528-250. we demonstrate that themolecular cloud does not cover the background source completely. the partialcoverage reveals itself as a residual flux in the bottom of saturated h_2absorption lines. this amounts to about (2.22$\pm$0.54)% of the continuum anddoes not depend on the wavelength. this value is small and it explains why thiseffect has not been detected in previous studies of this quasar spectrum.however, it is robustly detected and significantly higher than the zero fluxlevel in the bottom of saturated lines of the ly-alpha forest,(-0.21$\pm$0.22)%. the presence of the residual flux could be caused byunresolved quasar multicomponents, by light scattered by dust, and/or byjet-cloud interaction. the h$_2$ absorption system is very well described by atwo-component model without inclusion of additional components when we takepartial coverage into account. the derived total column densities in the h$_2$absorption components a and b are logn(h$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$] = 18.10$\pm$0.02 and17.82$\pm$0.02, respectively. hd molecules are present only in component b.given the column density, logn(hd)= 13.33$\pm$0.02, we findn(hd)/2n(h$_2$)=(1.48$\pm$0.10)x10$^{-5}$, significantly lower than previousestimations. we argue that it is crucial to take into account partial coverageeffects for any analysis of h$_2$ bearing absorption systems, in particularwhen studying the physical state of high-redshift interstellar medium.

1502.03921	vlt/uves observations of extremely strong intervening damped lyman-alpha  systems: molecular hydrogen and excited carbon, oxygen and silicon at log  n(hi)=22.4	we present a detailed analysis of three extremely strong intervening dlas(log n(hi)&gt;=21.7) observed towards quasars with vlt/uves. we measure overallmetallicities of [zn/h]~-1.2, -1.3 and -0.7 at respectively zabs=2.34 towardssdss j2140-0321 (log n(hi) = 22.4+/-0.1), zabs=3.35 towards sdss j1456+1609(log n(hi) = 21.7+/-0.1) and zabs=2.25 towards sdss j0154+1935 (log n(hi) =21.75+/-0.15). we detect h2 towards j2140-0321 (log n(h2) = 20.13+/-0.07) andj1456+1609 (log n(h2) = 17.10+/-0.09) and argue for a tentative detectiontowards j0154+1935. absorption from the excited fine-structure levels of oi, ciand siii are detected in the system towards j2140-0321, that has the largest hicolumn density detected so far in an intervening dla. this is the firstdetection of oi fine-structure lines in a qso-dla, that also provides us a rarepossibility to study the chemical abundances of less abundant atoms like co andge. simple single phase photo-ionisation models fail to reproduce all theobserved quantities. instead, we suggest that the cloud has a stratifiedstructure: h2 and ci likely originate from both a dense (log nh~2.5-3) cold(80k) and warm (250k) phase containing a fraction of the total hi while awarmer (t&gt;1000 k) phase probably contributes significantly to the highexcitation of oi fine-structure levels. the observed ci/h2 column density ratiois surprisingly low compared to model predictions and we do not detect comolecules: this suggests a possible underabundance of c by 0.7 dex compared toother alpha elements. the absorber could be a photo-dissociation region closeto a bright star (or a star cluster) where higher temperature occurs in theilluminated region. direct detection of on-going star formation through e.g.nir emission lines in the surrounding of the gas would enable a detailedphysical modelling of the system.

1510.04695	a quasar reddened by a sub-parsec sized, metal-rich and dusty cloud in a  damped lyman-alpha absorber at z=2.13	we present a detailed analysis of a red quasar at z=2.32 with an interveningdamped lyman-alpha absorber (dla) at z=2.13. using high quality data from thex-shooter spectrograph at eso very large telescope we find that the absorberhas a metallicity consistent with solar. we observe strong c i and h$_2$absorption indicating a cold, dense absorbing medium. partial coverage effectsare observed in the c i lines, from which we infer a covering fraction of $27\pm 6$ % and a physical diameter of the cloud of 0.1 pc. from the coveringfraction and size, we estimate the size of the background quasar's broad lineregion. we search for emission from the dla counterpart in optical andnear-infrared imaging. no emission is observed in the optical data. however, wesee tentative evidence for a counterpart in the h and k' band images. the dlashows high depletion (as probed by [fe/zn]=-1.22) indicating that significantamounts of dust must be present in the dla. by fitting the spectrum withvarious dust reddened quasar templates we find a best-fitting amount of dust inthe dla of $a(v)_{\rm dla}=0.28 \pm 0.01|_{\rm stat} \pm 0.07|_{\rm sys}$. weconclude that dust in the dla is causing the colours of this intrinsically veryluminous background quasar to appear much redder than average quasars, therebynot fulfilling the criteria for quasar identification in the sloan digital skysurvey. such chemically enriched and dusty absorbers are thus underrepresentedin current samples of dlas.

astro-ph;0306403	on the ly-alpha emission from gamma-ray burst host galaxies: evidence  for low metallicities	we report on the results of a search for ly-alpha emission from the hostgalaxy of the z=2.140 grb 011211 and other galaxies in its surrounding field.we detect ly-alpha emission from the host as well as from six other galaxies inthe field. the restframe equivalent width of the ly-alpha line from the grb011211 host is about 21 aa. this is the fifth detection of ly-alpha emissionout of five possible detections from grb host galaxies, strongly indicatingthat grb hosts, at least at high redshifts, are ly-alpha emitters. this isintriguing as only about 25% of the lyman-break selected galaxies at similarredshifts have ly-alpha emission lines with restframe equivalent width largerthan 20 aa. possible explanations are i) a preference for grb progenitors to bemetal-poor as expected in the collapsar model, ii) an optical afterglowselection bias against dusty hosts, and iii) a higher fraction of ly-alphaemitters at the faint end of the luminosity function for high-z galaxies. ofthese, the current evidence seems to favour i).

astro-ph;0403080	the host of grb 030323 at z=3.372: a very high column density dla system  with a low metallicity	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow of grb 030323. vltspectra of the afterglow show damped lya (dla) absorption and low- andhigh-ionization lines at a redshift z=3.3718+-0.0005. the inferred neutralhydrogen column density, log n(hi)=21.90+-0.07, is larger than any (grb- orqso-) dla hi column density inferred directly from lya in absorption. from theafterglow photometry, we derive a conservative upper limit to the host-galaxyextinction: a(v)&lt;0.5 mag. the iron abundance is [fe/h]=-1.47+-0.11, while themetallicity of the gas as measured from sulphur is [s/h]=-1.26+-0.20. we derivean upper limit on the h2 molecular fraction of 2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(hi))&lt;~10^-6. inthe lya trough, a lya emission line is detected, which corresponds to astar-formation rate (not corrected for dust extinction) of roughly 1 msun peryear. all these results are consistent with the host galaxy of grb 030323consisting of a low metallicity gas with a low dust content. we detectfine-structure lines of silicon, siii*, which have never been clearly detectedin qso-dlas; this suggests that these lines are produced in the vicinity of thegrb explosion site. under the assumption that these fine-structure levels arepopulated by particle collisions, we estimate the hi volume density to ben_hi=100-10000 cm^-3. hst/acs imaging 4 months after the burst shows anextended ab(f606w)=28.0+-0.3 mag object at a distance of 0.14" (1kpc) from theearly afterglow location, which presumably is the host galaxy of grb 030323.

astro-ph;0407439	the line-of-sight towards grb 030429 at z = 2.66: probing the matter at  stellar, galactic and intergalactic scales	we report the discovery of the optical afterglow (oa) of the long-durationgamma-ray burst grb 030429, and present a comprehensive optical/near-infrareddataset used to probe the matter at different distance scales, i.e. in theburst environment, in the host galaxy and in an intervening absorber. a breakin the afterglow light curve is seen approximately 1 day from the onset of theburst. the light curve displays a significant deviation from a simple brokenpower-law with a bright 1.5 magnitude bump with a duration of 2-3 days. theoptical/near-infrared spectral energy distribution is best fit with a power-lawwith index beta = -0.36 +/- 0.12 reddened by an smc-like extinction law with (amodest) a_v = 0.34 +/- 0.04. in addition, we present deep spectroscopicobservations obtained with the very large telescope. the redshift measured viametal absorption lines in the oa is z = 2.658 +/- 0.004. based on the dampedly-alpha absorption line in the oa spectrum we measure the hi column density tobe log n(hi) = 21.6 +/- 0.2. this confirms the trend that grbs tend to belocated behind very large hi column densities. the resulting dust-to-gas ratiois consistent with that found in the smc, indicating a low metallicity and/or alow dust-to-metal ratio in the burst environment. we find that a neighbouringgalaxy, at a separation of only 1.2", has z = 0.841 +/- 0.001, ruling it out asthe host of grb 030429. the small impact parameter of this nearby galaxy, whichis responsible for mgii absorption in the oa spectrum, is in contrast toprevious identifications of most qso absorption-selected galaxy counterparts.finally, we demonstrate that the oa was not affected by strong gravitationallensing via the nearby galaxy.

astro-ph;0504402	the mass-metallicity relation for high-redshift damped ly-alpha galaxies	we used our database of eso vlt-uves spectra of quasars to build up a sampleof 67 damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems with redshifts 1.7&lt;zabs&lt;3.7. for eachsystem, we measured average metallicities relative to solar, [x/h] (with eitherx=zn, s or si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, w1. wefind that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected atthe 5sigma significance level. the existence of such a correlation, over morethan two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be theconsequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxiesresponsible for dla absorption lines. the best-fit linear relation is[x/h]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log w1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with w1 expressed in km/s. whilethe slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same withinuncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation withdecreasing redshift. this suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend tobecome more metal-rich with time. moreover, the slope of this relation isconsistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.the dla systems having the lowest metallicities among the dla population wouldtherefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. inturn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the dla galaxypopulation. this may explain the recent result that the few dla systems withdetected ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.

astro-ph;0504657	evidence for a magnitude-dependent bias in the hamburg/eso survey for  damped lyman-alpha systems	we present preliminary results from the hamburg/eso survey for dampedly-alpha (hereafter, dla) systems. this survey is characterized by (i) the goodknowledge of the biases affecting the parent qso survey, (ii) the brightnessand (iii) the relatively wide magnitude distribution of the background qsos.therefore, it is well-suited to study possible magnitude-dependent biases indla surveys, such as the one expected from dust obscuration. we havesystematically searched for damped lyman-alpha line candidates in 5 aresolution spectra of the 188 qsos that constitute our statistical sample.these candidates have later been reobserved with uves at the eso--very largetelescope (vlt) for confirmation and accurate n(hi) measurements. in theredshift range covered by the survey, 19 dla systems have been discovered. overthe whole survey, we find that the number density, n(z), and cosmologicaldensity of gas, omega_gas, have comparable values to the ones obtained bycorals (ellison et al. 2001). however, the number densities of dla systems n(z)in two sub-samples of equal absorption distance path defined by the magnitudeof the background qsos differ by a factor of about 5. we estimate that theprobability that n(z) is equal in the two sub-samples is &lt; 0.003. a similar,only slightly less significant difference is found for omega_gas.

astro-ph;0505477	tracing large-scale structure at high redshift with lyman-alpha  emitters: the effect of peculiar velocities	we investigate the effect of peculiar velocities on the redshift spacedistribution of z&gt;~2 galaxies, and we focus in particular on ly-alpha emitters.we generate catalogues of dark matter (dm) halos and identify emitters withhalos of the same co-moving space density (m(ly-alpha emitters) ~ 3x10^11m_sun). we decompose the peculiar velocity field of halos into streaming,gradient and random components, and compute and analyse these as a function ofscale. streaming velocities are determined by fluctuations on very largescales, strongly affected by sample variance, but have a modest impact on theinterpretation of observations. gradient velocities are the most important asthey distort structures in redshift space, changing the thickness andorientation of sheets and filaments. random velocities are typically below orof the same order as the typical observational uncertainty on the redshift. wediscuss the importance of these effects for the interpretation of data on thelarge-scale structure as traced by ly-alpha emitters (or similar kinds ofastrophysical high-redshift objects), focusing on the induced errors in theviewing angles of filaments. we compare our predictions of velocity patternsfor ly-alpha emitters to observations and find that redshift clumping ofly-alpha emitters, as reported for instance in the fields of high-redshiftradio galaxies, does not allow to infer whether an observed field is samplingan early galaxy overdensity.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

(2003). we show that thefraction of dla systems with logf=log 2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(hi))&gt;-4 is as large as50% for [x/h]&gt;-0.7 when it is only about 5% for [x/h]&lt;-1.3 and about 15% in theoverall sample (with -2.5&lt;[x/h]&lt;-0.3). this demonstrates that the presence ofmolecular hydrogen at high redshift is strongly correlated with metallicity.

astro-ph;0609450	hi column densities of z &gt; 2 swift gamma-ray bursts	context: before the launch of the swift satellite, the majority of thegamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows for which ly-alpha was redshifted into theobservable spectrum showed evidence for a damped ly-alpha absorber. this smallsample indicated that grbs explode either in galaxies, or regions within them,having high neutral hydrogen column densities.  aims: to increase the spectroscopic sample of grbs with z &gt; 2 and henceestablish the n(hi) distribution along grb lines-of-sight.  methods: we have obtained six z &gt; 2 grb afterglow spectra and fitted thely-alpha absorption line in each case to determine n(hi). this has beencomplemented with 12 other swift n(hi) values from the literature.  results: we show that the peak of the grb n(hi) distribution is qualitativelyconsistent with a model where grbs originate in galactic-like molecular clouds.however, a systematic difference, in particular an excess of low column-densitysystems compared to the predictions, indicates that selection effects andconditions within the cloud (e.g. strong ionization) influence the observedn(hi) range. we also report the discovery of ly-alpha emission from the grb060714 host, corresponding to a star-formation rate of approximately 0.8m_sun/year. finally, we present accurate redshifts of the six bursts: z = 3.240+/- 0.001 (grb 050319), z = 2.198 +/- 0.002 (grb 050922c), z = 3.221 +/- 0.001(grb 060526), z = 3.425 +/- 0.002 (grb 060707), z = 2.711 +/- 0.001 (grb060714) and z = 3.686 +/- 0.002 (grb 060906).

astro-ph;0611690	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of grb060418: conclusive  evidence for uv pumping from the time evolution of feii and niii excited- and  metastable-level populations	we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of grb060418, obtainedwith vlt/uves. these observations were triggered using the vlt rapid responsemode (rrm), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena,without any human intervention. this resulted in the first uves exposure ofgrb060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial swift satellitetrigger. a sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25,41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7km/s, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-15. this time-series clearly showsevidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving feiifine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both feii and niii, at thehost-galaxy redshift z=1.490. this is the first report of absorption linesarising from metastable levels of feii and niii along any grb sightline. wemodel the observed evolution of the level populations with three differentexcitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, andfluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. our data allow us toreject the collisional and ir excitation scenarios with high confidence. the uvpumping model, in which the grb afterglow uv photons excite a cloud of atomswith a column density n, distance d, and doppler broadening parameter b,provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log n(feii)=14.75+0.06-0.04,log n(niii)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see appendix a), and b=25+/-3km/s. the success of our uv pumping modeling implies that no significant amountof feii or niii is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratumin appendix a), most likely because it is ionized by the grb x-ray/uv flash.because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than feii and niii, thisminimum distance also applies to any hi present.

astro-ph;0701034	the nature of the dwarf starforming galaxy associated with grb 060218 /  sn2006aj	we present high resolution vlt uves and low resolution fors opticalspectroscopy of supernova 2006aj and its host galaxy, associated with thenearby (z = 0.03342) gamma-ray burst grb 060218. this host galaxy is a uniquecase, as it is one of the few nearby grb host galaxies known, and it is onlythe second time high resolution spectra have been taken of a nearby grb hostgalaxy (after grb 980425). the resolution, wavelength range and s/n of the uvesspectrum combined with low resolution fors spectra allow a detailed analysis ofthe circumburst and host galaxy environments. we analyse the emission andabsorption lines in the spectrum, combining the high resolution uves spectrumwith low resolution fors spectra and find the metallicity and chemicalabundances in the host. we probe the geometry of the host by studying theemission line profiles. our spectral analysis shows that the star formingregion in the host is metal poor with 12 + log(o/h) = 7.54 (+0.17, -0.10)(~0.07 z_sun), placing it among the most metal deficient subset ofemission-line galaxies. it is also the lowest metallicity found so far for agrb host from an emission-line analysis. given the stellar mass of the galaxyof ~10^7 m_sun and the sfr (h alpha) = 0.065 +/- 0.005 m_sun/yr, the highspecific star formation rate indicates an age for the galaxy of less than ~200myr. the brightest emission lines are clearly asymmetric and are well fit bytwo gaussian components separated by ~22$ km/s. we detect two discrete na i andca ii absorption components at the same redshifts as the emission components.we tentatively interpret the two components as arising from two differentstarforming regions in the host, but high resolution imaging is necessary toconfirm this.

astro-ph;0703218	physical conditions in the neutral interstellar medium at z=2.43 toward  q2348-011	we obtained a high-resolution vlt-uves spectrum of the quasar q2348-011 overa wavelength range that covers most of the prominent metal and molecularabsorption lines from the log n(hi)=20.50+-0.10 damped lyman-alpha system atzabs=2.43. from the column density ratios and the relative populations of h2rotational and ci fine-structure levels, we derive the physical conditions(relative abundances, dust-depletion, particle density, kinetic temperature andionizing flux) and discuss physical conditions in the neutral phase. molecularhydrogen is detected in seven components in the first four rotational levels (j= 0-3) of the vibrational ground state. absorption lines of h2 j = 4 (resp. j =5) are also detected in six (resp. two) of these components. this leads to atotal molecular fraction of log f = -1.69+0.37-0.58. we confirm the earlierfindings that there is a correlation between n(feii)/n(sii) and n(siii)/n(sii)indicative of a dust-depletion pattern. surprisingly, however, the depletion ofmetals onto dust in the h2 components is not large in this system: [fe/s] =-0.8 to -0.1. the gas in h2-bearing components is found to be cold but stillhotter than similar gas in our galaxy (t &gt; 130 k, instead of typically 80 k).and dense (n=100-200 cm^-3). there is an anti-correlation between the logarithmof the photo-absorption rate, and log n(h2)/n(ci) derived for each h2component. we show that this is mostly due to shielding effects and impliesthat the photo- absorption rate is a good indicator of the physical conditionsin the gas. we find that the gas is immersed in a intense uv field, about oneorder of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity. the results suggest thatthe gas in h2-bearing dlas is clumpy, and star-formation occurs in theassociated object.

astro-ph;9806202	on the kinematics of damped lyman-alpha systems	we report on high spectral resolution observations of five damped ly-alphaabsorbers. line velocity profiles and heavy element abundances are discussed.nitrogen is found to have abundances less than silicon in the systems toward q0347-383, q 0913+072, and q 1213+093. the absorber toward q 0913+072 is themost metal-deficient damped system known, with [fe/h] &lt; -3.2. the simplekinematical structure of the metal absorptions makes this system ideal todiscuss the [o/si] and [n/o] ratios. we find [o/h] ~ -2.7 and -2.7 &lt; [si/h] &lt;-2.2. by combining these data with information gathered in the literature, westudy the kinematics of the low and high ionization phases in a sample of 26damped ly-alpha systems in the redshift range 1.17-4.38. we note a strongcorrelation between the velocity broadenings of the siii,1808 and feii,1608lines whatever the line optical depth, implying that the physical conditionsare quite homogeneous in the sample. statistically this shows that largevariations of abundance ratios and thus large variations of depletion into dustgrains are unlikely. the velocity broadening of the absorption lines, delta v,is correlated with the asymmetry of the lines for delta v &lt; 150 km/s. thebroader the line the more asymmetric it is, as expected in case rotationdominates the line broadening. however this correlation does not hold forlarger delta v suggesting that evidence for rotational motions is restricted tovelocity broadenings delta v &lt; 150 km/s. the systems with delta v &gt; 200 km/sare peculiar with kinematics consistent with random motions. they showsub-systems as those expected if the objects are in the process of merging(abridged).

astro-ph;9810140	adaptive optics imaging and integral field spectroscopy of apm  08279+5255: evidence for gravitational lensing	we report observations of the z = 3.87 broad absorption line quasar apm08279+5255 (irwin et al. 1998) with the adaptive optics bonnette (aob) of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope. the object is found to be a double source. theseparation of the two images is 0.35" +/- 0.02" and the intensity ratioi_{north}/i_{south} = 1.21 +/- 0.25 in the h-band. no other image is detecteddown to h(5sigma) = 21.3 within 10" from the double image. strong support forthe lensing hypothesis comes from the uniformity of the quasar spectrum as afunction of spatial position in the image obtained with the integral fieldspectrograph oasis at cfht. from the 2d-spectroscopy, narrow-band images arereconstructed over the wavelength range 5600-6200a to search for emission-lineobjects in a field of 15"x12" around the quasar. we find no such object to alimit of 6x10^{-17} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. we use the images centered on thedeepest absorption lines of the ly-alpha forest to dim the quasar and toincrease the sensitivity closer to the line of sight. one of the images,centered at 5766.4a, exhibits a 3sigma excess 1.5" from the quasar to thenorth-east.

0809.3785	hd molecules at high redshift: a low astration factor of deuterium in a  solar-metallicity dla system at z=2.418	we present the detection of deuterated molecular hydrogen (hd) in the remoteuniverse in a damped lyman-alpha cloud at zabs=2.418 toward the quasar sdssj143912.04+111740.5. this is a unique system in which h2 and co molecules arealso detected. the chemical enrichment of this gas derived from znii and sii isas high as in the sun. we measure n(hd)/2 n(h2)=1.5+0.6-0.4 x 10^-5, which issignificantly higher than the same ratio measured in the galaxy and close tothe primordial d/h ratio estimated from the wmap constraint on the baryonicmatter density omega_b. this indicates a low astration factor of deuterium thatcontrasts with the unusually high chemical enrichment of the gas. this can beinterpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gas onto theassociated galaxy. detection of hd molecules at high-z also opens thepossibility to obtain an independent constraint on the cosmological-timevariability of mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio.

0810.2897	dust extinction in high-z galaxies with grb afterglow spectroscopy - the  2175{\aa} feature at z=2.45	we report the clear detection of the 2175a dust absorption feature in theoptical afterglow spectrum of the gamma-ray burst (grb) grb070802 at a redshiftof z=2.45. this is the highest redshift for a detected 2175a dust bump to date,and it is the first clear detection of the 2175a bump in a grb host galaxy,while several tens of optical afterglow spectra without the bump have beenrecorded in the past decade. the derived extinction curve gives a_v=0.8-1.5depending on the assumed intrinsic slope. of the three local extinction laws,an lmc type extinction gives the best fit to the extinction curve of the hostof grb070802. besides the 2175a bump we find that the spectrum of grb070802 ischaracterized by unusually strong low-ionization metal lines and possibly ahigh metallicity for a grb sightline ([si/h]=-0.46+/-0.38,[zn/h]=-0.50+/-0.68). in particular, the spectrum of grb070802 is unique for agrb spectrum in that it shows clear ci absorption features, leading us topropose a correlation between the presence of the bump and ci. the gas to dustratio for the host galaxy is found to be significantly lower than that of othergrb hosts with n(hi)/a_v=(2.4+/-1.0)x10^21 cm^-2 mag^-1, which lies betweentypical mw and lmc values. our results are in agreement with the tentativeconclusion reached by gordon et al. 2003 that the shape of the extinctioncurve, in particular the presence of the bump, is affected by the uv fluxdensity in the environment of the dust.

0706.1070	a multi-wavelength study of z = 3.15 lyman-alpha emitters in the goods  south field	context: ly-alpha-emitters have proven to be excellent probes of faint,star-forming galaxies in the high redshift universe. however, although thesample of known emitters is increasingly growing, their nature (e.g. stellarmasses, ages, metallicities, star-formation rates) is still poorly constrained.  aims: we aim to study the nature of ly-alpha-emitters, to find the propertiesof a typical ly-alpha-emitting galaxy and to compare these properties with theproperties of other galaxies at similar redshift, in particular lyman-breakgalaxies.  methods: we have performed narrow-band imaging at the vlt, focused only-alpha at redshift z ~ 3.15, in the goods-s field. we have identified asample of ly-alpha-emitting candidates, and we have studied their spectralenergy distributions (seds).  results: we find that the emitters are best fit by an sed with lowmetallicity (z/z_sun = 0.005), low dust extinction (a_v ~ 0.32) and mediumstellar masses of approximately 10^9 m_sun. the age is not very wellconstrained. one object out of 24 appears to be a high redshiftly-alpha-emitting dusty starburst galaxy. we find filamentary structure astraced by the ly-alpha-emitters at the 4 sigma level. the rest-frame uv sed ofthese galaxies is very similar to that of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) andcomply with the selection criteria for u-band drop-outs, except they areintrinsically fainter than the current limit for lbgs.  conclusion: ly-alpha-emitters are excellent probes of galaxies in the distantuniverse, and represent a class of star-forming, dust and agn free, medium massobjects.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
