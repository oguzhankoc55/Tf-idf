0902.2534	lofar, e-lofar and low-frequency vlbi	the low frequency array (lofar) is a new generation of electronic radiotelescope based on aperture array technology. the telescope is being developedby astron, and currently being rolled out across the netherlands and othercountries in europe. i present the current status of the project, and itsrelation to high resolution instruments such as the european vlbi network (evn)and the very long baseline array (vlba). in particular, i present recent vlbiresults at 327 mhz associated with: (i) a shallow survey based on vlba archivedata and (ii) a deep, wide-field global vlbi survey centred on two in-beamcalibrators, b0218+357 and j0226+3421. the results suggest that there will beno shortage of relatively bright primary calibrators that remain unresolved bylofar even on the longest european baselines. the sky density of fainterin-beam calibrators should also be more than adequate to permit the generationof high fidelity images over a large fraction of the sky, especially in thehigh-band observing band (120-240 mhz). extending lofar via internationalstations to baseline lengths of several thousand kilometres is certainlypractical and should significantly enhance the scientific output andcapabilities of the array.

0905.1605	high-redshift obscured quasars: radio emission at sub-kiloparsec scales	the radio properties of 11 obscured `radio-intermediate' quasars at redshiftsz&gt;~2 have been investigated using the europeanvery-long-baseline-interferometry network (evn) at 1.66 ghz. a sensitivity of~25 micro jy per 14x17 mas2 beam was achieved, and in 7 out of 11 sourcesunresolved radio emission was securely detected. the detected radio emission ofeach source accounts for ~30-100 % of the total source flux density. thephysical extent of this emission is ~&lt;150 pc, and the derived propertiesindicate that this emission originates from an active galactic nucleus (agn).the missing flux density is difficult to account for by star-formation alone,so radio components associated with jets of physical size &gt;~150 pc, and ~&lt; 40kpc are likely to be present in most of the sources. amongst the observedsample steep, flat, gigahertz-peaked and compact-steep spectrum sources are allpresent. hence, as well as extended and compact jets, examples of beamed jetsare also inferred, suggesting that in these sources, the obscuration must bedue to dust in the host galaxy, rather than the torus invoked by the unifiedschemes. comparing the total to core (~&lt; 150 pc) radio luminosities of thissample with different types of agn suggests that this sample of z &gt;~2radio-intermediate obscured quasars shows radio properties that are moresimilar to those of the high-radio-luminosity end of the low-redshiftradio-quiet quasar population than those of fr i radio galaxies. thisconclusion may reflect intrinsic differences, but could be strongly influencedby the increasing effect of inverse-compton cooling of extended radio jets athigh redshift.

0905.1851	revealing hanny's voorwerp: radio observations of ic 2497	we present multi-wavelength radio observations in the direction of the spiralgalaxy ic 2497 and the neighbouring emission nebula known as "hanny'svoorwerp". our wsrt continuum observations at 1.4 ghz and 4.9 ghz, reveal thepresence of extended emission at the position of the nebulosity, although thebulk of the emission remains unresolved at the centre of the galaxy. e-vlbi1.65 ghz observations show that on the milliarcsecond-scale a faint centralcompact source is present in ic 2497 with a brightness temperature in excess of4e5 k. with the wsrt, we detect a large reservoir of neutral hydrogen in theproximity of ic 2497. one cloud complex with a total mass of 5.6e9 msol to thesouth of ic 2497, encompasses hanny's voorwerp. another cloud complex islocated at the position of a small galaxy group ~100 kpc to the west of ic 2497with a mass of 2.9e9 msol. our data hint at a physical connection between bothcomplexes. we also detect hi in absorption against the central continuum sourceof ic 2497. our observations strongly support the hypothesis that hanny'svoorwerp is being ionised by an agn in the centre of ic 2497. in this scenario,a plasma jet associated with the agn, clears a path through the ism/igm in thedirection towards the nebulosity. the large-scale radio continuum emissionpossibly originates from the interaction between this jet and the large cloudcomplex that hanny's voorwerp is embedded in. the hi kinematics do not fitregular rotation, thus the cloud complex around ic 2497 is probably of tidalorigin. from the hi absorption against the central source, we derive a lowerlimit of 2.8e21 +- 0.4e21 atoms/sqcm to the hi column density. however,assuming non-standard conditions for the detected gas, we cannot exclude thepossibility that the agn in the centre of ic 2497 is compton-thick.

0909.2790	probing the behaviour of the x-ray binary cygnus x-3 with  very-long-baseline radio interferometry	in order to test the recently proposed classification of the radio/x-raystates of the x-ray binary cyg x-3, we present an analysis of the radio dataavailable for the system at much higher spatial resolutions than used fordefining the states. the radio data set consists of archival vlba data at 5 or15 ghz and new e-evn data at 5 ghz. we also present 5 ghz merlin observationsof an outburst of cyg x-3. in the x-ray regime we use quasi-simultaneous withradio, monitoring and pointed rxte observations. we find that when the radioemission from both jet and core is globally considered, the behaviour of cygx-3 at milliarcsecond scales is consistent with that described at arcsecondscales. however, when the radio emission is disentangled in a core componentand a jet component the situation changes. it becomes clear that in activestates the radio emission from the jet is dominating that from the core. thisshows that in these states the overall radio flux cannot be used as a directtracer of the accretion state.

0910.1213	radio counterpart of the lensed sub-mm emission in the cluster  ms0451.6-0305: new evidence for the merger scenario	smm j04542-0301 is an extended (~1 arcmin) sub-mm source located near thecore of the cluster ms0451.6-0305. it has been suggested that part of itsemission arises from the interaction between a lbg and two eros at z~2.9 thatare multiply-imaged. however, the dramatic resolution difference between thesub-mm map and the optical/nir images make it difficult to confirm thishypothesis. in this paper, we present a deep (~ 10 microjy/beam), highresolution (~2 arcsec) 1.4 ghz radio map of the cluster core, in which we haveidentified 6 sources located within smm j04542-0301. the strong lensing effectin the radio data has been quantified by constructing a new lens model of thecluster. the brightest and most extended of these sources (rj) is located inthe middle of the sub-mm emission, and has no obvious counterpart in theoptical/nir. three other detections (e1, e2 and e3) seem to be associated withthe images of one of the eros. the last two detections (cr1 and cr2), for whichno optical/nir counterpart have been found, seem to constitute two relativelycompact emitting regions embedded in a ~5 arcsec extended radio source locatedat the position of the sub-mm peak. the presence of this extended component canonly be explained if it is being produced by a lensed region of dust obscuredstar formation in the center of the merger. a comparison between the radio andsub-mm data at the same resolution suggests that e1, e2, e3, cr1 and cr2 areassociated with the sub-mm emission. the radio observations provide strongobservational evidence in favor of the merger hypothesis. however, the questionif rj is also contributing to the observed sub-mm emission remains open. theseresults illustrate the promising prospects for radio interferometry and stronggravitational lensing to study the internal structure of smgs.

1001.5060	a mildly relativistic radio jet from the otherwise normal type ic  supernova 2007gr	the class of type ic supernovae have drawn increasing attention since 1998owing to their sparse association (only four so far) with long durationgamma-ray bursts. although both phenomena originate from the core collapse of amassive star, supernovae emit mostly at optical wavelengths, whereas grbs emitmostly in soft gamma-rays or hard x-rays. though the grb central enginegenerates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam the early emission into a narrowcone, no relativistic outflows have hitherto been found in type ib/c supernovaeexplosions, despite theoretical expectations and searches. here we report radio(interferometric) observations that reveal a mildly relativistic expansion in anearby type ic supernova, sn 2007gr. using two observational epochs 60 daysapart, we detect expansion of the source and establish a conservative lowerlimit for the average apparent expansion velocity of 0.6c. independently, asecond mildly relativistic supernova has been reported. contrary to the radiodata, optical observations of sn 2007gr indicate a typical type ic supernovawith ejecta velocities ~6000 km/s, much lower than in grb-associatedsupernovae. we conclude that in sn 2007gr a small fraction of the ejectaproduced a low-energy mildly relativistic bipolar radio jet, while the bulk ofthe ejecta were slower and, as shown by optical spectro-polarimetry, mildlyaspherical.

1103.0583	a new perspective on the submillimetre galaxy mm 18423+5938 at redshift  3.9296 from radio continuum imaging	the bright submillimetre (sub-mm) galaxy mm 18423+5938 at redshift 3.9296 hasbeen predicted from mid-infrared and millimetre photometry to have anexceptionally large total infrared (ir) luminosity. we present new radioimaging at 1.4 ghz with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope that is usedto determine a radio-derived total ir luminosity for mm 18423+5938 via the wellestablished radio-far-infrared correlation. the flux density is found to bes_1.4 ghz = 217 +/- 37 \mu jy, which corresponds to a rest-frame luminositydensity of l_1.4 ghz = 2.32 +/- 0.40 x 10^25 / u w / hz, where u is themagnification from a probable gravitational lens. the radio-derived total irluminosity and star-formation rate are l_8-1000 \mu m = 5.6^+4.1_-2.4 x 10^13 /u l_sol and sfr = 9.4^+7.4_-4.9 x 10^3 / u m_sol / yr, respectively, which are~9 times smaller than those previously reported. these differences areattributed to the ir spectral energy distribution of mm 18423+5938 being poorlyconstrained by the limited number of reliable photometric data that arecurrently available, and from a previous misidentification of the object at 70\mu m. using the radio derived total ir luminosity as a constraint, thetemperature of the cold dust component is found to be t ~ 24^+7_-5 k for a dustemissivity of \beta = 1.5 +/- 0.5. the radio-derived properties of this galaxyare still large given the low excitation temperature implied by the co emissionlines and the temperature of the cold dust. therefore, we conclude that mm18423+5938 is probably gravitationally lensed.

1302.3128	lofar detections of low-frequency radio recombination lines towards  cassiopeia a	cassiopeia a was observed using the low-band antennas of the low frequencyarray (lofar) with high spectral resolution. this allowed a search for radiorecombination lines (rrls) along the line-of-sight to this source. fivecarbon-alpha rrls were detected in absorption between 40 and 50 mhz with asignal-to-noise ratio of &gt; 5 from two independent lofar datasets. the derivedline velocities (v_lsr ~ -50 km/s) and integrated optical depths (~ 13 s^-1) ofthe rrls in our spectra, extracted over the whole supernova remnant, areconsistent within each lofar dataset and with those previously reported. forthe first time, we are able to extract spectra against the brightest hotspot ofthe remnant at frequencies below 330 mhz. these spectra show significantlyhigher (15-80 %) integrated optical depths, indicating that there issmall-scale angular structure on the order of ~1 pc in the absorbing gasdistribution over the face of the remnant. we also place an upper limit of 3 x10^-4 on the peak optical depths of hydrogen and helium rrls. these resultsdemonstrate that lofar has the desired spectral stability and sensitivity tostudy faint recombination lines in the decameter band.

1303.6230	calibrating high-precision faraday rotation measurements for lofar and  the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes	faraday rotation measurements using the current and next generation oflow-frequency radio telescopes will provide a powerful probe of astronomicalmagnetic fields. however, achieving the full potential of these measurementsrequires accurate removal of the time-variable ionospheric faraday rotationcontribution. we present ionfr, a code that calculates the amount ofionospheric faraday rotation for a specific epoch, geographic location, andline-of-sight. ionfr uses a number of publicly available, gps-derived totalelectron content maps and the most recent release of the internationalgeomagnetic reference field. we describe applications of this code for thecalibration of radio polarimetric observations, and demonstrate the highaccuracy of its modeled ionospheric faraday rotations using lofar pulsarobservations. these show that we can accurately determine some of thehighest-precision pulsar rotation measures ever achieved. precision rotationmeasures can be used to monitor rotation measure variations - either intrinsicor due to the changing line-of-sight through the interstellar medium. thiscalibration is particularly important for nearby sources, where the ionospherecan contribute a significant fraction of the observed rotation measure. we alsodiscuss planned improvements to ionfr, as well as the importance of ionosphericfaraday rotation calibration for the emerging generation of low-frequency radiotelescopes, such as the ska and its pathfinders.

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1404.3907	the shape of the radio wavefront of extensive air showers as measured  with lofar	extensive air showers, induced by high energy cosmic rays impinging on theearth's atmosphere, produce radio emission that is measured with the lofarradio telescope. as the emission comes from a finite distance of a fewkilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar. a spherical, conical orhyperbolic shape of the wavefront has been proposed, but measurements ofindividual air showers have been inconclusive so far. for a selectedhigh-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we havereconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecondprecision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. for each measured air shower, wehave fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.the fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the bestparametrization. using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angularresolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. furthermore, adependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. thissuggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get anadditional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which issensitive to the mass of the primary particle.

1406.7242	lofar sparse image reconstruction	context. the low frequency array (lofar) radio telescope is a giant digitalphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in europe. itprovides discrete sets of fourier components of the sky brightness. recoveringthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverseproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methodsaims. recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete natureof radio interferometry measurement and the "compressed sensing" (cs) theory,which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measuredvisibilities. empowered by proximal theory, cs offers a sound framework forefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fastalgorithms. combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (dde) in thescope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based onthis framework methods. we implemented a sparse reconstruction method in thestandard lofar imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolutionperformance of this new imager with that of clean-based methods (clean andms-clean) with simulated and real lofar data results. we show that i) sparsereconstruction performs as well as clean in recovering the flux of pointsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean squareerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with aneffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the clean images.conclusions. sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic andwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (ofsimulated and real lofar datasets). this sparse reconstruction method iscompatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle dde corrections (a-and w-projections) required for current and future instruments such as lofarand ska

1507.07496	lofar tied-array imaging and spectroscopy of solar s bursts	context. the sun is an active source of radio emission that is oftenassociated with energetic phenomena ranging from nanoflares to coronal massejections (cmes). at low radio frequencies (&lt;100 mhz), numerous millisecondduration radio bursts have been reported, such as radio spikes or solar sbursts (where s stands for short). to date, these have neither been studiedextensively nor imaged because of the instrumental limitations of previousradio telescopes. aims. here, low frequency array (lofar) observations wereused to study the spectral and spatial characteristics of a multitude of sbursts, as well as their origin and possible emission mechanisms. methods. weused 170 simultaneous tied-array beams for spectroscopy and imaging of sbursts. since s bursts have short timescales and fine frequency structures,high cadence (~50 ms) tied-array images were used instead of standardinterferometric imaging, that is currently limited to one image per second.results. on 9 july 2013, over 3000 s bursts were observed over a time period of~8 hours. s bursts were found to appear as groups of short-lived (&lt;1 s) andnarrow-bandwidth (~2.5 mhz) features, the majority drifting at ~3.5 mhz/s and awide range of circular polarisation degrees (2-8 times more polarised than theaccompanying type iii bursts). extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic fieldusing the potential field source surface (pfss) model suggests that s burstsare associated with a trans-equatorial loop system that connects an activeregion in the southern hemisphere to a bipolar region of plage in the northernhemisphere. conclusions. we have identified polarised, short-lived solar radiobursts that have never been imaged before. they are observed at a height andfrequency range where plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism,however they possess some of the characteristics of electron-cyclotron maseremission.

1507.08932	calibrating the absolute amplitude scale for air showers measured at  lofar	air showers induced by cosmic rays create nanosecond pulses detectable atradio frequencies. these pulses have been measured successfully in the past fewyears at the low frequency array (lofar) and are used to study the propertiesof cosmic rays. for a complete understanding of this phenomenon and theunderlying physical processes, an absolute calibration of the detecting antennasystem is needed. we present three approaches that were used to check andimprove the antenna model of lofar and to provide an absolute calibration ofthe whole system for air shower measurements. two methods are based oncalibrated reference sources and one on a calibration approach using thediffuse radio emission of the galaxy, optimized for short data-sets. anaccuracy of 19% in amplitude is reached. the absolute calibration is alsocompared to predictions from air shower simulations. these results are used toset an absolute energy scale for air shower measurements and can be used as abasis for an absolute scale for the measurement of astronomical transients withlofar.

1509.01257	the lofar multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss) i. survey  description and first results	we present the multifrequency snapshot sky survey (msss), the firstnorthern-sky lofar imaging survey. in this introductory paper, we firstdescribe in detail the motivation and design of the survey. compared toprevious radio surveys, msss is exceptional due to its intrinsic multifrequencynature providing information about the spectral properties of the detectedsources over more than two octaves (from 30 to 160 mhz). the broadbandfrequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by lofar'smultibeaming capabilities, make msss the first survey of the sort anticipatedto be carried out with the forthcoming square kilometre array (ska). two of thesixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlapthe frequency coverage of large-area very large array (vla) and giant metrewaveradio telescope (gmrt) surveys at 74 mhz and 151 mhz respectively. the surveyperformance is illustrated within the "msss verification field" (mvf), a regionof 100 square degrees centered at j2000 (ra,dec)=(15h,69deg). the msss resultsfrom the mvf are compared with previous radio survey catalogs. we assess theflux and astrometric uncertainties in the catalog, as well as the completenessand reliability considering our source finding strategy. we determine the 90%completeness levels within the mvf to be 100 mjy at 135 mhz with 108"resolution, and 550 mjy at 50 mhz with 166" resolution. images and catalogs forthe full survey, expected to contain 150,000-200,000 sources, will be releasedto a public web server. we outline the plans for the ongoing production of thefinal survey products, and the ultimate public release of images and sourcecatalogs.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1511.09118	imaging jupiter's radiation belts down to 127 mhz with lofar	context. observing jupiter's synchrotron emission from the earth remainstoday the sole method to scrutinize the distribution and dynamical behavior ofthe ultra energetic electrons magnetically trapped around the planet (becausein-situ particle data are limited in the inner magnetosphere). aims. we performthe first resolved and low-frequency imaging of the synchrotron emission withlofar at 127 mhz. the radiation comes from low energy electrons (~1-30 mev)which map a broad region of jupiter's inner magnetosphere. methods (see articlefor complete abstract) results. the first resolved images of jupiter'sradiation belts at 127-172 mhz are obtained along with total integrated fluxdensities. they are compared with previous observations at higher frequenciesand show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (&gt;=4 $r_j$). theasymmetry and the dynamic of east-west emission peaks are measured and thepresence of a hot spot at lambda_iii=230 {\deg} $\pm$ 25 {\deg}. spectral fluxdensity measurements are on the low side of previous (unresolved) ones,suggesting a low-frequency turnover and/or time variations of the emissionspectrum. conclusions. lofar is a powerful and flexible planetary imager. theobservations at 127 mhz depict an extended emission up to ~4-5 planetary radii.the similarities with high frequency results reinforce the conclusion that: i)the magnetic field morphology primarily shapes the brightness distribution ofthe emission and ii) the radiating electrons are likely radially andlatitudinally distributed inside about 2 $r_j$. nonetheless, the larger extentof the brightness combined with the overall lower flux density, yields newinformation on jupiter's electron distribution, that may shed light on theorigin and mode of transport of these particles.

astro-ph;0106575	2016+112: a gravitationally lensed type-ii quasar	a single-screen model of the gravitational lens system 2016+112 is proposed,that explains recent hubble space telescope} (hst) infrared (nicmos-f160w)observations and new high-resolution european vlbi network (evn) 5-ghz radioobservations, presented in this paper. in particular, we find that a massive`dark' structure at the lens position, previously suggested by x-ray, opticaland spectroscopic observations of the field around 2016+112, is not necessarilyrequired to accommodate the strong lensing constraints. a massive structure tothe north-west of the lens system, suggested from a weak-lensing analysis ofthe field, is included in the model. the lensed source is an x-ray brightactive galaxy at z=3.273 with a central bright optical continuum core andstrong narrow emission lines, suggestive of a type-ii quasar. the evn 5-ghzradio maps show a radio-jet structure with at least two compact subcomponents.we propose that the diamond caustic crosses the counter-jet of the radiosource, so that part of the counter-jet, host galaxy and narrow-line emissionregions are quadruply imaged. the remainder of the radio source, including thecore, is doubly imaged. our lens model predicts a very high magnification(mu~300) at the bightness peaks of the inner two radio components of complex c.if the jet exhibits relativistic velocities on micro-arsecond scales, it mightresult in apparent hyperluminal motion. however, the lack of strong radiovariability and the peaked radio spectrum imply that these motions need not bepresent in the source. our model furthermore implies that the optical spectrumof c' can only show features of the agn and its host galaxy.

astro-ph;0301355	when you wish upon a star: future developments in astronomical vlbi	in this paper, i present the likely technological development of vlbi, andits impact on the astronomical community over the next 1-5 years. vlbi iscurrently poised to take advantage of the rapid development in commercialoff-the-shelf (cots) pc-based products. the imminent deployment of disk-basedrecording systems will enable gbps data rates to be achieved routinely by bothcm and mm-vlbi networks. this, together with anticipated improvements incollecting area, receiver systems and coherence time is set to transform theperformance of vlbi in terms of both baseline and image noise sensitivity. atthe same time the feasibility of using fibre based communication networks asthe basis for production, real-time vlbi networks will begin. fantastic newcorrelator output data rates, and the ability to deal with these via powerfulpc clusters promises to expand the typical vlbi field-of-view to scalespreviously reserved for connected, short baseline interferometers. bysimultaneously sampling the summed response of all compact radio sources within(and indeed beyond) the half-power point of the vlbi telescope primary beam,simple self-calibration of the target field will always be possible atfrequencies below a few ghz. unbiased, broad-band continuum surveys will beconducted over huge areas of sky, and (redshifted) spectral-features will bedetected too. by the end of the decade the microjy radio sky will be accessibleto vlbi: dozens of sources will be simultaneosuly observed, correlated,detected and fully analysed all within the same day.

astro-ph;0508579	deep extragalactic vlbi-optical survey (devos): i. pilot merlin and vlbi  observations	we present the results of the pilot observations of the deep extragalacticvlbi-optical survey (devos). our ultimate aim is to collect information oncompact structures in a large sample of extragalactic radio sources (~10000objects) up to two orders of magnitude fainter than those studied in typicalimaging very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) surveys up until now. thiswould lead to an unprecedented data base for various astrophysical, astrometricand cosmological studies. the first global vlbi observations of the devosprogramme were successfully conducted in may 2002. we selected sources withoutany spectral criterion from the very large array (vla) faint images of theradio sky at twenty-centimeters (first) catalogue, that are also detected withthe multi-element radio linked interferometer network (merlin). the devos pilotsample sources are in the area of the sky that is covered by the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we describe the sample selection and present high resolution5-ghz radio images of the sources. based on the results of this pilot study, weestimate the outcome of and the resources needed for a full-scale devosproject.

astro-ph;0603466	highly-magnified, multiply-imaged radio counterparts of the sub-mm  starburst emission in the cluster-lens ms0451.6-0305	previous authors have reported the detection of intrinsically faint sub-mmemission lensed by the cluster ms0451.6-0305. they suggest that this emissionarises from a merging system composed of a ly-break galaxy and a pair ofextremely red objects which are multiply-imaged in the optical/nirobservations. since the submm emission presents an unusually large angularextent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system canhelp to identify optical/nir counterparts due to the higher spatial resolutionand astrometric accuracy of the radio observations. archive vla data (bnaconfiguration at 1.4 ghz) was reduced and analysed. a simple lens model wasconstructed to aid the interpretation of the radio and pre-existing sub-mm andoptical/nir data. we present a 1.4 ghz map of the central region ofms0451.6-0305 and report the detection of gravitationally lensed radioemission, coincident with the previously discovered sub-mm lensed emission. theoverall morphology and scale of the radio and sub-mm emission are strikinglysimilar, extending ~1 arcmin across the sky. this observation strongly suggeststhat the radio and sub-mm emission arise from the same sources. preliminaryestimates of the total s_850 microns/s_1.4 ghz flux density ratio appear to beconsistent with that expected from distant star forming galaxies. the radioemission is resolved into 7 distinct components, and the overall structure canbe explained, using a simple lens model, with three multiply-imaged radiosources at z~2.9. one of these sources is predicted to lie in the middle of thepreviously mentioned system in the source plane, suggesting that it is relatedto the intense star formation generated during the merging process.

astro-ph;0611054	first e-vlbi observations of cygnus x-3	we report the results of the first two 5 ghz e-vlbi observations of the x-raybinary cygnus x-3 using the european vlbi network. two successful observingsessions were held, on 2006 april 20, when the system was in a quasi-quiescentstate several weeks after a major flare, and on 2006 may 18, a few days afteranother flare. at the first epoch we detected faint emission probablyassociated with a fading jet, spatially separated from the x-ray binary. thesecond epoch in contrast reveals a bright, curved, relativistic jet more than40 milliarcseconds in extent. in the first, and probably also second epochs,the x-ray binary core is not detected, which may indicate a temporarysuppression of jet production as seen in some black hole x-ray binaries incertain x-ray states. spatially resolved polarisation maps at the second epochprovide evidence of interaction between the ejecta and the surrounding medium.these results clearly demonstrate the importance of rapid analysis oflong-baseline observations of transients, such as facilitated by e-vlbi.

astro-ph;9906108	wide-field vlbi imaging	we discuss the technique of wide-field imaging as it applies to very longbaseline interferometry (vlbi). in the past vlbi data sets were usuallyaveraged so severely that the field-of-view was typically restricted to regionsextending a few hundred milliarcseconds from the phase centre of the field.recent advances in data analysis techniques, together with increasing datastorage capabilities, and enhanced computer processing power, now permit vlbiimages to be made whose angular size represents a significant fraction of anindividual antenna's primary beam. this technique has recently beensuccessfully applied to several large separation gravitational lens systems,compact supernova remnants in the starburst galaxy m82, and two faint radiosources located within the same vla first field. it seems likely that othervlbi observing programmes might benefit from this wide-field approach to vlbidata analysis. with the raw sensitivity of global vlbi set to improve by afactor 4-5 over the coming few years, the number of sources that can bedetected in a given field will rise considerably. in addition, a continuedprogression in vlbi's ability to image relatively faint and extended lowbrightness temperature features (such as hot-spots in large-scale astrophysicaljets) is also to be expected. as vlbi sensitivity approaches the $\mu$jy level,a wide-field approach to data analysis becomes inevitable.

astro-ph;9906158	a vlbi and merlin survey of faint, compact radio sources	we present preliminary results from a vlbi survey at $\lambda=6 $cm of asample of 35 sources with flux densities of 2 - 100 mjy. these sources wereselected from the vla first survey at $\lambda = 20 $cm, in a 3 degree fieldaround the bright calibrator 1156+295, simply by imposing $s_{20} &gt; 10 $ mjyand $\theta &lt; 5$ arcsec. merlin observations at $\lambda 6 $cm detected 70/127of these sources with a threshold of 2 mjy at 50 mas resolution and the closest35 of these to the calibrator were observed with the vlba+evn in snapshot modeat $\lambda 6 $cm. these sources are a mixture of flat and steep-spectrumsources and include: weak flat-spectrum nuclei of large radio galaxies, lowpower agn in nearby galaxies and radio quiet quasars. with these shortobservations, the sensitivity is limited and most appear as either core-jets orsimple point sources on the milliarcsec scale. nonetheless, it is encouragingthat with only 10 minutes observation per source, at least 35% of all sourceswith $s_{20} &gt; 10 $ mjy can be detected and imaged with global 6cm vlbi.

0810.5341	the role of luminous substructure in the gravitational lens system mg  2016+112	mg 2016+112 is a quadruply imaged lens system with two complete images a andb and a pair of merging partial images in region c as seen in the radio. themerging images are found to violate the expected mirror symmetry. thisindicates an astrometric anomaly which could only be of gravitational originand could arise due to substructure in the environment or line-of-sight of thelens galaxy. we present new high resolution multi-frequency vlbi observationsat 1.7, 5 and 8.4 ghz. three new components are detected in the new vlbiimaging of both the lensed images a and b. the expected opposite parity of thelensed images a and b was confirmed due to the detection of non-collinearcomponents. furthermore, the observed properties of the newly detectedcomponents are inconsistent with the predictions of previous mass models. wepresent new scenarios for the background quasar which are consistent with thenew observations. we also investigate the role of the satellite galaxy situatedat the same redshift as the main lensing galaxy. our new mass modelsdemonstrate quantitatively that the satellite galaxy is the primary cause ofthe astrometric anomaly found in region c. the detected satellite is consistentwith the abundance of subhaloes expected in the halo from cold dark matter(cdm) simulations. however, the fraction of the total halo mass in thesatellite as computed from lens modeling is found to be higher than thatpredicted by cdm simulations.
