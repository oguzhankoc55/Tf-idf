0905.1122	turning back the clock: inferring the history of the eight o'clock arc	we present the results from an optical and near-infrared spectroscopic studyof the ultraviolet-luminous z = 2.73 galaxy, the 8 o'clock arc. due togravitational lensing, this galaxy is magnified by a factor of &gt; 10, allowingin-depth measurements which are usually unfeasible at such redshifts. in theoptical spectra, we measured the systemic redshift of the galaxy, z = 2.7322+/- 0.0012, using stellar photospheric lines. this differs from the redshift ofabsorption lines in the interstellar medium, z = 2.7302 +/- 0.0006, implyinggas outflows on the order of 160 km/s. with h and k-band near-infrared spectra,we have measured nebular emission lines of halpha, hbeta, hgamma, [n ii] and [oiii], which have a redshift z = 2.7333 +/- 0.0001, consistent with the derivedsystemic redshift. from the balmer decrement, we measured the dust extinctionto be a_5500 = 1.17 +/- 0.36 mag. correcting halpha for dust extinction and theassumed lensing factor, we measure a star-formation rate of ~ 270 msol/yr,which is higher than ~ 85% of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. usingcombinations of all detected emission lines, we find that the 8 o'clock arc hasa gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.8 zsol, showing that enrichment at high-redshiftis not rare, even in blue, star-forming galaxies. studying spectra from two ofthe arc components separately, we find that one component dominates the dustextinction and star-formation rate, although the metallicities between the twocomponents are similar. we derive the mass via stellar population modeling, andfind that the arc has a total stellar mass of ~ 4 x 10^11 msol, which falls onthe mass-metallicity relation at z ~ 2. finally, we estimate the total gasmass, and find it to be only ~ 12% of the stellar mass, implying that the 8o'clock arc is likely nearing the end of a starburst.

0906.4554	a plethora of agn among lyman alpha galaxies at low redshift	we investigate the fraction of z ~ 0.3 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes)which host active galactic nucleus activity, which is typically from 1 - 5% at2 &lt; z &lt; 6. using optical spectroscopy of 23 laes at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.45 selectedwith galex uv data, we probe for agn with a variety of methods, including linewidths, diagnostic line ratios, high-ionization emission, infrared activity andx-ray luminosity. we found that our sample of low-redshift laes has an agnfraction of 43 ^{+18}{-26}%, significantly higher than at high redshift. whileprevious results have shown that low-redshift laes have a lower space densitythan their high-redshift analogs, these results show that star-forming laes atlow-redshift are rarer still. accounting for differences in available agnclassification methods, we conclude that rest-frame optical spectroscopy isnecessary to identify low-luminosity agns in laes at high redshift, and thatlimits on the x-ray flux are necessary to determine the extent to which the agncontaminates the lyman alpha fluxes.

0910.0022	the shining future of uv spectral synthesis	with the coming generation of instruments and telescopes capable ofspectroscopy of high redshift galaxies, the spectral synthesis technique in therest-frame uv and far-uv range will become one of a few number of toolsremaining to study their young stellar populations in detail. the rest-frame uvlines and continuum of high redshift galaxies, observed with visible andinfrared telescopes on earth, can be used for accurate line profile fittingsuch as pv@1118,1128a, ciii@1176a, and civ@1550a. these lines are very precisediagnostic tools to estimate ages, metallicities, and masses of stellarpopulations.  here we discuss the potential for spectral synthesis of rest-frame uv spectraobtained at the keck telescope. as an example, we study the 8 o'clock arc, alensed galaxy at z=2.7322. we show that the poor spectral type coverage of theactual uv empirical spectral libraries limits the age and metallicitydiagnostic. in order to improve our knowledge of high redshift galaxies usingspectral synthesis, uv stellar libraries need to be extended to obtain accurateage, metallicity, and mass estimates likely to be occuring in young stellarpopulations observed in the early universe.

1005.5126	reversal of fortune: confirmation of an increasing star  formation-density relation in a cluster at z=1.62	we measure the rest-frame colors (dust-corrected), infrared luminosities,star formation rates, and stellar masses of 92 galaxies in a spitzer-selectedcluster at z=1.62. by fitting spectral energy distributions (seds) to 10-bandphotometry (0.4 micron &lt; lambda(obs) &lt;8 micron) and measuring 24 micron fluxesfor the 12 spectroscopically confirmed and 80 photometrically selected members,we discover an exceptionally high level of star formation in the cluster coreof ~1700 msun/yr per mpc^2. the cluster galaxies define a strong blue sequencein (u-v) color and span a range in color. we identify 17 members withl(ir)&gt;10^(11) lsun, and these ir luminous members follow the same trend ofincreasing star formation with stellar mass that is observed in the field atz~2. using rates derived from both the 24 micron imaging and sed fitting, wefind that the relative fraction of star-forming members triples from the lowestto highest galaxy density regions, e.g. the ir luminous fraction increases from~8% at sigma~10 gal per mpc^2 to ~25% at sigma&gt;100 gal per mpc^2. the observedincrease is a reversal of the well-documented trend at z&lt;1 and signals that wehave reached the epoch when massive cluster galaxies are still forming asubstantial fraction of their stars.

1006.1895	first spectroscopic measurements of [oiii] emission from lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z ~ 3.1	we present the first spectroscopic measurements of the [oiii] 5007 a line intwo z ~ 3.1 lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (laes) using the new near-infraredinstrument lucifer1 on the 8.4m large binocular telescope (lbt). we alsodescribe the optical imaging and spectroscopic observations used to identifythese lya emitting galaxies. using the [oiii] line we have measured accuratesystemic redshifts for these two galaxies, and discovered a velocity offsetbetween the [oiii] and ly-alpha lines in both, with the lya line peaking 342and 125 km/s redward of the systemic velocity. these velocity offsets implythat there are powerful outflows in high-redshift laes. they also ease thetransmission of lya photons through the interstellar medium and intergalacticmedium around the galaxies. by measuring these offsets directly, we can refineboth lya-based tests for reionization, and lya luminosity function measurementswhere the lya forest affects the blue wing of the line. our work also providesthe first direct constraints on the strength of the [oiii] line inhigh-redshift laes. we find [oiii] fluxes of 7 and 36 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2in two z ~ 3.1 laes. these lines are strong enough to dominate broad-band fluxmeasurements that include the line (in thiscase, k_s band photometry). spectralenergy distribution fits that do not account for the lines would thereforeoverestimate the 4000 a (and/or balmer) break strength in such galaxies, andhence also the ages and stellar masses of such high-z galaxies.

1006.3071	the luminosity function of lyman alpha emitters at redshift z=7.7	lyman alpha (lya) emission lines should be attenuated in a neutralintergalactic medium (igm). therefore the visibility of lya emitters at highredshifts can serve as a valuable probe of reionization at about the 50% level.we present an imaging search for z=7.7 lya emitting galaxies using anultra-narrowband filter (filter width= 9a) on the newfirm imager at the kittpeak national observatory. we found four candidate lya emitters in a surveyvolume of 1.4 x 10^4 mpc^3, with a line flux brighter than 6x10^-18 erg/cm^2/s(5 sigma in 2" aperture). we also performed a detailed monte-carlo simulationincorporating the instrumental effects to estimate the expected number of lyaemitters in our survey, and found that we should expect to detect one lyaemitter, assuming a non-evolving lya luminosity function (lf) between z=6.5 andz=7.7. even if one of the present candidates is spectroscopically confirmed asa z~8 lya emitter, it would indicate that there is no significant evolution ofthe lya lf from z=3.1 to z~8. while firm conclusions would need bothspectroscopic confirmations and larger surveys to boost the number counts ofgalaxies, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of sensitivenear-infrared (1.06 um) narrow-band searches using custom filters designed toavoid the oh emission lines that make up most of the sky background.

1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

0708.4226	effects of dust geometry in lyman alpha galaxies at z = 4.4	equivalent widths (ews) observed in high-redshift lyman alpha galaxies couldbe stronger than the ew intrinsic to the stellar population if dust is presentresiding in clumps in the inter-stellar medium (ism). in this scenario,continuum photons could be extinguished while the lyman alpha photons would beresonantly scattered by the clumps, eventually escaping the galaxy. weinvestigate this radiative transfer scenario with a new sample of six lymanalpha galaxy candidates in the goods cdf-s, selected at z = 4.4 withground-based narrow-band imaging obtained at ctio. grism spectra from the hstpears survey confirm that three objects are at z = 4.4, and that another objectcontains an active galactic nuclei (agn). if we assume the other five (non-agn)objects are at z = 4.4, they have rest-frame ews from 47 -- 190 a. we presentresults of stellar population studies of these objects, constraining theirrest-frame uv with hst and their rest-frame optical with spitzer. out of thefour objects which we analyzed, three objects were best-fit to contain stellarpopulations with ages on the order of 1 myr and stellar masses from 3 - 10 x10^8 solar masses, with dust in the amount of a_1200 = 0.9 - 1.8 residing in aquasi-homogeneous distribution. however, one object (with a rest ew ~ 150 a)was best fit by an 800 myr, 6.6 x 10^9 solar mass stellar population with asmaller amount of dust (a_1200 = 0.4) attenuating the continuum only. in thisobject, the ew was enhanced ~ 50% due to this dust. this suggests that large ewlyman alpha galaxies are a diverse population. preferential extinction of thecontinuum in a clumpy ism deserves further investigation as a possible cause ofthe overabundance of large-ew objects that have been seen in narrow-bandsurveys in recent years.

1011.0426	hetdex pilot survey for emission-line galaxies - i. survey design,  performance, and catalog	we present a catalog of emission-line galaxies selected solely by theiremission-line fluxes using a wide-field integral field spectrograph. this workis partially motivated as a pilot survey for the upcoming hobby-eberlytelescope dark energy experiment (hetdex). we describe the observations,reductions, detections, redshift classifications, line fluxes, and counterpartinformation for 397 emission-line galaxies detected over 169 sq.arcmin with a3500-5800 ang. bandpass under 5 ang. full-width-half-maximum (fwhm) spectralresolution. the survey's best sensitivity for unresolved objects underphotometric conditions is between 4-20 e-17 erg/s/sq.cm depending on thewavelength, and ly-alpha luminosities between 3-6 e42 erg/s are detectable.this survey method complements narrowband and color-selection techniques in thesearch for high redshift galaxies with its different selection properties andlarge volume probed. the four survey fields within the cosmos, goods-n, munics,and xmm-lss areas are rich with existing, complementary data. we find 104galaxies via their high redshift ly-alpha emission at 1.9&lt;z&lt;3.8, and themajority of the remainder objects are low redshift [oii]3727 emitters atz&lt;0.56. the classification between low and high redshift objects depends onrest frame equivalent width, as well as other indicators, where available.based on matches to x-ray catalogs, the active galactic nuclei (agn) fractionamongst the ly-alpha emitters (laes) is 6%. we also analyze the survey'scompleteness and contamination properties through simulations. we find fivehigh-z, highly-significant, resolved objects with full-width-half-maximum sizes&gt;44 sq.arcsec which appear to be extended ly-alpha nebulae. we also find threehigh-z objects with rest frame ly-alpha equivalent widths above the levelbelieved to be achievable with normal star formation, ew(rest)&gt;240 ang.

1011.0431	the hetdex pilot survey iii: the low metallicities of high-redshift  lyman alpha galaxies	we present keck/nirspec spectroscopic observations of three lyman alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 2.3 discovered with the hetdex pilot survey. wedetect halpha, [oiii], and hbeta emission from two galaxies at z = 2.29 and2.49, designated hps194 and hps256, respectively, representing the firstdetection of multiple rest-frame optical emission lines in galaxies athigh-redshift selected on the basis of their lyman alpha emission. theredshifts of the lyman alpha emission from these galaxies are offset redward ofthe systemic redshifts by delta_v = 162 +/- 37 (photometric) +/- 42(systematic) km/s for hps194, and delta_v = 36 +/- 35 +/- 18 km/s for hps256.an interpretation for hps194 is that a large-scale outflow may be occurring inits interstellar medium. the emission line ratios imply that neither lae hostsan active galactic nucleus. using the upper limits on the [nii] emission weplace meaningful constraints on the gas-phase metallicities in these two laesof z &lt; 0.17 and &lt; 0.28 zsol (1 sigma). measuring the stellar masses of theseobjects via spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting (~ 10^10 and 6 x 10^8msol, respectively), we study the nature of laes in a mass-metallicity plane.at least one of these two laes appears to be more metal poor thancontinuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift and stellar mass,implying that objects exhibiting lyman alpha emission may be systematicallyless chemically enriched than the general galaxy population. we use the seds ofthese two galaxies to show that neglecting the emission lines when fittingstellar population models to the observed photometry can result inoverestimates of the population age by orders of magnitude, and the stellarmass by a factor of ~ 2. this effect is particularly important at z &gt; 7, wheresimilarly strong emission lines may masquerade in the photometry as a 4000 abreak (abridged).

1012.4010	dust extinction and metallicities of star-forming lyman alpha emitting  galaxies at low redshift	we present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of 12galex-discovered star-forming lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3.we measure the emission line fluxes from these galaxies by fitting theirobserved spectra to stellar population models in order to correct forunderlying stellar absorption. we revisit earlier stellar population modelfitting results, finding that excluding now-known agns lowers the typicalstellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 myr and ~ 4 x10^9 msol, respectively. we calculate their dust extinction using the balmerdecrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of av ~ 0.3 mag, similar tothat seen in many high-redshift laes. comparing the ratio of lyalpha/halpha andthe lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find thatthe isms in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriouslyattenuating the lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in aquasi-clumpy ism. lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phasemetallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our samplehave z &lt; 0.4 zsol. we find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift laeanalogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxypopulation at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicityrelationship. this implies that galaxies with lyman alpha in emission may besystematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellarmass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.

1106.2811	x-ray constraints on the lyman-alpha escape fraction	we have coadded x-ray flux of all known lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the 4msec chandra deep field south (cdf-s) region, to place sensitive upper limitson the average unobscured star-formation rate (sfr_x) in these galaxies. a verysmall fraction of lyman-alpha galaxies in the field are individually detectedin the x-rays, implying a low fraction of agn activity. after excluding the fewx-ray detected laes, we stack the undetected laes located in the 4 ms cdf-sdata and 250 ks extended cdf-s (ecdfs) data, and compute a 1-\sigma upper limiton sfr_x &lt; 14, 28, 28, 140, 440, 880 m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ for laes located at z= 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively. the upper limit of sfr_x inlaes can be then be compared to sfr$_{ly\alpha}$ derived from lyman-alpha lineand thus can constrain on the lyman-alpha escape fraction($f^{esc}_{ly\alpha}$). we derive a lower limit on f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 14%(84 % confidence level, 1-\sigma lower limit) for laes at redshift z ~ 2.1 andz ~ 3.1-3.2. at z &gt; 4, the current lae samples are not of sufficient size toconstrain sfr_x well. by averaging all the laes at z&gt; 2, the x-raynon-detection constrains f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 17% (84 % confidence level,1-\sigma lower limit), and rejects f(lyman-alpha escape) &lt; 5.7% at the 99.87%confidence level from 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.5.

1106.2816	sizing up lyman-alpha and lyman break galaxies	we show that populations of high redshift galaxies grow more luminous as theygrow in linear size. this is because the brightness per unit area has adistinct upper limit due to the self-regulating nature of star-formation. as acorollary, we show that the observed increase in characteristic luminosity oflyman break galaxies (l*) with time can be explained by their increase in size,which scales as 1/h(z). in contrast, lyman-alpha selected galaxies have acharacteristic, constant, small size between redshift z=2.25 and 6.5. coupledwith a characteristic surface brightness, this can explain their non-evolvingultraviolet continuum luminosity function. this compact physical size seems tobe a critical determining factor in whether a galaxy will show lyman-alphaemission. we base these conclusions on new size measurements for a sample ofabout 170 lyman-alpha selected galaxies with hubble space telescope broad-bandimaging, over the redshift range 2.25 &lt; z &lt; 6. we combine these with a similarnumber of lyman-alpha selected galaxies with half-light radii from theliterature, and derive surface brightnesses for the entire combined sample.

1206.0735	candels: the contribution of the observed galaxy population to cosmic  reionization	we present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from asample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. these galaxies were selected from new deepnear-infrared hst imaging from the candels, hudf09 and ers programs. incontrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that thedistribution of galaxy ultraviolet (uv) luminosities follows a schechterdistribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below ourobservable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxieswhich we can observe, free from these assumptions. we find that the observablepopulation of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized igm at z=6, if the averageionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. a number of previous studieshave measured uv luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5x, withmany concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless alarge population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, orextremely high values of f_esc were present. the observed uv luminosity densityfrom our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fullyreionized igm unless f_esc&gt;50%. combining our observations with constraints onthe emission rate of ionizing photons from ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,we can constrain f_esc&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the onlycontributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity functionextends to m_uv = -13. these escape fractions are sufficient to completereionization by z=6. these constraints imply that the volume ionized fractionof the igm becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number ofcomplementary reionization probes. if faint galaxies dominate reionization,future jwst observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing anindirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

1301.3140	the dynamical masses, densities, and star formation scaling relations of  lyman alpha galaxies	we present the first dynamical mass measurements for lyman alpha galaxies athigh redshift, based on velocity dispersion measurements from rest-frameoptical emission lines and size measurements from hst imaging, for a sample ofnine galaxies drawn from four surveys. these measurements enable us to studythe nature of lyman alpha galaxies in the context of galaxy scaling relations.the resulting dynamical masses range from 1e9 to 1e10 solar masses. we also fitstellar population models to our sample, and use them to plot the lyman alphasample on a stellar mass vs. line width relation. overall, the lyman alphagalaxies follow well the scaling relation established by observing star forminggalaxies at lower redshift (and without regard for lyman alpha emission),though in 1/3 of the lyman alpha galaxies, lower-mass fits are also acceptable.in all cases, the dynamical masses agree with established stellarmass-linewidthrelation. using the dynamical masses as an upper limit on gas mass, we showthat lyman alpha galaxies resemble starbursts (rather than "normal" galaxies)in the relation between gas mass surface density and star formation activity,in spite of relatively modest star formation rates. finally, we examine themass densities of these galaxies, and show that their future evolution likelyrequires dissipational ("wet") merging. in short, we find that lyman alphagalaxies are low mass cousins of larger starbursts.

1305.0607	candels observations of the environmental dependence of the  color-mass-morphology relation at z = 1.6	we study the environmental dependence of color, stellar mass, and morphologyby comparing galaxies in a forming cluster to those in the field at z = 1:6with hubble space telescope near-infrared imaging in the candels/uds field. wequantify the morphology of the galaxies using the effective radius, reff, ands\'ersic index, n. in both the cluster and field, approximately half of thebulge-dominated galaxies (n &gt; 2) reside on the red sequence of thecolor-magnitude diagram, and most disk-dominated galaxies (n &lt; 2) have colorsexpected for star-forming galaxies. there is weak evidence that clustergalaxies have redder rest-frame u - b colors and higher stellar masses comparedto the field. star-forming galaxies in both the cluster and field show nosignificant differences in their morphologies. in contrast, there is evidencethat quiescent galaxies in the cluster have larger median effective radii andsmaller s\'ersic indices compared to the field with a significance of 2?. thesedifferences are most pronounced for galaxies at clustercentric distances 1 mpc&lt; rproj &lt; 1.5 mpc, which have low s\'ersic indices and possibly largereffective radii, more consistent with star-forming galaxies at this epoch andin contrast to other quiescent galaxies. we argue that star-forming galaxiesare processed under the influence of the cluster environment at distancesgreater than the cluster-halo virial radius. our results are consistent withmodels where gas accretion onto these galaxies is suppressed from processesassociated with the cluster environment.

1305.1357	uvudf: ultraviolet imaging of the hubble ultradeep field with wide-field  camera 3	we present an overview of a 90-orbit hubble space telescope treasury programto obtain near ultraviolet imaging of the hubble ultra deep field using thewide field camera 3 uvis detector with the f225w, f275w, and f336w filters.this survey is designed to: (i) investigate the episode of peak star formationactivity in galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5; (ii) probe the evolution of massive galaxiesby resolving sub-galactic units (clumps); (iii) examine the escape fraction ofionizing radiation from galaxies at z~2-3; (iv) greatly improve the reliabilityof photometric redshift estimates; and (v) measure the star formation rateefficiency of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas at z~1-3. in this overviewpaper, we describe the survey details and data reduction challenges, includingboth the necessity of specialized calibrations and the effects of chargetransfer inefficiency. we provide a stark demonstration of the effects ofcharge transfer inefficiency on resultant data products, which whenuncorrected, result in uncertain photometry, elongation of morphology in thereadout direction, and loss of faint sources far from the readout. we agreewith the stsci recommendation that future uvis observations that require verysensitive measurements use the instrument's capability to add background lightthrough a "post-flash". preliminary results on number counts of uv-selectedgalaxies and morphology of galaxies at z~1 are presented. we find that thenumber density of uv dropouts at redshifts 1.7, 2.1, and 2.7 is largelyconsistent with the number predicted by published luminosity functions. we alsoconfirm that the image mosaics have sufficient sensitivity and resolution tosupport the analysis of the evolution of star-forming clumps, reaching 28-29thmagnitude depth at 5 sigma in a 0.2 arcsecond radius aperture depending onfilter and observing epoch.

1308.1957	the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha emission of three lyman-alpha  selected field galaxies at z~2.4 from the hetdex pilot survey	we present new results on the spectrally resolved lyman-alpha (lya) emissionof three lya emitting field galaxies at z~2.4 with high lya equivalent width(&gt;100 angstroms) and lya luminosity (~10^43 erg/s). at 120 km/s (fwhm) spectralresolution, the prominent double-peaked lya profile straddles the systemicvelocity, where the velocity zero-point is determined from spectroscopy of thegalaxies' rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. the average velocityoffset from systemic of the stronger redshifted emission component for oursample is 176 km/s while the average total separation between the redshiftedand main blueshifted emission components is 380 km/s. these measurements are afactor of ~2 smaller than for uv continuum-selected galaxies that show lya inemission with lower lya equivalent width. we compare our lya spectra to thepredicted line profiles of a spherical "expanding shell" lya radiative transfergrid that models large-scale galaxy outflows. specifically blueward of thesystemic velocity where two galaxies show a weak, highly blueshifted (by ~1000km/s) tertiary emission peak, the model line profiles are a relatively poorrepresentation of the observed spectra. since the neutral gas column densityhas a dominant influence over the shape of the lya line profile, we cautionagainst equating the observed lya velocity offset with a physical outflowvelocity, especially at lower spectral resolution where the unresolved lyavelocity offset is a convoluted function of several degenerate parameters.referring to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical hubble space telescope imaging,we find that galaxy-galaxy interactions may play an important role in inducinga starburst that results in copious lya emission, as well as perturbing the gasdistribution and velocity field which have strong influence over the lyaemission line profile.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1310.4835	ly{\alpha} equivalent width distribution of ly{\alpha} emitting galaxies  at redshift z $\sim$ 4.5	ly{\alpha} line ews provide important clues to the physical nature of highredshift laes. however, measuring the ly{\alpha} ew distribution of high-znarrowband selected laes can be hard because many sources do not have broadbandphotometry. we investigate the possible biases in measuring the intrinsicly{\alpha} ew distribution for a lae sample at z $\sim$ 4.5 in the extendedcdfs. only weak malmquist-type bias in both the intrinsic ly{\alpha} luminosityfunction and the ly{\alpha} ew distribution were found. however, the observedew distribution is severely biased if one only considers laes with detectionsin the continuum. taking the broadband non-detections into account requiresfitting the distribution of the broadband-to-narrowband ratio, which then givesa larger ew distribution scale length. assuming an exponential form of theintrinsic ly{\alpha} ew distribution dn/dew = n exp(-ew/w$_0$), we obtain w$_0$= 167+/-44{\aa} (uncorrected for igm absorption of ly{\alpha}). we discuss thelikely range of igm absorption effects in light of recent measurements ofly{\alpha} line profiles and velocity offsets. our data are consistent withly{\alpha} ew being independent of uv luminosity (i.e., we do not see evidencefor the "ando" effect). our simulations also imply that broad-band imagesshould be 0.5-1 magnitude deeper than narrowband images for an effective andreasonably complete lae survey. comparing with consistent measurements at otherredshifts, we see a strong evolution in ly{\alpha} ew distribution withredshift which goes as a power-law form of w$_0$ $\prop$(1+z)$^${\xi}, with{\xi} = 1.1$\pm$0.1 (0.6$\pm$0.1) if no igm corrections are applied to thely{\alpha} line; or {\xi} = 1.7$\pm$0.1 (1.2$\pm$0.1) after applying a maximaligm-absorption correction to ly{\alpha} line) for an exponential (a gaussian)ew distribution from z = 0.3 to 6.5.

1403.4935	spectral energy distribution fitting of hetdex pilot survey lyman-alpha  emitters in cosmos and goods-n	we use broadband photometry extending from the rest-frame uv to the near-irto fit the individual spectral energy distributions (seds) of 63 bright(l(ly-alpha) &gt; 10^43 ergs/s) ly-alpha emitting galaxies (laes) in the redshiftrange 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.6. we find that these laes are quite heterogeneous, withstellar masses that span over three orders of magnitude, from 7.5 &lt; log m &lt;10.5. moreover, although most laes have small amounts of extinction, somehigh-mass objects have stellar reddenings as large as e(b-v) ~0.4.interestingly, in dusty objects the optical depths for ly-alpha and the uvcontinuum are always similar, indicating that ly-alpha photons are notundergoing many scatters before escaping their galaxy. in contrast, the ratioof optical depths in low-reddening systems can vary widely, illustrating thediverse nature of the systems. finally, we show that in the star formation rate(sfr)-log mass diagram, our laes fall above the "main-sequence" defined by z ~3 continuum selected star-forming galaxies. in this respect, they are similarto sub-mm-selected galaxies, although most laes have much lower mass.

1405.4869	rapid decline of lyman-alpha emission toward the reionization era	the observed deficit of strongly lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;6.5 isattributed to either increasing neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium(igm) and/or to the evolving galaxy properties. to investigate this, we haveperformed very deep near-ir spectroscopy of z&gt;7 galaxies using mosfire on thekeck-i telescope. we measure the lyman-alpha fraction at z~8 (combinedphotometric redshift peak at z=7.7) using two methods. first, we derivednly{\alpha}/ntot directly using extensive simulations to correct forincompleteness. second, we used a bayesian formalism (introduced by treu et al.2012) that compares the z&gt;7 galaxy spectra to models of the lyman-alphaequivalent width (wly{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. we explored two simpleevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where lyman-alpha is attenuated in allgalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolutionor a slowly increasing igm opacity), and patchy evolution where lyman-alpha isblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the igm being opaque alongonly some fraction of sightlines). the bayesian formalism places strongerconstraints compared with the direct method. combining our data with that inthe literature we find that at z~8 the lyman-alpha fraction has dropped by afactor &gt;3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy scenarioscompared to the z~6 values. furthermore, we find a tentative evidence that thedata favor the patchy scenario over smooth (with "positive" bayesian evidence),extending trends observed at z~7 to higher redshift. if this decrease is aresult of reionization as predicted by theory, then our data imply the volumeaveraged neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm to be &gt;0.3 suggesting that thereionization of the universe is in progress at z~8.

1410.5439	the evolution of the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function  over the first two billion years	we present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet(uv) luminosity function at z=4-8. we use deep hubble space telescope imagingover the candels/goods fields, the hubble ultra deep field and the year 1hubble frontier field deep parallel observations. these surveys provides aneffective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us toperform a robust search for faint (m_uv=-18) and bright (m_uv &lt; -21) galaxies.we select candidate galaxies using a well-tested photometric redshift techniquewith careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446 galaxies at3.5&lt;z&lt;8.5, with &gt;1000 galaxies at z~6-8. we measure the luminosity functionusing a markov chain monte carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. atthe faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higherabundance of uv-bright galaxies at z&gt;6, with m* ~ -21 at z&gt;5, different thanthat inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. at z=8, a singlepower-law provides an equally good fit to the uv luminosity function, while atz=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. wecompare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in m* isconsistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-endof the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. we measure theevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dustattenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z&gt;4,consistent with observations at z&gt;9. our observations are consistent with areionization history that starts at z&gt;10, completes at z&gt;6, and reaches amidpoint (x_hii = 0.5) at 6.7&lt;z&lt;9.4. finally, our observations predict that theabundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies.

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

1504.00005	an increasing stellar baryon fraction in bright galaxies at high  redshift	recent observations have shown that the characteristic luminosity of therest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function does not significantly evolveat 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 and is approximately m*_uv ~ -21. we investigate this apparentnon-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, m_uv &lt; -21 galaxies at z=4to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. including deepspitzer/irac imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find thatm*_uv galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(m/msol)=9.6-9.9 andare thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. however, bright galaxiesat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly brightgalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formationrates and levels of dust attenuation. we match the abundances of these brightz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the bolshoi lambda-cdm simulation toestimate the halo masses. we find that the typical halo masses in ~m*_uvgalaxies decrease from log(m_h/msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(m_h/msol)=11.4 at z=7.thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multipleredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. thestellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean omega_b/omega_m rises from5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigmalevel. this rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, isallowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars athigh redshifts.

1505.01160	uvudf: ultraviolet through near-infrared catalog and photometric  redshifts of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field	we present photometry and derived redshifts from up to eleven bandpasses for9927 galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field (udf), covering an observedwavelength range from the near-ultraviolet (nuv) to the near-infrared (nir)with hubble space telescope observations. our wide field camera 3 (wfc3)/uvf225w, f275w, and f336w image mosaics from the ultra-violet udf (uvudf) imagingcampaign are newly calibrated to correct for charge transfer inefficiency, anduse new dark calibrations to minimize background gradients and pattern noise.our nir wfc3/ir image mosaics combine the imaging from the udf09 and udf12campaigns with candels data to provide nir coverage for the entire udf field ofview. we use aperture-matched point-spread function corrected photometry tomeasure photometric redshifts in the udf, sampling both the lyman break andbalmer break of galaxies at z~0.8-3.4, and one of the breaks over the rest ofthe redshift range. our comparison of these results with a compilation ofrobust spectroscopic redshifts shows an improvement in the galaxy photometricredshifts by a factor of two in scatter and a factor three in outlier fractionover previous udf catalogs. the inclusion of the new nuv data is responsiblefor a factor of two decrease in the outlier fraction compared to redshiftsdetermined from only the optical and nir data, and improves the scatter atz&lt;0.5 and at z&gt;2. the panchromatic coverage of the udf from the nuv through thenir yields robust photometric redshifts of the udf, with the lowest outlierfraction available.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1505.03877	surveying galaxy proto-clusters in emission: a large-scale structure at  z=2.44 and the outlook for hetdex	galaxy proto-clusters at z &gt;~ 2 provide a direct probe of the rapid massassembly and galaxy growth of present day massive clusters. because of the needof precise galaxy redshifts for density mapping and the prevalence of starformation before quenching, nearly all the proto-clusters known to date wereconfirmed by spectroscopy of galaxies with strong emission lines. therefore,large emission-line galaxy surveys provide an efficient way to identifyproto-clusters directly. here we report the discovery of a large-scalestructure at z = 2.44 in the hetdex pilot survey. on a scale of a few tens ofmpc comoving, this structure shows a complex overdensity of lya emitters (lae),which coincides with broad-band selected galaxies in the cosmos/ultravistaphotometric and zcosmos spectroscopic catalogs, as well as overdensities ofintergalactic gas revealed in the lya absorption maps of lee et al. (2014). weconstruct mock lae catalogs to predict the cosmic evolution of this structure.we find that such an overdensity should have already broken away from thehubble flow, and part of the structure will collapse to form a galaxy clusterwith 10^14.5 +- 0.4 m_sun by z = 0. the structure contains a higher medianstellar mass of broad-band selected galaxies, a boost of extended lya nebulae,and a marginal excess of active galactic nuclei relative to the field,supporting a scenario of accelerated galaxy evolution in cluster progenitors.based on the correlation between galaxy overdensity and the z = 0 descendanthalo mass calibrated in the simulation, we predict that several hundred 1.9 &lt; z&lt; 3.5 proto-clusters with z = 0 mass of &gt; 10^14.5 m_sun will be discovered inthe 8.5 gpc^3 of space surveyed by the hobby eberly telescope dark energyexperiment.

1509.06381	probing the physical properties of z=4.5 lyman alpha emitters with  spitzer	we present the results from a stellar population modeling analysis of asample of 162 z=4.5, and 14 z=5.7 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) in thebootes field, using deep spitzer/irac data at 3.6 and 4.5 um from the spitzerlyman alpha survey, along with hubble space telescope nicmos and wfc3 imagingat 1.1 and 1.6 um for a subset of the laes. this represents one of the largestsamples of high-redshift laes imaged with spitzer irac. we find that 30/162(19%) of the z=4.5 laes and 9/14 (64%) of the z=5.7 laes are detected at&gt;3-sigma in at least one irac band. individual z=4.5 irac-detected laes have alarge range of stellar mass, from 5x10^8 to 10^11 msol. one-third of theirac-detected laes have older stellar population ages of 100 myr - 1 gyr, whilethe remainder have ages &lt; 100 myr. a stacking analysis of irac-undetected laesshows this population to be primarily low mass (8 -- 20 x 10^8 msol) and young(64 - 570 myr). we find a correlation between stellar mass and thedust-corrected ultraviolet-based star-formation rate (sfr) similar to that atlower redshifts, in that higher mass galaxies exhibit higher sfrs. however, thez=4.5 lae correlation is elevated 4-5 times in sfr compared tocontinuum-selected galaxies at similar redshifts. the exception is the mostmassive laes which have sfrs similar to galaxies at lower redshifts suggestingthat they may represent a different population of galaxies than the traditionallower-mass laes, perhaps with a different mechanism promoting lyman alphaphoton escape.

1512.03063	hst emission line galaxies at z ~ 2: comparing physical properties of  lyman alpha and optical emission line selected galaxies	we compare the physical and morphological properties of z ~ 2 lyman-alphaemitting galaxies (laes) identified in the hetdex pilot survey and narrow bandstudies with those of z ~ 2 optical emission line galaxies (oelgs) identifiedvia hst wfc3 infrared grism spectroscopy. both sets of galaxies extend over thesame range in stellar mass (7.5 &lt; logm &lt; 10.5), size (0.5 &lt; r &lt; 3.0 kpc), andstar-formation rate (~1 &lt; sfr &lt; 100). remarkably, a comparison of the mostcommonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-lightradius, uv slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance,star formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [o iii]luminosity, and [o iii] equivalent width -- reveals no statisticallysignificant differences between the populations. this suggests that theprocesses and conditions which regulate the escape of ly-alpha from a z ~ 2star-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. in particular, the lackof dependence on the uv slope suggests that ly-alpha emission is not beingsignificantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. we developa simple model of ly-alpha emission that connects laes to all high-redshiftstar forming galaxies where the escape of ly-alpha depends on the sightlinethrough the galaxy. using this model, we find that mean solid angle forly-alpha escape is 2.4+/-0.8 steradians; this value is consistent with thosecalculated from other studies.

0806.3269	lyman alpha galaxies: primitive, dusty or evolved galaxies?	we present stellar population modeling results for 10 newly discovered lymanalpha emitting galaxies (laes), as well as four previously known laes at z ~4.5 in the chandra deep field - south. we fit stellar population models tothese objects in order to learn specifically if there exists more than oneclass of lae. past observational and theoretical evidence has shown that whilemany laes appear to be young, they may be much older, with lyman alpha ewsenhanced due to resonant scattering of lyman alpha photons in a clumpyinterstellar medium (ism). our results show a large range of stellar populationage (3 - 500 myr), stellar mass (1.6 x 10^8 - 5.0 x 10^10 msol) and dustextinction (a_1200 = 0.3 - 4.5 mag), broadly consistent with previous studies.with such a large number of individually analyzed objects, we have looked atthe distribution of stellar population ages in laes for the first time, and wefind a very interesting bimodality, in that our objects are either very young(&lt; 15 myr) or old (&gt; 450 myr). this bimodality may be caused by dust, and itcould explain the lyman alpha duty cycle which has been proposed in theliterature. we find that eight of the young objects are best fit with a clumpyism. we find that dust geometry appears to play a large role in shaping theseds that we observe, and that it may be a major factor in the observed lymanalpha equivalent width distribution in high redshift lyman alpha galaxies,although other factors (i.e. outflows) may be in play. we conclude that 12 outof our 14 laes are dusty star-forming galaxies, with the other two laes beingevolved galaxies.

astro-ph;0601543	optical structure and proper-motion age of the oxygen-rich supernova  remnant 1e 0102-7219 in the small magellanic cloud	we present new optical emission-line images of the young snr 1e 0102-7219(e0102) in the smc obtained with the hst advanced camera for surveys (acs).e0102 is a member of the oxygen-rich class of snrs showing strong oxygen, neon, and other metal-line emissions in its optical and x-ray spectra, and anabsence of h and he. the progenitor of e0102 may have been a wolf-rayet starthat underwent considerable mass loss prior to exploding as a type ib/c oriil/b sn. the ejecta in this snr are fast-moving (v &gt; 1000 km/s) and emit asthey are compressed and heated in the reverse shock. in 2003, we obtainedoptical [o iii], h-alpha, and continuum images with the acs wide field camera.the [o iii] image captures the full velocity range of the ejecta, and showsconsiderable high-velocity emission projected in the middle of the snr that wasdoppler-shifted out of the narrow f502n bandpass of a previous wide field andplanetary camera 2 image from 1995. using these two epochs separated by ~8.5years, we measure the transverse expansion of the ejecta around the outer rimin this snr for the first time at visible wavelengths. from proper-motionmeasurements of 12 ejecta filaments, we estimate a mean expansion velocity forthe bright ejecta of ~2000 km/s and an inferred kinematic age for the snr of\~2050 +/- 600 years. the age we derive from hst data is about twice thatinferred by hughes et al.(2000) from x-ray data, though our 1-sigma error barsoverlap. our proper-motion age is consistent with an independent opticalkinematic age derived by eriksen et al.(2003) using spatially resolved [o iii]radial-velocity data. we derive an expansion center that lies very close tox-ray and radio hotspots, which could indicate the presence of a compactremnant (neutron star or black hole).

astro-ph;0612511	the ages and masses of lyman alpha galaxies at redshift $z\sim 4.5$	we examine the stellar populations of a sample of 98 redshift 4.5 lyman alphaemitting galaxies using their broadband colors derived from deep photometry atthe mmt. these galaxies were selected by narrowband excess from the large arealyman alpha survey. twenty-two galaxies are detected in two or more of our mmtfilters (g', r', i' and z'). by comparing broad and narrowband colors of thesegalaxies to synthetic colors from stellar population models, we determine theirages and stellar masses. the highest equivalent width objects have an averageage of 4 myr, consistent with ongoing star formation. the lowest ew objectsshow an age of 40 - 200 myr, consistent with the expectation that largernumbers of stars are causing low ews. we found masses ranging from 2e7 solarmasses for the youngest objects in the sample to 2e9 solar masses for theoldest. it is possible that dust effects could produce large equivalent widthseven in older populations by allowing the lyman alpha photons to escape, evenwhile the continuum is extinguished, and we present models for this scenarioalso.
