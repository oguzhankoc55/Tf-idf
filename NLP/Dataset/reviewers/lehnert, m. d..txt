0902.2784	physical conditions in the ism of intensely star-forming galaxies at  redshift~2	we analyze the physical conditions in the interstellar gas of 11 activelystar-forming galaxies at z~2, based on integral-field spectroscopy from theeso-vlt and hst/nicmos imaging. we concentrate on the high h-alpha surfacebrightnesses, large line widths, line ratios and the clumpy nature of thesegalaxies. we show that photoionization calculations and emission linediagnostics imply gas pressures and densities that are similar to the mostintense nearby star-forming regions at z=0 but over much larger scales (10-20kpc). a relationship between surface brightness and velocity dispersion can beexplained through simple energy injection arguments and a scaling set by nearbygalaxies with no free parameters. the high velocity dispersions are a naturalconsequence of intense star formation thus regions of high velocity dispersionare not evidence for mass concentrations such as bulges or rings. externalmechanisms like cosmological gas accretion generally do not have enough energyto sustain the high velocity dispersions. in some cases, the high pressures andlow gas metallicites may make it difficult to robustly distinguish between agnionization cones and star formation, as we show for bzk-15504 at z=2.38. weconstruct a picture where the early stages of galaxy evolution are driven byself-gravity which powers strong turbulence until the velocity dispersion ishigh. then massive, dense, gas-rich clumps collapse, triggering star formationwith high efficiencies and intensities as observed. at this stage, the intensestar formation is likely self-regulated by the mechanical energy output ofmassive stars.

0903.0862	co line emission in the halo of a radio galaxy at z=2.6	we report the detection of luminous co(3-2) line emission in the halo of thez=2.6 radio galaxy (hzrg) txs0828+193, which has no detected counterpart atoptical to mid-infrared wavelengths implying a stellar mass &lt; few x10^9 m_sunand relatively low star-formation rates. with the iram pdbi we find two coemission line components at the same position at ~80 kpc distance from the hzrgalong the axis of the radio jet, with different blueshifts of few 100 km s^-1relative to the hzrg and a total luminosity of ~2x10^10 k km s^-1 pc^2 detectedat 8 sigma significance. hzrgs have significant galaxy overdensities andextended halos of metal-enriched gas often with embedded clouds or filaments ofdenser material, and likely trace very massive dark-matter halos. the coemission may be associated with a gas-rich, low-mass satellite galaxy withlittle on-going star formation, in contrast to all previous co detections ofgalaxies at similar redshifts. alternatively, the co may be related to a gascloud or filament and perhaps jet-induced gas cooling in the outer halo,somewhat in analogy with extended co emission found in low-redshift galaxyclusters.

0903.1872	the sins survey: sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of z ~ 2  star-forming galaxies	we present the sins survey with sinfoni of high redshift galaxies. with 80objects observed and 63 detected, sins is the largest survey of spatiallyresolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forminggalaxies at z~1-3. we describe the selection of the targets, the observations,and the data reduction. we then focus on the "sins halpha sample" of 62rest-uv/optically-selected sources at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.6 for which we targeted primarilythe halpha and [nii] emission lines. only 30% of this sample had previousnear-ir spectroscopic observations. as a whole, the sins halpha sample covers areasonable representation of massive log(m*/msun)&gt;~10 star-forming galaxies atz~1.5-2.5, with some bias towards bluer systems compared to pure k-selectedsamples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. the sample spans twoorders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formationrates, with median values of approximately log(m*/msun) = 10.5, 70 msun/yr, and3/gyr. the ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved onscales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations totypically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. the halpha morphologies tend to beirregular and/or clumpy. about one-third are rotation-dominated yet turbulentdisks, another third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominatedobjects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; thefraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part ofthe sample. the halpha luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on averageroughly twice higher dust attenuation towards the hii regions relative to thebulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formationrates.

0903.2846	on the survival of metallicity gradients to major dry-mergers	using a large suite of galaxies with a variety of concentrations andmetallicity gradients, we study the evolution of non-dissipative ("dry") equalmass mergers. our purpose in generating these simulations is to explore how themetallicity gradient in dry mergers depends on the structure and metallicitygradients of the galaxies involved in the merger. specifically, we would liketo answer: could dry mergers lead to metallicity gradients as observed inelliptical galaxies in the local universe? do dry mergers always lead to aflattening of the initial (i.e., pre-merger) gradient? from this modeling, weconclude that: the ratio of the remnant and the initial galaxy slopes span awide range of values, up to values greater than 1 (with values greater than oneresulting only when companions have gradients twice the progenitor). for amerger between two ellipticals having identical initial metallicity slopes(i.e., equal companion and galaxy slopes), the metallicity profile of theremnant flattens, with a final gradient about 0.6 times the initial one.ellipticals can maintain their original pre-merger metallicity gradient if thecompanion slope is sufficiently steep. the amount of flattening neither dependson the characteristics of the orbit of the progenitors or on their initialconcentration. given the diversity in outcomes of the mergers, we conclude thatdry mergers do not violate any observational constraints on the systematiccharacteristics of metallicity gradients in local ellipticals. in fact, drymergers may be important within the context of the results of our simulationsand may explain the large scatter in gradients for massive ellipticals and therelative paucity of massive ellipticals with no or shallow metallicitygradients.

0906.0010	generation of rotationally dominated galaxies by mergers of  pressure-supported progenitors	through the analysis of a set of numerical simulations of major mergersbetween initially non-rotating, pressure supported progenitor galaxies with arange of central mass concentrations, we have shown that: (1) it is possible togenerate elliptical-like galaxies, with v/sigma &gt; 1 outside one effectiveradius, as a result of the conversion of orbital- into internal-angularmomentum; (2) the outer regions acquire part of the angular momentum first; (3)both the baryonic and the dark matter components of the remnant galaxy acquirepart of the angular momentum, the relative fractions depend on the initialconcentration of the merging galaxies. for this conversion to occur the initialbaryonic component must be sufficiently dense and/or the encounter should takeplace on a orbit with high angular momentum. systems with these hybridproperties have been recently observed through a combination of stellarabsorption lines and planetary nebulae for kinematic studies of early-typegalaxies. our results are in qualitative agreement with such observations anddemonstrate that even mergers composed of non-rotating, pressure-supportedprogenitor galaxies can produce early-type galaxies with significant rotationat large radii.

0909.0746	photometric selection of z~5 lyman break galaxies in the eso remote  galaxy survey	we describe the selection of a sample of photometrically-defined lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) at z~5 using the multi-wavelength imaging data of the esoremote galaxy survey (ergs). the data is drawn from ten widely-separated fieldscovering a total sky area of 275 arcmin squared. starting with a simple colour(r-i&gt;1.3) and magnitude (i&lt;26.3) cut to isolate the lyman break and thenrefining the sample by applying further optical and near-infrared photometriccriteria we identify a sample of 253 lbg candidates. we carefully model thecompleteness of this sample and the factors that affect its reliability. thereis considerable overlap between this sample and a spectroscopically-confirmedsample drawn from the same survey and this allows us to determine thereliability of the optical photometric selection (~60 per cent) and to showthat the reliability can be significantly improved (to ~80 per cent) byapplying near-infrared waveband criteria to exclude very red contaminants. eventhis high level of reliability may compromise some statistical studies of lbgproperties. we show that over 30 per cent of the highest reliability candidateshave multiple uv-luminous components and/or disturbed morphology in hstimaging, though it is unclear whether this represents multipleinteracting/merging sources or individual large sources with multiple uv brightregions. using this sample we confirm that the normalisation of the bright endof the z=5 uv luminosity function (down to m*) is lower than the same at z=4 bya factor of 3. using a schechter fit we determine m*uv=-20.9+/-0.2. we discusswhether it is reasonable to expect the uv luminosity function to follow aschechter function, given the uv emission is short-lived and stochastic, anddoes not necessarily trace the underlying mass of the galaxy.

1003.3449	energetics of the molecular gas in the h_2 luminous radio galaxy 3c 326:  evidence for negative agn feedback	we present a detailed analysis of the gas conditions in the h_2 luminousradio galaxy 3c326n at z~0.1, which has a low star formation rate (sfr~0.07m_sun/yr) in spite of a gas surface density similar to those in starburstgalaxies. its star-formation efficiency is likely a factor ~20-30 lower thanthose of ordinary star-forming galaxies. combining new iram co emission-lineinterferometry with existing spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, we find thatthe luminosity ratio of co and pure rotational h_2 line emission is factors10-100 lower than what is usually found. this may suggest that most of themolecular gas is warm. the na d absorption-line profile of 3c326n in theoptical suggests an outflow with a terminal velocity of ~ -1800 km/s and a massoutflow rate of 30-40 m_sun/yr, which cannot be explained by star formation.the mechanical power implied by the wind, of order 10^43 erg/s, is comparableto the bolometric luminosity of the emission lines of ionized and moleculargas. to explain these observations, we propose a scenario where a smallfraction of the mechanical energy of the radio jet is deposited in the theinterstellar medium of 3c326n, which powers the outflow, and the line emissionthrough a mass momentum and energy exchange between the different phases in theism. dissipation times are of order 10^7-8 yrs, similar or greater than thetypical jet lifetime. small ratios of co and pah surface brightnesses inanother 7 h_2 luminous radio galaxies suggest that a similar form of agnfeedback could be lowering star formation efficiencies in these galxies asimilar way. the local demographics of radio-loud agn suggests that secular gascooling in massive early-type galaxies of &gt;= 10^11 m_sun could be regulatedthrough a fundamentally similar form of 'maintenance-phase' agn feedback.

1004.1178	a redshift survey towards the cmb cold spot	we have carried out a redshift survey using the vimos spectrograph on the vlttowards the cosmic microwave background cold spot. a possible cause of the coldspot is the integrated sachs-wolfe effect imprinted by an extremely large void(hundreds of mpc in linear dimension) at intermediate or low redshifts. theredshift distribution of over seven hundred z&lt;1 emission-line galaxies drawnfrom an i-band flux limited sample of galaxies in the direction of the coldspot shows no evidence of a gap on scales of delta-z&gt; 0.05 as would be expectedif such a void existed at 0.35&lt;z&lt;1. there are troughs in the redshiftdistribution on smaller scales (delta-z ~0.01) indicating that smaller scalevoids may connect regions separated by several degrees towards the cold spot. acomparison of this distribution with that generated from similarly-sizedsubsamples drawn from widely-spaced pointings of the vvds survey does notindicate that the redshift distribution towards the cold spot is anomalous orthat these small gaps can be uniquely attributed to real voids.

1007.2847	spectroscopy of z~5 lyman break galaxies in the eso remote galaxy survey	(abridged) we present the global results of a large spectroscopic surveycarried out in order to identify z~ 5 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) across tenwidely-separated fields to i_{ab}=26.3. the redshifts of seventy 4.6&lt;z&lt;5.6 lbgswere identified. we find no significant difference in the frequency of highequivalent-width line emitters between z~3 and our z~5 samples. the rest-frameuv continuum slope of a typical z~5 line-emitting galaxy is bluer than that ofa typical break-only galaxy, a difference that is difficult to explain purelyby differences in the ages of their stellar populations. variation inmetallicity and/or dust extinction can more straightforwardly account for thisdifference. given their uv-continuum slopes, the typical z~5 lbgs havemetallicities a factor of three lower than those of lbgs at z~3. hst imagingindicates that a large majority of the spectroscopically-confirmed lbgs in oursample are members of multiple systems and/or show disturbed morphology. usinglocal lbg analogues as a model, this multiplicity could be explained either bysuper-starburst regions within a larger unseen structure, or by a highincidence of merging events at this epoch. the current data cannot distinguishbetween these two possibilities. the surface density of z~5 lbgs in two fieldsis considerably higher than in the rest. both show clear spikes in theirredshift distributions indicating strong three-dimensional clustering. neitherstructure can be bound given their depth in redshift and probably extend beyondthe observed fields. the three-dimensional distances between lbgs in thestructures are too large for them to have triggered their starbursts throughmutual gravitational interaction, and so it is likely that the short-lived lbgsrepresent only a small fraction of the baryons in the structures.

1007.3989	limits on the molecular gas content of z-5 lbgs	we present limits on the molecular gas content of lyman break galaxies (lbgs)at z~5 from observations targetting redshifted co(1-0) and co(2-1) lineemission. we observed a single field containing eightspectroscopically-confirmed z~5 lbgs, seven of which are contained within anarrow (z=4.95\pm 0.08) redshift range and the eighth is at z=5.2. no sourcewas individually detected. assuming the co to h2 conversion factor for vigorousstarbursts, we place upper limits on the molecular gas content of individualz~5 lbgs of m(h2)&lt;~10^10 msun. from a stacking analysis combining all of thenon-detections, the typical z~5 lbg has an h2 mass limit comparable to theirstellar mass, &lt; 3.1 x 10^9 msun. this limit implies that, given the starformation rates of these systems (measured from their uv emission), starformation could be sustained for at most ~100myr, similar to the typical agesof their stellar populations. the lack of a substantially larger reservoir ofcold gas argues against the lbgs being uv luminous super starbursts embedded inmuch larger uv-dark systems and as a result increases the likelihood that atleast those lbgs with multiple components are starbursts triggered by mergers.the sources responsible for reionization are expected to be starbursts similarto these systems, but with lower luminosities, masses and consequently withstar formation timescales far shorter than the recombination timescale. if so,the ionized bubbles expected in the igm during the reionization era willinfrequently have uv-luminous sources at their centres.

0708.3000	the physical properties of lbgs at z&gt;5: outflows and the "pre-enrichment  problem"	we discuss the properties of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z&gt;5 as determinedfrom disparate fields covering approximately 500 sq. arcmin. while the broadcharacteristics of the lbg population has been discussed extensively in theliterature, such as luminosity functions and clustering amplitude, we focus onthe detailed physical properties of the sources in this large survey (&gt;100 withspectroscopic redshifts). specifically, we discuss ensemble mass estimates,stellar mass surface densities, core phase space densities, star-formationintensities, characteristics of their stellar populations, etc as obtained frommulti-wavelength data (rest-frame uv through optical) for a subsample of thesegalaxies. in particular, we focus on evidence that these galaxies drivevigorous outflows and speculate that this population may solve the so-called``pre-enrichment problem''. the general picture that emerges from these studiesis that these galaxies, observed about 1 gyr after the big bang, haveproperties consistent with being the progenitors of the densest stellar systemsin the local universe -- the centers of old bulges and early type galaxies.

0708.4150	compact radio sources and jet-driven agn feedback in the early universe:  constraints from integral-field spectroscopy	to investigate the impact of radio jets during the formation epoch of theirmassive host galaxies, we present an analysis of two massive, log(m_stel/m_sun)~10.6 and 11.3, compact radio galaxies at z=3.5, tnj0205+2242 andtnj0121+1320. their small radio sizes (r&lt;= 10 kpc) are most likely a sign ofyouth. we compare their radio properties and gas dynamics with those in wellextended radio galaxies at high redshift, which show strong evidence forpowerful, jet-driven outflows of significant gas masses (m 10^9-10 m_sun). ouranalysis combines rest-frame optical integral-field spectroscopy with existingradio imaging, co emission line spectra, and rest-frame uv spectroscopy.[oiii]5007 line emission is compact in both galaxies and lies within the regiondefined by the radio lobes. for tnj0205+2242, the ly-alpha profile narrowssignificantly outside the jet radius, indicating the presence of a quiescenthalo. tnj0121+1320 has two components separated by ~10 kpc and a velocityoffset of ~300 km s^-1. if motions are gravitational, this implies a dynamicalmass of 2x10^11 m_sun for the more massive, radio-loud component. the dynamicalmass, molecular gas mass measured from the co line emission, and radioluminosity of these two compact radio galaxies imply that compact radio sourcesmay well develop large-scale, energetic outflows as observed in extended radiogalaxies, with the potential of removing significant fractions of the ism fromthe host galaxy. the absence of luminous emission line gas extending beyond theradio emission in these sources agrees with the observed timescales and outflowrates in extended radio galaxies, and adds further evidence that the energetic,large-scale outflows observed in extended radio sources (nesvadba et al. 2006)are indeed the result of influence of the radio jet.

1010.4312	spectroscopic confirmation of a galaxy at redshift z=8.6	galaxies had their most significant impact on the universe when theyassembled their first generations of stars. energetic photons emitted by young,massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surroundingtheir host galaxies, cleared sight-lines along which the light of the younggalaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of theintergalactic gas in the universe continuously until the present day.observations of the cosmic microwave background, and of galaxies and quasars atthe highest redshifts, suggest that the universe was reionised through acomplex process that was completed about a billion years after the big bang, byredshift z~6. detecting ionizing ly-alpha photons from increasingly distantgalaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of thesources responsible for reionisation. here we report the detection of ly-aphotons emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang. udfy-38135539is at a redshift z=8.5549+-0.0002, which is greater than those of thepreviously known most distant objects, at z=8.2 and z=6.97. we find that thissingle source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volumenecessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contributionfrom other, probably fainter galaxies nearby.

1011.3825	the formation of a thick disk through the heating of a thin disk:  agreement with orbital eccentricities of stars in the solar neighborhood	we study the distribution of orbital eccentricities of stars in thick disksgenerated by the heating of a pre-existing thin stellar disk through a minormerger (mass ratio 1:10), using n-body/sph numerical simulations ofinteractions that span a range of gas fractions in the primary disk and initialorbital configurations. the resulting eccentricity distributions have anapproximately triangular shape, with a peak at 0.2-0.35, and a relativelysmooth decline towards higher values. stars originally in the satellite galaxytend to have higher eccentricities (on average from e = 0.45 to e = 0.75),which is in general agreement with the models of sales and collaborators,although in detail we find fewer stars with extreme values and no evidence oftheir secondary peak around e = 0.8. the absence of this high-eccentricityfeature results in a distribution that qualitatively matches the observations.moreover, the increase in the orbital eccentricities of stars in the solarneighborhood with vertical distance from the galactic mid-plane recently foundby diericxk and collaborators can be qualitatively reproduced by our models,but only if the satellite is accreted onto a direct orbit. we thus speculatethat if minor mergers were the dominant means of formating the milky way thickdisk, the primary mechanism should be merging with satellite(s) on directorbits.

1102.2234	gas inflows, star formation and metallicity evolution in galaxy pairs	it has been known since many decades that galaxy interactions can induce starformation (hereafter sf) enhancements and that one of the driving mechanisms ofthis enhancement is related to gas inflows into the central galaxy regions,induced by asymmetries in the stellar component, like bars. in the last yearsmany evidences have been accumulating, showing that interacting pairs havecentral gas-phase metallicities lower than those of field galaxies, by {\sim}0.2-0.3 dex on average. these diluted ism metallicities have been explained asthe result of inflows of metal-poor gas from the outer disk to the galaxycentral regions. a number of questions arises: what's the timing and theduration of this dilution? how and when does the sf induced by the gas inflowenrich the circumnuclear gas with re-processed material? is there anycorrelation between the timing and strength of the dilution and the timing andintensity of the sf? by means of tree-sph simulations of galaxy majorinteractions, we have studied the effect that gas inflows have on the ismdilution, and the effect that the induced sf has, subsequently, in re-enrichingthe nuclear gas. in this contribution, we present the main results of thisstudy.

1104.1176	a sinfoni view of flies in the spiderweb: a galaxy cluster in the making	the environment of the high-z radio galaxy pks 1138-262 at z~2.2 is a primeexample of a forming galaxy cluster. we use deep sinfoni data to perform adetailed study of the kinematics of the galaxies within 60 kpc of the radiocore and we link this to the kinematics of the protocluster on the megaparsecscale. identification of optical emission lines shows that 11 galaxies are atthe redshift of the protocluster. the density of line emitters is more than anorder of magnitude higher in the core of the protocluster than the larger scaleenvironment. this implies a matter overdensity in the core of delta_m~70 whichis similar to the outskirts of local galaxy clusters. the velocity distributionof the confirmed satellite galaxies shows a broad, double-peaked velocitystructure with sigma=1360+/-206 km/s. a similar broad, double-peakeddistribution was found in a previous study targeting the large scaleprotocluster structure, indicating that a common process is acting on bothsmall and large scales. including all spectroscopically confirmed protoclustergalaxies, a velocity dispersion of 1013+/-87 km/s is found. we show that theprotocluster has likely decoupled from the hubble flow and is a dynamicallyevolved structure. comparison to the millenium simulation indicates that theprotocluster velocity distribution is consistent with that of the most massivehaloes at z~2, but we rule out that the protocluster is a fully virializedstructure based on dynamical arguments and its x-ray luminosity. comparison tomerging haloes in the millennium simulation shows that the structure asobserved in and around the spiderweb galaxy is best interpreted as being theresult of a merger between two massive haloes. we propose that this merger canresult in an increase in star formation and agn activity in the protoclustercore and is possibly an important stage in the evolution of massive cdgalaxies.

1107.1037	the na d profiles of nearby low-power radio sources: jets powering  outflows	(abridged) we have analyzed the properties of the na d doublet lines in alarge sample of 691 radio galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).these radio galaxies are resolved in the first survey, have redshifts less that0.2 and radio flux densities at 1.4 ghz higher than 40 mjy. approximately 1/3of the sources show a significant excess (above that contributed by theirstellar populations) of na d absorption that can be robustly fitted with twovoigt profiles representing the na d doublet. a further 1/6 of the sources showresidual absorption, for which the fits were not well constrained though while~50% of the sample show no significant residual absorption. the residualabsorption is modestly blueshifted, typically by ~50 km/s, but the velocitydispersions are high, generally ~500 km/s. assuming that the size of theabsorbing region is consistent with ~1 kpc for dust lanes in a sample ofgenerally more powerful radio sources and a continuous constant velocity flow(continuity equation), we estimate mass and energy outflow rates of about 10msun/yr and few x e42 erg/s. these rates are consistent with those in theliterature based on hi absorption line observations of radio galaxies. theenergy required to power these outflows is on the order of 1-10% of the jetmechanical power and we conclude that the radio jet alone is sufficient. themass and energy outflow rates are consistent with what is needed to heat/expelthe mass returned by the stellar populations as well as the likely amount ofgas from a cooling halo. this suggests that radio-loud agn play a key role inenergizing the outflow/heating phase of the feedback cycle. the deposition ofthe jet mechanical energy could be important for explaining the ensemblecharacteristics of massive early type galaxies in the local universe.

1109.1820	the average optical spectra of intense starbursts at z~2: outflows and  the pressurization of the ism	an important property of star-forming galaxies at z~1-2 is the high localstar-formation intensities they maintain over tens of kiloparsecs at levelsthat are only observed in the nearby universe in the most powerful nuclearstarbursts. to investigate how these high star-formation intensities affect thewarm ionized medium, we present an analysis of the average spectra of about 50such galaxies at z~1.2-2.6 and of subsamples selected according to their localand global star-formation intensity. stacking allows us to probe relativelyweak lines like [sii]\lambda \lambda 6716,6731 and [oi]\lambda 6300, which aretracers of the conditions of the ism and are undetectable in most individualtargets. we find higher gas densities (hence pressures) in intenselystar-forming regions compared to fainter diffuse gas and, overall, values thatare comparable to starburst regions and the diffuse ism in nearby galaxies. bymodeling the h\alpha\ surface brightnesses and [sii]/h\alpha\ line ratios withthe cloudy photoionization code, we find that our galaxies continue trendsobserved in local galaxies, where gas pressures scale with star-formationintensity. we discuss these results in the context of models of self-regulatedstar formation, where star formation determines the average thermal andturbulent pressure in the ism, which in turn determines the rate at which starscan form, finding good agreement with our data. we also confirm the detectionof broad, faint lines underlying h\alpha\ and [nii], which have previously beenconsidered evidence of either outflows or active galactic nuclei. finding thatthe broad component is only significantly detected in stacks with the highestaverage local and global star-formation intensities strongly supports theoutflow interpretation, and further emphasizes the importance of star-formationfeedback and self-regulation in the early universe.

1110.0769	minor mergers and their impact on the kinematics of old and young  stellar populations in disk galaxies	by means of n-body simulations we investigate the impact of minor mergers onthe angular momentum and dynamical properties of the merger remnant. oursimulations cover a range of initial orbital characteristics and gas-to-stellarmass fractions (from 0 to 20%), and include star formation and supernovafeedback. we confirm and extend previous results by showing that the specificangular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independently of theorbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, and that the decrease in therotation velocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in theanisotropy of the orbits. however, the decrease affects only the old stellarpopulation, and not the new population formed from gas during the mergingprocess. this means that the merging process induces an increasing differencein the rotational support of the old and young stellar components, with the oldone lagging with respect to the new. even if our models are not intendedspecifically to reproduce the milky way and its accretion history, we findthat, under certain conditions, the modeled rotational lag found is compatiblewith that observed in the milky way disk, thus indicating that minor mergerscan be a viable way to produce it. the lag can increase with the verticaldistance from the disk midplane, but only if the satellite is accreted along adirect orbit, and in all cases the main contribution to the lag comes fromstars originally in the primary disk rather than from stars in the satellitegalaxy. we also discuss the possibility of creating counter-rotating stars inthe remnant disk, their fraction as a function of the vertical distance fromthe galaxy midplane, and the cumulative effect of multiple mergers on theircreation.

1202.0511	the ionized gas in the califa early-type galaxies i. mapping two  representative cases: ngc 6762 and ngc 5966	as part of the califa survey, we conducted a thorough 2d analysis of theionized gas in two e/s0 galaxies, ngc6762 and ngc5966, aiming to shed light onthe nature of their warm ionized ism. we present optical ifs obtained with thepmas/ppak spectrophotometer. to recover the nebular lines, we subtracted theunderlying stellar continuum from the observed spectra using the starlightcode. in ngc6762, the ionized gas and stellar emission display similarmorphologies, while the emission line morphology is elongated in ngc5966,spanning ~6 kpc, and is oriented roughly orthogonal to the major axis of thestellar continuum ellipsoid. whereas gas and stars are kinematically aligned inngc6762, the gas is kinematically decoupled from the stars in ngc5966. adecoupled rotating disk or an ionization cone are two possible interpretationsof the elongated ionized gas structure in ngc5966. the latter would be thefirst ionization cone of such a dimension detected within a weak emission-linegalaxy. both galaxies have weak emission-lines relative to the continuum[ew(ha)&lt; 3 a] and have low excitation, log([oiii]5007/hb) &lt; 0.5. based onoptical diagnostic ratios([oiii]5007/hb,[nii]6584/ha,[sii]6717,6731/ha,[oi]6300/ha), both objectscontain a liner nucleus and an extended liner-like gas emission. the emissionline ratios do not vary significantly with radius or aperture, which indicatesthat the nebular properties are spatially homogeneous. the gas emission inngc6762 can be best explained by photoionization by pagb stars without the needof invoking any other excitation mechanism. in the case of ngc5966, thepresence of a nuclear ionizing source seems to be required to shape theelongated gas emission feature in the ionization cone scenario, althoughionization by pagb stars cannot be ruled out.(abridged)

0711.1491	integral-field spectroscopy of a lyman-break galaxy at z=3.2: evidence  for merging	we present spatially-resolved, rest-frame optical spectroscopy of a z~3lyman-break galaxy (lbg), q0347-383 c5, obtained with sinfoni on the vlt. thisgalaxy, among the ~10% brightest lbgs, is only the second z~3 lbg observed withan integral-field spectrograph. it was first described by pettini et al.(2001), who obtained wfpc2 f702w imaging and longslit spectroscopy in thek-band. we find that the emission line morphology is dominated by twounresolved blobs at a projected distance of ~5 kpc with a velocity offset of~33 km s^-1. velocity dispersions suggest that each blob has a mass of ~10^10m_sun. unlike pettini et al. (2001), our spectra are deep enough to detecth-beta, and we derive star-formation rates of ~20-40 m_sun yr^-1, and use theh-beta/[oiii] ratio to crudely estimate an oxygen abundance 12+[o/h]=7.9-8.6,which is in the range typically observed for lbgs. we compare the properties ofq0347-383 c5 with what is found for other lbgs, including the gravitationallylensed ``arc+core'' galaxy (nesvadba et al. 2006), and discuss possiblescenarios for the nature of the source, namely disk rotation, astarburst-driven wind, disk fragmentation, and merging of two lbgs. we favorthe merging interpretation or bright, extended lbgs like q0347-383c5, in broadagreement with predicted merger rates from hierarchical models.

1210.8150	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey. ii. first  public data release	we present the first public data release of the califa survey. it consists ofscience-grade optical datacubes for the first 100 of eventually 600 nearby(0.005&lt;z&lt;0.03) galaxies, obtained with the integral-field spectrographpmas/ppak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the calar alto observatory. thegalaxies in dr1 already cover a wide range of properties in color-magnitudespace, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionization conditions. thisoffers the potential to tackle a variety of open questions in galaxy evolutionusing spatially resolved spectroscopy. two different spectral setups areavailable for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution v500 setup covering the nominalwavelength range 3745-7500a with a spectral resolution of 6.0a (fwhm), and (ii)a medium-resolution v1200 setup covering the nominal wavelength range3650-4840a with a spectral resolution of 2.3a (fwhm). we present thecharacteristics and data structure of the califa datasets that should be takeninto account for scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the effectsof vignetting, bad pixels and spatially correlated noise. the data quality testfor all 100 galaxies showed that we reach a median limiting continuumsensitivity of 1.0x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 5635a and2.2x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 4500a for the v500 and v1200 setuprespectively, which corresponds to limiting r and g band surface brightnessesof 23.6mag/arcsec^2 and 23.4mag/arcsec^2, or an unresolved emission-line fluxdetection limit of roughly 1x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 and0.6x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, respectively. the median spatial resolution is3.7", and the absolute spectrophotometric calibration is better than 15%(1sigma). we also describe the available interfaces and tools that allow easyaccess to this first public califa data.

1304.3726	are z~5 qsos found in the most massive high redshift over-densities?	luminous high-redshift qsos are thought to exist within the most massive darkmatter haloes in the young universe. as a consequence they are likely to bemarkers for biased, over-dense regions where early galaxies cluster, regionsthat eventually grow into the groups and clusters seen in the lower redshiftuniverse. in this paper we explore the clustering of galaxies around z ~ 5 qsosas traced by lyman break galaxies (lbgs). we target the fields of three qsosusing the same optical imaging and spectroscopy techniques used in the esoremote galaxy survey (ergs, douglas et al. 2009, 2010), which was successful inidentifying individual clustered structures of lbgs. we use the statistics ofthe redshift clustering in ergs to show that two of the three fields showsignificant clustering of lbgs at the qso redshifts. neither of these fields isobviously over-dense in lbgs from the imaging alone; a possible reason whyprevious imaging-only studies of high-redshift qso environments have givenambiguous results. this result shows that luminous qsos at z ~ 5 are typicallyfound in over-dense regions. the richest qso field contains at least ninespectroscopically confirmed objects at the same redshift including the qsoitself, seven lbgs and a second fainter qso. while this is a very strongobservational signal of clustering at z ~ 5, it is of similar strength to thatseen in two structures identified in the 'blank sky' ergs fields. thisindicates that, while over-dense, the qso environments are not more extremethan other structures that can be identified at these redshifts. the threerichest structures discovered in this work and in ergs have propertiesconsistent with that expected for proto-clusters and likely represent the earlystages in the build-up of massive current-day groups and clusters.

1304.7734	on the self-regulation of intense star-formation in galaxies at z=1-3	(abridged) we have analyzed the properties of the rest-frame optical emissionlines of a sample of 53 intensely star forming galaxies at z=1.3 to 2.7observed with sinfoni on the eso-vlt. we find large velocity dispersions in thelines, sigma=30-250 km/s. our data agree well with simulations where we appliedbeam-smearing and assumed a scaling relation of the form: velocity dispersionis proportional to the square root of the star-formation intensity(star-formation rate per unit area). we conclude that the dispersions areprimarily driven by star formation. to explain the high surface brightness andoptical line ratios, high thermal pressures in the warm ionized medium, wim,are required (log p/k (k/cm^3)&gt;~6-7). such thermal pressures in the wim aresimilar to those observed in nearby starburst galaxies, but occur over muchlarger physical scales. moreover, the relatively low ionization parametersnecessary to fit the high surface brightnesses and optical line ratios suggestthat the gas is not only directly associated with regions of star formation,but is wide spread throughout the general ism. thus the optical emission linegas is a tracer of the large scale dynamics of the bulk of the ism. we presenta simple model for the energy input from young stars in an accreting galaxy, toargue that the intense star-formation is supporting high turbulent pressure,which roughly balances the gravitational pressure and thus enables distant gasaccreting disks to maintain a toomre disk instability parameter q~1. for a starformation efficiency of 3%, only 5-15% of the mechanical energy from youngstars that is deposited in the ism is needed to support the level of turbulencerequired for maintaining this balance. since this balance is maintained byenergy injected into the ism by the young stars themselves, this suggests thatstar formation in high redshift galaxies is self-regulating.

1305.2926	resolving the optical emission lines of lya blob 'b1' at z=2.38: another  hidden quasar	we have used the sinfoni near-infrared integral field unit on the vlt toresolve the optical emission line structure of one of the brightest (l~1e44erg/s) and nearest (z=2.38) of all lya blobs (labs). the target, known in theliterature as object 'b1' (francis et al. 1996), lies at a redshift where themain optical emission lines are accessible in the observed near-infrared. wedetect luminous [oiii]4959,5007a and ha emission with a spatial extent of atleast 32x40 kpc (4"x5"). the dominant optical emission line component showsrelatively broad lines (600-800 km/s, fwhm) and line ratios consistent withagn-photoionization. the new evidence for agn photoionization, combined withpreviously detected civ and luminous, warm infrared emission, suggest that b1is the site of a hidden quasar. this is confirmed by the fact that [oii] isrelatively weak compared to [oiii] (extinction-corrected [oiii]/[oii] of about3.8), which is indicative of a high, seyfert-like ionization parameter. fromthe [oiii] luminosity we infer a bolometric agn luminosity of ~3e46 erg/s, andfurther conclude that the obscured agn may be compton-thick given existingx-ray limits. the large line widths observed are consistent with clouds movingwithin the narrow line region of a luminous qso. the agn scenario is capable ofproducing sufficient ionizing photons to power the lya, even in the presence ofdust. by performing a census of similar objects in the literature, we find thatvirtually all luminous labs harbor obscured quasars. based on simple duty-cyclearguments, we conclude that agn are the main drivers of the lya in labs ratherthan the gravitational heating and subsequent cooling suggested by cold streammodels. we also conclude that the empirical relation between labs and overdenseenvironments at high redshift must be due to a more fundamental correlationbetween agn (or massive galaxies) and environment.

1306.2338	nebular emission and the lyman continuum photon escape fraction in  califa early-type galaxies	we use deep integral field spectroscopy data from the califa survey to studythe warm interstellar medium (wim) of 32 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs). wepropose a tentative subdivision of our sample etgs into two groups, accordingto their ha equivalent width (ew) and lyman continuum (lyc) photon escapefraction (plf). type i etgs show nearly constant ews and a plf~0, suggestingthat photoionization by post-agb stars is the main driver of their faintextranuclear nebular emission. type ii etgs are characterized by very low,outwardly increasing ews, and a plf as large as ~0.9 in their centers. suchproperties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing wim density and/or volumefilling factor. we argue that, because of extensive lyc photon leakage,emission-line luminosities and ews are reduced in type ii etg nuclei by atleast one order of magnitude. consequently, the line weakness of these etgs isby itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely "weak"(sub-eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (agn). in fact, lyc photonescape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key elementin understanding why many etgs with prominent signatures of agn activity inradio continuum and/or x-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines andweak signatures of agn activity in their optical spectra. the lyc photonescape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear ews by line-of-sightintegration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impededetection of agn in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-linespectroscopy. we further find that type i and ii etgs differ little (~0.4 dex)in their mean bpt line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic ofliners. this potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,luminosity-weighted bpt ratios for the specific 3d properties of the wim inetgs.

1312.3328	identifying clustering at high redshift through actively star-forming  galaxies	identifying galaxy clustering at high redshift (i.e. z &gt; 1) is essential toour understanding of the current cosmological model. however, at increasingredshift, clusters evolve considerably in star-formation activity and so areless likely to be identified using the widely-used red sequence method. here weassess the viability of instead identifying high redshift clustering usingactively star-forming galaxies (smgs associated with over-densities ofbzks/lbgs). we perform both a 2- and 3-d clustering analysis to determinewhether or not true (3d) clustering can be identified where only 2d data areavailable. as expected, we find that 2d clustering signals are weak at best andinferred results are method dependant. in our 3d analysis, we identify 12 smgsassociated with an over-density of galaxies coincident both spatially and inredshift - just 8% of smgs with known redshifts in our sample. where an smg inour target fields lacks a known redshift, their sightline is no more likely todisplay clustering than blank sky fields; prior redshift information for thesmg is required to identify a true clustering signal. we find that the strengthof clustering in the volume around typical smgs, while identifiable, is notexceptional. however, we identify a small number of highly clustered regions,all associated with an smg. the most notable of these, surroundinglessj033336.8-274401, potentially contains an smg, a qso and 36 star-forminggalaxies (a &gt; 20sig over-density) all at z~1.8. this region is highly likely torepresent an actively star-forming cluster and illustrates the success of usingstar-forming galaxies to select sites of early clustering. given the increasingnumber of deep fields with large volumes of spectroscopy, or high quality andreliable photometric redshifts, this opens a new avenue for clusteridentification in the young universe.

1403.6832	agn emission line diagnostics and the mass-metallicity relation up to  redshift z~2: the impact of selection effects and evolution	emission line diagnostic diagrams probing the ionization sources in galaxies,such as the baldwin-phillips-terlevich (bpt) diagram, have been usedextensively to distinguish agn from purely star-forming galaxies. yet, theyremain poorly understood at higher redshifts. we shed light on this issue withan empirical approach based on a z~0 reference sample built from ~300,000 sdssgalaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission linedetection limits at higher redshift. we combine this low-redshift referencesample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxypopulation to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the bpt andmass-excitation (mex) diagnostic diagrams. the predicted bivariatedistributions agree remarkably well with direct observations of galaxies out toz~1.5, including the observed stellar mass-metallicity (mz) relation evolution.as a result, we infer that high-redshift star-forming galaxies are consistentwith having "normal" ism properties out to z~1.5, after accounting forselection effects and line luminosity evolution. namely, their optical lineratios and gas-phase metallicities are comparable to that of low-redshiftgalaxies with equivalent emission-line luminosities. in contrast, agnnarrow-line regions may show a shift toward lower metallicities at higherredshift. while a physical evolution of the ism conditions is not ruled out forpurely star-forming galaxies, and may be more important starting at z&gt;2, wefind that reliably quantifying this evolution is hindered by selectionseffects. the recipes provided here may serve as a basis for future studiestoward this goal. code to predict the loci of galaxies on the bpt and mexdiagnostic diagrams, and the mz relation as a function of emission lineluminosity limits, is made publicly available.

1404.0304	mapping a stellar disk into a boxy bulge: the outside-in part of the  milky way bulge formation	by means of idealized, dissipationless n-body simulations which follow theformation and subsequent buckling of a stellar bar, we study thecharacteristics of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges and compare them with theproperties of the stellar populations in the milky way bulge. the main resultsof our modeling, valid for the general family of boxy/peanut shaped bulges, arethe following: (i) because of the spatial redistribution in the disk initiatedat the epoch of bar formation, stars from the innermost regions to the outerlindblad resonance of the stellar bar are mapped into a boxy bulge; (ii) thecontribution of stars to the local bulge density depends on their birth radius:stars born in the innermost disk tend to dominate the innermost regions of theboxy bulge, while stars originating closer to the olr are preferentially foundin the outer regions of the boxy/peanut structure; (iii) stellar birth radiiare imprinted in the bulge kinematics, the larger the birth radii of starsending up in the bulge, the greater their rotational support and the highertheir line-of- sight velocity dispersions (but note that this last trenddepends on the bar viewing angle); (iv) the higher the classicalbulge-over-disk ratio, the larger its fractional contribution of stars at largevertical distance from the galaxy mid-plane. (abridged) on the basis of theirchemical and kinematic characteristics, the results of our modeling suggeststhat the populations a, b and c, as defined by the argos survey, can beassociated, respectively, with the inner thin disk, to the young thick and tothe old thick disk, following the nomenclature recently suggested for stars inthe solar neighborhood by haywood et al.

1410.6155	exceptional agn-driven turbulence inhibits star formation in the 3c 326n  radio-galaxy	we detect bright [cii]158$\mu$m line emission from the radio galaxy 3c 326nat z=0.09, which shows weak star formation ($sfr&lt;0.07$m$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$)despite having strong h$_2$ line emission and $2\times 10^9$m$_{\odot}$ ofmolecular gas. the [cii] line is twice as strong as the 0-0s(1) 17$\mu$m h$_2$line, and both lines are much in excess what is expected from uv heating. wecombine infrared spitzer and herschel data with gas and dust modeling to inferthe gas physical conditions. the [cii] line traces 30 to 50% of the moleculargas mass, which is warm (70&lt;t&lt;100k) and at moderate densities$700&lt;n_{h}&lt;3000$cm$^{-3}$. the [cii] line is broad with a blue-shifted wing,and likely to be shaped by a combination of rotation, outflowing gas, andturbulence. it matches the near-infrared h$_2$ and the na d optical absorptionlines. if the wing is interpreted as an outflow, the mass loss rate would belarger than 20m$_{\odot}$/yr, and the depletion timescale shorter than theorbital timescale ($10^8$yr). these outflow rates may be over-estimated becausethe stochastic injection of turbulence on galactic scales can contribute to theskewness of the line profile and mimic outflowing gas. we argue that thedissipation of turbulence is the main heating process of this gas. cosmic rayscan also contribute to the heating but they require an average gas densitylarger than the observational constraints. we show that strong turbulentsupport maintains a high gas vertical scale height (0.3-4kpc) in the disk andcan inhibit the formation of gravitationally-bound structures at all scales,offering a natural explanation for the weakness of star formation in 3c 326n.to conclude, the bright [cii] line indicates that strong agn jet-driventurbulence may play a key role in enhancing the amount of molecular gas(positive feedback) but yet can prevent star formation on galactic scales(negative feedback).

1502.02681	on the cosmic evolution of the specific star formation rate	the apparent correlation between the specific star formation rate (ssfr) andtotal stellar mass (m_star) of galaxies is a fundamental relationshipindicating how they formed their stellar populations. to attempt to understandthis relation, we hypothesize that the relation and its evolution is regulatedby the increase in the stellar and gas mass surface density in galaxies withredshift, which is itself governed by the angular momentum of the accreted gas,the amount of available gas, and by self-regulation of star formation. with ourmodel, we can reproduce the specific sfr-m_star relations at z~1-2 by assuminggas fractions and gas mass surface densities similar to those observed forz=1-2 galaxies. we further argue that it is the increasing angular momentumwith cosmic time that causes a decrease in the surface density of accreted gas.the gas mass surface densities in galaxies are controlled by the centrifugalsupport (i.e., angular momentum), and the ssfr is predicted to increase as,ssfr(z)=(1+z)^3/t_h0, as observed (where t_h0 is the hubble time and no freeparameters are necessary). at z&gt;~2, we argue that star formation isself-regulated by high pressures generated by the intense star formationitself. the star formation intensity must be high enough to either balance thehydrostatic pressure (a rather extreme assumption) or to generate highturbulent pressure in the molecular medium which maintains galaxies near theline of instability (i.e. toomre q~1). the most important factor is theincrease in stellar and gas mass surface density with redshift, which allowsdistant galaxies to maintain high levels of ssfr. without a strong feedbackfrom massive stars, such galaxies would likely reach very high ssfr levels,have high star formation efficiencies, and because strong feedback drivesoutflows, ultimately have an excess of stellar baryons (abridged).

1505.00949	a co-rich merger shaping a powerful and hyper-luminous infrared radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy	in the low-redshift universe, the most powerful radio sources are oftenassociated with gas-rich galaxy mergers or interactions. we here presentevidence for an advanced, gas-rich (`wet') merger associated with a powerfulradio galaxy at a redshift of z~2. this radio galaxy, mrc 0152-209, is the mostinfrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the southern hemisphere.using the australia telescope compact array, we obtained high-resolutionco(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with hst/wfpc2 imagingand wht long-slit spectroscopy. we find that, while roughly m(h2) ~ 2 x10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,another m(h2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of~60 kpc. most of this widespread co(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidalfeatures visible in the rest-frame near-uv hst/wfpc2 imaging. ly$\alpha$emission shows an excess over heii, but a deficiency over l(ir), which islikely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured starformation that was triggered by the merger. in terms of feedback, the radiosource is aligned with widespread co(1-0) emission, which suggests that thereis a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of coldmolecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. its optical appearance, combinedwith the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of mrc0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `dragonfly galaxy'.

1505.04069	spatially resolved spitzer-irs spectral maps of the superwind in m82	we have mapped the superwind/halo region of the nearby starburst galaxy m82in the mid-infrared with $spitzer-irs$. the spectral regions covered includethe h$_2 s(1)-s(3)$, [neii], [neiii] emission lines and pah features. weestimate the total warm h$_2$ mass and the kinetic energy of the outflowingwarm molecular gas to be between $m_{warm}\sim5-17\times10^6$ m$_{\odot}$ and$e_{k}\sim6-20\times10^{53}$ erg. using the ratios of the 6.2, 7.7 and 11.3micron pah features in the irs spectra, we are able to estimate the averagesize and ionization state of the small grains in the superwind. there are largevariations in the pah flux ratios throughout the outflow. the 11.3/7.7 and the6.2/7.7 pah ratios both vary by more than a factor of five across the windregion. the northern part of the wind has a significant population of pah'swith smaller 6.2/7.7 ratios than either the starburst disk or the southernwind, indicating that on average, pah emitters are larger and more ionized. thewarm molecular gas to pah flux ratios (h$_2/pah$) are enhanced in the outflowby factors of 10-100 as compared to the starburst disk. this enhancement in theh$_2/pah$ ratio does not seem to follow the ionization of the atomic gas (asmeasured with the [neiii]/[neii] line flux ratio) in the outflow. this suggeststhat much of the warm h$_2$ in the outflow is excited by shocks. the observedh$_2$ line intensities can be reproduced with low velocity shocks ($v &lt; 40$ kms$^{-1}$) driven into moderately dense molecular gas ($10^2 &lt;n_h &lt; 10^4$cm$^{-3}$) entrained in the outflow.

1507.07919	dissecting the complex environment of a distant quasar with muse	high redshift quasars can be used to trace the early growth of massivegalaxies and may be triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions. we present musescience verification data on one such interacting system consisting of thewell-studied z=3.2 pks1614+051 quasar, its agn companion galaxy and bridge ofmaterial radiating in lyalpha between the quasar and its companion. we find atotal of four companion galaxies (at least two galaxies are new discoveries),three of which reside within the likely virial radius of the quasar host,suggesting that the system will evolve into a massive elliptical galaxy by thepresent day. the muse data are of sufficient quality to split the extendedlyalpha emission line into narrow velocity channels. in these the gas can beseen extending towards each of the three neighbouring galaxies suggesting thatthe emission-line gas originates in a gravitational interaction between thegalaxies and the quasar host. the photoionization source of this gas is lessclear but is probably dominated by the two agn. the quasar's lyalpha emissionspectrum is double-peaked, likely due to absorbing neutral material at thequasar's systemic redshift with a low column density as no damping wings arepresent. the spectral profiles of the agn and bridge's lyalpha emission arealso consistent with absorption at the same redshift indicating this neutralmaterial may extend over &gt; 50 kpc. the fact that the neutral material is seenin the line of sight to the quasar and transverse to it, and the fact that wesee the quasar and it also illuminates the emission-line bridge, suggests thequasar radiates isotropically and any obscuring torus is small. these resultsdemonstrate the power of muse for investigating the dynamics of interactingsystems at high redshift.

1510.01959	can galaxy growth be sustained through hi-rich minor mergers?	local galaxies with specific star-formation rates (star-formation rate perunit mass; ssfr~0.2-10/gyr) as high as distant galaxies (z~1-3), are very richin hi. those with low stellar masses, log m_star (m_sun)=8-9, for example, havem_hi/m_star~5-30. using continuity arguments of peng et al. (2014), whereby thespecific merger rate is hypothesized to be proportional to the specificstar-formation rate, and hi gas mass measurements for local galaxies with highssfr, we estimate that moderate mass galaxies, log m_star (m_sun)=9-10.5, canacquire sufficient gas through minor mergers (stellar mass ratios ~4-100) tosustain their star formation rates at z~2. the relative fraction of the gasaccreted through minor mergers declines with increasing stellar mass and forthe most massive galaxies considered, log m_star (m_sun)=10.5-11, thisaccretion rate is insufficient to sustain their star formation. we checked ourminor merger hypothesis at z=0 using the same methodology but now withrelations for local normal galaxies and find that minor mergers cannot accountfor their specific growth rates, in agreement with observations of hi-richsatellites around nearby spirals. we discuss a number of attractive features,like a natural down-sizing effect, in using minor mergers with extended hidisks to support star formation at high redshift. the answer to the questionposed by the title, "can galaxy growth be sustained through \hi-rich minormergers?", is maybe, but only for relatively low mass galaxies and at highredshift.

1510.02107	warm molecular hydrogen at high redshift with the james webb space  telescope	the build-up of galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay betweengravitational collapse, galaxy merging and feedback related to agn and starformation. the energy released by these processes has to dissipate for gas tocool, condense, and form stars. how gas cools is thus a key to understandgalaxy formation. \textit{spitzer space telescope} infrared spectroscopyrevealed a population of galaxies with weak star formation and unusuallypowerful h$_2$ line emission. this is a signature of turbulent dissipation,sustained by large-scale mechanical energy injection. the cooling of themultiphase interstellar medium is associated with emission in the h$_2$ lines.these results have profound consequences on our understanding of regulation ofstar formation, feedback and energetics of galaxy formation in general. thefact that h$_2$ lines can be strongly enhanced in high-redshift turbulentgalaxies will be of great importance for the \textit{james webb spacetelescope} observations which will unveil the role that h$_2$ plays as acooling agent in the era of galaxy assembly.

1510.02381	alma unveils a triple merger and gas exchange in a hyper-luminous radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy (ii)	the dragonfly galaxy (mrc0152-209), at redshift z~2, is one of the mostvigorously star-forming radio galaxies in the universe. what triggered itsactivity? we present alma cycle 2 observations of cold molecular co(6-5) gasand dust, which reveal that this is likely a gas-rich triple merger. itconsists of a close double nucleus (separation ~4 kpc) and a weak co-emitter at~10 kpc distance, all of which have counterparts in hst/nicmos imagery. thehyper-luminous starburst and powerful radio-agn were triggered at thisprecoalescent stage of the merger. the co(6-5) traces dense molecular gas inthe central region, and complements existing co(1-0) data, which revealed morewidespread tidal debris of cold gas. we also find ~10$^{10}$ m(sun) ofmolecular gas with enhanced excitation at the highest velocities. at least20-50% of this high-excitation, high-velocity gas shows kinematics thatsuggests it is being displaced and redistributed within the merger, althoughwith line-of-sight velocities of |v| &lt; 500 km/s, this gas will probably notescape the system. the processes that drive the redistribution of cold gas arelikely related to either the gravitational interaction between two kpc-scalediscs, or starburst/agn-driven outflows. we estimate that the rate at which themolecular gas is redistributed is at least ~1200 +- 500 m(sun)/yr, and couldperhaps even approach the star formation rate of ~3000 +- 800 m(sun)/yr. thefact that the gas depletion and gas redistribution timescales are similarimplies that dynamical processes can be important in the evolution of massivehigh-z galaxies.

1510.06631	kinematic signatures of agn feedback in moderately powerful radio  galaxies at z~2 observed with sinfoni	most successful galaxy formation scenarios now postulate that the intensestar formation in massive, high-redshift galaxies during their major growthperiod was truncated when powerful agns launched galaxy-wide outflows of gasthat removed large parts of the interstellar medium. the most powerful radiogalaxies at z~2 show clear signatures of such winds, but are too rare to begood representatives of a generic phase in the evolution of all massivegalaxies at high redshift. here we present sinfoni imaging spectroscopy of 12radio galaxies at z~2 that are intermediate between the most powerful radio andvigorous starburst galaxies in radio power, and common enough to represent ageneric phase in the early evolution of massive galaxies.  the kinematic properties are diverse, with regular velocity gradients withamplitudes of delta v=200-400 km s^-1 as in rotating disks as well as irregularkinematics with multiple velocity jumps of a few 100 km s^-1. line widths aregenerally high, typically around fwhm=800 km s^-1, consistent with windvelocities in hydrodynamic models. a broad h-alpha line in one target implies ablack hole mass of a few 10^9 m$_sun. the ratio of line widths, sigma, to bulkvelocity, v, is so large that even the gas in galaxies with regular velocityfields is unlikely to be gravitationally bound. it is unclear, however, whetherthe large line widths are due to turbulence or unresolved, local outflows asare sometimes observed at low redshifts. comparison of the kinetic energy withthe energy supply from the agn through jet and radiation pressure suggests thatthe radio source still plays a dominant role for feedback, consistent withlow-redshift radio-loud quasars.

1511.01300	spectroscopic aperture biases in inside-out evolving early-type galaxies  from califa	integral field spectroscopy studies based on califa data have recentlyrevealed the presence of ongoing low-level star formation (sf) in the peripheryof ~10% of local early-type galaxies (etgs), witnessing a still ongoinginside-out galaxy growth process. a distinctive property of the nebularcomponent in these etgs, classified i+, is a two-radial-zone structure, withthe inner zone displaying liner emission with a h\alpha equivalent widthew~1{\aa}, and the outer one (3{\aa}&lt;ew&lt;~20{\aa}) showing hii-regioncharacteristics. using califa ifs data, we empirically demonstrate that theconfinement of nebular emission to the galaxy periphery leads to a strongaperture (or, redshift) bias in spectroscopic single-fiber studies of type i+etgs: at low redshift (&lt;~0.45), sdss spectroscopy is restricted to the inner(sf-devoid liner) zone, thereby leading to their erroneous classification as"retired" galaxies (systems lacking sf and whose faint emission is powered bypagb stars). only at higher z's the sdss aperture can encompass the outer sfzone, permitting their unbiased classification as "composite sf/liner". we alsodemonstrate that the principal effect of a decreasing aperture on theclassification of i+ etgs via standard bpt emission-line ratios consists in amonotonic up-right shift precisely along the upper-right wing of the "seagull"distribution. motivated by these insights, we also investigate theoreticallythese biases in aperture-limited studies of inside-out growing galaxies as afunction of z. to this end, we devise a simple model, which involves anoutwardly propagating sf process, that reproduces the radial extent andtwo-zone ew distribution of i+ etgs. by simulating on this model thespectroscopic sdss aperture, we find that sdss studies at z&lt;~1 areprogressively restricted to the inner liner-zone, and miss an increasinglylarge portion of the h\alpha-emitting periphery.

(2013) we argue that etgsspan a broad continuous sequence with regard to the properties of their wim,and they can be roughly subdivided into two characteristic classes. the firstone (type i) comprises etgs with a nearly constant ew~1-3 {\aa} in theirextranuclear component, in quantitative agreement with (even though, no prooffor) the hypothesis of photoionization by pagb stars. the second class (typeii) consists of virtually wim-evacuated etgs with a large lyman continuum (lyc)photon escape fraction and a very low (&lt;= 0.5 {\aa}) ew in their nuclear zone.these two classes appear indistinguishable from one another by theirliner-specific emission-line ratios. additionally, here we extend theclassification by the class i+ which stands for a subset of type i etgs withlow-level star-fomation in contiguous spiral-arm like features in theiroutermost periphery. these faint features, together with traces of localizedstar formation in several type i&amp;i+ systems point to a non-negligiblecontribution from young massive stars to the global ionizing photon budget inetgs.

(ii) weaker large-scale excesses extending out to between 1and 1.5 mpc radius. the presence or absence of galaxy excesses on these twoscales, however, differs greatly between the six different fields. theimplications of these results for both cluster formation and the nature of highredshift agn are discussed (abridged).

(2003), those for which the h_2 emission arises in denseclouds illuminated by intense fuv radiation. the nai stellar absorption isclearly seen in 6 of the nuclear spectra, indicating the presence of asignificant population of late type stars. it is possible that these stars area result of the same episode of star formation that gave rise to the starsheating the pdrs. it seems unlikely that the agn is the dominant source ofexcitation for the near infrared h_2 emission: in two nuclei h_2 was notdetected at all, and in general we find no evidence of suppression of the2-1s(3) line, which may occur in x-ray irradiated gas. our data do not revealany significant difference between the nuclear and circumnuclear line ratios,suggesting that the physical conditions of the dominant excitation mechanismare similar both near the agn and in the larger scale environment around it,and that star formation is an important process even in the central 100pcacround agn.

astro-ph;0509005	the missing metals problem: i. how many metals are in submm galaxies?	we use a sample of submillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs) with molecular gasand dynamical mass measurements from the literature to put constraints on thecontribution of such galaxies to the total metal budget. compared to lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs), for example, smgs are rarer (by a factor of 10 or more),but contain much more gas and are more metal rich. we estimate that smgsbrighter than 3 mjy contain only less than 9% of the metals when we combine theobserved dynamical masses (few$\times 10^{11}$ \msun), number density ($n\simeq10^{-4}$ mpc$^{-3}$), observed gas metallicity (1--2 x solar), and observed gasfractions (~40%) assuming a molecular to neutral hydrogen ratio of 1. includingsmgs fainter than 3 mjy, we estimate that smgs contain at the most 15% of themetals, where our incompleteness correction is estimated from the dust massfunction. our results are strong upper limits given that high gas fractions andhigh overall metallicity are mutually exclusive. in summary, smgs make asignificant contribution to the metal budget (&lt; 15%) but not sufficient tosolve the `missing metals problem.' a consequence of our results is that smgscan only add $\approx 3.5$% to $\omega_{\rm dla}$, and can not be the source ofa significant population of dusty dlas.

(1990). redshifts are not available for theremaining two companions. the red colors of the second brightest companionappear most consistent with a high redshift star-forming galaxy at z &gt; 1.5. ifthis object is at the redshift of 4c +09.17 it has a luminosity of about 7l*.the faintest companion has colors which are unlike those expected from either aspiral or an e/s0 galaxy at any redshift associated with the 4c+09.17 system.since this object lies along the same direction as the radio jet/lobe of4c+09.17, as well as the extended ly-alpha emission mapped by heckman et al.(1991) we suggest that this component can be explained as a combination ofstrong line emission and scattered qso light. the resolved, diffuse emissionsurrounding 4c+09.17 is bright, k~17.0 mag, and about one magnitude redder inj-k than the quasar. if this emission is starlight, a very luminous ellipticalhost galaxy is implied for 4c+09.17. scattered and reddened agn light, emissionline gas, and flux from absorbing galaxies along the line of sight may allcontribute to this emission.

astro-ph;9810417	asca observations of the starburst-driven superwind galaxy ngc 2146:  broad band (0.6 - 9 kev) spectral properties	we report asca gis and sis observations of the nearby (d = 11.6 mpc), nearlyedge-on, starburst galaxy ngc 2146. these x-ray spectral data complement rosatpspc and hri imaging discussed by armus et al., 1995. the broad band (0.6-9kev) x-ray spectrum of ngc 2146 is best described by a two component model: thesoft x-ray emission with a raymond-smith thermal plasma model having atemperature of kt $\sim 0.8$ kev; the hard x-ray emission with a thermal plasmamodel having kt $\sim 8$ kev or a power-law model having a photon index of$\sim 1.7$. we do not find compelling evidence of substantial excess absorptionabove the galactic value. the soft (hard) thermal component provides about 30%(70%) of the total luminosity in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev energy band, while in the2-10 kev energy range only the hard component plays a major role. the spectralresults allow us to set tighter constraints on the starburst-driven superwindmodel, which we show can satisfactorily account for the luminosity, mass, andenergy content represented by the soft x-ray spectral component. we estimatethat the mass outflow rate ($\sim$ 9 m$_{\odot}$ per year) is about an order ofmagnitude greater than the predicted rate at which supernovae and stellar windsreturn mass into the interstellar medium and, therefore, argue that the flow isstrongly "mass-loaded" with material in and around the starburst. the estimatedoutflow velocity of the hot gas is close to the escape velocity from thegalaxy, so the fate of the gas is not clear. we suggest that the hard x-rayspectral component is due to the combined emission of x-ray binaries and/oryoung supernovae remnants associated with the starburst.

astro-ph;9903471	a 98% spectroscopically complete sample of the most powerful equatorial  radio sources at 408 mhz	a new sample of very powerful radio galaxies is defined from the molongloreference catalogue, according to the criteria s (408 mhz) &gt; 5 jy, -30 &lt; dec &lt;10 degrees, |b| &gt; 10 degrees. the sample is selected to have similar propertiesto the northern 3cr revised sample, and to be visible to a combination ofexisting northern telescopes such as the very large array radio interferometerand large southern hemisphere telescope facilities. the sample contains 178sources, of which spectroscopic redshifts are available in the literature for128. for the remaining 50 sources, new radio imaging, optical imaging andspectroscopic observations are presented to identify the host galaxies anddetermine their redshifts. with these new observations the total sample is 100%optically identified and redshifts are available for 174 (98%) of the sources.the sample consists of one starburst galaxy, one seyfert galaxy, 127 radiogalaxies and 49 quasars. basic properties of the sample, such as thedistributions of the quasar and radio galaxy populations in redshift and theirlocations on the radio power versus linear size (p-d) diagram, show nosignificant differences from the revised 3cr sample. the equatorial locationand the high spectroscopic completeness of this sample make it a valuableresource for detailed studies of the nature and environments of these importantobjects with the new generation of southern hemisphere telescopes.

astro-ph;9904227	very extended x-ray and h-alpha emission in m82: implications for the  superwind phenomenon	we discuss the properties and implications of a 3.7x0.9 kpc region ofspatially-coincident x-ray and h-alpha emission about 11.6 kpc to the north ofthe galaxy m82 previously discussed by devine and bally (1999). the pspc x-rayspectrum is fit by thermal plasma (kt=0.80+-0.17 kev) absorbed by only thegalactic foreground column density. we evaluate the relationship of thex-ray/h-alpha ridge to the m82 superwind. the main properties of the x-rayemission can all be explained as being due to shock-heating driven as thesuperwind encounters a massive ionized cloud in the halo of m82. this encounterdrives a slow shock into the cloud, which contributes to the excitation of theobserved h-alpha emission. at the same time, a fast bow-shock develops in thesuperwind just upstream of the cloud, and this produces the observed x-rayemission. this interpretation would imply that the superwind has an outflowspeed of roughly 800 km/s, consistent with indirect estimates based on itsgeneral x-ray properties and the kinematics of the inner kpc-scale region ofh-alpha filaments. the gas in the m82 ridge is roughly two orders-of-magnitudehotter than the minimum "escape temperature" at this radius, so this gas willnot be retained by m82.

0809.5171	evidence for powerful agn winds at high redshift: dynamics of galactic  outflows in radio galaxies during the "quasar era"	agn feedback now appears as an attractive mechanism to resolve some of theoutstanding problems with the "standard" cosmological models, in particularthose related to massive galaxies. to directly constrain how this may influencethe formation of massive galaxies near the peak in the redshift distribution ofpowerful quasars, z~2, we present an analysis of the emission-line kinematicsof 3 powerful radio galaxies at z~2-3 (hzrgs) based on rest-frame opticalintegral-field spectroscopy obtained with sinfoni on the vlt. hzrgs are amongthe most massive galaxies, so agn feedback may have a particularly clearsignature. we find evidence for bipolar outflows in all hzrgs, with kineticenergies that are equivalent to 0.2% of the rest-mass of the supermassive blackhole. velocity offsets in the outflows are ~800-1000 km s^-1 between theblueshifted and redshifted line emission, fwhms ~1000 km s^-1 suggest strongturbulence. ionized gas masses estimated from the ha luminosity are of order10^10 m_s, similar to the molecular gas content of hzrgs, underlining thatthese outflows may indicate a significant phase in the evolution of the hostgalaxy. the total energy release of ~10^60 erg during a dynamical time of ~10^7yrs corresponds to about the binding energy of a massive galaxy. geometry,timescales and energy injection rates of order 10% of the kinetic energy fluxof the jet suggest that the outflows are most likely driven by the radiosource. the global energy density release of ~10^57 erg s^-1 mpc^-3 may alsoinfluence the subsequent evolution of the hzrg by enhancing the entropy andpressure in the surrounding halo and facilitating ram-pressure stripping of gasin satellite galaxies that may contribute to the subsequent mass assembly ofthe hzrg through low-dissipation "dry" mergers.
