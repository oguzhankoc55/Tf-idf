0904.4550	an x-ray face-on view of the sgr b molecular clouds observed with suzaku	we present a new methodology to derive the positions of the sgr b molecularclouds (mcs) along the line of sight, as an application study of the galacticcenter diffuse x-rays (gcdx). the gcdx is composed of hot plasma emission ofabout 7 kev and 1 kev temperatures, and non-thermal continuum emissionincluding the 6.4 kev line from neutral irons. the former, the galactic centerplasma emission (gcpe), is uniformly distributed over 1 degree in longitude,while the latter is clumpy emission produced by thomson scattering andfluorescence from mcs irradiated by external x-rays (the x-ray reflectionnebula emission: xrne). we examined the suzaku x-ray spectra of the gcpe andxrne near to the sgr b mc complex, and found that the spectra suffer from twodifferent absorptions of n_h (abs1) &gt;10^23 h cm^-2 and n_h (abs2) ~6 x 10^22 hcm^-2. abs1 is proportional to the 6.4 kev-line flux, and hence is due to themcs, while abs2 is typical of interstellar absorption toward the galacticcenter. assuming that the gcpe plasma is spherically-extended around sgr a*with a uniform density and the same angular distribution of the two temperaturecomponents, we quantitatively estimated the line-of-sight positions of the mcsfrom the flux ratio the gcpe spectrum suffered by abs1 and that with no abs1.the results suggest that the sgr b mcs are located at the near side of sgr a*in the gcpe.

0905.2725	a super bubble candidate in the galactic center and a local enhancement  g359.77-0.09	a 20' \times 16' elliptical ring-like structure has been found near thegalactic center in the narrow energy band corresponding to the k$\alpha$ linefrom he-like sulfur. in the ring, two diffuse sources are found, a supernovaremnant candidate g359.79-0.26 and an unidentified source g359.77-0.09. thex-ray spectrum of g359.77-0.09 is similar to that of g359.79-0.26, which can beexplained by an absorbed thin thermal plasma model with temperatures of 0.7 and1.0 kev. the absorption column densities of these two sources are large (n_h =6.9 \times 10^{22} and 4.5 \times 10^{22} cm^{-2}) and are consistent with thatof the galactic center distance. the x-ray spectrum extracted from thering-like structure is also represented by an absorbed thin thermal plasmamodel (kt_e \sim 0.9 kev). the thermal energy of the plasma filling thering-like structure is estimated to be 1.0 \times 10^{51} erg. we thereforepropose that the two sources comprise a single ring-like object, which ispossibly a super bubble with a size of 49 pc \times 40 pc in the galacticcenter region.

0706.4146	x-ray spectroscopy of sn 1006 with suzaku	we report on observations of sn 1006 with the x-ray imaging spectrometers(xis) on board suzaku. we firmly detected k-shell emission from fe, for thefirst time, and find that the fe ionization state is quite low. the broad bandspectrum extracted from the southeast of the remnant is well fitted with amodel consisting of three optically thin thermal non-equilibrium ionizationplasmas and a power-law component. two of the thermal models are highlyoverabundant in heavy elements and, hence, are likely due to ejecta. thesecomponents have different ionization parameters: $n_et \sim 1.4\times 10^{10}$cm$^{-3}$ s and $n_et \sim 7.7\times 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ s and it is the later onethat produces the fe-k emission. this suggests that fe has been heated by thereverse shock more recently than the other elements, consistent with a picturewhere the ejecta are stratified by composition with fe in the interior. on theother hand, the third thermal component is assumed to be solar abundance, andwe associate it with emission from the interstellar medium (ism). the electrontemperature and ionization parameter are $kt_e \sim $0.5 kev and $n_et \sim5.8\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ s. the electron temperature is lower than thatexpected from the shock velocity which suggests a lack of collisionlesselectron heating at the forward shock. the extremely low ionization parameterand extreme non-equilibrium state are due to the low density of the ambientmedium.

0909.3848	discovery of strong radiative recombination continua from the supernova  remnant ic 443 with suzaku	we present the suzaku spectroscopic study of the galactic middle-agedsupernova remnant (snr) ic 443. the x-ray spectrum in the 1.75-6.0 kev band isdescribed by an optically-thin thermal plasma with the electron temperature of0.6 kev and several additional lyman lines. we robustly detect, for the firsttime, strong radiative recombination continua (rrc) of h-like si and s aroundat 2.7 and 3.5 kev. the ionization temperatures of si and s determined from theintensity ratios of the rrc to he-like k-alpha line are 1.0 kev and 1.2 kev,respectively. we thus find firm evidence for an extremely-overionized(recombining) plasma. as the origin of the overionization, a thermal conductionscenario argued in previous work is not favored in our new results. we proposethat the highly-ionized gas were made at the initial phase of the snr evolutionin dense regions around a massive progenitor, and the low electron temperatureis due to a rapid cooling by an adiabatic expansion.

0708.2002	measuring the broad-band x-ray spectrum from 400 ev to 40 kev in the  southwest part of the supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	we report on results from suzaku broadband x-ray observations of thesouthwest part of the galactic supernova remnant (snr) rx j1713.7-3946 with anenergy coverage of 0.4-40 kev. the x-ray spectrum, presumably of synchrotronorigin, is known to be completely lineless, making this snr ideally suited fora detailed study of the x-ray spectral shape formed through efficient particleacceleration at high speed shocks. with a sensitive hard x-ray measurement fromthe hxd pin on board suzaku, we determine the hard x-ray spectrum in the 12--40kev range to be described by a power law with photon index gamma = 3.2+/- 0.2,significantly steeper than the soft x-ray index of gamma = 2.4+/- 0.05 measuredpreviously with asca and other missions. we find that a simple power law failsto describe the full spectral range of 0.4-40 kev and instead a power-law withan exponential cutoff with hard index gamma = 1.50+/- 0.09 and high-energycutoff epsilon_c = 1.2+/- 0.3 kev formally provides an excellent fit over thefull bandpass. if we use the so-called srcut model, as an alternative model, itgives the best-fit rolloff energy of epsilon_{roll} = 0.95+/- 0.04 kev.together with the tev gamma-ray spectrum ranging from 0.3 to 100 tev obtainedrecently by hess observations, our suzaku observations of rx j1713.7-3946provide stringent constraints on the highest energy particles accelerated in asupernova shock.

0709.1580	suzaku detection of extended/diffuse hard x-ray emission from the  galactic center	five on-plane regions within +/- 0.8deg of the galactic center were observedwith the hard x-ray detector (hxd) and the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis)onboard suzaku. from all regions, significant hard x-ray emission was detectedwith hxd-pin up to 40 kev, in addition to the extended plasma emission which isdominant in the xis band. the hard x-ray signals are inferred to come primarilyfrom a spatially extended source, rather than from a small number of brightdiscrete objects. contributions to the hxd data from catalogued x-ray sources,typically brighter than 1 mcrab, were estimated and removed using informationfrom suzaku and other satellites. even after this removal, the hard x-raysignals remained significant, exhibiting a typical 12--40 kev surfacebrightness of 4e-10 erg cm-2 s-1 deg-2 and power-law-like spectra with a photonindex of 1.8. combined fittings to the xis and hxd-pin spectra confirm that aseparate hard tail component is superposed onto the hot thermal emission,confirming a previous report based on the xis data. over the 5--40 kev band,the hard tail is spectrally approximated by a power law of photon index ~2, butbetter by those with somewhat convex shapes. possible origins of the extendedhard x-ray emission are discussed.

0709.3151	suzaku observation of the rcw86 northeastern shell	this paper reports the suzaku results on the northeast shell of rcw 86. withthe spatial and spectral analysis, we separated the x-rays into three distinctcomponents; low (kt_e~0.3kev) and high (kt_e~1.8kev) temperature plasmas and anon-thermal component, and discovered their spatial distributions are differentfrom each other. the low temperature plasma is dominated at the east rim,whereas the non-thermal emission is the brightest at the northeast rim which isspatially connected from the east rim. the high temperature plasma, found tocontain the ~6.42kev line (k alpha of low-ionized iron), is enhanced at theinward region with respect to the east rim and has no spatial correlation withthe non-thermal x-ray (the northeast). the fe-kalpha line, therefore, is notrelated to the non-thermal emission but originates from fe-rich ejecta heatedto the high temperatures by the reverse shock. since the metal abundances ofthe low temperature plasma are sub-solar, the most possible origin of thiscomponent is interstellar medium heated by a blast wave. the non-thermal x-ray,which has a power-law index of ~2.8, is likely to be synchrotron emission. apossible scenario to explain these morphologies and spectra is: a fast movingblast wave in a thin cavity of ob association collided with a denseinterstellar medium or cloud at the east region very recently. as the result,the reverse shock in this interior decelerated, and arrived at the fe-richregion of the ejecta and heated it. in the northeast rim, on the other hand,the blast wave is still moving fast, and accelerated high energy electrons toemit synchrotron x-rays.

1104.4484	k-shell emission of neutral iron line from sgr b2 excited by  subrelativistic protons	we investigated the emission of k$\alpha$ iron line from the massivemolecular clouds in the galactic center (gc). we assume that at present thetotal flux of this emission consists of time variable component generated byprimary x-ray photons ejected by sagittarius a$^\ast$ (sgr a$^\ast$) in thepast and a relatively weak quasi-stationary component excited by impact ofprotons which were generated by star accretion onto the central black hole. thelevel of background emission was estimated from a rise of the 6.4 kev lineintensity in the direction of several molecular clouds, that we interpreted asa stage when the x-ray front ejected by sgr a$^\ast$ entered into these clouds.the 6.4 kev emission before this intensity jump we interpreted as emissiongenerated by subrelativistic cosmic rays there. the cross-section of k$\alpha$vacancies produced by protons differs from that of electrons or x-rays.therefore, we expect that this processes can be distinguished from the analysisof the equivalent width of the iron line and time variations of the width canbe predicted. the line intensity from the clouds depends on their distance fromsgr a$^\ast$ and the coefficient of spacial diffusion near the galactic center.we expect that in a few years the line intensity for the cloud g\,0.11$-$0.11which is relatively close to sgr a$^\ast$ will decreases to the level$\lesssim$ 10% from its present value. for the cloud sagittarius b2 (sgr b2)the situation is more intricate. if the diffusion coefficient $d\gtrsim10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ then the expected stationary flux should be about 10%of its level in 2000. in the opposite case the line intensity from sgr b2should drop down to zero because the protons do not reach the cloud.

1109.1950	new evidence for high activity of the super-massive black hole in our  galaxy	prominent k-shell emission lines of neutral iron (hereafter, fei-k) andhard-continuum x-rays were found from molecular clouds (mcs) in the sagittariusb (sgr b) region with the two separate suzaku observations in 2005 and 2009.the x-ray flux of fei-k decreased in correlation to the hard-continuum flux byfactor of 0.4-0.5 in 4 years, which is nearly equal to the light-travellingacross the mcs. the rapid and correlated time-variability, the equivalent widthof fei-k, and the k-edge absorption depth of fei are consistently explained by"x-ray echoes" due to the fluorescent and thomson-scattering of an x-ray flarefrom an external source. the required flux of the x-ray flare depends on thedistance to the mcs and the duration time. the flux, even in the minimum case,is larger than those of the brightest galactic x-ray sources. based on thesefacts, we conclude that the super-massive black hole, sgr a*, exhibited abig-flare about a few hundred years ago and the luminosity of higher than4x10^39 erg s^{-1}. the "x-ray echo" from sgr b, located at a few hundredlight-years from sgr a*, now arrived at the earth.

1110.4948	evolution of supernova remnants expanding out of the dense circumstellar  matter into the rarefied interstellar medium	we carry out 3d-hydrodynamical calculations for the interaction of expandingsupernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar matter (csm) and the rarefiedinterstellar medium (ism) outside. the csm is composed of the stellar windmatter from the progenitor in its pre-supernova phase, and assumed to beaxially symmetric: more matter around the equator than in the polar directiondriven by rotation of the progenitor. because of high density of the csm, theionization state of the shock-heated ejecta quickly becomes equilibrium withthe electron temperature. when the blast wave breaks out of the csm into therarefied ism, the shocked ejecta cools rapidly due to adiabatic expansion, andhence an over-ionized/recombining plasma would be left. the ejecta is reheatedby the second reverse shock due to the interaction with the ism. we calculatethe emission measure of the supernova remnant (snr) along the line of sight,and find that the over-ionized plasma appears to be bar-like with wings in theedge-on (equatorial view), while shell-like in the face-on (polar view)geometry with respect to the rotation axis. the hot gas heated by the blastwave exists in the outermost region of the snr with a nearly complete shell,but the x-rays therefrom are too faint to be observable. thus, depending on theviewing angle, the snr of the over-ionized plasma would exhibit center-filledmorphology in x-rays, like w49b, a mixed-morphology snr. the bar-like structureis swept out by the second reverse shock and disappears eventually, and thenthe snr becomes shell-like in both the equatorial and polar views in the laterphase of the evolution.

0712.0874	discovery of extended x-ray emission from the unidentified tev source  hess j1614-518 using the suzaku satellite	we report the suzaku results of hess j1614-518, which is the brightestextended tev gamma-ray source discovered in the galactic plane survey conductedusing the h.e.s.s. telescope. we discovered three x-ray objects in the field ofview of the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis), which were designated as suzakuj1614-5141 (src a), suzaku j1614-5152 (src b), and suzaku j1614-5148 (src c).src a is an extended source located at the peak position of hess j1614-518, andtherefore it is a plausible counterpart to hess j1614-518. the x-ray flux inthe 2-10 kev band is 5e-13 erg/s/cm^2, which is an order of magnitude smallerthan the tev flux. the photon index is 1.7, which is smaller than the canonicalvalue of synchrotron emissions from high-energy electrons found in somesupernova remnants. these findings present a challenge to models in which theorigin of the tev emission is the inverse compton scattering of the cosmicmicrowave background by accelerated electrons that emit x-rays via synchrotronemission. src b is located at a relatively dim region in the tev band image;however, its hydrogen column density is the same as that of src a. therefore,src b may also be physically related to hess j1614-518. src c is a foregroundlate-type b star. we also discovered a soft extended x-ray emission near hessj1614-518.

1303.6049	non-thermal radio and gamma-ray emission from a supernova remnant by the  blast wave breaking out of the circumstellar matter	we calculate synchrotron radio emission and gamma-ray emission due tobremsstrahlung, inverse-compton scattering and $pi^0$-decay from the remnant ofsupernova which exploded in the circumstellar matter (csm) formed by theprogenitor's stellar wind. this sort of situation is a possible origin ofmixed-morphology supernova remnants (snrs) like w49b, which exhibitrecombination-radiation spectra in x-ray emission. we assume that the csm of1.5 $m_{odot}$ exists at 0.07--3 pc away from the supernova in the interstellarmedium (ism) of density 0.016 cm$^{-3}$. when the blast wave breaks out of thecsm into the ism, its velocity rapidly increases and hence particleacceleration is enhanced. the maximum energy of protons reaches $sim$ 1300 tevjust after the break-out with $sim$ 0.5% of the explosion energy. we considerthe non-thermal emission from the blast-shocked ism shell after the break-out.synchrotron radio flux at 1 ghz is tens jy, comparable to the observed frommixed-morphology snrs. because of low density, the gamma-ray luminosity isdominated by inverse-compton scattering, which is higher than the $pi^0$-decayluminosity by an order of magnitude. the total gamma-ray luminosity includingbremsstrahlung is of the order of $10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lower than the typicalvalue $10^{35}$--$10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ observed from mixed-morphology snrs.however, if, e.g., $sim$10% of accelerated protons interact with some matter ofdensity $sim$100 cm$^{-3}$, $pi^0$-decay gamma-ray luminosity would be enhancedto be comparable with the observed value.

1303.6607	dynamics of x-ray-emitting ejecta in the oxygen-rich supernova remnant  puppis a revealed by the xmm-newton rgs	using the unprecedented spectral resolution of the reflection gratingspectrometer (rgs) onboard xmm-newton, we reveal dynamics of x-ray--emittingejecta in the oxygen-rich supernova remnant puppis a. the rgs spectrum showsprominent k-shell lines, including o vii he_alpha forbidden and resonance, oviii ly_alpha, o viii ly_beta, and ne ix he_alpha resonance, from an ejectaknot positionally coincident with an optical oxygen-rich filament (theso-called omega filament in the northeast of the remnant). we find that theline centroids are blueshifted by 1480+/-140+/-60 km/s (the first and secondterm errors are measurement and calibration uncertainties, respectively), whichis fully consistent with that of the optical omega filament. line broadening at654 ev (corresponding to o viii ly_alpha) is obtained to be less than ~0.9 ev,indicating an oxygen temperature of less than ~30 kev. analysis of xmm-newtonmos spectra shows an electron temperature of ~0.8 kev and an ionizationtimescale of ~2e10 cm^-3 s. we show that the oxygen and electron temperaturesas well as the ionization timescale can be reconciled if the ejecta knot washeated by a collisionless shock whose velocity is ~600-1200 km/s and wassubsequently equilibrated due to coulomb interactions. the rgs spectrum alsoshows relatively weak k-shell lines of another ejecta feature located near thenortheastern edge of the remnant, from which we measure redward dopplervelocities of 650+/-70+/-60 km/s.

1305.4489	asymmetric ejecta distribution in sn 1006	we present the results from deep x-ray observations (~400 ks in total) of sn1006 by the x-ray astronomy satellite suzaku. the thermal spectrum from theentire supernova remnant (snr) exhibits prominent emission lines of o, ne, mg,si, s, ar, ca, and fe. the observed abundance pattern in the ejecta componentsis in good agreement with that predicted by a standard model of type iasupernovae (sne). the spatially resolved analysis reveals that the distributionof the o-burning and incomplete si-burning products (si, s, and ar) isasymmetric, while that of the c-burning products (o, ne, and mg) is relativelyuniform in the snr interior. the peak position of the former is clearly shiftedby 5' (~3.2 pc at a distance of 2.2 kpc) to the southeast from the snr'sgeometric center. using the snr age of ~1000 yr, we constrain the velocityasymmetry (in projection) of ejecta to be ~3100 km/s. the abundance of fe isalso significantly higher in the southeast region than in the northwest region.given that the non-uniformity is observed only among the heavier elements (sithrough fe), we argue that sn 1006 originates from an asymmetric explosion, asis expected from recent multi-dimensional simulations of type ia sne, althoughwe cannot eliminate the possibility that an inhomogeneous ambient mediuminduced the apparent non-uniformity. possible evidence for the cr k-shell lineand line broadening in the fe k-shell emission is also found.

1308.1755	thermal and non-thermal x-rays from the galactic supernova remnant  g348.5+0.1	we report on suzaku results of the two distinct regions in the galacticsupernova remnant g348.5+0.1: extended thermal x-rays ("soft diffuse") at thenortheast region and non-thermal x-rays (cxou j171419.8-383023) at thenorthwest region. the x-ray spectrum of the soft diffuse is fitted with neitheran ionization equilibrium nor a non-equilibrium (ionizing) plasma model,leaving saw-teeth residuals in the 1.5-3 kev energy band. the residualstructures can be produced when free electrons are recombined to the k-shellsof highly ionized mg and si ions. in fact, the x-ray spectrum is nicely fittedwith a recombination-dominant plasma model. we propose a scenario that theplasma in nearly full ionized state at high temperature quickly changed to arecombining phase due to selective cooling of electrons to a lower temperatureof ~0.5 kev. the spectrum of cxou j171419.8-383023 is well explained by asimple power-law model with a photon index of 1.9, nearly equal to the typicalvalue of pulsar wind nebulae. since the distance is estimated to be the same asthat of the soft diffuse, we infer that both the soft diffuse and cxouj171419.8-383023 are associated with the same object, snr g348.5+0.1.

1309.3672	suzaku observations of the type 2 qso in the central galaxy of the  phoenix cluster	we report the \suzaku/xis and hxd and \chandra/acis-i results on the x-rayspectra of the phoenix cluster at the redshift $z=0.596$. the spectrum of theintracluster medium (icm) is well-reproduced with the emissions from a lowtemperature ($\sim3.0$\,kev and $\sim0.76$\,solar) and a high temperature($\sim11$\,kev and $\sim0.33$\,solar) plasmas; the former is localized at thecluster core, while the latter distributes over the cluster. in addition tothese icm emissions, a strongly absorbed power-law component is found, which isdue to an active galactic nucleus (agn) in the cluster center. the absorptioncolumn density and unobscured luminosity of the agn are$\sim3.2\times10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim4.7\times10^{45}$\,ergs\,s$^{-1}$(2-10\,kev), respectively. furthermore, a neutral iron (\ion{fe}{1}) k-shellline is discovered for the first time with the equivalent width (ew) of$\sim150$\,ev at the rest frame. the column density and the ew of the\ion{fe}{1} line are exceptionally large for such a high luminosity agn, andhence the agn is classified as a type 2 quasi-stellar object (qso). wespeculate that the significant fraction of the icm cooled gas would be consumedto maintain the torus and to activate the type 2 qso. the phoenix cluster has amassive starburst in the central galaxy, indicating suppression in the coolingflow is less effective. this may be because the onset of the latest agnfeedback has occurred recently and it has not yet been effective.alternatively, the agn feedback is predominantly in radiative-mode not inkinetic-mode and the torus may work as a shield to reduce its effect.

1309.7749	x-ray emission from the galactic supernova remnant g12.0-0.1	we present results of the suzaku/xis observation around the radio supernovaremnant (snr) g12.0-0.1. no significant diffuse emission extending in or alongthe radio shell was observed. instead two compact x-ray sources, suzakuj181205-1835 and suzaku j181210-1842, were found in or near g12.0-0.1. suzakuj181205-1835 is located at the northwest of the radio shell of g12.0-0.1. thex-ray profile is slightly extended over the point spread function of the suzakutelescope. the x-ray spectrum has no line-like structure and is wellrepresented by a power-law model with a photon index of 2.2 and an absorptioncolumn of n_{h}=4.9x10^{22} cm^{-2}. the distances of suzaku j181205-1835 andg12.0-0.1 are estimated from the absorption column and the sigma-d relation,respectively, and are nearly the same with each other. these results suggestthat suzaku j181205-1835 is a candidate of a pulsar wind nebula associated withg12.0-0.1. from its location, suzaku j181210-1842 would be unrelated object tog12.0-0.1. the x-ray profile is point-like and the spectrum is thin thermalemission with fe k-lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 6.97 kev, similar to those ofcataclysmic variables.

1403.5850	discovery of enhanced radiative recombination continua of he-like iron  and calcium from ic 443 and its implications	we present deep observations of the galactic supernova remnant ic 443 withthe {\it suzaku x-ray satellite}. we find prominent k-shell lines from iron andnickel, together with a triangle residual at 8--10~kev, which corresponds tothe energy of the radiative recombination continuum (rrc) of he-like iron. inaddition, the wavy residuals have been seen at $\sim$5.1 and $\sim$5.5~kev. weconfirm that the residuals show the first enhanced rrcs of he- and h-likecalcium found in supernova remnants. these facts provide robust evidence forthe recombining plasma. we reproduce the plasma in the 3.7--10~kev band using arecombining plasma model at the electron temperature 0.65~kev. therecombination parameter $n_{\rm e}t$ ($n_{\rm e}$ is electron density and $t$is elapsed time after formation of a recombining plasma) and abundances of ironand nickel are strongly correlated, and hence the errors are large. on theother hand, the ratio of nickel to iron relative to the solar abundances iswell constrained to 11$^{+4}_{-3}$ (1$\sigma$). a possibility is that the largeabundance ratio is a result of an asymmetric explosion of the progenitor star.

1403.6898	abundances in the ejecta of core collapse supernova remnants, g350.1-0.3  and g349.7+0.2	we present suzaku results of the two galactic supernova remnants (snrs),g350.1-0.3 and g349.7+0.2. we find al and ni k alpha lines from both the snrsfor the first time, in addition to previously detected k-shell lines of mg, si,s, ar, ca and fe. the spectra are well described by two optically thin thermalplasmas: a low-temperature (low-kt) plasma in collisional ionizationequilibrium and a high-temperature (high-kt) plasma in non-equilibriumionization. since the low-kt plasma has solar metal abundances, it is thoughtto be of interstellar medium origin. the high-kt plasma has super-solarabundances, hence it is likely to be of ejecta origin. the abundance patternsof the ejecta components are similar to those of core-collapse supernovae withthe progenitor mass of ~15-25 m_solar for g350.1-0.3 and ~35-40 m_solar forg349.7+0.2. we find extremely high abundances of ni compared to fe (z_ni/z_fe~8). based on the measured column densities between the snrs and the near skybackground, we propose that g350.1-0.3 and g349.7+0.2 are located at thedistance of 9+/-3 kpc and 12+/-5 kpc, respectively. then the ejecta masses areestimated to be ~13 m_solar and ~24 m_solar for g350.1-0.3 and g349.7+0.2,respectively. these values are consistent with the progenitor mass of ~15-25m_solar and ~35-40 m_solar for g350.1-0.3 and g349.7+0.2, respectively.

1406.3747	discovery of an overlapping cluster in abell 1674 field with suzaku	we present the results of a suzaku observation of abell 1674, an opticallyvery rich (richness class 3) cluster cataloged as z = 0.1066. we discover thehe-like fe k-shell line from the central region for the first time, and findthat the x-ray spectrum yields a high redshift of 0.215^{+0.007}_{-0.006}. onthe other hand, the spectrum of the southwestern region is fitted with aredshift of 0.11 \pm 0.02 by the he-like fe l-shell lines, consistent with theoptically determined value. the gas temperature, metal abundance, and coreradius of the x-ray emission in the central region are 3.8 \pm 0.2 kev, 0.20\pm 0.05 z_solar and 450 \pm 40 kpc, respectively, while those in thesouthwestern region are 2.0 \pm 0.2 kev, 0.41^{+0.17}_{-0.13} z_solar and220^{+90}_{-70} kpc, respectively. these parameters are typical for clusters.we thus conclude that abell 1674 consists of two independent clusters, a1674-cat z ~0.22 and a1674-sw at z ~0.11, overlapping along the line of sight. thex-ray luminosities of a1674-c within r = 2 mpc is 15.9 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{43}erg s^{-1} in the 0.1-2.4 kev energy band, while that for a1674-sw is 1.25 \pm0.07 \times 10^{43} erg s^{-1}. both are consistent with those expected fromthe l-t relation of clusters within a factor of 2. this is another support forour conclusion.

0804.3309	spatial distribution of the galactic center diffuse x-rays and the  spectra of the brightest 6.4kev clumps	the high energy resolution and low background, particularly in the hard x-rayband, of the x-ray imaging spectrometer onboard suzaku provide excellentspectra of the galactic center diffuse x-rays (gcdx). this paper reports on theresults of spatially resolved spectroscopy of gcdx. the most pronouncedfeatures of gcdx are the k-shell transition lines from neutral (fei) andhe-like (fexxv) irons at energies of 6.4kev and 6.7kev, respectively. thefluxes of these lines are non-uniformly and asymmetrically distributed withrespect to sgr a*. the 6.4kev lines are particularly bright on the positiveside of the galactic longitude (east-side) with clumpy structures. a brightclump near the gc exhibits a time variability over a timescale of a few years.neither the 6.4kev nor 6.7kev line flux shows close proportionality to thecontinuum flux (5--10kev band); the 6.4kev line shows excess on the high fluxside, and vice versa for the 6.7kev line. on the other hand, the sum of the6.4kev plus 6.7kev line fluxes with a ratio of 1:2 shows good proportionalityto the continuum flux, and hence we phenomenologically decomposed the continuumflux of the gcdx into the 6.4kev- and 6.7kev-associated continuums with a fluxratio of 1:2. based on these facts, we have tried to estimate the contributionof diffuse and integrated flux of point sources to the gcdx.

1502.04255	a chandrasekhar mass progenitor for the type ia supernova remnant 3c 397  from the enhanced abundances of nickel and manganese	despite decades of intense efforts, many fundamental aspects of type iasupernova (sne ia) remain elusive. one of the major open questions is whetherthe mass of the exploding white dwarf (wd) is close to the chandrasekhar limit.here we report the detection of strong k-shell emission from stable fe-peakelements in the suzaku x-ray spectrum of the type ia supernova remnant (snr) 3c397. the high ni/fe and mn/fe mass ratios (0.11-0.24 and 0.018-0.033,respectively) in the hot plasma component that dominates the k-shell emissionlines indicate a degree of neutronization in the sn ejecta which can only beachieved by electron captures in the dense cores of exploding wds with anear-chandrasekhar mass. this suggests a single-degenerate origin for 3c 397,since chandrasekhar mass progenitors are expected naturally if the wd accretesmass slowly from a companion. together with other results supporting thedouble-degenerate scenario, our work adds to the mounting evidence that bothprogenitor channels make a significant contribution to the sn ia rate instar-forming galaxies.

1505.07913	n49: the first robust discovery of a recombining plasma in an extra  galactic supernova remnant	recent discoveries of recombining plasmas (rps) in supernova remnants (snrs)have dramatically changed our understanding of snr evolution. to date, a dozenof rp snrs have been identified in the galaxy. here we present suzaku deepobservations of four snrs in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), n49, n49b, n23,and dem l71, for accurate determination of their plasma state. our uniformanalysis reveals that only n49 is in the recombining state among them, which isthe first robust discovery of a rp from an extra-galactic snr. given that rpshave been identified only in core-collapse snrs, our result strongly suggests amassive star origin of this snr. on the other hand, no clear evidence for a rpis confirmed in n23, from which detection of recombination lines and continuawas previously claimed. comparing the physical properties of the rp snrsidentified so far, we find that all of them are categorized into the"mixed-morphology" class and interacting with surrounding molecular clouds.this might be a key to solve formation mechanisms of the rps.

1506.03135	kepler's supernova: an overluminous type ia event interacting with a  massive circumstellar medium at a very late phase	we have analyzed xmm-newton, chandra, and suzaku observations of kepler'ssupernova remnant (snr) to investigate the properties of both the sn ejecta andthe circumstellar medium (csm). for comparison, we have also analyzed twosimilarly-aged, ejecta-dominated snrs: tycho's snr, thought to be the remnantof a typical type ia sn, and snr 0509-67.5 in the large magellanic cloud,thought to be the remnant of an overluminous type ia sn. by simply comparingthe x-ray spectra, we find that line intensity ratios of iron-group elements(ige) to intermediate-mass elements (ime) for kepler's snr and snr 0509-67.5are much higher than those for tycho's snr. we therefore argue that kepler isthe product of an overluminous type ia sn. this inference is supported by ourspectral modeling, which reveals the ige and ime masses respectively to be~0.95 m_sun and ~0.12 m_sun (kepler's snr), ~0.75 m_sun and ~0.34 m_sun (snr0509-67.5), and ~0.35 m_sun and ~0.70 m_sun (tycho's snr). we find that the csmcomponent in kepler's snr consists of tenuous diffuse gas (~0.3 m_sun) presentthroughout the entire remnant, plus dense knots (~0.035 m_sun). both of thesecomponents have an elevated n abundance (n/h ~ 4 times the solar value),suggesting that they originate from cno-processed material from the progenitorsystem. the mass of the diffuse csm allows us to infer the pre-sn mass-lossrate to be ~1.5e-5 (v_w/10 km/s) m_sun/yr, in general agreement with resultsfrom recent hydrodynamical simulations. since the dense knots have slow propermotions and relatively small ionization timescales, they were likely located afew pc away from the progenitor system. therefore, we argue that kepler's snwas an overluminous event that started to interact with massive csm a fewhundred years after the explosion. this supports the possible link betweenoverluminous sne and the so-called "ia-csm" sne.

0805.2079	x-ray observations of the sagittarius d hii region toward the galactic  center with suzaku	we present a suzaku x-ray study of the sagittarius d (sgr d) hii region inthe galactic center region. two 18'x18' images by the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) encompass the entire sgr d complex. thanks to the lowbackground, xis discovered two diffuse sources with low surface brightness andobtained their high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. one is associated with thecore of the sgr d hii region, arising from the young stellar cluster. the otheris a new object in the vicinity of the region. we also present 3.5 cm and 6.0cm radio continuum maps of the new source using the 100 m green bank telescope.we conclude that the source is a new supernova remnant (snr; g1.2--0.0) basedon: (1) the 0.9+/-0.2 kev thermal x-ray spectrum with emission lines fromhighly ionized atoms; (2) the diffuse nature with an apparent extent of ~10 pcat the galactic center distance inferred from the x-ray absorption(~8.5x10^{22} cm^{-2}); and (3) the nonthermal radio continuum spectral index(~-0.5). our discovery of an snr in the sgr d hii region leads to a revision ofthe view of this system, which had been considered to be a thermal hii regionand its environment.

1510.04025	evidence for thermal x-ray line emission from the synchrotron-dominated  supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	we report the first detection of thermal x-ray line emission from thesupernova remnant (snr) rx j1713.7-3946, the prototype of the small class ofsynchrotron dominated snrs. a softness-ratio map generated using xmm-newtondata shows that faint interior regions are softer than bright shell regions.using suzaku and deep xmm-newton observations, we have extracted x-ray spectrafrom the softest area, finding clear line features at 1 kev and 1.35 kev. theselines can be best explained as ne ly-alpha and mg he-alpha from a thermalemission component. since the abundance ratios of metals to fe are much higherthan solar values in the thermal component, we attribute the thermal emissionto reverse-shocked sn ejecta. the measured mg/ne, si/ne, and fe/ne ratios of2.0-2.6, 1.5-2.0, and &lt;0.05 solar suggest that the progenitor star of rxj1713.7-3946 was a relatively low-mass star (&lt;~20 m_sun), consistent with aprevious inference based on the effect of stellar winds of the progenitor staron the surrounding medium. since the mean blastwave speed of ~6000 km/s (theradius of 9.6 pc divided by the age of 1600 yr) is relatively fast comparedwith other core-collapse snrs, we propose that rx j1713.7-3946 is a result of atype ib/c supernova whose progenitor was a member of an interacting binary.while our analysis provides strong evidence for x-ray line emission, ourinterpretation of its nature as thermal emission from sn ejecta requiresfurther confirmation especially through future precision spectroscopicmeasurements using astro-h.

1510.06832	number density distribution of near-infrared sources on a sub-degree  scale in the galactic center: comparison with the fe xxv ka line at 6.7 kev	the stellar distribution derived from an $h$ and $k_{\mathrm s}$-band surveyof the central region of our galaxy is compared with the fe xxv k$\alpha$ (6.7kev) line intensity observed with the suzaku satellite. the survey is for thegalactic coordinates $|l| \lesssim 3^{\circ}.0$ and $|b| \lesssim 1^{\circ}.0$(equivalent to 0.8 kpc $\times$ 0.3 kpc for $r_0 = 8$ kpc), and thenumber-density distribution $n(k_{\mathrm s,0}; l, b)$ of stars is derivedusing the extinction-corrected magnitude $k_{\mathrm s,0}=10.5$. this is deepenough to probe the old red giant population and in turn to estimate the ($l$,$b$) distribution of faint x-ray point sources such as coronally activebinaries and cataclysmic variables. in the galactic plane ($b=0^{\circ}$),$n(10.5; l, b)$ increases to the galactic center as $|l|^{-0.30 \pm 0.03}$ inthe range of $-0^{\circ}.1 \geq l \geq -0^{\circ}.7$, but this increase issignificantly slower than the increase ($|l|^{-0.44 \pm 0.02}$ ) of the fe xxvk$\alpha$ line intensity. if normalized with the ratios in the outer region$1^{\circ}.5 \leq |l| \leq 2^{\circ}.8$, where faint x-ray point sources areargued to dominate the diffuse galactic x-ray ridge emission, the excess of thefe xxv k$\alpha$ line intensity over the stellar number density is at least afactor of two at $|l| = 0^{\circ}.1$. this indicates that a significant part ofthe galactic center diffuse emission arises from a truly diffuse optically-thinthermal plasma, and not from an unresolved collection of faint x-ray pointsources related to the old stellar population.

1512.04300	suzaku spectra of a type ii supernova remnant kes 79	this paper reports results of a suzaku observation of the supernova remnant(snr) kes 79 (g33.6+0.1). the x-ray spectrum is best fitted by atwo-temperature model: a non-equilibrium ionization (nei) plasma and acollisional ionization equilibrium (cie) plasma. the nei plasma is spatiallyconfined within the inner radio shell with kt~0.8 kev, while the cie plasma isfound in more spatially extended regions associated with the outer radio shellwith kt~0.2 kev and solar abundance. therefore, the nei plasma is attributableto the sn ejecta and the cie plasma is forward shocked interstellar medium. inthe nei plasma, we discovered k-shell line of al, ar and ca for the first time.the abundance pattern and estimated mass of the ejecta are consistent with thecore-collapse supernova explosion of a ~30-40 solar mass progenitor star. an feline with center energy of ~6.4 kev is also found in the southeast (se) portionof the snr, a close peripheral region around dense molecular clouds. onepossibility is that the line is associated with the ejecta. however, thecentroid energy of ~6.4 kev and the spatial distribution of enhancement nearthe se peripheral do not favor this scenario. since the ~6.4 kev emittingregion coincides to the molecular clouds, we propose another possibility thatthe fe line is due to k-shell ionization of neutral fe by the interaction oflocally accelerated protons (lecrp) with the surrounding molecular cloud. boththese possibilities, heated ejecta or lecrp origin, are discussed based on theobservational facts.

astro-ph;0002167	a study of the populations of x-ray sources in the small magellanic  cloud with asca	the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics (asca) has mademultiple observations of the small magellanic cloud (smc). x-ray mosaic imagesin the soft (0.7--2.0 kev) and hard (2.0--7.0 kev) bands are separatelyconstructed, and the latter provides the first hard x-ray view of the smc. weextract 39 sources from the two-band images with a criterion of s/n&gt;5, andconduct timing and spectral analyses for all of these sources. coherentpulsations are detected from 12 x-ray sources; five of which are newdiscoveries. most of the 12 x-ray pulsars are found to exhibit long-term fluxvariabilities, hence they are likely to be x-ray binary pulsars (xbps). on theother hand, we classify four supernova remnants (snrs) as thermal snrs, becausetheir spectra exhibit emission lines from highly ionized atoms. we find thatxbps and thermal snrs in the smc can be clearly separated by their hardnessratio (the ratio of the count rate between the hard and soft bands). using thisempirical grouping, we find many xbp candidates in the smc, although nopulsations have yet been detected from these sources. possible implications onthe star-formation history and evolution of the smc are presented by acomparison of the source populations in the smc and our galaxy.

astro-ph;0003057	deep x-ray observations of supernova remnants g359.1-0.5 and g359.0-0.9  with asca	we present the results of deep asca observations of two shell-like radiosupernova remnants (snrs) located in the direction to the galactic center (gc)region. unlike the radio morphology, g359.1-0.5 shows center-filled x-rays withprominent k-alpha lines of he-like silicon and h-like sulfur. the plasmarequires at least two temperature components: a silicon-dominated cool plasmaof 0.6kev temperature and a sulfur-dominated higher temperature plasma of4.4kev. because the absorption column is ~ 6x10^22 h cm^-2, this snr would benear to the gc. the spherical plasma is attributable to supernova ejecta withthe total mass of si and s being about 0.1 solar mass and 0.3 solar mass,respectively. x-rays from g359.0-0.9 trace the partial shell structure of theradio emission. the spectrum is well fitted to a single-temperature plasma of0.4kev with a non-solar abundance of magnesium or iron. because the absorptioncolumn is not very large, ~ 1.8x10^22 h cm^-2, g359.0-0.9 would be in front ofthe gc region. the total supernova energy, interstellar density near to thex-ray emitting shell and age of the snr are estimated to be 1.2x10^51erg,0.5cm^-3, and 1.8x10^4yr, respectively. we also discuss possible implicationson the origin of the large-scale hot plasma surrounding the gc.

astro-ph;0007365	discovery of non-thermal x-rays from the shell of rcw86	we report the asca (advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics)results of rcw 86, a shell-like supernova remnant (snr). the bright region inthe x-ray band traces the radio clumpy shell, although details of the structureare different. the x-ray spectrum from each part of the shell can not be fittedto a thin thermal plasma model, but requires, at least three components: a lowtemperature plasma of 0.3 kev, high temperature plasma of &gt; several kev, and apower-law component with a photon index = 3. the abundances of o, ne, mg and siare significantly higher than that of fe, indicating that rcw 86 is a type iisnr. the absorption column of 3e21 h cm^-2 indicates the distance to the snr tobe several kpc. the power-law component can be interpreted to be synchrotronradiation of high energy electrons. assuming energy density equipartitionbetween the magnetic field and the electrons, and using the radio and x-rayspectra, we argue that high energy electrons are accelerated up to 20 tev. theacceleration efficiency is, however, different from shell to shell.

astro-ph;0311345	constraints on the diffusive shock acceleration from the nonthermal  x-ray thin shells in sn1006 ne rim	characteristic scale lengths of nonthermal x-rays from the sn1006 ne rim,which are observed by chandra, are interpreted in the context of the diffusiveshock acceleration on the assumption that the observed spatial profile ofnonthermal x-rays corresponds to that of accelerated electrons with energies ofa few tens of tev. to explain the observed scale lengths, we construct twosimple models with a test particle approximation, where the maximum energy ofaccelerated electrons is determined by the age of sn1006 (age-limited model) orthe energy loss (energy loss-limited model), and constrain the magnetic fieldconfiguration and the diffusion coefficients of accelerated electrons. when themagnetic field is nearly parallel to the shock normal, the magnetic fieldshould be in the range of 20-85 micro gauss and highly turbulent both inupstream and downstream, which means that the mean free path of acceleratedelectrons is on the order of their gyro-radius (bohm limit). this situation canbe realized both in the age-limited and energy loss-limited model. on the otherhand, when the magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal,which can exist only in the age-limited case, the magnetic field is severalmicro gauss in the upstream and 14-20 micro gauss in the downstream, and theupstream magnetic field is less turbulent than the downstream.

0808.3501	suzaku observation of 30dor c: a supernova remnant with the largest  non-thermal shell	this paper reports on the suzaku results of thermal and non-thermal featuresof 30 dor c, a supernova remnant (snr) in a superbubble of the large magellaniccloud (lmc). the west rim exhibits a non-thermal x-ray spectrum with no thermalcomponent. a single power-law model is rejected but a power-law model withspectral cutoff is accepted. the cutoff frequency of $(3-7)\times 10^{17}$ hzis the highest among the shell type snrs like sn 1006 ($\sim 6\times 10^{16}$hz), and hence 30 dor c would be the site of the highest energy accelerator ofthe snr shock. the southeast (se) and northeast (ne) rims have both the thermaland non-thermal components. the thin-thermal plasmas in the both rims are incollisional ionization equilibrium state. the electron temperature of theplasma in the se rim ($kt_e \sim 0.7$ kev) is found to be higher than thepreviously reported value. the power-law index from se is nearly the same as,while that from the ne is larger than that of the west rim. the snr age wouldbe in the range of $(4-20)\times 10^3$ yr. thus, 30 dor c is likely to be theoldest shell-like snr with non-thermal emission.

astro-ph;0406489	x-ray study of the intermediate-mass young stars herbig ae/be stars	we present the asca results of intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars(pmss), or herbig ae/be stars (haebes). among the 35 asca pointed-sources, wedetect 11 plausible x-ray counterparts. x-ray luminosities of the detectedsources in the 0.5-10 kev band are in the range of log lx ~30-32 ergs s-1,which is systematically higher than those of low-mass pmss. this fact suggeststhat the contribution of a possible low-mass companion is not large. most ofthe bright sources show significant time variation, particularly, two haebes -mwc 297 and ty cra - exhibit flare-like events with long decay timescales(e-folding time ~ 10-60 ksec). these flare shapes are similar to those oflow-mass pmss. the x-ray spectra are successfully reproduced by an absorbed oneor two-temperature thin-thermal plasma model. the temperatures are in the rangeof kt ~1-5 kev, which are significantly higher than those of main-sequence obstars (kt &lt; 1 kev). these x-ray properties are not explained by wind drivenshocks, but are more likely due to magnetic activity. on the other hand, theplasma temperature rises as absorption column density increases, or as haebesascend to earlier phases. the x-ray luminosity reduces after stellar age of afew x10^6 years. x-ray activity may be related to stellar evolution. the age ofthe activity decay is apparently near the termination of jet or outflowactivity. we thus hypothesize that magnetic activity originates from theinteraction of the large scale magnetic fields coupled to the circumstellardisk. we also discuss differences in x-ray properties between haebes andmain-sequence ob stars.

astro-ph;0412249	chandra observation of the starburst galaxy ngc 2146	we present six monitoring observations of the starburst galaxy ngc 2146 usingthe chandra x-ray observatory. we have detected 67 point sources in the 8'.7 x8'.7 field of view of the acis-s detector. six of these sources wereultra-luminous x-ray sources, the brightest of which has a luminosity of 5 x10^{39} ergs s^{-1}. one of the source, with a luminosity of ~1 x 10^{39} ergss^{-1}, is coincident with the dynamical center location, as derived from the^{12}co rotation curve. we suggest that this source may be a low-luminosityactive galactic nucleus. we have produced a table where the positions and maincharacteristics of the chandra-detected sources are reported. the comparisonbetween the positions of the x-ray sources and those of compact sourcesdetected in nir or radio does not indicate any definite counterpart. takingprofit of the relatively large number of sources detected, we have derived alogn-logs relation and a luminosity function. the former shows a break at\~10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}, that we interpret as due to a detection limit.the latter has a slope above the break of 0.71, which is similar to those foundin the other starburst galaxies. in addition, a diffuse x-ray emission has beendetected in both, soft (0.5--2.0kev) and hard (2.0--10.0kev), energy bands. thespectra of the diffuse component has been fitted with a two (hard and soft)components. the hard power-law component, with a luminosity of ~4 x 10^{39}ergs s^{-1}, is likely originated by unresolved point sources, while the softcomponent is better described by a thermal plasma model with a temperature of0.5kev and high abundances for mg and si.

astro-ph;0609215	iron and nickel line diagnostics for the galactic center diffuse  emission	we have observed the diffuse x-ray emission from the galactic center (gc)using the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) on suzaku. the high-energyresolution and the low-background orbit provide excellent spectra of the gcdiffuse x-rays (gcdx). the xis found many emission lines in the gcdx near theenergy of k-shell transitions of iron and nickel. the most pronounced featuresare fei k alpha at 6.4 kev and k-shell absorption edge at 7.1 kev, which arefrom neutral and/or low ionization states of iron, and the k-shell lines at 6.7kev and 6.9 kev from he-like (fexxv k alpha) and hydrogenic (fexxvi ly alpha)ions of iron. in addition, k alpha lines from neutral or low ionization nickel(nii k alpha) and he-like nickel (nixxvii k alpha), and fei k beta, fexxv kbeta, fexxvi ly beta, fexxv k gamma and fexxvi ly gamma are detected for thefirst time. the line center energies and widths of fexxv k alpha and fexxvi lyalpha favor a collisional excitation (ce) plasma for the origin of the gcdx.the electron temperature determined from the line flux ratio of fexxv k alpha /fexxv k beta is similar to the ionization temperature determined from that offexxv k alpha /fexxvi ly alpha. thus it would appear that the gcdx plasma isclose to ionization equilibrium. the 6.7 kev flux and temperature distributionto the galactic longitude is smooth and monotonic,in contrast to the integratedpoint source flux distribution. these facts support the hypothesis that thegcdx is truly diffuse emission rather than the integration of the outputs of alarge number of unresolved point sources. in addition, our results demonstratethat the chemical composition of fe in the interstellar gas near the gc isconstrained to be about 3.5 times solar.

astro-ph;9911373	quasi-periodic x-ray flares from the protostar ylw15	with asca, we have detected three x-ray flares from the class i protostarylw15. the flares occurred every ~20 hours and showed an exponential decay withtime constant 30-60 ks. the x-ray spectra are explained by a thin thermalplasma emission. the plasma temperature shows a fast-rise and slow-decay foreach flare with kt_{peak}~4-6 kev. the emission measure of the plasma showsthis time profile only for the first flare, and remains almost constant duringthe second and third flares at the level of the tail of the first flare. thepeak flare luminosities l_{x,peak} were ~5-20 * 10^{31} erg s^{-1}, which areamong the brightest x-ray luminosities observed to date for class i protostars.the total energy released in each flare was 3-6*10^{36} ergs. the first flareis well reproduced by the quasi-static cooling model, which is based on solarflares, and it suggests that the plasma cools mainly radiatively, confined by asemi-circular magnetic loop of length ~14 ro with diameter-to-length ratio\~0.07. the two subsequent flares were consistent with the reheating of thesame magnetic structure as of the first flare. the large-scale magneticstructure and the periodicity of the flares imply that the reheating events ofthe same magnetic loop originate in an interaction between the star and thedisk due to the differential rotation.

astro-ph;9911379	rotation and x-ray emission from protostars	the asca satellite has recently detected variable hard x-ray emission fromtwo class i protostars in the rho oph cloud, ylw15 (irs43) and wl6, with acharacteristic time scale ~20h. in ylw15, the x-ray emission is in the form ofquasi-periodic energetic flares, which we explain in terms of strong magneticshearing and reconnection between the central star and the accretion disk. inwl6, x-ray flaring is rotationally modulated, and appears to be more like thesolar-type magnetic activity ubiquitous on t tauri stars. we find that ylw15 isa fast rotator (near break-up), while wl6 rotates with a significantly longerperiod. we derive a mass m_\star ~ 2 m_\odot and \simlt 0.4 m_\odot for thecentral stars of ylw15 and wl6 respectively. on the long term, the interactionsbetween the star and the disk results in magnetic braking and angular momentumloss of the star. on time scales t_{br} ~ a few 10^5 yrs, i.e., of the sameorder as the estimated duration of the class~i protostar stage. close to thebirthline there must be a mass-rotation relation, t_{br} \simpropto m_\star,such that stars with m_\star \simgt 1-2 m_\odot are fast rotators, while theirlower-mass counterparts have had the time to spin down. the rapid rotation andstrong star-disk magnetic interactions of ylw15 also naturally explain theobservation of x-ray ``superflares''. in the case of ylw15, and perhaps also ofother protostars, a hot coronal wind (t~10^6 k) may be responsible for the vlathermal radio emission. this paper thus proposes the first clues to therotation status and evolution of protostars.
