0902.2324	the kinematics of late type stars in the solar cylinder studied with  sdss data	we study the velocity distribution of milky way disk stars in akiloparsec-sized region around the sun, based on ~ 2 million m-type stars fromdr7 of sdss, which have newly re-calibrated absolute proper motions fromcombining sdss positions with the usno-b catalogue. we estimate photometricdistances to all stars, accurate to ~ 20 %, and combine them with the propermotions to derive tangential velocities for this kinematically unbiased sampleof stars. based on a statistical de-projection method we then derive thevertical profiles (to heights of z = 800 pc above the disk plane) for the firstand second moments of the three dimensional stellar velocity distribution. wefind that &lt;w&gt; = -7 +/- 1 km/s and &lt;u&gt; = -9 +/- 1 km/s, independent of heightabove the mid-plane, reflecting the sun's motion with respect to the localstandard of rest. in contrast, &lt;v&gt; changes distinctly from -20 +/- 2 km/s inthe mid-plane to &lt;v&gt; = -32 km/s at z = 800 pc, reflecting an asymmetric driftof the stellar mean velocity that increases with height. all three componentsof the m-star velocity dispersion show a strong linear rise away from themid-plane, most notably \sigma_{zz}, which grows from 18 km/s (z = 0) to 40km/s (at z = 800 pc). we determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid,and find a significant vertex deviation of 20 to 25 degrees, which decreasesonly slightly to heights of z = 800 pc. away from the mid-plane, our sampleexhibits a remarkably large tilt of the velocity ellipsoid towards the galacticplane, which reaches 20 deg. at z = 800 pc and which is not easily explained.finally, we determine the ratio \sigma^2_{\phi\phi}/\sigma^2_{rr} near themid-plane, which in the epicyclic approximation implies an almost perfectlyflat rotation curve at the solar radius.

0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0904.1003	halo streams in the 7th sdss data release	we have detected stellar halo streams in the solar neighborhood using datafrom the 7th public data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), whichincludes the directed stellar program segue: sloan extension for galacticunderstanding and exploration. in order to derive distances to each star, weused the metallicity-dependent photometric parallax relation from ivezic et al.(2008) for which we examine and quantify the accuracy. our final sampleconsists of 22,321 nearby (d &lt; 2 kpc), metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -0.5) main-sequencestars with 6d estimates of position and space velocity. we characterize theorbits of these stars through suitable kinematic proxies for their "effective"integrals of motion, angular momentum, eccentricity, and orbital polar angleand compare the observed distribution to expectations from a smoothdistribution in four [fe/h] bins. on this basis we identify at least fivesignificant "phase-space overdensities" of stars on very similar orbits in thesolar neighborhood to which we can assign unambiguously peaked [fe/h]distributions. three of them have been identified previously, including thehalo stream discovered by helmi et al. (1999) at a significance level of 12.0.in addition, we find at least two new genuine halo streams, judged by theirkinematics and [fe/h], at significance levels of 2.9 and 4.8, respectively. forone stream the stars even show coherence in configuration space, matching aspatial overdensity of stars found by juric et al. (2008) at (r,z) \approx(9.5,0.8) kpc. our results demonstrate the practical power of our search methodto detect substructure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars withoutmaking a-priori assumptions about the detailed form of the gravitationalpotential.

0907.0258	automated determination of [fe/h] and [c/fe] from low-resolution  spectroscopy	we develop an automated spectral synthesis technique for the estimation ofmetallicities ([fe/h]) and carbon abundances ([c/fe]) for metal-poor stars,including carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, for which other methods may proveinsufficient. this technique, automoog, is designed to operate on relativelystrong features visible in even low- to medium-resolution spectra, yieldingresults comparable to much more telescope-intensive high-resolution studies. wevalidate this method by comparison with 913 stars which have existinghigh-resolution and low- to medium-resolution to medium-resolution spectra, andthat cover a wide range of stellar parameters. we find that at lowmetallicities ([fe/h] &lt; -2.0), we successfully recover both the metallicity andcarbon abundance, where possible, with an accuracy of ~ 0.20 dex. at highermetallicities, due to issues of continuum placement in spectral normalizationdone prior to the running of automoog, a general underestimate of the overallmetallicity of a star is seen, although the carbon abundance is stillsuccessfully recovered. as a result, this method is only recommended for use onsamples of stars of known sufficiently low metallicity. for theselow-metallicity stars, however, automoog performs much more consistently andquickly than similar, existing techniques, which should allow for analyses oflarge samples of metal-poor stars in the near future. steps to improve andcorrect the continuum placement difficulties are being pursued.

0707.4252	fluorine in a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star	the fluorine abundance of the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) star he1305+0132 has been derived by analysis of the molecular hf (1-0) r9 line at2.3357 microns in a high-resolution (r = 50,000) spectrum obtained with thephoenix spectrometer and gemini-south telescope. our abundance analysis makesuse of a cno-enhanced atlas12 model atmosphere characterized by a metallicityand cno enhancements determined utilizing medium-resolution (r = 3,000) opticaland near-ir spectra. the effective iron abundance is found to be [fe/h] = -2.5,making he 1305+0132 the most fe-deficient star, by more than an order ofmagnitude, for which the abundance of fluorine has been measured. usingspectral synthesis, we derive a super-solar fluorine abundance of a(19f) = 4.96+/- 0.21, corresponding to a relative abundance of [f/fe] = 2.90. a single lineof the phillips c_2 system is identified in our phoenix spectrum, and alongwith multiple lines of the first-overtone vibration-rotation co (3-1) bandhead, c and o abundances of a(12c) = 8.57 +/- 0.11 and a(16o) = 7.04 +/- 0.14are derived. we consider the striking fluorine overabundance in the frameworkof the nucleosynthetic processes thought to be responsible for thec-enhancement of cemp stars and conclude that the atmosphere of he 1305+0132was polluted via mass transfer by a primary companion during its asymptoticgiant branch phase. this is the first study of fluorine in a cemp star, and itdemonstrates that this rare nuclide can be a key diagnostic of nucleosyntheticprocesses in the early galaxy.

1003.4510	the metal-poor end of the spite plateau. 1: stellar parameters,  metallicities and lithium abundances	we present vlt-uves li abundances for 28 halo dwarf stars between [fe/h]=-2.5and -3.5, 10 of which have [fe/h]&lt;-3. four different t_eff scales have beenused. direct infrared flux method (irfm) has been used on the basis of 2massinfrared photometry. h_alpha wings have been fitted against synthetic gridscomputed by means of 1d lte atmosphere models, assuming differentself-broadening theories. finally, a grid of h_alpha profiles has been computedby means of 3d hydrodynamical atmosphere models. the li i doublet at 670.8 nmhas been used to measure a(li) by means of 3d hydrodynamical nlte spectralsyntheses. an analytical fit of a(li)(3d, nlte) as a function of equivalentwidth, t_eff, log g, and [fe/h] has been derived and is made available. a(li)does not exhibit a plateau below [fe/h]=-3. a strong positive correlation with[fe/h] appears, not influenced by the choice of the t_eff estimator. from alinear fit, we obtain a strong slope of about 0.30 dex in a(li) per dex in[fe/h], significant to 2-3 sigma, and consistent among all the four t_effestimators. a significant slope is also detected in the a(li)--t_eff plane,driven mainly by the coolest stars in the sample which appear li-poor. removingsuch stars does not alter the behavior in the a(li)-[fe/h] plane. the scatterin a(li) increases by a factor of 2 towards lower metallicities, while theplateau appears very thin above [fe/h]=-2.8. the meltdown of the spite plateaubelow [fe/h]\sim-3 is established, but its cause is unclear. if the primordiala(li) is the one derived from wmap, it appears difficult to envision a singledepletion phenomenon producing a thin, metallicity independent plateau above[fe/h]=-2.8, and a highly scattered, metallicity dependent distribution below.the fact that no star below [fe/h]=-3 lies above the plateau suggests that theyformed at plateau level and underwent subsequent depletion.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

0712.2949	first stars xi. chemical composition of the extremely metal-poor dwarfs  in the binary cs 22876--032	we have used high-resolution, high-s/n ratio spectra from the uvesspectrograph at the eso vlt telescope. long-term radial-velocity measurementsand broad-band photometry allow us to determine improved orbital elements andstellar parameters for both components. we use osmarcs 1d models and the{{\scshape turbospectrum}} spectral synthesis code to determine the abundancesof li, o, na, mg, al, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, fe, co and ni. we also use theco$^5$bold model atmosphere code to compute the 3d abundance corrections,especially for li and o. we find a metallicity of [fe/h]$\sim -3.6$ for bothstars, using 1d models with 3d corrections of $\sim -0.1$ dex from averaged 3dmodels. we determine the oxygen abundance from the near-uv oh bands; the 3dcorrections are large, -1 and -1.5 dex for the secondary and primaryrespectively, and yield [o/fe] $\sim 0.8$, close to the high-quality resultsobtained from the [oi] 630 nm line in metal-poor giants. other [$\alpha$/fe]ratios are consistent with those measured in other dwarfs and giants withsimilar [fe/h], although ca and si are somewhat low ([x/fe]$\la 0$). otherelement ratios follow those of other halo stars. the li abundance of theprimary star is consistent with the spite plateau, but the secondary shows alower abundance; 3d corrections are small. the li abundance in the primary starsupports the extension of the {{\em spite plateau}} value at the lowestmetallicities, without any decrease. the low abundance in the secondary starcould be explained by endogenic li depletion, due to its cooler temperature. ifthis is not the case, another, yet unknown mechanism may be causing increasedscatter in a(li) at the lowest metallicities.

0801.1232	the milky way's circular velocity curve to 60 kpc and an estimate of the  dark matter halo mass from kinematics of ~2400 sdss blue horizontal branch  stars	we derive new constraints on the mass of the milky way's dark matter halo,based on a set of halo stars from sdss as kinematic tracers. our samplecomprises 2401 rigorously selected blue horizontal-branch (bhb) halo starsdrawn from sdss dr-6. to interpret these distributions, we compare them tomatched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxyformation simulations designed to resemble the milky way, which we presume tohave an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. we then determine whichvalue of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$ brings the observed distribution into agreement withthe corresponding distributions from the simulations. this procedure results inan estimate of the milky way's circular velocity curve to $\sim 60$ kpc, whichis found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of $\rm 220 km s^{-1}$at the sun's location, and implies m$(&lt;60 \rm kpc) = 4.0\pm 0.7\times10^{11}$m$_\odot$. the radial dependence of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$, derived instatistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectationsfrom an nfw dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components atits center. if we assume an nfw halo profile of characteristic concentrationholds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the milkyway's dark matter halo, m$_{\rm vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times10^{12}$m$_\odot$, which is lower than many previous estimates. this estimateimplies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the milkyway's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our galaxy. a valuefor m$_{\rm vir}$ of only $\sim 1\times10^{12}$m$_\odot$ also (re-)opens thequestion of whether all of the milky way's satellite galaxies are on boundorbits.

1306.3614	chemical analysis of the ninth magnitude carbon-enhanced metal-poor star  bd+44 493	we present detailed chemical abundances for the bright carbon-enhancedmetal-poor (cemp) star bd+44 493, previously reported on by ito et al. ourmeasurements confirm that bd+44 493 is an extremely metal-poor ([fe/h]=-3.8)subgiant star with excesses of carbon and oxygen. no significant excesses arefound for nitrogen and neutron-capture elements (the latter of which place itin the cemp-no class of stars). other elements that we measure exhibitabundance patterns that are typical for non-cemp extremely metal-poor stars. noevidence for variations of radial velocity have been found for this star. theseresults strongly suggest that the carbon enhancement in bd+44 493 is unlikelyto have been produced by a companion asymptotic giant-branch star andtransferred to the presently observed star, nor by pollution of its natalmolecular cloud by rapidly-rotating, massive, mega metal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -6.0)stars. a more likely possibility is that this star formed from gas polluted bythe elements produced in a "faint" supernova, which underwent mixing andfallback, and only ejected small amounts of elements of metals beyond thelighter elements. the li abundance of bd+44 493 (a(li)=log(li/h)+12=1.0) islower than the spite plateau value, as found in other metal-poor subgiants. theupper limit on be abundance (a(be)=log(be/h)+12&lt;-1.8) is as low as those foundfor stars with similarly extremely-low metallicity, indicating that theprogenitors of carbon- (and oxygen-) enhanced stars are not significant sourcesof be, or that be is depleted in metal-poor subgiants with effectivetemperatures of ~5400k.

1404.0234	high-resolution abundance analysis of very metal-poor r-i stars	moderately r-process-enriched stars (r-i) are at least four times as commonas those that are greatly enriched in r-process elements (r-ii), and theabundances in their atmospheres are important tools for obtaining a betterunderstanding of the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the origin ofthe elements beyond the iron peak. the main aim of this work is to deriveabundances for a sample of seven metal-poor stars with classified as r-i stars,to understand the role of these stars for constraining the astrophysicalnucleosynthesis event(s) that is(are) responsible for the production of ther-process, and to investigate whether they differ, in any significant way, fromthe r-ii stars. we carried out a detailed abundance analysis based onhigh-resolution spectra obtained with the vlt/uves spectrograph. the osmarcslte 1d model atmosphere grid was employed, along with the spectrum synthesiscode turbospectrum. we have derived abundances of light elements li, c, and n,alpha-elements, odd-z elements, iron-peak elements, and the trans-iron elementsfrom the first peak, the second peak, the third peak, and the actinidesregions. the results are compared with values for these elements for r-ii andnormal very and extremely metal-poor stars reported in the literature, agesbased on radioactive chronometry are explored using different models, and anumber of conclusions about the r-process and the r-i stars are presented.hydrodynamical models were used for some elements, and general behaviors forthe 3d corrections were presented.

1405.2180	extinction maps towards the milky way bulge: 2d and 3d tests with apogee	galactic interstellar extinction maps are powerful and necessary tools formilky way structure and stellar population analyses, particularly toward theheavily-reddened bulge and in the midplane. however, due to the difficulty ofobtaining reliable extinction measures and distances for a large number ofstars that are independent of these maps, tests of their accuracy andsystematics have been limited.  our goal is to assess a variety of photometric stellar extinction estimates,including both 2d and 3d extinction maps, using independent extinction measuresbased on a large spectroscopic sample of stars towards the milky way bulge. weemploy stellar atmospheric parameters derived from high-resolution $h$-bandapogee spectra, combined with theoretical stellar isochrones, to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances for a sample of more than 2400 giantstowards the milky way bulge. we compare these extinction values to thosepredicted by individual near-ir and near+mid-ir stellar colors, 2d bulgeextinction maps and 3d extinction maps. the long baseline, near+mid-ir stellarcolors are, on average, the most accurate predictors of the apogee extinctionestimates, and the 2d and 3d extinction maps derived from different stellarpopulations along different sightlines show varying degrees of reliability. wepresent the results of all of the comparisons and discuss reasons for theobserved discrepancies. we also demonstrate how the particular stellaratmospheric models adopted can have a strong impact on this type of analysis,and discuss related caveats.

1405.5846	exploring the origin of lithium, carbon, strontium and barium with four  new ultra metal-poor stars	we present an elemental abundance analysis for four newly discovered ultrametal-poor stars from the hamburg/eso survey, with $\mathrm{[fe/h]}\leq-4$.based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we derive abundancesfor 17 elements in the range from li to ba. three of the four stars exhibitmoderate to large over-abundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in theirneutron-capture elements. the most metal-poor star in the sample,he~0233$-$0343 ($\mathrm{[fe/h]} = -4.68$), is a subgiant with a carbonenhancement of $\mathrm{[c/fe]}= +3.5$, slightly above the carbon-enhancementplateau suggested by spite et al. no carbon is detected in the spectrum of thefourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determinationof an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of $\mathrm{[c/fe]} &lt; +1.7$. wedetect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, includinghe~0233$-$0343. both stars with li detections are li-depleted, with respect tothe li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by spite \&amp; spite. this suggeststhat whatever site(s) produced c either do not completely destroy lithium, orthat li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordialli in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. the derived abundancesfor the $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similarto those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poorstars. finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of sr and ba forthese stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in theearly universe.

1406.3352	the alpha-element knee of the sagittarius stream	we employ abundances from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the sloanextension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) to study thealpha-element distribution of the stellar members of the sagittarius stream. totest the reliability of sdss/segue abundances for the study of sagittarius, weselect high-likelihood samples tracing the different components of the milkyway, and recover known literature alpha-element distributions. using selectioncriteria based on the spatial position, radial velocity, distance and coloursof individual stars, we obtain a robust sample of sagittarius-stream stars. thealpha-element distribution of the sagittarius stream forms a narrow sequence atintermediate metallicities with a clear turn-down, consistent with the presenceof an alpha-element "knee". this is the first time that the alpha-element kneeof the sagittarius dwarf galaxy has been detected. fitting a toy model to ourdata, we determine that the alpha-knee in sagittarius takes place at[fe/h]=-1.27pm0.05, only slightly less metal-poor than the knee in the milkyway. this indicates that a small number of sagittarius-like galaxies could havecontributed significantly to the build-up of the milky way's stellar halosystem at ancient times.

1501.04962	statistical time-resolved spectroscopy: a higher fraction of  short-period binaries for metal-rich f-type dwarfs in sdss	stellar multiplicity lies at the heart of many problems in modernastrophysics, including the physics of star formation, the observationalproperties of unresolved stellar populations, and the rates of interactingbinaries such as cataclysmic variables, x-ray binaries, and type ia supernovae.however, little is known about the stellar multiplicity of field stars in themilky way, in particular about the differences in the multiplicitycharacteristics between metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor halo stars. inthis study we perform a statistical analysis of ~14,000 f-type dwarf stars inthe milky way through time-resolved spectroscopy with the sub-exposuresarchived in the sloan digital sky survey. we obtain absolute radial velocitymeasurements through template cross-correlation of individual sub-exposureswith temporal baselines varying from minutes to years. these sparsely sampledradial velocity curves are analyzed using markov chain monte carlo techniquesto constrain the very short-period binary fraction for field f-type stars inthe milky way. metal-rich disk stars were found to be 30% more likely to havecompanions with periods shorter than 12 days than metal-poor halo stars.

1503.01990	new abundances from very old stars	metal-poor stars provide the fossil record of galactic chemical evolution andthe nucleosynthesis processes that took place at the earliest times in thehistory of our galaxy. from detailed abundance studies of low mass, extremelymetal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -3), we can trace and help constrain the formationprocesses which created the first heavy elements in our galaxy. here we presentthe results of a ~25-star homogeneously analysed sample of metal-poorcandidates from the hamburg/eso survey. we have derived abundances for a largenumber of elements ranging from li to ba, covering production processes fromhydrostatic burning to neutron-capture. the sample includes some of the mostmetal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -4) studied to date, and also a number of starsenhanced in carbon. the so called cemp (carbon enhanced metal-poor) stars,these stars make up ~20% of the stars with [fe/h] &lt; -3, and 80% of the starswith [fe/h] &lt; -4.5. the progenitors of cemp stars are still not fullyconstrained; they could be a result of binary mass transfer or high-massexplosive events in the early universe.

1503.04362	deep sdss optical spectroscopy of distant halo stars ii. iron, calcium,  and magnesium abundances	we analyze a sample of 3,944 low-resolution (r ~ 2000) optical spectra fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss), focusing on stars with effectivetemperatures 5800 &lt; teff &lt; 6300 k, and distances from the milky way plane inexcess of 5 kpc, and determine their abundances of fe, ca, and mg. we followedthe same methodology as in the previous paper in this series, derivingatmospheric parameters by chi2 minimization, but this time we obtained theabundances of individual elements by fitting their associated spectral lines.distances were calculated from absolute magnitudes obtained by a statisticalcomparison of our stellar parameters with stellar-evolution models. theobservations reveal a decrease in the abundances of iron, calcium, andmagnesium at large distances from the galactic center. the median abundancesfor the halo stars analyzed are fairly constant up to a galactocentric distancer ~ 20 kpc, rapidly decrease between r ~ 20 and r ~ 40 kpc, and flatten out tosignificantly lower values at larger distances, consistent with previousstudies. in addition, we examine the [ca/fe] and [mg/fe] as a function of fe/hand galactocentric distance. our results show that the most distant parts ofthe halo show a steeper variation of the [ca/fe] and [mg/fe] with iron. wefound that at the range -1.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.4 [ca/fe] decreases with distance,in agreement with earlier results based on local stars. however, the oppositetrend is apparent for [mg/fe]. our conclusion that the outer regions of thehalo are more metal-poor than the inner regions, based on in situ observationsof distant stars, agrees with recent results based on inferences from thekinematics of more local stars, and with predictions of recent galaxy formationsimulations for galaxies similar to the milky way.

1503.06990	young [$\alpha$/fe]-enhanced stars discovered by corot and apogee: what  is their origin?	we report the discovery of a group of apparently young corot red-giant starsexhibiting enhanced [alpha/fe] abundance ratios (as determined from apogeespectra) with respect to solar values. their existence is not explained bystandard chemical evolution models of the milky way, and shows that thechemical-enrichment history of the galactic disc is more complex. we findsimilar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could berobustly obtained, although in smaller relative numbers, which could explainwhy these stars have not received prior attention. the young [alpha/fe]-richstars are much more numerous in the corot-apogee (corogee) inner-field samplethan in any other high-resolution sample available at present, as only corogeecan explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. thekinematic properties of the young [$\alpha$/fe]-rich stars are not clearlythick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the galacticmid-plane. our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguingobservations in the milky way is that these stars were formed close to the endof the galactic bar, near corotation -- a region where gas can be kept inertfor longer times, compared to other regions shocked more frequently by thepassage of spiral arms. moreover, that is where the mass return from olderinner-disc stellar generations should be maximal (according to an inside-outdisc-formation scenario), further diluting the in-situ gas. other possibilitiesto explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are alsodiscussed.

0805.1121	fluorine in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars: a binary scenario	a super-solar fluorine abundance was observed in the carbon-enhancedmetal-poor (cemp) star he 1305+0132 ([f/fe] = +2.90, [fe/h] = -2.5). we proposethat this observation can be explained using a binary model that involve masstransfer from an asymptotic giant branch (agb) star companion and, based onthis model, we predict f abundances in cemp stars in general. we discuss wetherf can be used to discriminate between the formation histories of most cempstars: via binary mass transfer or from the ejecta of fast-rotating massivestars. we compute agb yields using different stellar evolution andnucleosynthesis codes to evaluate stellar model uncertainties. we use a simpledilution model to determine the factor by which the agb yields should bediluted to match the abundances observed in he 1305+0132. we further employ abinary population synthesis tool to estimate the probability of f-rich cempstars. the abundances observed in he 1305+0132 can be explained if this staraccreted 3-11% of the mass lost by its former agb companion. the primary agbstar should have dredged-up at least 0.2 msun of material from its he-richregion into the convective envelope via third dredge-up, which corresponds toagb models of z ~ 0.0001 and mass ~ 2 msun. many agb model uncertainties, suchas the treatment of convective borders and mass loss, require furtherinvestigation. we find that in the binary scenario most cemp stars should alsobe femp stars, that is, have [f/fe] &gt; +1, while fast-rotating massive stars donot appear to produce fluorine. we conclude that fluorine is a signature oflow-mass agb pollution in cemp stars, together with elements associated withthe slow neutron-capture process.

1507.04969	modelling the observed properties of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars  using binary population synthesis	the stellar population in the galactic halo is characterised by a largefraction of cemp stars. most cemp stars are enriched in $s$-elements (cemp-$s$stars), and some of these are also enriched in $r$-elements (cemp-$s/r$ stars).one formation scenario proposed for cemp stars invokes wind mass transfer inthe past from a tp-agb primary star to a less massive companion star which ispresently observed. we generate low-metallicity populations of binary stars toreproduce the observed cemp-star fraction. in addition, we aim to constrain ourwind mass-transfer model and investigate under which conditions our syntheticpopulations reproduce observed abundance distributions. we compare the cempfractions and the abundance distributions determined from our syntheticpopulations with observations. several physical parameters of the binarystellar population of the halo are uncertain, e.g. the initial mass function,the mass-ratio and orbital-period distributions, and the binary fraction. wevary the assumptions in our model about these parameters, as well as the windmass-transfer process, and study the consequent variations of our syntheticcemp population. the cemp fractions calculated in our synthetic populationsvary between 7% and 17%, a range consistent with the cemp fractions among verymetal-poor stars recently derived from the sdss/segue data sample. the resultsof our comparison between the modelled and observed abundance distributions aredifferent for cemp-$s/r$ stars and for cemp-$s$ stars. for the latter, oursimulations qualitatively reproduce the observed distributions of c, na, sr,ba, eu, and pb. contrarily, for cemp-$s/r$ stars our model cannot reproduce thelarge abundances of neutron-rich elements such as ba, eu, and pb. this resultis consistent with previous studies, and suggests that cemp-$s/r$ starsexperienced a different nucleosynthesis history to cemp-$s$ stars.

1509.05344	the role of binaries in the enrichment of the early galactic halo. i.  r-process-enhanced metal-poor stars	the detailed chemical composition of most metal-poor halo stars has beenfound to be highly uniform, but a minority of stars exhibit dramaticenhancements in their abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements and/or ofcarbon. the key question for galactic chemical evolution models is whetherthese peculiarities reflect the composition of the natal clouds, or if they aredue to later mass transfer of processed material from a binary companion. ifthe former case applies, the observed excess of certain elements was implantedwithin selected clouds in the early ism from a production site at interstellardistances. our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital properties ofbinaries among these chemically peculiar stars. this information provides thebasis for deciding whether mass transfer from a binary companion is necessaryand sufficient to explain their unusual compositions. this paper discusses ourstudy of a sample of 17 moderately (r-i) and highly (r-ii) r-process-elementenhanced vmp and emp stars. high-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra of thestars were obtained at roughly monthly intervals over 8 years with the fiesspectrograph at the nordic optical telescope. from these spectra, radialvelocities with an accuracy of ~100 m/s were determined by cross-correlationagainst an optimized template. 14 of the programme stars exhibit no significantrv variation over this period, while 3 are binaries with orbits of typicaleccentricity for their periods, resulting in a normal binary frequency of~18+-6% for the sample. our results confirm our preliminary conclusion from2011, based on partial data, that the chemical peculiarity of the r-i and r-iistars is not caused by any putative binary companions. instead, it wasimprinted on the natal molecular clouds of these stars by an external, distantsource. models of the ism in early galaxies should account for such mechanisms.

1510.08147	chronography of the milky way's halo system with field blue  horizontal-branch stars	in a pioneering effort, preston et al. reported that the colors of bluehorizontal-branch (bhb) stars in the halo of the galaxy shift with distance,from regions near the galactic center to about 12 kpc away, and interpretedthis as a correlated variation in the ages of halo stars, from older toyounger, spanning a range of a few gyrs. we have applied this approach to asample of some 4700 spectroscopically confirmed bhb stars selected from thesloan digital sky survey to produce the first "chronographic map" of the haloof the galaxy. we demonstrate that the mean de-reddened g$-$r color,&lt;(g$-$r)o&gt;, increases outward in the galaxy from $-$0.22 to $-$0.08 (over acolor window spanning [$-$0.3:0.0]) from regions close to the galactic centerto ~40 kpc, independent of the metallicity of the stars. models of the expectedshift in the color of the field bhb stars based on modern stellar evolutionarycodes confirm that this color gradient can be associated with an age differenceof roughly 2-2.5 gyrs, with the oldest stars concentrated in the central ~15kpc of the galaxy. within this central region, the age difference spans a meancolor range of about 0.05 mag (~0.8 gyrs). furthermore, we show thatchronographic maps can be used to identify individual substructures, such asthe sagittarius stream, and overdensities in the direction of virgo andmonoceros, based on the observed contrast in their mean bhb colors with respectto the foreground/background field population.

1511.08197	the role of binaries in the enrichment of the early galactic halo. ii.  carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars - cemp-no stars	the detailed composition of most metal-poor halo stars has been found to bevery uniform. however, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasingmetallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - theso-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars. a key question for galacticchemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflectsthat of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transferof chemically processed material from a binary companion; cemp stars shouldthen all be members of binary systems. our aim is to determine the frequencyand orbital parameters of binaries among cemp stars with and withoutover-abundances of neutron-capture elements - cemp-s and cemp-no stars,respectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. this paperdiscusses a sample of 24 cemp-no stars, while a subsequent paper will considera similar sample of cemp-s stars. most programme stars exhibit no statisticallysignificant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,while four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days andnormal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. the singlestars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-c band'', while thebinaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. we conclude that thenucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in theseancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted ontheir natal molecular clouds in the early galactic ism by an even earlier,external source, strongly indicating that the cemp-no stars are likely bonafide second-generation stars. we discuss potential production sites for carbonand its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ism, andimplications for the composition of high-redshift dla systems. abridged.

astro-ph;0203462	the extreme r-element rich, iron-poor halo giant cs31082-001:  implications for the r-process site(s) and radioactive cosmochronology	we present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the bright (v=11.7),extreme halo giant cs31082-001 ([fe/h] = -2.9), obtained in an eso-vlt largeprogramme dedicated to very metal-poor stars. we find cs31082-001 to beextremely rich in r-process elements, comparable in this respect only to thesimilarly metal-poor, but carbon-enriched, giant cs22892-052. as a result ofthe extreme overabundance of the heaviest r-process elements, and negligibleblending from ch and cn molecular lines, a reliable measurement is obtained ofthe u ii line at 386 nm, for the first time in a halo star, along with numerouslines of th ii, as well as lines of 25 other r-process elements. abundanceestimates for a total of 43 elements are reported in cs31082-001, almost halfof the entire periodic table. all elements with 56 \leq z \leq 72 follow thesolar r-element pattern, reduced by about 1.25 dex ([r/fe]=+1.7 dex, a factor50). pb, in contrast, seems to be below the shifted solar r-processdistribution, possibly indicating an error in the latter, while thorium is moreenhanced than the lighter nuclides. thus, while a universal production ratiofor the r-process elements seems to hold in the interval 56 \leq z \leq 72, itbreaks down in the actinide region. when available, the u/th is thus preferableto th/eu for radioactive dating: (i) because of its faster decay rate andsmaller sensitivity to observational errors, and (ii) because the initalproduction ratio of the neighboring nuclides 238u and 232th is more robustlypredicted than the 151eu/232th ratio. our current best estimate for the age ofcs31082-001 is 14.0+/-2.4 gyr.

astro-ph;0402298	spectroscopic studies of extremly metal-poor stars with  subaru/hds:ii.the r-process elements, including thorium	we present the abundance analyses for the neutron-capture elements, anddiscuss the observed abundance distributions in very metal-poor stars withexcesses of r-process elements. as has been found by previous abundancestudies, the star-to-star scatter in the abundances of neutron-capture elementsare very large. the abundance patterns of the heavy neutron-capture elements(56 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 70) in seven objects with moderate to large excesses of theneutron-capture elements are similar to that of the solar system r-processcomponent. these results strongly suggest that the heavy neutron-captureelements in these objects are primarily synthesized by the r-process. on theother hand, the abundance ratios of the light neutron-capture elements (38$\leq$ z $\leq$ 46) exhibit a rather large dispersion. our inspection of thecorrelation between sr and ba abundances in very metal-poor stars reveals thatthe dispersion of the sr abundances clearly decreases with increasing baabundance. this results support previous suggestions that the lightneutron-capture elements are likely to have been produced in differentastrophysical sites from those associated with the production of the heavierones. the th/eu abundance ratios (log(th/eu)) measured for the sevenr-process-enhanced stars range from -0.10 to -0.59. since these very metal-poorstars are believed to be formed in the early galaxy, this result means that asmall dispersion appears in the abundance ratios between th and rare-earthelements, such as eu, in very metal-poor stars. in order to apply the th/euratios to estimates of stellar ages, further understanding for the thproduction by the r-process nucleosynthesis is required.

astro-ph;0408380	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars in the early galaxy	very metal-deficient stars that exhibit enhancements of their carbonabundances are of crucial importance for understanding a number of issues --the nature of stellar evolution among the first generations of stars, the shapeof the initial mass function, and the relationship between carbon enhancementand neutron-capture processes, in particular the astrophysical s-process. onerecent discovery from objective-prism surveys dedicated to the discovery ofmetal-deficient stars is that the frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor(cemp) stars increases with declining metallicity, reaching roughly 25% for[fe/h] &lt; -2.5. in order to explore this phenomenon in greater detail we haveobtained medium-resolution (2 a) spectroscopy for about 350 of the 413 objectsin the christlieb et al. catalog of carbon-rich stars, selected from thehamburg/eso objective prism survey on the basis of their carbon-enhancement,rather than metal deficiency. based on these spectra, and near-ir jhkphotometry from the 2mass point source catalog, we obtain estimates of [fe/h]and [c/fe] for most of the stars in this sample, along with reasonably accuratedeterminations of their radial velocities. of particular importance, we findthat the upper envelope of carbon enhancement observed for these stars isnearly constant, at [c/h] ~ -1.0, over the metallicity range -4.0 &lt; [fe/h] &lt;-2.0; this same level of [c/h] applies to the most iron-deficent star yetdiscovered, he 0107-5240, at [fe/h] = -5.3.

astro-ph;0509788	enrichment of very metal-poor stars with both r-process and s-process  elements from 8-10 m_\odot stars	recent spectroscopic studies have revealed the presence of numerouscarbon-enhanced, metal-poor stars with [fe/h] &lt; -2.0 that exhibit strongenhancements of s-process elements. these stars are believed to be the resultof a binary mass-transfer episode from a former asymptotic giant-branch (agb)companion that underwent s-process nucleosynthesis. however, several such starsexhibit significantly lower ba/eu ratios than solar s-process abundances. thismight be explained if there were an additional contribution from the r-process,thereby diluting the ba/eu ratio by extra production of eu. we propose a modelin which the double enhancements of r-process and s-process elements originatefrom a former 8-10 m_\odot companion in a wide binary system, which may undergos-processing during an agb phase, followed by r-processing during itssubsequent supernova explosion. the mass of eu (as representative of r-processelements) captured by the secondary through the wind from the supernova isestimated, which is assumed to be proportional to the geometric fraction of thesecondary (low-mass, main-sequence) star with respect to the primary(exploding) star. we find that the estimated mass is in good agreement with aconstraint on the eu yield per supernova event obtained from a galacticchemical evolution study, when the initial orbital separation is taken to be\sim 1 year. if one assumes an orbital period on the order of five years, theefficiency of wind pollution from the supernova must be enhanced by a factor of\sim 10. this may, in fact, be realized if the expansion velocity of thesupernova's innermost ejecta, in which the r-process has taken place, issignificantly slow, resulting in an enhancement of accretion efficiency bygravitational focusing.

astro-ph;0509812	a spectroscopic study of the ancient milky way: f- and g-type stars in  the third data release of the sloan digital sky survey	(abridged) we perform an analysis of spectra and photometry for 22,770 starsincluded in the third data release (dr3) of the sdss. we measure radialvelocities and, based on a model-atmosphere analysis, derive estimates oftheatmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and [fe/h]) foreach star. stellar evolution models are then used to estimate distances. thesdss sample covers a range in stellar brightness of 14 &lt; v &lt; 22, and compriseslarge numbers of f- and g-type stars from the thick-disk and halo populations(up to 100 kpc from the galactic plane), therefore including some of the oldeststars in the milky way. in agreement with previous results from the literature,we find that halo stars exhibit a broad range of iron abundances, with a peakat [fe/h] ~ -1.4. this population exhibits essentially no galactic rotation.thick-disk g-dwarf stars at distances from the galactic plane in the range1&lt;|z|&lt;3 kpc show a much more compact metallicity distribution, with a maximumat [fe/h] ~ -0.7, and a median galactic rotation velocity at that metallicityof 157 +/- 4 km/s (a lag relative to the thin disk of 63 km/s). a comparison ofcolor indices and metal abundances with isochrones indicates that nosignificant star formation has taken place in the halo in the last ~ 11 gyr,but there are thick-disk stars which are at least 2 gyr younger. we find themetallicities of thick-disk stars to be nearly independent of galactocentricdistance between 5 and 14 kpc, in contrast with the marked gradients found inthe literature for the thin disk. no vertical metallicity gradient is apparentfor the thick disk, but we detect a gradient inits rotational velocity of -16+/- 4 km/s/kpc between 1 and 3 kpc from the plane.

astro-ph;0603553	from first stars to the spite plateau: a possible reconciliation of halo  stars observations with predictions from big bang nucleosynthesis	since the pioneering observations of spite &amp; spite in 1982, the constantlithium abundance of metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-1.3) halo stars near the turnoff hasbeen attributed a cosmological origin. closer analysis revealed that theobserved abundance lies at $\delta$ li~0.4 dex below the predictions of bigbang nucleosynthesis. the measurements of deuterium abundances on the lines ofsight toward quasars and the recent data from the wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe independently confirmed this gap. we suggest here that part ofthe discrepancy is explained by the first generation of stars that efficientlydepleted lithium. assuming that the models for lithium evolution in the haloturnoff stars and $\delta$ li estimates are correct, we infer that between 1/3and 1/2 of the baryonic matter of the early halo (~10^9 mo) was processedthrough population iii stars. this new paradigm proposes a very economicalsolution to the lingering difficulty of understanding the properties of thespite plateau and its lack of star-to-star scatter down to [fe/h]=-2.5. it ismoreover in agreement both with the absence of lithium detection in the mostmetal-poor star presently known (he 1327-2326), and also with new trends of theplateau suggesting its low metallicity edge may be reached around [fe/h]=-2.5.we discuss the turbulent mixing associated with enhanced supernovae explosionsin the early interstellar medium in this picture. finally we show that otherchemical properties of the extremely metal-poor stars are in agreement with asignificant population iii processing in the halo, provided these modelsinclude mass-loss and rotationally-induced mixing.

astro-ph;0603776	early star formation, nucleosynthesis, and chemical evolution in  proto-galactic clouds	we present numerical simulations to describe the nucleosynthesis andevolution of pre-galactic clouds in a model which is motivated by cold darkmatter simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation. we adopt a sn-inducedstar-formation mechanism and follow the chemical enrichment and energy input bytype ii and type ia sne. we utilize metallicity-dependent yields and includefinite stellar lifetimes. we derive the metallicity distribution functions, theage-metallicity relation, and relative elemental abundances for a number ofalpha- and fe-group elements. we find that the dispersion of the metallicitydistribution function of the outer halo is reproduced by contributions fromclouds with different initial conditions. clouds with initial masses greaterthan that of present globular clusters are found to survive the first 0.1 gyr,suggesting that such systems may have contributed to the formation of the firststars, and could have been self-enriched. more massive clouds are only stablewhen one assumes an initial mass function that is not biased towards massivestars. the predicted relative abundances of some alpha- and fe-group elementsshow good agreement with the observed values down to metallicities below [fe/h]= -4 when the iron yields are reduced relative to stellar models. the observedscatter is also reproduced for many elements including the observed bifurcationin [alpha/fe] for stars with low [fe/h]. however, the predicted dispersion maybe too large for some alpha elements unless a limited range of progenitormasses is assumed. the results suggest that the low-mass sneii were absent atthe very low metallicities, and that the upper mass limit for the first starsthat contributed to nucleosynthesis may be &lt; 40 solar masses.

astro-ph;0608332	bright metal-poor stars from the hamburg/eso survey. i. selection and  follow-up observations from 329 fields	we present a sample of 1777 bright (9&lt;b&lt;14) metal-poor candidates selectedfrom the hamburg/eso survey (hes). despite saturation effects present in thered portion of the hes objective-prism spectra, the data were recoverable andquantitative selection criteria could be applied to select the sample. analysesof medium-resolution (~2 a) follow-up spectroscopy of the entire sample,obtained with several 2 to 4 m class telescopes, yielded 145 new metal-poorstars with metallicity [fe/h]&lt;-2.0, of which 79 have [fe/h]&lt;-2.5, and 17 have[fe/h]&lt;-3.0. we also obtained c/fe estimates for all these stars. from this, wefind a frequency of c-enhanced ([c/fe]&gt;1.0) metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-2.0) giants of9% +- 2%, which is lower than previously reported. however, the frequencyraises to similar (&gt;20%) and higher values with increasing distance from thegalactic plane. although the numbers of stars at low metallicity are fallingrapidly at the lowest metallicities, there is evidence that the fraction ofcarbon-enhanced metal-poor stars is increasing rapidly as a function ofdeclining metallicity. for ~60 objects, high-resolution data have already beenobtained; one of these, he 1327-2326, is the new record holder for the mostiron-deficient star known.

astro-ph;0608448	cats and dogs, hair and a hero: a quintet of new milky way companions	we present five new satellites of the milky way discovered in sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) imaging data, four of which were followed-up with either thesubaru or the isaac newton telescopes. they include four probable new dwarfgalaxies -- one each in the constellations of coma berenices, canes venatici,leo and hercules -- together with one unusually extended globular cluster,segue 1. we provide distances, absolute magnitudes, half-light radii andcolor-magnitude diagrams for all five satellites. the morphological features ofthe color-magnitude diagrams are generally well described by the ridge line ofthe old, metal-poor globular cluster m92. in the last two years, a total of tennew milky way satellites with effective surface brightness mu_v &gt;~ 28 mag/sq.arcsec have been discovered in sdss data. they are less luminous, moreirregular and appear to be more metal-poor than the previously-known nine milkyway dwarf spheroidals. the relationship between these objects and otherpopulations is discussed. we note that there is a paucity of objects withhalf-light radii between ~40 pc and ~ 100 pc. we conjecture that this mayrepresent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0701154	discovery of an unusual dwarf galaxy in the outskirts of the milky way	in this letter, we announce the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, leo t, inthe local group. it was found as a stellar overdensity in the sloan digital skysurvey data release 5 (sdss dr5). the color-magnitude diagram of leo t showstwo well-defined features, which we interpret as a red giant branch and asequence of young, massive stars. as judged from fits to the color-magnitudediagram, it lies at a distance of about 420 kpc and has an intermediate-agestellar population with a metallicity of [fe/h]= -1.6, together with a youngpopulation of blue stars of age of 200 myr. there is a compact cloud of neutralhydrogen with mass roughly 10^5 solar masses and radial velocity 35 km/scoincident with the object visible in the hipass channel maps. leo t is thesmallest, lowest luminosity galaxy found to date with recent star-formation. itappears to be a transition object similar to, but much lower luminosity than,the phoenix dwarf.

astro-ph;0703309	estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters from sdss/segue spectra	we present techniques for the estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters(teff,logg,[fe/h]) for stars from the sdss/segue survey. the atmosphericparameters are derived from the observed medium-resolution (r=2000) stellarspectra using non-linear regression models trained either on (1) pre-classifiedobserved data or (2) synthetic stellar spectra. in the first case we use ourmodels to automate and generalize parametrization produced by a preliminaryversion of the sdss/segue spectroscopic parameter pipeline (sspp). in thesecond case we directly model the mapping between synthetic spectra (derivedfrom kurucz model atmospheres) and the atmospheric parameters, independently ofany intermediate estimates. after training, we apply our models to varioussamples of sdss spectra to derive atmospheric parameters, and compare ourresults with those obtained previously by the sspp for the same samples. weobtain consistency between the two approaches, with rms deviations of 150k inteff, 0.35dex in logg, and 0.22dex in [fe/h]. the models are applied topre-processed spectra, either via principal components analysis or a wavelengthrange selection method, which employs a subset of the full 3850-9000a spectralrange. this is both for computational reasons, and because it delivers higheraccuracy. from an analysis of cluster candidates with available sdssspectroscopy (m15, m13, m2, and ngc2420), we find evidence for small systematicoffsets in teff and/or logg for the atmospheric parameter estimates from themodel trained on real data with the sspp. thus, this model turns out to derivemore precise, but less accurate, atmospheric parameters than the model trainedon synthetic data.

astro-ph;9412004	subcluster merger and galaxy infall in a2151	we have obtained a 12.5 ksec image of the hercules cluster, a2151, with the{\it rosat} pspc. comparison of the optical and x-ray data suggest the presenceof at least three distinct subclusters in a2151. the brightest x-ray emissioncoincides with the highest-density peak in the galaxy distribution, and isbimodal. the northern subclump, distinct in position and velocity, has {\it no}detectable x-ray gas. the eastern subclump, apparent in the optical contourmap, is indistinguishable from the main clump in velocity space but is clearlyvisible in the x-ray image. x-ray spectra derived from the central peak ofemission yield a best-fit temperature of 1.6 kev. the emission coincident withthe eastern clump of galaxies is cooler, 0.8 kev, and is outside the 90\%confidence intervals of the central peak temperature. we suggest that theeastern and central subclusters have recently undergone a merger event. thelack of x-ray emission to the north suggests that those galaxies do not form aphysically-distinct structure (i.e. they are not located within a distinctgravitational potential), but rather that they are falling into the clustercore along the filament defined by the hercules supercluster.

astro-ph;9610178	a dynamical and kinematical model of the galactic stellar halo and  possible implications for galaxy formation scenarios	we re-analyse the kinematics of the system of blue horizontal branch field(bhbf) stars in the galactic halo (in particular the outer halo), fitting thekinematics with the model of radial and tangential velocity dispersions in thehalo as a function of galactocentric distance r proposed by sommer-larsen,flynn &amp; christensen (1994), using a much larger sample (almost 700) of bhbfstars. the basic result is that the character of the stellar halo velocityellipsoid changes markedly from radial anisotropy at the sun to tangentialanisotropy in the outer parts of the galactic halo (r greater than approx 20kpc). specifically, the radial component of the stellar halo's velocityellipsoid decreases fairly rapidly beyond the solar circle, from approx 140 +/-10 km/s at the sun, to an asymptotic value of 89 +/- 19 km/s at large r. therapid decrease in the radial velocity dispersion is matched by an increase inthe tangential velocity dispersion, with increasing r.  our results may indicate that the galaxy formed hierarchically (partly orfully) through merging of smaller subsystems - the 'bottom-up' galaxy formationscenario, which for quite a while has been favoured by most theorists andrecently also has been given some observational credibility by hst observationsof a potential group of small galaxies, at high redshift, possibly in theprocess of merging to a larger galaxy (pascarelle et al 1996).

astro-ph;9712227	cs 22957-027: a carbon-rich extremely-metal-poor star	we present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of theextremely-metal-poor star cs 22957-027, which beers et al (1992) noted toexhibit a rather strong g-band. for teff = 4839 k, derived from broadbandphotometry, our analysis obtains log g = 2.25, and a very low metallicity of[fe/h]=-3.43 +/- 0.12. the carbon-to-iron ratio is found to be enhanced byabout 2 dex relative to the solar value, similar to the handful of othercarbon-rich metal-deficient stars discussed by norris et al (1997a) and barbuyet al (1997). from the 12c13c (1,0) swan bandhead and 13ch lines the isotoperatio 12c/13c is about 10, indicating a 13c enrichment. nitrogen is also foundto be enhanced by about 1 dex. the s-process elements sr and ba are,surprisingly, found to be under-abundant relative to solar, with [sr/fe]=-0.91and [ba/fe]=-0.93. the star's low luminosity requires that the chemicalenrichment arises from mass transfer from an evolved companion, rather thanself-polluting dredge-up processes. however, the s-process elements sr and baare unusually low, with a solar ratio to one another, at variance with whatfound in the ``classical'' ch stars. finally we note that a feature due to 13chis present in coincidence with the th ii 401.9129 nm resonance line. the blendis of relevance for the nucleo-chronology use of the th ii line in theseextremely metal poor stars, when significant 13c is present.

astro-ph;9903476	abell 521: dynamical analysis of a young cluster	we present the results of a dynamical analysis of the rich x-ray luminousgalaxy cluster abell 521, and discuss the nature of the arc-like structurefirst noted by maurogordato et al. (1996). our study is based on radialvelocities for 41 cluster members, measured from spectra obtained at theeuropean southern observatory and the canada-france-hawaii telescope. we findthat abell 521 is an intermediate-redshift cluster (cbi= 74132 (-250,+202)km/s)with a rather high apparent value of the velocity dispersion (sbi= 1386(-139,+206) km/s). this high value, which cannot be explained by trivialprojection effects, and the significant clumping in the two-dimensionalprojected positions of the galaxies in the cluster indicate it is stillundergoing strong dynamical evolution. the two brightest knots of the giant arccandidate are shown to be at the velocity of the cluster. this makes thegravitational lensing interpretation for the bright curved structure veryimprobable, although gravitational lensing might still be present in thiscluster, as suggested by the colors of two fainter arclet-like structures.

astro-ph;9905211	primordial lithium and big bang nucleosynthesis	in the standard hot big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) model the primordialabundances of h, h2, he3, he4, and li7, fix the baryon density of the universe,$\omega_b$, via the baryon-to-photon ratio, $\eta$, for a given hubbleparameter. recent observations of li show that its intrinsic dispersion inmetal-poor stars is essentially zero, and the random error in the mean liabundance is negligible. however, a decreasing trend in the li abundancetowards lower metallicity, plus li6 detections, indicate that its primordialabundance can be inferred only after allowing for nucleosynthesis processes inthe galaxy (galactic chemical evolution (gce)). we show that the li vs fe trendprovides a tough discriminant between alternative models for gce oflight-elements. we critically assess current systematic uncertainties, anddetermine the primordial li abundance within new, much tighter limits. we showthat the li constraint on $\omega_b$ is now limited principally byuncertainties in the nuclear cross-sections used in bbn {\it calculations}, notby the abundance itself. a clearer understanding of systematics allows for amuch more accurate inference of the primordial li abundance, sharpening thecomparison with he4 and deuterium and the resulting test of bbn. we find thatthe li data are in good agreement with he4 and with ``high'' deuterium values,but that low deuterium abundances are at best marginally within the li range.
