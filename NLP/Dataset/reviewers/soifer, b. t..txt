0903.1272	a complete view of galaxy evolution: panchromatic luminosity functions  and the generation of metals	when and how did galaxies form and their metals accumulate? over the lastdecade, this has moved from an archeological question to a live investigation:there is now a broad picture of the evolution of galaxies in dark matter halos:their masses, stars, metals and supermassive blackholes. galaxies have beenfound and studied in which these formation processes are taking place mostvigorously, all the way back in cosmic time to when the intergalactic medium(igm) was still largely neutral. however, the details of how and why theinterstellar medium (ism) in distant galaxies cools, is processed, recycled andenriched in metals by stars, and fuels active galactic nuclei (agns) remainuncertain. in particular, the cooling of gas to fuel star formation, and thechemistry and physics of the most intensely active regions is hidden from viewat optical wavelengths, but can be seen and diagnosed at mid- &amp; far-infrared(ir) wavelengths. rest-frame ir observations are important first to identifythe most luminous, interesting and important galaxies, secondly to quantifyaccurately their total luminosity, and finally to use spectroscopy to trace theconditions in the molecular and atomic gas out of which stars form. in order tomap out these processes over the full range of environments and large-scalestructures found in the universe - from the densest clusters of galaxies to theemptiest voids - we require tools for deep, large area surveys, of millions ofgalaxies out to z~5, and for detailed follow-up spectroscopy. the necessarytools can be realized technically. here, we outline the requirements forgathering the crucial information to build, validate and challenge models ofgalaxy evolution.

0904.1231	high redshift dust obscured galaxies, a morphology-sed connection  revealed by keck adaptive optics	a simple optical to mid-ir color selection, r-[24] &gt; 14, i.e. f_nu(24) /f_nu(r) &gt; 1000, identifies highly dust obscured galaxies (dogs) with typicalredshifts of z~2 +/- 0.5. extreme mid-ir luminosities (l_{ir} &gt; 10^{12-14})suggest that dogs are powered by a combination of agn and star formation,possibly driven by mergers. in an effort to compare their photometricproperties with their rest frame optical morphologies, we obtained high spatialresolution (0.05 -0.1") keck adaptive optics (ao) k'-band images of 15 dogs.the images reveal a wide range of morphologies, including: small exponentialdisks (8 of 15), small ellipticals (4 of 15), and unresolved sources (2 of 15).one particularly diffuse source could not be classified because of low signalto noise ratio. we find a statistically significant correlation between galaxyconcentration and mid-ir luminosity, with the most luminous dogs exhibitinghigher concentration and smaller physical size. dogs with high concentrationalso tend to have spectral energy distributions (seds) suggestive of agnactivity. thus central agn light may be biasing the morphologies of the moreluminous dogs to higher concentration. conversely, more diffuse dogs tend toshow an sed shape suggestive of star formation. two of fifteen in the sampleshow multiple resolved components with separations of ~1 kpc, circumstantialevidence for ongoing mergers.

0905.1487	spitzer 24 um excesses for bright galactic stars in bootes and first  look survey fields	optically bright galactic stars (v &lt; 13 mag) having fv(24 um) &gt; 1 mjy areidentified in spitzer mid-infrared surveys within 8.2 square degrees for thebootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey and within 5.5 square degreesfor the first look survey (fls). 128 stars are identified in bootes and 140 inthe fls, and their photometry is given. (k-[24]) colors are determined using kmagnitudes from the 2mass survey for all stars in order to search for excess 24um luminosity compared to that arising from the stellar photosphere. of thecombined sample of 268 stars, 141 are of spectral types f, g, or k, and 17 ofthese 141 stars have 24 um excesses with (k-[24]) &gt; 0.2 mag. using limits onabsolute magnitude derived from proper motions, at least 8 of the fgk starswith excesses are main sequence stars, and estimates derived from thedistribution of apparent magnitudes indicate that all 17 are main sequencestars. these estimates lead to the conclusion that between 9% and 17% of themain sequence fgk field stars in these samples have 24 um infrared excesses.this result is statistically similar to the fraction of stars with debris disksfound among previous spitzer targeted observations of much brighter, mainsequence field stars.

0905.4274	strong pah emission from z~2 ulirgs	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, wepresent low-resolution (64 &lt; lambda / dlambda &lt; 124), mid-infrared (20-38micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ulirgs detected in the bootes field of thenoao deep wide-field survey. all of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24micron) &gt; 0.5 mjy; 2) r-[24] &gt; 14 vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into spitzer's 3-8 micron iracbands. of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs),usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. the pah features indicateredshifts in the range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, with a mean of &lt;z&gt;=1.96 and a dispersionof 0.30. based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infraredluminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. our results confirmprevious indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can beefficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, andthat the fraction of starburst-dominated ulirgs increases to faint 24 micronflux densities. using local templates, we find that the observed narrowredshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability ofpah-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. we can analogously explain thebroader redshift distribution of spitzer-detected agn-dominated ulirgs based onthe shapes of their seds. finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with adetectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient agn emission toveil the 7.7 micron pah band.

0909.2650	infrared luminosities and dust properties of z ~ 2 dust-obscured  galaxies	we present sharc-ii 350um imaging of twelve 24um-bright (f_24um &gt; 0.8 mjy)dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) and carma 1mm imaging of a subset of 2 dogs, allselected from the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. detectionsof 4 dogs at 350um imply ir luminosities which are consistent within a factorof 2 of expectations based on a warm dust spectral energy distribution (sed)scaled to the observed 24um flux density. the 350um upper limits for the 8non-detected dogs are consistent with both mrk231 and m82 (warm dust seds), butexclude cold dust (arp220) seds. the two dogs targeted at 1mm were not detectedin our carma observations, placing strong constraints on the dust temperature:t_dust &gt; 35-60 k. assuming these dust properties apply to the entire sample, wefind dust masses of ~3x10^8 m_sun. in comparison to other dusty z ~ 2 galaxypopulations such as sub-millimeter galaxies (smgs) and other spitzer-selectedhigh-redshift sources, this sample of dogs has higher ir luminosities (2x10^13l_sun vs. 6x10^12 l_sun for the other galaxy populations), warmer dusttemperatures (&gt;35-60 k vs. ~30 k), and lower inferred dust masses (3x10^8 m_sunvs. 3x10^9 m_sun). herschel and scuba-2 surveys should be able to detecthundreds of these power-law dominated dogs. we use hst and spitzer/irac data toestimate stellar masses of these sources and find that the stellar to gas massratio may be higher in our 24um-bright sample of dogs than in smgs and otherspitzer-selected sources. although larger sample sizes are needed to provide adefinitive conclusion, the data are consistent with an evolutionary trend inwhich the formation of massive galaxies at z~2 involves a sub-millimeterbright, cold-dust and star-formation dominated phase followed by a 24um-bright,warm-dust and agn-dominated phase.

0707.4190	pah emission from ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we explore the relationships between the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) feature strengths, mid-infrared continuum luminosities, far-infraredspectral slopes, optical spectroscopic classifications, and silicate opticaldepths within a sample of 107 ulirgs observed with the infrared spectrograph onthe spitzer space telescope. the detected 6.2 micron pah equivalent widths(eqws) in the sample span more than two orders of magnitude (0.006-0.8 micron),and ulirgs with hii-like optical spectra or steep far-infrared spectral slopes(s_{25} / s_{60} &lt; 0.2) typically have 6.2 micron pah eqws that are half thatof lower-luminosity starbursts. a significant fraction (~40-60%) of hii-like,liner-like, and cold ulirgs have very weak pah eqws. many of these ulirgs alsohave large (tau_{9.7} &gt; 2.3) silicate optical depths. the far-infrared spectralslope is strongly correlated with pah eqw, but not with silicate optical depth.in addition, the pah eqw decreases with increasing rest-frame 24 micronluminosity. we argue that this trend results primarily from dilution of the paheqw by continuum emission from dust heated by a compact central source,probably an agn. high luminosity, high-redshift sources studied with spitzerappear to have a much larger range in pah eqw than seen in local ulirgs, whichis consistent with extremely luminous starburst systems being absent at lowredshift, but present at early epochs.

1102.2929	the dirt on dry mergers	using data from the spitzer space telescope, we analyze the mid-infrared(3-70 micron) spectral energy distributions of dry merger candidates in thebootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. these candidates were selectedby previous authors to be luminous, red, early-type galaxies with morphologicalevidence of recent tidal interactions. we find that a significant fraction ofthese candidates exhibit 8 and 24 micron excesses compared to expectations forold stellar populations. we estimate that a quarter of dry merger candidateshave mid-infrared-derived star formation rates greater than ~1 msun/yr. thisrepresents a "frosting" on top of a large old stellar population, and has beenseen in previous studies of elliptical galaxies. further, the dry mergercandidates include a higher fraction of starforming galaxies relative to acontrol sample without tidal features. we therefore conclude that the starformation in these massive ellipticals is likely triggered by merger activity.our data suggest that the mergers responsible for the observed tidal featureswere not completely dry, and may be minor mergers involving a gas-rich dwarfgalaxy.

1102.4616	black hole masses and star formation rates of z &gt;1 dust obscured  galaxies (dogs): results from keck osiris integral field spectroscopy	we have obtained high spatial resolution keck osiris integral fieldspectroscopy of four z~1.5 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies that exhibit broadh-alpha emission lines indicative of strong agn activity. the observations weremade with the keck laser guide star adaptive optics system giving a spatialresolution of 0.1", or &lt;1 kpc at these redshifts. these high spatial resolutionobservations help to spatially separate the extended narrow-line regions ---possibly powered by star formation --- from the nuclear regions, which may bepowered by both star formation and agn activity. there is no evidence forextended, rotating gas disks in these four galaxies. assuming dust correctionfactors as high as a(h-alpha)=4.8 mag, the observations suggest lower limits onthe black hole masses of (1 - 9) x 10^8 solar masses, and star formation rates&lt;100 solar masses per year. the black hole masses and star formation rates ofthe sample galaxies appear low in comparison to other high-z galaxies withsimilar host luminosities. we explore possible explanations for theseobservations including, host galaxy fading, black hole growth, and the shutdown of star formation.

1103.3527	hst morphologies of z ~ 2 dust-obscured galaxies ii: bump sources	we present hubble space telescope (hst) imaging of 22 ultra-luminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) at z~2 with extremely red r-[24] colors (called dust-obscuredgalaxies, or dogs) which have a local maximum in their spectral energydistribution (sed) at rest-frame 1.6um associated with stellar emission. thesesources, which we call "bump dogs", have star-formation rates of 400-4000msun/yr and have redshifts derived from mid-ir spectra which show strongpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission --- a sign of vigorous on-goingstar-formation. using a uniform morphological analysis, we look forquantifiable differences between bump dogs, power-law dogs (spitzer-selectedulirgs with mid-ir seds dominated by a power-law and spectral features that aremore typical of obscured active galactic nuclei than starbursts),sub-millimeter selected galaxies (smgs), and other less-reddened ulirgs fromthe spitzer extragalactic first look survey (xfls). bump dogs are larger thanpower-law dogs (median petrosian radius of 8.4 +/- 2.7 kpc vs. 5.5 +/- 2.3 kpc)and exhibit more diffuse and irregular morphologies (median m_20 of -1.08 +/-0.05 vs. -1.48 +/- 0.05). these trends are qualitatively consistent withexpectations from simulations of major mergers in which merging systems duringthe peak star-formation rate period evolve from m_20 = -1.0 to m_20 = -1.7.less obscured ulirgs (i.e., non-dogs) tend to have more regular, centrallypeaked, single-object morphologies rather than diffuse and irregularmorphologies. this distinction in morphologies may imply that less obscuredulirgs sample the merger near the end of the peak star-formation rate period.alternatively, it may indicate that the intense star-formation in theseless-obscured ulirgs is not the result of a recent major merger.

0709.3119	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of 70um-selected distant luminous  infrared galaxies	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy obtained with the spitzer spacetelescope of a sample of 11 optically faint, infrared luminous galaxiesselected from a spitzer mips 70um imaging survey of the ndwfs bootes field.these are the first spitzer irs spectra presented of distant 70um-selectedsources. all the galaxies lie at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3 and have very largeinfrared luminosities of l_ir~ 0.1-17 x 10^12 solar luminosities. seven of thegalaxies exhibit strong emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs). the average irs spectrum of these sources ischaracteristic of classical starburst galaxies, but with much larger infraredluminosities. the pah luminosities of l(7.7) ~ 0.4 - 7 x 10^11 solarluminosities imply star formation rates of ~ 40 - 720 solar masses per year.four of the galaxies show deep 9.7um silicate absorption features and nosignificant pah emission features (6.2um equivalent widths &lt; 0.03um). the largeinfrared luminosities and low f70/f24 flux density ratios suggests that thesesources have agn as the dominant origin of their large mid-infraredluminosities, although deeply embedded but luminous starbursts cannot be ruledout. if the absorbed sources are agn-dominated, a significant fraction of allfar-infrared bright, optically faint sources may be dominated by agn.

0710.1650	lens galaxy properties of sbs1520+530: insights from keck spectroscopy  and ao imaging	we report on an investigation of the sbs 1520+530 gravitational lens systemand its environment using archival hst imaging, keck spectroscopic data, andkeck adaptive-optics imaging. the ao imaging has allowed us to fix the lensgalaxy properties with a high degree of precision when performing the lensmodeling, and the data indicate that the lens has an elliptical morphology andperhaps a disk. the new spectroscopic data suggest that previous determinationsof the lens redshift may be incorrect, and we report an updated, thoughinconclusive, value z_lens = 0.761. we have also spectroscopically confirmedthe existence of several galaxy groups at approximately the redshift of thelens system. we create new models of the lens system that explicitly accountfor the environment of the lens, and we also include improved constraints onthe lensing galaxy from our adaptive-optics imaging. lens models created withthese new data can be well-fit with a steeper than isothermal mass slope (alpha= 2.29, with the density proportional to r^-alpha) if h_0 is fixed at 72km/s/mpc; isothermal models require h_0 ~ 50 km/s/mpc. the steepened profilemay indicate that the lens is in a transient perturbed state caused byinteractions with a nearby galaxy.

1111.0630	resolving the galaxies within a giant lya nebula: witnessing the  formation of a galaxy group?	detailed analysis of the substructure of lya nebulae can put importantconstraints on the physical mechanisms at work and the properties of galaxiesforming within them. using high resolution hst imaging of a lya nebula atz~2.656, we have taken a census of the compact galaxies in the vicinity, usedoptical/near-infrared colors to select system members, and put constraints onthe morphology of the spatially-extended emission. the system is characterizedby (a) a population of compact, low luminosity (~0.1 l*) sources --- 17primarily young, small (re~1-2 kpc), disky galaxies including an obscured agn--- that are all substantially offset (&gt;20 kpc) from the line-emitting nebula;(b) the lack of a central galaxy at or near the peak of the lya emission; and(c) several nearly coincident, spatially extended emission components --- lya,heii, and uv continuum --- that are extremely smooth. these morphologicalfindings are difficult to reconcile with theoretical models that invokeoutflows, cold flows, or resonant scattering, suggesting that while all ofthese physical phenomena may be occurring, they are not sufficient to explainthe powering and large extent of lya nebulae. in addition, although the compactgalaxies within the system are irrelevant as power sources, the region issignificantly overdense relative to the field galaxy population (by at least afactor of 4). these observations provide the first estimate of the luminosityfunction of galaxies within an individual lya nebula system, and suggest thatlarge lya nebulae may be the seeds of galaxy groups or low-mass clusters.

1111.2869	the star-formation histories of z~2 dogs and smgs	the spitzer space telescope has identified a population of ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z ~ 2 that may play an important role in theevolution of massive galaxies. we measure the stellar masses of two populationsof spitzer-selected ulirgs, both of which have extremely red r-[24] colors(dust-obscured galaxies, or dogs) and compare our results with sub-millimeterselected galaxies (smgs). one set of 39 dogs has a local maximum in theirmid-ir spectral energy distribution (sed) at rest-frame 1.6um associated withstellar emission ("bump dogs"), while the other set of 51 dogs has a power-lawdominated mid-ir sed with spectral features typical of obscured agn ("power-lawdogs"). we use stellar population synthesis models applied self-consistently tobroad-band photometry in the rest-frame ultra-violet, optical, andnear-infrared of each of these populations and test a variety of stellarpopulation synthesis codes, star-formation histories (sfhs), and initial massfunctions (imfs). assuming a simple stellar population sfh and a chabrier imf,we find that the median and inner quartile stellar masses of smgs, bump dogsand power-law dogs are given by log(m_*/m_sun) = 10.42_-0.36^+0.42,10.62_-0.32^+0.36, and 10.71_-0.34^+0.40, respectively. implementing morecomplicated sfhs with multiple age components increases these mass estimates byup to 0.5 dex. our stellar mass estimates are consistent with physicalmechanisms for the origin of z~2 ulirgs that result in high star-formationrates for a given stellar mass. such mechanisms are usually driven by a majormerger of two gas-rich systems, rather than smooth accretion of gas and smallsatellites.

0801.4578	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of distant x-ray luminous agn	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 16 optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope. these sources were jointly selected from spitzer andchandra imaging surveys in the ndwfs bootes field and were selected from theirbright x-ray fluxes to host luminous agn. none of the spectra show significantemission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; 6.2um equivalent widths&lt;0.2um), consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by agn. nineof the x-ray sources show 9.7um silicate absorption features. their redshiftsare in the range 0.9&lt;z&lt;2.6, implying infrared luminosities oflog(l{ir})=12.5-13.6 solar luminosities. the average silicate absorptionstrength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies with similar mid-infrared luminosities implying thatthe x-ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of si-rich dust thannon-x-ray selection. seven of the x-ray sources have featureless power-lawmid-ir spectra. we argue that the featureless spectra likely result from thesources having weak or absent silicate and pah features rather than the sourceslying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the irsspectral window. we investigate whether there are any correlations betweenx-ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorptionfeatures tend to have fainter x-ray fluxes and harder x-ray spectra, indicatinga weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density ofx-ray-absorbing gas.

astro-ph;0009078	high spatial resolution imaging of ngc 1068 in the mid infrared	mid-infrared observations of the central source of ngc 1068 have beenobtained with a spatial resolution in the deconvolved image of 0.1" (~ 7pc).the central source is extended by ~1" in the north-south direction but appearsunresolved in the east-west direction over most of its length. about two-thirdsof its flux can be ascribed to a core structure which is itself elongatednorth-south and does not show a distinct unresolved compact source. the sourceis strongly asymmetric, extending significantly further to the north than tothe south. the morphology of the mid-infrared emission appears similar to thatof the radio jet, and has features which correlate with the images in [o iii].its 12.5-24.5 micron color temperature ranges from 215 to 260 k and does notdecrease smoothly with distance from the core. silicate absorption is strongestin the core and to the south and is small in the north.  the core, apparently containing two-thirds of the bolometric luminosity ofthe inner 4" diameter area, may be explained by a thick, dusty torus near thecentral agn viewed at an angle of ~65 deg to its plane. there are, however,detailed difficulties with existing models, especially the narrow east-westwidth of the thin extended mid-infrared "tongue" to the north of the core. weinterpret the tongue as re-processed visual and ultraviolet radiation that isstrongly beamed and that originates in the agn.

astro-ph;0010077	k band spectroscopy of ultraluminous infrared galaxies: the 2 jy sample	we present near-infrared spectroscopy for a complete sample of 33ultraluminous infrared galaxies at a resolution of r\approx 1000. most of thewavelength range from 1.80-2.20 microns in the rest frame is covered, includingthe pa-alpha and br-gamma hydrogen recombination lines, and the molecularhydrogen vibration-rotation 1-0 s(1) and s(3) lines. other species, such as hei, [fe ii], and [si vi] appear in the spectra as well, in addition to a numberof weaker molecular hydrogen lines. nuclear extractions for each of theindividual galaxies are presented here, along with spectra of secondary nuclei,where available. the pa-alpha emission is seen to be highly concentrated on thenuclei, typically with very little emision extending beyond a radius of 1 kpc.signatures of active nuclei are rare in the present sample, occurring in onlytwo of the 33 galaxies. it is found that visual extinctions to the nuclei viathe pa-alpha/br-gamma line ratio in excess of 10 magnitudes are relativelycommon among ulirgs, and that visual extinctions greater than 25 mag arenecessary to conceal a qso emitting half the total bolometric luminosity. thevibration-rotation lines of molecular hydrogen appear to be predominantlythermal in origin, with effective temperatures generally around 2200 k. therelative nuclear velocities between double nucleus ulirgs are investigated,through which it is inferred that the maximum deprojected velocity differenceis about 200 km/s. this figure is lower than the velocities predicted byphysical models of strong interactions/mergers of large, gas-rich galaxies.

astro-ph;0103425	age-dating ultraluminous infrared galaxies along the merger sequence	imaging spectroscopy using the new palomar integral field spectrograph ispresented for the pa-alpha line in four ultraluminous infrared galaxies. inmost cases, we are able to establish the geometry of the merger, and thusestimate the time in the merger process at which we are viewing the system. theresulting range in estimated ages, some of which are very young encounters(~5x10^7 yr), is not predicted by merger models, which produce high rates ofstar formation either 1-2x10^8 years after the first encounter or very late(~10^9 yr) in the merger process. even in the very young mergers, theultraluminous activity appears to be centrally concentrated on the nucleus ofone of the progenitor galaxies---namely the galaxy with a prograde orbitalgeometry. very high star formation rates (2-5 m_sun/yr) are also observed instructures believed to be newly formed tidal tails.  the presence of a significant population of very young ultraluminous mergers,together with the majority of ultraluminous infrared galaxies existing in thefinal stages of merger activity, indicates that the ultraluminous galaxy phaseis at least bimodal in time. an evolutionary scenario is proposed forultraluminous infrared galaxies, wherein the far-infrared luminosity mayundergo multiple ultraluminous bursts during the course of the encounter. asubstantial fraction of the merger lifetime may be spent in a phase identifiedwith the less powerful luminous infrared galaxy class.

astro-ph;0302299	the first measurement of spectral lines in a short-period star bound to  the galaxy's central black hole: a paradox of youth	we have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one ofthe high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the galaxy's central supermassiveblack hole. both brgamma (2.1661 micron) and he i (2.1126 micron) are seen inabsorption in s0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 ang &amp; 1.7+-0.4 ang) and aninferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent withthat of an o8-b0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 msun), young(&lt;10 myr) main sequence star. this presents a major challenge to star formationtheories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reachedby s0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 au) and the difficulty in migratingthis star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces shouldno longer preclude star formation. the radial velocity measurements (-510+-40km/s) and our reported proper motions for s0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(ro/8kpc)^3msun. the keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by afactor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the firsttime, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, whileconsistent with the nominal infrared position of sgr a*, is localized to afactor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). furthermore, the ambiguity inthe inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radialvelocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at thetime of closest approach and counter-revolving against the galaxy. with furtherradial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of s0-2 willprovide the most robust estimate of the distance to the galactic center.

astro-ph;0405604	obscured and unobscured active galactic nuclei in the spitzer space  telescope first look survey	selection of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the infrared allows thediscovery of agn whose optical emission is extinguished by dust. in this paper,we use the spitzer space telescope first look survey (fls) to assess whatfraction of agn with mid-infrared luminosities comparable to quasars are missedin optical quasar surveys due to dust obscuration. we begin by using the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg^2extragalactic fls. these quasars occupy a distinct region in mid-infrared colorspace by virtue of their strong, red, continua. this has allowed us to define amid-infrared color criterion for selecting agn candidates. about 2000 flsobjects have colors consistent with them being agn, but most are much fainterin the mid-infrared than the sdss quasars, which typically have 8 micron fluxdensities, s(8.0), ~1 mjy. we have investigated the properties of the 43objects with s(8.0) &gt;= 1 mjy satisfying our agn color selection. this sampleshould contain both unobscured quasars, and agn which are absent from the sdsssurvey due to extinction in the optical. after removing 16 known quasars, threeprobable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from theinitial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects which are likely to beobscured quasars or luminous seyfert-2 galaxies. this suggests the numbers ofobscured and unobscured agn are similar in samples selected in the mid-infraredat s(8.0)~1 mjy.

(2) 2% of the sample(85/sq.degrees) have colors similar to dust reddened agns, like mrk231 atz~0.6-3. (3) we anticipate that some of these sources with extremely red colorsmay be new types of sources, since they can not be modelled with any familiartype of spectral energy distribution. we find that 17% of the 24um sources haveno detectable optical counterparts brighter than r limit of 25.5mag. opticalspectroscopy of these optical extremely faint 24um sources would be verydifficult, and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the spitzer would be critical forunderstanding their physical nature (abridged).

astro-ph;0502144	spitzer observations of optically "invisible" radio and x-ray sources:  high redshift agn	we have combined a survey at 24 microns to 0.3 mjy with the multiband imagingphotometer (mips) on the spitzer space telescope, a 20 cm a-array vla surveycovering 0.5 deg^2, and an existing 172 ks chandra x-ray observatory exposureto investigate the nature of optically faint radio and x-ray sources in thenoao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs) in bootes. we find little overlap betweenthe radio and infrared selected populations: only 9% of the infrared sourcesare detected in the radio and only 33% of the radio sources are detected in theinfrared. thirty-six (10%) of the 377 compact radio sources lack opticalcounterparts in the ndwfs bw, r, &amp; i images. we refer to these objects asoptically invisible radio sources (oirs). only four of the thirty-one oirssobserved with mips are detected at 24 microns. comparisons of the radio andinfrared properties of the oirss with various galaxy spectral energydistributions demonstrate that most of these sources are powered by agn ratherthan starbursts. similarly, eleven x-ray sources observed by both mips and thevla are classified as optically invisible x-ray sources (oixs). none aredetected at 24 microns or 20 cm. all seven oixss detected in chandra's 0.5-2kev band have infrared to x-ray flux ratios consistent with their luminositybeing dominated by an unobscured agn. from these results we conclude that boththe optically invisible radio and x-ray source populations are primarily agn,relatively unaffected by dust and most likely at z &gt; 1. no oirss are detectedin x-ray emission and no oixss are detected at 20 cm. however, given the widerange in radio and x-ray properties of known agn and the size of our samples,this lack of overlap does not necessarily imply agn source populations.

astro-ph;0509859	the detection of crystalline silicates in ultra-luminous infrared  galaxies	silicates are an important component of interstellar dust and the structureof these grains -- amorphous versus crystalline -- is sensitive to the localphysical conditions. we have studied the infrared spectra of a sample ofultra-luminous infrared galaxies. here, we report the discovery of weak, narrowabsorption features at 11, 16, 19, 23, and 28 microns, characteristic ofcrystalline silicates, superimposed on the broad absorption bands at 10 and 18microns due to amorphous silicates in a subset of this sample. these featuresbetray the presence of forsterite (mg_2sio_4), the magnesium-rich end member ofthe olivines. previously, crystalline silicates have only been observed incircumstellar environments. the derived fraction of forsterite to amorphoussilicates is typically 0.1 in these ulirgs. this is much larger than the upperlimit for this ratio in the interstellar medium of the milky way, 0.01. theseresults suggest that the timescale for injection of crystalline silicates intothe ism is short in a merger-driven starburst environment (e.g., as compared tothe total time to dissipate the gas), pointing towards massive stars as aprominent source of crystalline silicates. furthermore, amorphization due tocosmic rays, which is thought to be of prime importance for the local ism, lagsin vigorous starburst environments.

astro-ph;0511282	sub-arcsecond mid-infrared observations of ngc 6240: limitations of  agn-starburst power diagnostics	in order to examine the relative importance of powerful starbursts andcompton-thick agns in ngc 6240, we have obtained mid-infrared images andlow-resolution spectra of the galaxy with sub-arcsecond spatial resolutionusing the keck telescopes. despite the high spatial resolution (~200 pc) of ourdata, no signature of the hidden agns has been detected in the mid-infrared.the southern nucleus, which we show provides 80-90% of the total 8-25 umluminosity of the system, has a mid-infrared spectrum and a mid-/far-infraredspectral energy distribution consistent with starbursts. at the same time,however, it is also possible to attribute up to 60% of the bolometricluminosity to an agn, consistent with x-ray observations, if the agn is heavilyobscured and emits mostly in the far-infrared. this ambiguity arises becausethe intrinsic variation of properties among a given galaxy population (e.g.,starbursts) introduces at least a factor of a few uncertainty even into themost robust agn-starburst diagnostics. we conclude that with presentobservations it is not possible to determine the dominant power source ingalaxies when agn and starburst luminosities are within a factor of a few ofeach other.

astro-ph;0610218	observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies with the infrared  spectrograph on the spitzer space telescope ii: the iras bright galaxy sample	we present spectra taken with the infrared spectrograph on spitzer coveringthe 5-38 micron region of the ten ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)found in the iras bright galaxy sample. among the bgs ulirgs, we find a factorof 50 spread in the rest-frame mid to far-infrared spectral slope. the 9.7micron silicate optical depths range from less than 0.4 more than 4.2, implyingline of sight extinctions of a(v) ~ 8 - 78 mag. there is evidence for water iceand hydrocarbon absorption and c2h2 and hcn absorption features in four andpossibly six of the 10 bgs ulirgs, indicating shielded molecular clouds and awarm, dense ism. we have detected [nev] emission in three of the ten bgsulirgs, at flux levels of 5-18e-14 erg/cm^2/sec and [nev] 14.3/[neii] 12.8 lineflux ratios of 0.12-0.85. the remaining bgs ulirgs have limits on their[nev]/[neii] line flux ratios which range from less than 0.15 to less than0.01. among the bgs ulirgs, the agn fractions implied by either the[nev]/[neii] or [oiv]/[neii] line flux ratios (or their upper limits) aresignificantly lower than implied by the mir slope or eqw of the 6.2 micron pahfeature. fitting the seds, we see evidence for hot (t &gt; 300k) dust in five ofthe bgs ulirgs, with the fraction of hot dust to total dust luminosity rangingfrom ~1-23%, before correcting for extinction. when integrated over the irac-8,irs blue peakup, and mips-24 filter bandpasses, the irs spectra imply very bluecolors for some ulirgs at z ~ 1.3. this is most extreme for sources withsignificant amounts of warm dust and deep silicate absorption.

astro-ph;0611215	high resolution imaging of the anomalous flux-ratio gravitational lens  system class b2045+265: dark or luminous satellites?	the existence of flux-ratio anomalies between fold and cusp images ingalaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on thepresence of a high mass-fraction of cold-dark-matter (cdm) substructures aroundgalaxies, as predicted by numerical n-body simulations. the flux-ratio anomalyis particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens systemclass b2045+265. in this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical, andinfrared imaging of b2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on thisanomaly and its possible causes. first, deep very long baseline arrayobservations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but withno evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. second, opticaland infrared observations with the hubble space telescope and throughadaptive-optics imaging with the w. m. keck telescope, show a previouslyundiscovered object -- interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellitebased on its colours and slight extension -- between the main lens galaxy andthe three anomalous flux-ratio images. third, colour variations in theearly-type lens galaxy indicate recent star-formation, possibly the result ofsecondary infall of gas-rich satellites. a population of such galaxies aroundthe lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [o ii] emission.however, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxycannot be excluded. in light of these new data, we propose a lens model for thesystem, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positionaland flux-ratio constraints, without the need for additional cdm substructure.[abridged]

astro-ph;0703003	optical line diagnostics of z~2 optically faint ulirgs in the spitzer  bootes survey	we present near-infrared spectroscopic observations for a sample of tenoptically faint luminous infrared galaxies (r-[24]&gt; 14) using keck nirspec andgemini niri. the sample is selected from a 24 micron spitzer mips imagingsurvey of the ndwfs bootes field. we measure accurate redshifts in the range1.3&lt;z&lt;3.4. based on either emission line widths or line diagnostics, we findthat all ten galaxies harbor luminous agn. seven sources are type i agn,exhibiting broad (&gt;1900 km/s) halpha or hbeta emission lines; the remainingthree are type ii agn. given their large mid-ir luminosities and faint opticalmagnitudes, we might expect these sources to be heavily extincted quasars, andtherefore only visible as type ii agn. the visibility of broad lines in 70% ofthe sources suggests that it is unlikely that these agn are being viewedthrough the mid-plane of a dusty torus. for four of the sources we constrainthe halpha/hbeta balmer decrement and estimate the extinction to the emissionline region to be large for both type i and type ii agn, with a_halpha &gt; 2.4-5mag. since the narrow-line region is also extincted and the uv continuumemission from the host galaxies is extremely faint, this suggests that much ofthe obscuration is contributed by dust on large (~kpc) scales within the hostgalaxies. these sources may be examples of "host-obscured" agn which could havespace densities comparable or greater to that of optically luminous type i agnwith similar bolometric luminosities.

astro-ph;9510093	hst observations of the luminous iras source fsc10214+4724: a  gravitationally lensed infrared quasar	we present an image of the redshift 2.3 iras source fsc10214+4724 at 0.8microns obtained with the hst wfpc2 planetary camera. the source appears as anunresolved (&lt; 0.06") arc 0.7" long, with significant substructure along itslength. the arc is centered near an elliptical galaxy 1.18" to the north. anunresolved component 100 times fainter than the arc is clearly detected on theopposite side of this galaxy. the most straightforward interpretation is thatfsc 10214+4724 is gravitationally lensed by the foreground elliptical galaxy,with the faint component a counterimage of the iras source. the brightness ofthe arc in the hst image is then magnified by ~100 and the intrinsic sourcediameter is ~0.01" (80 pc) at 0.25 microns rest wavelength. the bolometricluminosity is probably amplified by a smaller factor (~30), yielding anintrinsic luminosity ~2e13 solar luminosities. a detailed lensing model ispresented which reproduces the observed morphology and relative flux of the arcand counterimage, and correctly predicts the position angle of the lensinggalaxy. the model also predicts reasonable values for the velocity dispersion,mass, and mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy. a redshift for the lensinggalaxy of ~0.9 is consistent with the measured surface brightness profile fromthe image, as well as with the galaxy's sed.

astro-ph;9708097	a near infrared spectroscopic survey of liner galaxies	this paper reports the results of a near infrared spectroscopic survey ofliner galaxies undertaken with a new infrared spectrograph at the 5 m haletelescope. the galaxy sample includes 11 liners with spectra covering the[feii] (1.2567 microns), pabeta (1.2818 microns), h2 (1-0 s(1), 2.1218 microns)and brgamma (2.1655 microns) near infrared emission lines, and one additionalgalaxy with only [feii] and pa$\beta$ line coverage. all of the liners withinfrared line detections have strong [feii] and/or h2 emission, with about half(4 out of 9) having extremely high ratios (&gt;2) of [feii] to pabeta. thestrength of the h2 and [feii] lines is well correlated with the optical [oi]line, with many liners having higher ratios of [feii]/pabeta, h2/brgamma and[oi]/h-alpha than other galaxy types. the liners with the highest [feii]/pabetaratios (termed ``strong'' [feii] liners) show evidence for recent starformation. shocks from compact supernova remnants may enhance the [feii]emission in these ``strong'' [feii] liners. the liners with lower [feii]/pabetaratios (termed ``weak'' [feii] liners) are more consistent with seyfert-likeactivity, including higher ionization states, some strong x-ray sources andsome broad h-alpha detections. the [feii] luminosity and the [feii]/pabetaratio in these objects are more easily explained by hard x-ray excitation thanin the ``strong'' [feii] liners. these ``weak'' [feii] liners are consideredprime candidates for being low luminosity seyfert nuclei.
