0903.1333	hot debris dust around hd 106797	photometry of the a0 v main-sequence star hd 106797 with akari andgemini/t-recs is used to detect excess emission over the expected stellarphotospheric emission between 10 and 20 micron, which is best attributed to hotcircumstellar debris dust surrounding the star. the temperature of the debrisdust is derived as td ~ 190 k by assuming that the excess emission isapproximated by a single temperature blackbody. the derived temperaturesuggests that the inner radius of the debris disk is ~ 14 au. the fractionalluminosity of the debris disk is 1000 times brighter than that of our ownzodiacal cloud. the existence of such a large amount of hot dust around hd106797 cannot be accounted for by a simple model of the steady state evolutionof a debris disk due to collisions, and it is likely that transient events playa significant role. our data also show a narrow spectral feature between 11 and12 micron attributable to crystalline silicates, suggesting that dust heatinghas occurred during the formation and evolution of the debris disk of hd106797.

0707.1354	microscopic surface structure of c/sic composite mirrors for space  cryogenic telescopes	we report on the microscopic surface structure of carbon-fiber-reinforcedsilicon carbide (c/sic) composite mirrors that have been improved for the spaceinfrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics (spica) and other cooledtelescopes. the c/sic composite consists of carbon fiber, silicon carbide, andresidual silicon. specific microscopic structures are found on the surface ofthe bare c/sic mirrors after polishing. these structures are considered to becaused by the different hardness of those materials. the roughness obtained forthe bare mirrors is 20 nm rms for flat surfaces and 100 nm rms for curvedsurfaces. it was confirmed that a sisic slurry coating is effective in reducingthe roughness to 2 nm rms. the scattering properties of the mirrors weremeasured at room temperature and also at 95 k. no significant change was foundin the scattering properties through cooling, which suggests that themicroscopic surface structure is stable with changes in temperature down tocryogenic values. the c/sic mirror with the sisic slurry coating is a promisingcandidate for the spica telescope.

0910.0922	akari infrared observations of the supernova remnant g292.0+1.8:  unveiling circumstellar medium and supernova ejecta	we present the results of akari observations of the o-rich supernova remnantg292.0+1.8 using six irc and four fis bands covering 2.7-26.5 um and 50-180 um,respectively. the akari images show two prominent structures; a brightequatorial ring structure and an outer elliptical shell structure. theequatorial ring structure is clumpy and incomplete with its western end opened.the outer shell is almost complete and slightly squeezed along the north-southdirection. the central position of the outer shell is ~ 1' northwest from theembedded pulsar and coincides with the center of the equatorial ring structure.the equatorial ring and the elliptical shell structures were partly visible inoptical and/or x-rays, but they are much more clearly revealed in our akariimages. there is no evident difference in infrared colors of the two prominentstructures, which is consistent with the previous proposition that bothstructures are of circumstellar origin. however, we have detected faintinfrared emission of a considerably high 15 to 24 um ratio associated with thesupernova ejecta in the southeastern and northwestern areas. our irc spectrashow that the high ratio is at least partly due to the emission lines from neions in the supernova ejecta material. in addition we detect a narrow,elongated feature outside the snr shell. we derive the physical parameters ofthe infrared-emitting dust grains in the shocked circumstellar medium andcompare the result with model calculations of dust destruction by a sn shock.the akari results suggest that the progenitor was at the center of the infraredcircumstellar shell in red supergiant stage and that the observed asymmetry inthe sn ejecta could be a result of either a dense circumstellar medium in theequatorial plane and/or an asymmetric explosion.

0911.3409	properties of active galactic star-forming regions probed by imaging  spectroscopy with the fourier transform spectrometer (fts) onboard akari	we investigate the structure of the interstellar medium (ism) and identifythe location of possible embedded excitation sources from far-infrared (fir)line and mid-infrared continuum emission maps. we carried out imagingspectroscopic observations of four giant galactic star-forming regions with thefourier transform spectrometer (fts) onboard akari. we obtained [oiii] 88micron and [cii] 158 micron line intensity maps of all the regions:g3.270-0.101, g333.6-0.2, ngc3603, and m17. for g3.270-0.101, we obtainedhigh-spatial-resolution [oiii] 88 micron line-emission maps and a fir continuummap for the first time, which imply that [oiii] 88 micron emission identifiesthe excitation sources more clearly than the radio continuum emission. ing333.6-0.2, we found a local [oiii] 88 micron emission peak, which isindicative of an excitation source. this is supported by the 18 microncontinuum emission, which is considered to trace the hot dust distribution. forall regions, the [cii] 158 micron emission is distributed widely as suggestedby previous observations of star-forming regions. we conclude that [oiii] 88micron emission traces the excitation sources more accurately than the radiocontinuum emission, especially where there is a high density and/or columndensity gradient. the fir spectroscopy provides a promising means ofunderstanding the nature of star-forming regions.

1002.2253	detection of unidentified infrared bands in a halpha filament in the  dwarf galaxy ngc1569 with akari	we performed observations of ngc1569 for 6 infrared bands (3.2, 4.1, 7, 11,15, and 24 micron) with the infrared camera (irc) onboard akari. near- tomid-infrared (2--13 micron) spectroscopy of a halpha filament was also carriedout with the irc.  the extended structure associated with a halpha filament appears bright at 7micron, suggesting that the filament is bright at the uir band emission.follow-up spectroscopic observations with the irc confirm the presence of 6.2,7.7, and 11.3 micron emission in the filament. the filament spectrum exhibitsstrong 11.3 micron uir band emission relative to the 7.7 micron band comparedto the galaxy disk observed with the infrared spectrograph on spitzer. thenear-infrared spectrum also suggests the presence of excess continuum emissionin 2.5--5 micron in the filament.  the halpha filament is thought to have been formed by the galactic outfloworiginating from the star-formation activity in the disk of ngc1569. thedestruction timescale of the uir band carriers in the outflow is estimated tobe much shorter (~ 1.3 x 10^3 yr) than the timescale of the outflow (~ 5.3myr). thus it is unlikely that the band carriers survive the outflowenvironment. alternatively, we suggest that the band carriers in the filamentsmay be produced by the fragmentation of large carbonaceous grains in shocks,which produces the halpha emission. the nir excess continuum emission cannot beaccounted for by free-free emission alone and a hot dust contribution may beneeded, although the free-free emission intensity estimated from hirecombination lines has a large uncertainty.

1004.0049	spectroscopic observations of ices around embedded young stellar objects  in the large magellanic cloud with akari	the aim of this study is to understand the chemical conditions of ices aroundembedded young stellar objects (ysos) in the metal-poor large magellanic cloud(lmc). we performed near-infrared (2.5-5 micron) spectroscopic observationstoward 12 massive embedded ysos and their candidates in the lmc using theinfrared camera (irc) onboard akari. we estimated the column densities of theh2o, co2, and co ices based on their 3.05, 4.27, and 4.67 micron absorptionfeatures, and we investigated the correlation between ice abundances andphysical properties of ysos.the ice absorption features of h2o, co2, 13co2, co,ch3oh, and possibly xcn are detected in the spectra. in addition, hydrogenrecombination lines and pah emission bands are detected toward the majority ofthe targets. the derived typical co2/h2o ice ratio of our samples (~0.36 +-0.09) is greater than that of galactic massive ysos (~0.17 +- 0.03), while theco/h2o ice ratio is comparable. it is shown that the co2 ice abundance does notcorrelate with the observed characteristics of ysos; the strength of hydrogenrecombination line and the total luminosity. likewise, clear no correlation isseen between the co ice abundance and yso characteristics, but it is suggestedthat the co ice abundance of luminous samples is significantly lower than inother samples.the systematic difference in the co2 ice abundance around thelmc's massive ysos, which was suggested by previous studies, is confirmed withthe new near-infrared data. we suggest that the strong ultraviolet radiationfield and/or the high dust temperature in the lmc are responsible for theobserved high abundance of the co2 ice. it is suggested that the internalstellar radiation does not play an important role in the evolution of the co2ice around a massive yso, while more volatile molecules like co are susceptibleto the effect of the stellar radiation.

1004.0560	enstatite-rich warm debris dust around hd165014	we present the spitzer/infrared spectrograph spectrum of the main-sequencestar hd165014, which is a warm (&gt;~ 200 k) debris disk candidate discovered bythe akari all-sky survey. the star possesses extremely large excess emission atwavelengths longer than 5 \mum. the detected flux densities at 10 and 20 \mumare ~ 10 and ~ 30 times larger than the predicted photospheric emission,respectively. the excess emission is attributable to the presence ofcircumstellar warm dust. the dust temperature is estimated as 300-750 k,corresponding to the distance of 0.7-4.4 au from the central star. significantfine-structured features are seen in the spectrum and the peak positions are ingood agreement with those of crystalline enstatite. features of crystallineforsterite are not significantly seen. hd165014 is the first debris disk samplethat has enstatite as a dominant form of crystalline silicate rather thanforsterite. possible formation of enstatite dust from differentiated parentbodies is suggested according to the solar system analog. the detection of anenstatite-rich debris disk in the current study suggests the presence of largebodies and a variety of silicate dust processing in warm debris disks.

1005.5251	akari infrared observations of edge-on spiral galaxy ngc 3079	we present akari near- to far-infrared images of the nearby edge-on spiralgalaxy ngc 3079 in 10 photometric bands. the spectral energy distributionconsists of continuum emission from dust with a single temperature of 28-33 ktogether with strong mid-infrared emission features from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs). we derive the dust masses of 5.6x10^6 m_sun and 1.4x10^7m_sun for the central 4 kpc region and the whole galaxy, respectively, and findthat a gas-to-dust mass ratio is unusually high in the central region (\sim1100) and even for the whole galaxy (\sim 860). the ratio of the surfacebrightness distribution at the wavelength of 7 um to that at 11 um suggeststhat the properties of pahs have spatial variations. emission from ionized andneutral pahs is relatively strong in the center and the disk regions,respectively, suggesting stronger radiation field and thus relatively activestar formation in the center. yet the total infrared luminosities of the galaxyindicate rather low star formation rates. these results suggest that ngc 3079is in an early-phase starburst stage.

1008.1585	akari irc infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of a large sample of  luminous infrared galaxies	we present the results of our systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopyof 60 luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with infrared luminosities l(ir) =10^11-12 lsun, and 54 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with l(ir) &gt;10^12 lsun, using akari irc. akari irc slit-less spectroscopy allows us toprobe the full range of emission from these galaxies, including spatiallyextended components. the 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission features, hydrogen recombination emission lines, and variousabsorption features are detected and used to investigate the properties ofthese galaxies. because of the relatively small effect of dust extinction inthe infrared range, quantitative discussion of these dusty galaxy populationsis possible. for sources with clearly detectable br beta (2.63 micron) and bralpha (4.05 micron) emission lines, the flux ratios are found to be similar tothat predicted by case b theory. starburst luminosities are estimated from both3.3 micron pah and br alpha emission, which roughly agree with each other. inaddition to the detected starburst activity, a significant fraction of theobserved sources display signatures of obscured agns, such as low pahequivalent widths, large optical depths of dust absorption features, and redcontinuum emission. the energetic importance of optically elusive buried agnsin optically non-seyfert galaxies tends to increase with increasing galaxyinfrared luminosity, from lirgs to ulirgs.

0708.3140	optical identification of 15 micron sources in the akari performance  verification field toward the north ecliptic pole	we present the results of optical identifications for 257 mid-infraredsources detected with a deep 15um survey over approximately 80 arcmin^2 area inthe akari performance verification field near the north ecliptic pole. the 15umfluxes of the sources range from 1 mjy down to 40 ujy, approximately a half ofwhich are below 100 ujy. optical counterparts were searched for within a 2-3arcsec radius in both the bvri'z' catalog generated by using the deepsubaru/suprime-cam field which covers one-third of the performance verificationfield, and the g'r'i'z' catalog based on observations made with megacam atcfht. we found b-r and r-z' colours of sources with successful opticalidentifications are systematically redder than that of the entire opticalsample in the same field. moreover, approximately 40% of the 15um sources showcolours r-l15&gt;5, which cannot be explained by the spectral energy distribution(sed) of normal quiescent spiral galaxies, but are consistent with seds ofredshifted (z&gt;1) starburst or ultraluminous infrared galaxies. this resultindicates that the fraction of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in our faint15um sample is much larger than that in our brighter 15um sources, which isconsistent with the evolving mid-infrared luminosity function derived by recentstudies based on the spitzer 24um deep surveys. based on an sed fittingtechnique, the nature of the faint 15um sources is further discussed for aselected number of sources with available k_s-band data.

1105.5699	characterization and improvement of the image quality of the data taken  with the infrared camera (irc) mid-infrared channels onboard akari	mid-infrared images frequently suffer artifacts and extended point spreadfunctions (psfs). we investigate the characteristics of the artifacts and thepsfs in images obtained with the infrared camera (irc) onboard akari at fourmid-infrared bands of the s7 (7{\mu}m), s11 (11{\mu}m), l15 (15{\mu}m), and l24(24 {\mu}m). removal of the artifacts significantly improves the reliability ofthe ref- erence data for flat-fielding at the l15 and l24 bands. a set ofmodels of the irc psfs is also constructed from on-orbit data. these psfs haveextended components that come from diffraction and scattering within thedetector arrays. we estimate the aperture correction factors for point sourcesand the surface brightness correction factors for diffuse sources. we concludethat the surface brightness correction factors range from 0.95 to 0.8, takingaccount of the extended component of the psfs. to correct for the extended psfeffects for the study of faint structures, we also develop an imagereconstruction method, which consists of the deconvolution with the psf and theconvolution with an appropriate gaussian. the appropriate removal of theartifacts, improved flat-fielding, and image reconstruction with the extendedpsfs enable us to investigate de- tailed structures of extended sources in ircmid-infrared images.

1109.3512	observations of the near- to mid-infrared unidentified emission bands in  the interstellar medium of the large magellanic cloud	we present the results of near- to mid-infrared slit spectroscopicobservations (2.55--13.4 um) of the diffuse emission toward nine positions inthe large magellanic cloud with the infrared camera (irc) on board akari. thetarget positions are selected to cover a wide range of the intensity of theincident radiation field. the unidentified infrared bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6and 11.3 um are detected toward all the targets, and ionized gas signatures:hydrogen recombination lines and ionic forbidden lines toward three of them. weclassify the targets into two groups: those without the ionized gas signatures(group a) and those with the ionized signatures (group b). group a includesmolecular clouds and photo-dissociation regions, whereas group b consists ofhii regions. in group a, the band ratios of i(3.3)/i(11.3), i(6.2)/i(11.3),i(7.7)/$i(11.3) and $i(8.6)/$i(11.3) show positive correlation with the irasand akari colors, but those of group b do not follow the correlation. wediscuss the results in terms of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) modeland attribute the difference to the destruction of small pahs and an increasein the recombination due to the high electron density in group b. in thepresent study, the 3.3 um band provides crucial information on the sizedistribution and/or the excitation conditions of pahs and plays a key role inthe distinction of group a from b. the results suggest the possibility of thediagram of i(3.3)/i(11.3) v.s. $i(7.7)/$i(11.3) as an efficient diagnostic toolto infer the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.

1109.5557	detection of 3.3 micron aromatic feature in the supernova remnant n49  with akari	we present an infrared study of the supernova remnant (snr) n49 in the largemagellanic cloud with the near-infrared (nir; 2.5 - 5 {\mu}m) spectroscopicobservations performed by akari. the observations were performed as a coarsespectral mapping to cover most of the bright region in the east, which enablesus to compare the distribution of various line emission and to examine theircorrelation. we detect the 3.3 {\mu}m aromatic feature in the remnant, which isfor the first time to report the presence of the 3.3 {\mu}m aromatic featurerelated to a snr. in the line maps of h2 1-0 o(3), 3.3 {\mu}m feature, andbr{\alpha}, the distribution of the aromatic feature shows overall correlationwith those of other emissions together with regional differences reflecting thelocal physical conditions. by comparison with other archival imaging data atdifferent wavelengths, the association of the aromatic emission to otherionic/molecular emission is clarified. we examine archival spitzer irs data ofn49 and find signatures of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) featuresat 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 {\mu}m corresponding to the 3.3 {\mu}m aromatic feature.based on the band ratios of pahs, we find that pahs in n49 are not onlydominantly neutral but also small in size. we discuss the origin of the pahemission in n49 and conclude that the emission is either from pahs that havesurvived the shock or pahs in the preshock gas heated by radiative precursor.

1509.02280	impact of the initial disk mass function on the disk fraction	the disk fraction, the percentage of stars with disks in a young cluster, iswidely used to investigate the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk, which canimpose an important constraint on the planet formation mechanism. therelationship between the decay timescale of the disk fraction and the massdissipation timescale of an individual disk, however, remains unclear. here weinvestigate the effect of the disk mass function (dmf) on the evolution of thedisk fraction. we show that the time variation in the disk fraction depends onthe spread of the dmf and the detection threshold of the disk. in general, thedisk fraction decreases more slowly than the disk mass if a typical initial dmfand a detection threshold are assumed. we find that, if the disk mass decreasesexponentially, {the mass dissipation timescale of the disk} can be as short as$1\,{\rm myr}$ even when the disk fraction decreases with the time constant of${\sim}2.5\,{\rm myr}$. the decay timescale of the disk fraction can be anuseful parameter to investigate the disk lifetime, but the difference betweenthe mass dissipation of an individual disk and the decrease in the diskfraction should be properly appreciated to estimate the timescale of the diskmass dissipation.

0808.0363	systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous  infrared galaxies with akari	we report on the results of systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.3 using irc onboardthe akari satellite. this paper investigates whether the luminosities of theseulirgs are dominated by starburst activity, or optically elusive buried agnsare energetically important. our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features and the opticaldepths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains andat 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. because of the akari irc'sspectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffectedby earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ulirgs atz &gt; 0.15. we estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc),modestly obscured (av &lt; 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron pahemission luminosities measured in akari irc slitless spectra, and confirm thatsuch starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ulirgs. in roughly halfof the observed ulirgs classified optically as non-seyferts, we find signaturesof luminous energy sources that produce no pah emission and/or are morecentrally concentrated than the surrounding dust. we interpret these energysources as buried agns. the fraction of ulirgs with detectable buried agnsignatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. our overall resultssupport the scenario that luminous buried agns are important in many ulirgs atz &lt; 0.3 classified optically as non-seyferts, and that the opticalundetectability of such buried agns occurs merely because of a large amount ofnuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust columndensity opaque to the ionizing radiation of the agns.

astro-ph;0208218	a new empirical method of estimation of the far-infrared flux of  galaxies	we propose a new empirical method to estimate the total far-infrared flux ofgalaxies from the spectral energy distribution (sed) at wavelengths lambdashorter than 100 microns. it is difficult to derive the total far-infraredluminosity from only the iras data, though it is one of the most importantproperties of galaxies. observations by infrared telescope in space (irts)indicate that the sed of the diffuse emission from the galactic plane in thiswavelength region can be derived from the 60 microns to 100 microns color. thisempirical sed relation was improved in order to obtain a better fit to thegalactic plane data for i(60 microns)/i(100 microns) &gt; 0.6, and applied to 96iras galaxies for which isophot and kao data are available at lambda &gt; 100microns. as a result, the empirical relation describes well the far-infrared(fir) sed for a majority of the galaxies. additionally, the total fir flux forlambda longer than 40 microns is derived from the flux densities at 60 and 100microns by using this model. for the 96 iras galaxies, the uncertainty in thetotal far-infrared flux of the present method is 26%. the present method ismore accurate than the previous one widely used to derive the total infraredflux from the iras 60 and 100 microns data.

astro-ph;0208290	o and ne k absorption edge structures and interstellar abundance towards  cyg x-2	we have studied the o and ne absorption features in the x-ray spectrum of cygx-2 observed with the chandra letg. the o absorption edge is represented by thesum of three absorption-edge components within the limit of the energyresolution and the photon counting statistics. two of them are due to theatomic o; their energies correspond to two distinct spin states ofphoto-ionized o atoms. the remaining edge component is considered to representcompound forms of oxide dust grains. since cyg x-2 is about 1.4 kpc above thegalactic disk, the h column densities can be determined by radio (21 cm and coemission line) and h alpha observations with relatively small uncertainties.thus the o abundance relative to h can be determined from the absorption edges.we found that the dust scattering can affect the apparent depth of the edge ofthe compound forms. we determined the amplitude of the effect, which weconsider is the largest possible correction factor. the ratio of columndensities of o in atomic to compound forms and the o total abundance wererespectively determined to be in the range 1.7^{+3.0}_{-0.9} to2.8^{+5.1}_{-1.5} (ratio), and 0.63 +/- 0.12 solar to 0.74 +/- 0.14 solar(total), taking into account the uncertainties in the dust-scatteringcorrection and in the ionized h column density. we also determined the neabundance from the absorption edge to be 0.75 +/- 0.20 solar. these abundancevalues are smaller than the widely-used solar values but consistent with thelatest estimates of solar abundance.

astro-ph;0211378	detection of far-infrared features in star-forming regions	we report the detection of a feature at 65um and a broad feature around 100umin the far-infrared spectra of the diffuse emission from two activestar-forming regions, the carina nebula and sharpless 171. the features areseen in the spectra over a wide area of the observed regions, indicating thatthe carriers are fairly ubiquitous species in the interstellar medium. asimilar 65um feature has been detected in evolved stars and attributed todiopside, a ca-bearing crystalline silicate. the present observations indicatethe first detection of a crystalline silicate in the interstellar medium ifthis identification holds true also for the interstellar feature. a similarbroad feature around 90um reported in the spectra of evolved stars has beenattributed to calcite, a ca-bearing carbonate mineral. the interstellar featureseems to be shifted to longer wavelengths and have a broader width although theprecise estimate of the feature profile is difficult. as a carrier for theinterstellar 100um feature, we investigate the possibility that the featureoriginates from carbon onions, grains consisting of curved graphitic shells.because of the curved graphitic sheet structure, the optical properties in thedirection parallel to the graphitic plane interacts with those in the verticaldirection in carbon onion grains. this effect enhances the interband transitionfeature in the direction parallel to the graphitic plane in carbon onions,which is suppressed in graphite particles. simple calculations suggest thatcarbon onion grains are a likely candidate for the observed 100um featurecarrier, but the appearance of the feature is sensitive to the assumed opticalproperties.

0808.3022	akari irc survey of the large magellanic cloud: outline of the survey  and initial results	we observed an area of 10 deg^2 of the large magellanic cloud using theinfrared camera on board akari. the observations were carried out using fiveimaging filters (3, 7, 11, 15, and 24 micron) and a dispersion prism (2 -- 5micron, $\lambda / \delta\lambda$ $\sim$ 20) equipped in the irc. this paperdescribes the outline of our survey project and presents some initial resultsusing the imaging data that detected over 5.9x10^5 near-infrared and 6.4x10^4mid-infrared point sources. the 10 $\sigma$ detection limits of our survey areabout 16.5, 14.0, 12.3, 10.8, and 9.2 in vega-magnitude at 3, 7, 11, 15, and 24micron, respectively. the 11 and 15 micron data, which are unique to akari irc,allow us to construct color-magnitude diagrams that are useful to identifystars with circumstellar dust. we found a new sequence in the color-magnitudediagram, which is attributed to red giants with luminosity fainter than that ofthe tip of the first red giant branch. we suggest that this sequence is likelyto be related to the broad emission feature of aluminium oxide at 11.5 micron.the 11 and 15 micron data also indicate that the ([11] - [15]) micron color ofboth oxygen-rich and carbon-rich red giants once becomes blue and then turnsred again in the course of their evolution, probably due to the change in theflux ratio of the silicate or silicon carbide emission feature at 10 or 11.3micron to the 15 micron flux.

astro-ph;0406508	crystalline silicate feature of the vega-like star hd145263	we have observed the 8-13 $\mu$m spectrum (r$\sim$250) of the vega-like starcandidate hd145263 using subaru/comics. the spectrum of hd145263 shows thebroad trapezoidal silicate feature with the shoulders at 9.3 $\mu$m and 11.44$\mu$m, indicating the presence of crystalline silicate grains. this detectionimplies that crystalline silicate may also be commonly present around vega-likestars. the 11.44 $\mu$m feature is slightly shifted to a longer wavelengthcompared to the usual 11.2-3 $\mu$m crystalline forsterite feature detectedtoward herbig ae/be stars and t tauri stars. although the peak shift due to theeffects of the grain size can not be ruled out, we suggest that fe-bearingcrystalline olivine explains the observed peak wavelength fairly well.fe-bearing silicates are commonly found in meteorites and most interplanetarydust particles, which originate from planetesimal-like asteroids. according tostudies of meteorites, fe-bearing silicate must have been formed in asteroidalplanetesimals, supporting the scenario that dust grains around vega-like starsare of planetesimal origin, if the observed 11.44 $\mu$m peak is due tofe-bearing silicates.

0809.0552	far-infrared properties of blue compact dwarf galaxies observed with  akari/far-infrared surveyor (fis)	we report basic far-infrared (fir) properties of eight blue compact dwarfgalaxies (bcds) observed by akari. we measure the fluxes at the four fis bands(wavelengths of 65 um, 90 um, 140 um, and 160 um). based on these fluxes, weestimate basic quantities about dust: dust temperature, dust mass, and totalfir luminosity. we find that the typical dust temperature of the bcd sample issystematically higher than that of normal spiral galaxies, although there is alarge variety. the interstellar radiation field estimated from the dusttemperature ranges up to 100 times of the galactic value. this confirms theconcentrated star-forming activity in bcds. the star formation rate can beevaluated from the fir luminosity as 0.01--0.5 $m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. combiningthis quantity with gas mass taken from the literature, we estimate the gasconsumption timescales (gas mass divided by the star formation rate), whichprove to span a wide range from 1 gyr to 100 gyr. a natural interpretation ofthis large variety can be provided by intermittent star formation activity. wefinally show the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity (we utilizeour estimate of dust mass, and take other necessary quantities from theliterature). there is a positive correlation between dust-to-gas ratio andmetallicity as expected from chemical evolution models.

astro-ph;0511525	large silicon abundance in photodissociation regions	we have made one-dimensional raster-scan observations of the rho oph andsigma sco star-forming regions with two spectrometers (sws and lws) on boardthe iso. in the rho oph region, [siii] 35um, [oi] 63um, 146um, [cii] 158um, andthe h2 pure rotational transition lines s(0) to s(3) are detected, and the pdrproperties are derived as the radiation field scaled by the solar neighborhoodvalue g_0~30-500, the gas density n~250--2500 /cc, and the surface temperaturet~100-400 k. the ratio of [siii] 35um to [oi] 146um indicates that silicon of10--20% of the solar abundance must be in the gaseous form in thephotodissociation region (pdr), suggesting that efficient dust destruction isundergoing even in the pdr and that part of silicon atoms may be contained involatile forms in dust grains. the [oi] 63um and [cii] 158um emissions are tooweak relative to [oi] 146um to be accounted for by standard pdr models. wepropose a simple model, in which overlapping pdr clouds along the line of sightabsorb the [oi] 63um and [cii] 158um emissions, and show that the proposedmodel reproduces the observed line intensities fairly well. in the sigma scoregion, we have detected 3 fine-structure lines, [oi] 63um, [nii] 122um, and[cii] 158um, and derived that 30-80% of the [cii] emission comes from theionized gas. the upper limit of the [siii] 35um is compatible with the solarabundance relative to nitrogen and no useful constraint on the gaseous si isobtained for the sigma sco region.

astro-ph;0606321	spitzer space telescope infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the crab  nebula	we present 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, and 70 micron images of the crab nebulaobtained with the spitzer space telescope irac and mips cameras, low- andhigh-resolution spitzer irs spectra of selected positions within the nebula,and a near-infrared ground-based image made in the light of [fe ii]1.644micron. the 8.0 micron image, made with a bandpass that includes [ar ii]7.0micron, resembles the general morphology of visible h-alpha and near-ir [fe ii]line emission, while the 3.6 and 4.5 micron images are dominated by continuumsynchrotron emission. the 24 micron and 70 micron images show enhanced emissionthat may be due to line emission or the presence of a small amount of warm dustin the nebula on the order of less than 1% of a solar mass. the ratio of the3.6 and 4.5 micron images reveals a spatial variation in the synchrotron powerlaw index ranging from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 across the nebula. combiningthis information with optical and x-ray synchrotron images, we derive abroadband spectrum that reflects the superposition of the flatter spectrum jetand torus with the steeper diffuse nebula, and suggestions of the expectedpileup of relativistic electrons just before the exponential cutoff in thex-ray. the pulsar, and the associated equatorial toroid and polar jetstructures seen in chandra and hst images (hester et al. 2002) can beidentified in all of the irac images. we present the ir photometry of thepulsar. the forbidden lines identified in the high resolution ir spectra areall double due to doppler shifts from the front and back of the expandingnebula and give an expansion velocity of approximately 1264 km/s.

astro-ph;0701808	the asymmetric thermal emission of protoplanetary disk surrounding hd  142527 seen by subaru/comics	mid-infrared (mir) images of the herbig ae star hd 142527 were obtained at18.8 and 24.5 micron with the subaru/comics. bright extended arc-like emission(outer disk) is recognized at r=0.85" together with a strong central source(inner disk) and a gap around r=0.6" in the both images. thermal emission ofthe eastern side is much brighter than that of the western side in the mir. weestimate the dust size as a few micron from the observed color of the extendedemission and the distance from the star. the dust temperature t and the opticaldepth tau of the mir emitting dust are also derived from the two images ast=82+/-1k, tau=0.052+/-0.001 for the eastern side and t=85+/-3k,tau=0.018+/-0.001 for the western side. the observed asymmetry in thebrightness can be attributed to the difference in the optical depth of the miremitting dust. to account for the present observations, we propose an inclineddisk model, in which the outer disk is inclined along the east-west directionwith the eastern side being in the far side and the inner rim of the outer diskin the eatern side is exposed directly to us. the proposed model cansuccessfully account for the mir observations as well as near-infrared (nir)images of the scattering light, in which the asymmetry is seen in the oppositesense and the forward scattering light (near side -- western side) is brighter.

astro-ph;9910560	polarization of thermal emission from aligned dust grains under an  anisotropic radiation field	if aspherical dust grains are immersed in an anisotropic radiation field,their temperature depends on the cross-sections projected in the direction ofthe anisotropy.it was shown that the temperature difference produces polarizedthermal emission even without alignment, if the observer looks at the grainsfrom a direction different from the anisotropic radiation. when the dust grainsare aligned, the anisotropy in the radiation makes various effects on thepolarization of the thermal emission, depending on the relative angle betweenthe anisotropy and alignment directions. if the both directions are parallel,the anisotropy produces a steep increase in the polarization degree at shortwavelengths. if they are perpendicular, the polarization reversal occurs at awavelength shorter than the emission peak. the effect of the anisotropicradiation will make a change of more than a few % in the polarization degreefor short wavelengths and the effect must be taken into account in theinterpretation of the polarization in the thermal emission. the anisotropy inthe radiation field produces a strong spectral dependence of the polarizationdegree and position angle, which is not seen under isotropic radiation. thedependence changes with the grain shape to a detectable level and thus it willprovide a new tool to investigate the shape of dust grains. this paper presentsexamples of numerical calculations of the effects and demonstrates theimportance of anisotropic radiation field on the polarized thermal emission.

0811.1403	supernova remnants in the akari irc survey of the large magellanic cloud	we present the near- to mid-infared study of supernova remnants (snrs) usingthe akari irc survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the lmc surveyobserved about a 10 square degree area of the lmc in five bands centered at 3,7, 11, 15, and 24 \micron using the infrared camera (irc) aboard akari. thenumber of snrs in the survey area is 21, which is about a half of the known lmcsnrs. we systematically examined the akari images and identified eight snrswith distinguishable infrared emission. all of them were detected at $\gtrsim10$ \micron and some at 3 and 7 \micron, too. we present their akari images andfluxes. in the 11/15 \micron versus 15/24 \micron color-color diagram, the snrsappear to be aligned along a modified blackbody curve, representing thermalemission from dust at temperatures between 90 and 190 k. there is a goodcorrelation between the 24 \micron and x-ray fluxes of the snrs. it was alsofound that there is a good correlation between the 24 \micron and radio fluxeseven if there is no direct physical connection between them. we considered theorigin of the detected mid-infrared emission in individual snrs. we concludethat the mid-infrared emissions in five snrs that show morphologies similar tothe x-rays are dominated by thermal emission from hot dust heated by x-rayemitting plasma. their 15/24 \micron color temperatures are generally higherthan the spitzer 24/70 \micron color temperatures, which suggests that asingle-temperature dust model cannot describe the full spectral energydistribution (sed) of the snrs. it also implies that our understanding of thefull sed is essential for estimating the dust destruction rate of grains by snrshocks.
