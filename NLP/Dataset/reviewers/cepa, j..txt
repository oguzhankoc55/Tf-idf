0901.3483	otelo survey: deep bvri broadband photometry of the groth strip. ii  properties of x-ray emitters	the groth field is one of the sky regions that will be targeted by the otelo(osiris tunable filter emission line object) survey in the optical 820 nm and920 nm atmospheric windows. this field has been observed by aegis(all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey) covering the fullspectral range, from x-rays to radio waves. chandra x-ray data with totalexposure time of 200ksec are analyzed and combined with optical broadband dataof the groth field in order to study a set of structural parameters of thex-ray emitters and its relation with x-ray properties. we processed the raw,public x-ray data using the chandra interactive analysis of observations anddetermined and analyzed different structural parameters in order to produce amorphological classification of x-ray sources. finally, we analyzed the angularclustering of these sources using 2-point correlation functions. we present acatalog of 340 x-ray emitters with optical counterpart. we obtained the numbercounts and compared them with aegis data. objects have been classified bynuclear type using a diagnostic diagram relating x-ray-to-optical ratio (x/o)to hardness ratio (hr). also, we combined structural parameters with otherx-ray and optical properties, and found for the first time an anticorrelationbetween the x/o ratio and the abraham concentration index which might suggestthat early type galaxies have lower eddington rates than those of late typegalaxies. a significant positive angular clustering was obtained from apreliminary analysis of 4 subsamples of the x-ray sources catalog. theclustering signal of the opticaly extended counterparts is similar to that ofstrongly clustered populations like red and very red galaxies, suggesting thatthe environment plays an important role in agn phenomena.

0901.3676	evolution of the optical tully-fisher relation up to z=1.3	the study of the evolution of the tully-fisher relation has beencontroversial in the past years. the main difficulty is in determining therequired parameters for intermediate and high redshift galaxies.  this work aims to identify the main problems of the study of the tully-fisherrelation at high redshift using optical emission lines, in order to drawconclusions about the possible evolution of this relation in the b, r, andi-bands.  with this aim, the rotational velocities obtained from the widths ofdifferent optical lines using deep2 spectra are compared. morphology has beendetermined via hst images, using and comparing different methodologies.instrumental magnitudes are then corrected for k and extinction and theabsolute magnitudes derived for the concordance cosmological model. finally,the optical tully-fisher relations in b, r, and i-bands at different redshiftsup to z = 1.3 are derived.  although most studies (this one included) find evidence of evolution, theresults are not conclusive enough, since the possible luminosity evolution iswithin the scattering of the relation, and the evolution in slope is difficultto determine because at high redshift only the brightest galaxies can bemeasured. nevertheless, our study shows a clear tendency, which is the same forall bands studied, that favours a luminosity evolution where galaxies werebrighter in the past for the same rotation velocity. this result also impliesthat the colour of the tully-fisher relation does not change with redshift,supporting the collapse model versus the accretion model of disc galaxyformation.

0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0907.0450	study of star-forming galaxies in sdss up to redshift 0.4: i.  metallicity evolution	the chemical composition of the gas in galaxies versus cosmic time provides avery important tool for understanding galaxy evolution. although there are manystudies at high redshift, they are rather scarce at lower redshifts. however,low redshift studies can provide important clues about the evolution ofgalaxies, furnishing the required link between local and high redshiftuniverse. in this work we focus on the metallicity of the gas of star-forminggalaxies at low redshift, looking for signs of chemical evolution.  to analyze the metallicity contents star-forming galaxies of similarluminosities and masses at different redshifts. with this purpose, we present astudy of the metallicity of relatively massive (log(m_star/m_sun)&gt;10.5) starforming galaxies from sdss--dr5 (sloan digital sky survey--data release 5),using different redshift intervals from 0.04 to 0.4.  we used data processed with the starlight spectral synthesis code, correctingthe fluxes for dust extinction, estimating metallicities using the r_23 method,and segregating the samples with respect to the value of the[nii]6583/[oii]3727 line ratio in order to break the r_23 degeneracy selectingthe upper branch. we analyze the luminosity and mass-metallicity relations, andthe effect of the sloan fiber diameter looking for possible biases.  by dividing our redshift samples in intervals of similar magnitude andcomparing them, significant signs of metallicity evolution are found.metallicity correlates inversely with redshift: from redshift 0 to 0.4 adecrement of ~0.1 dex in 12+log(o/h) is found.

0911.3150	unveiling the origin of grb 090709a: lack of periodicity in a reddened  cosmological long-duration gamma-ray burst	we present broadband (gamma-ray, x-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)observations of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 090709a and its afterglow in aneffort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. previous analysessuggested that grb 090709a exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a periodof 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration grbs but typical of flares fromsoft gamma-ray repeaters. when properly accounting for the underlying shape ofthe power-density spectrum of grb 090709a, we find no conclusive (&gt; 3 sigma)evidence for the reported periodicity. in conjunction with the location of thetransient (far from the galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in thelocal universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the galacticvalue, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. a long-duration grb,however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of thissource. grb 090709a is distinguished from other long-duration grbs primarily bythe large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (a_k,obs &gt;~ 2 mag).

1003.5475	study of star-forming galaxies in sdss up to redshift 0.4 ii. evolution  from the fundamental parameters: mass, metallicity &amp; sfr	to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is important tohave a full comprehension of the role played by the metallicity, star formationrate (sfr), morphology, and color. the interplay of these parameters atdifferent redshifts will substantially affect the evolution of galaxies and, asa consequence, the evolution of them will provide important clues andconstraints on the galaxy evolution models. in this work we focus on theevolution of the sfr, metallicity of the gas, and morphology of galaxies at lowredshift in search of signs of evolution. we use the s2n2 diagnostic diagram asa tool to classify star--forming, composite, and agn galaxies. we analyzed theevolution of the three principal bpt diagrams, estimating the sfr and specificsfr (ssfr) for our samples of galaxies, studying the luminosity andmass-metallicity relations, and analyzing the morphology of our sample ofgalaxies through the g-r color, concentration index, and ssfr. we found thatthe s2n2 is a reliable diagram to classify star--forming, composite, and agnsgalaxies. we demonstrate that the three principal bpt diagrams show anevolution toward higher values of [oiii]5007/hb due to a metallicity decrement.we found an evolution in the mass-metallicity relation of ~ 0.2 dex for theredshift range 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.4 compared to our local one. from the analysis ofthe evolution of the sfr and ssfr as a function of the stellar mass andmetallicity, we discovered a group of galaxies with higher sfr and ssfr at allredshift samples, whose morphology is consistent with those of late-typegalaxies. finally, the comparison of our local (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.1) with our higherredshift sample (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.4), show that the metallicity, the sfr and morphology,evolve toward lower values of metallicity, higher sfrs, and late--typemorphologies for the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.4

1005.0509	a fundamental plane for field star-forming galaxies	star formation rate (sfr), metallicity and stellar mass are within theimportant parameters of star--forming galaxies that characterize theirformation and evolution. they are known to be related to each other at low andhigh redshift in the mass--metallicity, mass--sfr, and metallicity--sfrrelations. in this work we demonstrate the existence of a plane in the 3d spacedefined by the axes sfr [log(sfr)(m_sun yr^-1)], gas metallicity [12+log(o/h)],and stellar mass [log(m_star/m_sun)] of star-forming galaxies. we usedstar--forming galaxies from the "main galaxy sample" of the sloan digital skysurvey--data release 7 (sdss-dr7) in the redshift range 0.04 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 andr-magnitudes between 14.5 and 17.77. metallicities, sfrs, and stellar masseswere taken from the max-planck-institute for astrophysics-john hopkinsuniversity (mpa-jhu) emission line analysis database. from a final sample of44214 galaxies, we find for the first time a fundamental plane for fieldgalaxies relating the sfr, gas metallicity, and stellar mass for star--forminggalaxies in the local universe. one of the applications of this plane would beestimating stellar masses from sfr and metallicity. high redshift data from theliterature at redshift ~2.2 and 3.5, do not show evidence for evolution in thisfundamental plane.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.1512	evolution of the infrared tully-fisher relation up to z=1.4	the tully-fisher relation (tfr) represents a connection between fundamentalgalaxy parameters, such as its total mass and the mass locked in stars.therefore, the study of the evolution of this relation in the optical andinfrared bands can provide valuable information about the evolution of theindividual galaxies through the changes found in each band. this work aims tostudy the tfr at high redshift in the b, v, r, i, and k-bands by comparisonwith the local relations derived from a large sample of galaxies in theredshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3, processed in the same way, and with the sameinstrumental constraints that the high-redshift sample. using the largephotometric information available in the aegis database, we have studied thebest procedure to obtain reliable k-corrections. instrumental magnitudes arethen k and extinction corrected and the absolute magnitudes derived, using theconcordance cosmological model. the rotational velocities have been obtainedfrom the widths of optical lines using deep2 spectra. finally, morphology hasbeen determined via visual classification of the hst images. we detectevolution in the b, v and r-band tfrs in the sense that galaxies were brighterin the past for the same rotation velocity. the change in luminosity is morenoticeable in the bluer bands. this colour evolution, unnoticed in our previouswork (fern\'andez lorenzo et al. 2009) has been detected thanks to the morereliable k-corrections carried out in this paper, which included photometryfrom b to irac bands. the change in the (v-k) and (r-i) colours (for a fixedvelocity) could be interpreted as an ageing of the stellar populations asconsequence of the star formation decrease since z=1.25. in addition, weconclude that spiral galaxies could have doubled their stellar masses in thelast 8.6 gyr.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.1902	unveiling far-infrared counterparts of bright submillimeter galaxies  using pacs imaging	we present a search for herschel-pacs counterparts of dust-obscured,high-redshift objects previously selected at submillimeter and millimeterwavelengths in the great observatories origins deep survey north field. wedetect 22 of 56 submillimeter galaxies (39%) with a snr of &gt;=3 at 100 microndown to 3.0 mjy, and/or at 160 micron down to 5.7 mjy. the fraction of smgsseen at 160 micron is higher than that at 100 micron. about 50% ofradio-identified smgs are associated with pacs sources. we find a trend betweenthe scuba/pacs flux ratio and redshift, suggesting that these flux ratios couldbe used as a coarse redshift indicator. pacs undetected submm/mm selectedsources tend to lie at higher redshifts than the pacs detected ones. a total of12 sources (21% of our smg sample) remain unidentified and the fact that theyare blank fields at herschel-pacs and vla 20 cm wavelength may imply higherredshifts for them than for the average smg population (e.g., z&gt;3-4). theherschel-pacs imaging of these dust-obscured starbursts at high-redshiftssuggests that their far-infrared spectral energy distributions havesignificantly different shapes than template libraries of local infraredgalaxies.

1007.3846	a first glimpse into the far-ir properties of high-z uv-selected  galaxies: herschel/pacs observations of z~3 lbgs	we present first insights into the far-ir properties for a sample of irac andmips-24um detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3, as derived fromobservations in the northern field of the great observatories origins survey(goods-n) carried out with the pacs instrument on board the herschel spaceobservatory. although none of our galaxies are detected by herschel, we employa stacking technique to construct, for the first time, the average spectralenergy distribution of infrared luminous lbgs from uv to radio wavelengths. wederive a median ir luminosity of l_{ir} = 1.6 x 10^12 lo, placing thepopulation in the class of ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs).complementing our study with existing multi-wavelength data, we put constraintson the dust temperature of the population and find that for their l_{ir},mips-lbgs are warmer than submm-luminous galaxies while they fall in the locusof the l_{ir}-t_{d} relation of the local ulirgs. this, along with estimatesbased on the average sed, explains the marginal detection of lbgs in currentsub-mm surveys and suggests that these latter studies introduce a bias towardsthe detection of colder ulirgs in the high-z universe, while missing high-zulirgs with warmer dust.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1008.4795	gran telescopio canarias osiris transiting exoplanet atmospheric survey:  detection of potassium in xo-2b from narrowband spectrophotometry	we present gran telescopio canarias (gtc) optical transit narrow-bandphotometry of the hot-jupiter exoplanet xo-2b using the osiris instrument. thisunique instrument has the capabilities to deliver high cadence narrow-bandphotometric lightcurves, allowing us to probe the atmospheric composition ofhot jupiters from the ground. the observations were taken during three transitevents which cover four wavelengths at spectral resolutions near 500, necessaryfor observing atmospheric features, and have near-photon limited sub-mmagprecisions. precision narrow-band photometry on a large aperture telescopeallows for atmospheric transmission spectral features to be observed forexoplanets around much fainter stars than those of the well studied targetshd209458b and hd189733b, providing access to the majority of known transitingplanets. for xo-2b, we measure planet-to-star radius contrasts ofr_pl/r_star=0.10508+/-0.00052 at 6792 ang, 0.10640+/-0.00058 at 7582 ang, and0.10686+/-0.00060 at 7664.9 ang, and 0.10362+/-0.00051 at 8839 ang. thesemeasurements reveal significant spectral features at two wavelengths, with anabsorption level of 0.067+/-0.016% at 7664.9 ang due to atmospheric potassiumin the line core (a 4.1-sigma significance level), and an absorption level of0.058+/-0.016% at 7582 ang, (a 3.6-sigma significance level). when comparingour measurements to hot-jupiter atmospheric models, we find good agreement withmodels which are dominated in the optical by alkali metals. this is the firstevidence for potassium in an extrasolar planet, an element that has long beentheorized along with sodium to be a dominant source of opacity at opticalwavelengths for hot jupiters.

1010.4177	evolution of the fundamental plane of 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2 early-type galaxies in  the egs	the fundamental plane relates the structural properties of early-typegalaxies such as its surface brightness and effective radius with its dynamics.the study of its evolution has therefore important implications for models ofgalaxy formation and evolution. this work aims to identify signs of evolutionof early-type galaxies through the study of parameter correlations using asample of 135 field galaxies extracted from the extended groth strip in theredshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.2. using deep2 data, we calculate the internal velocitydispersions by extracting the stellar kinematics from absorption line spectra,using a maximum penalized likelihood approach. morphology was determinedthrough visual classification using the v+i images of acs. the structuralparameters of these galaxies were obtained by fitting de vaucouleurs stellarprofiles to the acs i-band images, using the galfit code. s\'ersic andbulge-to-disc decomposition models were also fitted to our sample of galaxies,and we found a good agreement in the fundamental plane derived from the threemodels. assuming that effective radii and velocity dispersions do not evolvewith redshift, we have found a brightening of 0.68 mag in the b-band and 0.52mag in the g-band at &lt;z&gt;=0.7. however, the scatter in the fp is reduced by halfwhen we allow the fp slope to evolve, suggesting a different evolution ofearly-type galaxies according to their intrinsic properties. the study of thekormendy relation shows the existence of a population of very compact (re&lt;2kpc) and bright galaxies (-21.5&gt;mg&gt;-22.5), of which there are only a smallfraction (0.4%) at z=0. the evolution of these compact objects is mainly causedby an increase in size that could be explained by the action of dry minormergers, and this population is responsible for the evolution detected in thefundamental plane.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

1106.5495	discovery of a high-z protocluster with tunable filters: the case of  6c0140+326 at z=4.4	we present the first results obtained using a tunable narrowband filter inthe search for high-z protoclusters. using the recently commissioned redtunable filter on the gran telescopio canarias we have searched for lyaemitters in a 75 arcmin^2 field centered on the z=4.413 radio galaxy6c0140+326. with three different wavelength tunings we find a total of 27unique candidate lya emitters. the availability of three different wavelengthtunings allows us to make estimates of the redshifts for each of the objects.it also allows us to separate a possible protocluster from structure in theimmediate foreground. this division shows that the foreground region containssignificantly fewer lya emitters. also, the spatial distribution of the objectsin the protocluster field deviates from a random distribution at the 2.5 sigmalevel. the observed redshift distribution of the emitters is different from theexpected distribution of a blank field at the ~3 sigma level, with the lyaemitters concentrated near the radio galaxy at z&gt;4.38. the 6c0140+326 field isdenser by a factor of 9+/-5 than a blank field, and the number density of lyaemitters close to the radio galaxy is similar to that of the z~4.1 protoclusteraround tnj1338-1942. we thus conclude that there is an overdensity of lyaemitters around the radio galaxy 6c0140+326. this is one of few knownoverdensities at such a high redshift.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1109.1392	sdss galaxies with double-peaked emission lines: double starbursts or  agns?	with the aim of investigating galaxies with two strong simultaneousstarbursts, we have extracted a sample of galaxies with double-peaked emissionlines in their global spectra from the sdss spectral database. we then fittedthe emission lines halpha, hbeta, [oiii]5007, [nii]6584, [sii]6717 and[sii]6731 of 129 spectra by two gaussians to separate the radiation of the two(blue and red) components. a more or less reliable decomposition of the allthose emission lines have been found for 55 spectra. using a standard bptclassification diagram, we have been able to divide the galaxies from oursample into two subsamples: sample a consisting of 18 galaxies where bothcomponents belong to the photoionised class of objects, and sample b containing37 galaxies which show non-thermal ionisation (agns). we have examined theproperties of the blue and red components, and found that the differencesbetween radial velocities of components lie within 200 - 400 km/s for galaxiesof both subsamples. the equivalent number of ionising stars is in the range10^4 - 10^5 o7v stars for each component in the galaxies of sample a. we haveestimated the oxygen and nitrogen abundances as well as the electrontemperatures for each component using the recent ns-calibration and from globalspectra for galaxies from sample a using both the ns and on-calibration. wehave found that the global oxygen abundance is typically in between themeasured abundances of individual components for our sample of galaxies, andthat both calibrations provide consistent global abundances. finally, wesuggest the classical o/h -- n/o diagram is used to test the reliability of thedividing lines between starburst-like objects and agns in the so-called bptdiagram.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1202.3397	quasi-stellar objects in the alhambra survey. i. photometric redshift  accuracy based on a 23 optical-nir filter photometry	we characterize the ability of the alhambra survey to assign accuratephoto-z's to blagn and qsos based on their alhambra very-low-resolutionoptical-nir spectroscopy. a sample of 170 spectroscopically identified blagnand qsos have been used together with a library of templates (including sedsfrom agn, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23photometric data points provided by alhambra in the optical and nir (20medium-band optical filters plus the standard jhks). we find that the alhambraphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classificationfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of thesurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(sloan)~24.0). thederived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recentresults in other cosmological fields. the fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainlycaused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and theintrinsic variability of the blagn/qso population. a small fraction of outliersmay have an incorrectly assigned spectroscopic redshift. the definition of thealhambra survey in terms of the number of filters, filter properties, areacoverage and depth is able to provide photometric redshifts for blagn/qsos witha precision similar to any previous survey that makes use of medium-bandoptical photometry. in agreement with previous literature results, our analysisalso reveals that, in the 0&lt;z&lt;4 redshift interval, very accurate photo-z can beobtained without the use of near-ir broadband photometry at the expense of aslight increase of outliers. the nir importance is expected to increase athigher redshifts (z&gt;4). these results are relevant for the design of futureoptical follow-ups of surveys with a large fraction of blagn, as it is the casefor x-rays or radio surveys.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1302.1009	the filling factor - radius relation for 58 hii regions across the disk  of ngc6946	using the osiris tunable narrow band imager on the 10.4m gtc (la palma) wehave mapped the sab(rs)cd galaxy ngc 6946 over a 7.3x7.5 square arcminutesfield in the emission lines of the [sii]\lambda\lambda, 6717, 6731 doublet, andin h\alpha. from these maps we have produced catalogs of the h\alphaluminosities and effective radii of 557 hii regions across the disk, andderived the [sii] emission line ratios of 370 of these. the h\alphaobservations were used to derive the mean luminosity-weighted electrondensities for the regions of the sample, while the [sii] line ratios allowed usto derive values of the in situ electron densities in the denser zones fromwhich the major fraction of the radiation in these lines is emitted, for 58 ofthe regions. this is by far the largest data set of its kind for a singlegalaxy. a classical two phase model is used to derive the filling factors ofthe regions. we find that although the mean electron density decreases with thesquare root of the radius of the regions, the in situ density is essentiallyindependent of this radius. thus the filling factor falls systematically, asthe radius and the luminosity of the regions increases, with a power law ofexponent -2.23 between filling factor and radius. these measurements shouldenhance the perspectives for more refined physical models of hii regions.

1304.3230	fir-detected lyman break galaxies at z ~ 3: dust attenuation and dust  correction factors at high redshift	lyman break galaxies (lbgs) represent one of the kinds of star-forminggalaxies that are found in the high-redshift universe. the detection of lbgs inthe fir domain can provide very important clues on their dust attenuation andtotal sfr, allowing a more detailed study than those performed so far. in thiswork we explore the fir emission of a sample of 16 lbgs at z ~ 3 in thegoods-north and goods-south fields that are individually detected in pacs-100umor pacs-160um. these detections demonstrate the possibility of measuring thedust emission of lbgs at high redshift. we find that pacs-detected lbgs at z ~3 are highly obscured galaxies which belong to the ultra luminous ir galaxiesor hyper luminous ir galaxies class. their total sfr cannot be recovered withthe dust attenuation factors obtained from their uv continuum slope or theirsed-derived dust attenuation employing bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) templates. bothmethods underestimate the results for most of the galaxies. comparing with asample of pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 we find evidences that the fir emissionof lbgs might have changed with redshift in the sense that the dustiest lbgsfound at z ~ 3 have more prominent fir emission, are dustier for a given uvslope, and have higher sfr for a given stellar mass than the dustiest lbgsfound at z ~ 1.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.5117	the alhambra survey: discovery of a faint qso at z = 5.41	we aim to illustrate the potentiality of the advanced large, homogeneousarea, medium-band redshift astronomical (alhambra) survey to investigate thehigh redshift universe through the detection of quasi stellar objects (qsos) atredshifts larger than 5. the search for z&gt;5 qsos candidates was done by fittingan extensive library of spectral energy distributions --including active andnon-active galaxy templates as well as stars-- to the photometric database ofthe alhambra survey (composed of 20 optical medium-band plus the 3 broad-bandjhks filters). our selection over ~1 square degree of alhambra data (~1/4 ofthe total area covered by the survey), combined with gtc/osiris spectroscopy,has yielded the identification of an optically faint qso at very high redshift(z = 5.41). the qso has an absolute magnitude of ~-24 at the 1450{\aa}continuum, a bolometric luminosity of ~2x10^46 erg/s and an estimated blackhole mass of ~10^8 msolar. this qso adds itself to a reduced number of known uvfaint sources at these redshifts. the preliminary derived space density iscompatible with the most recent determinations of the high-z qso luminosityfunctions (qlf). this new detection shows how alhambra, as well as forthcomingwell designed photometric surveys, can provide a wealth of information on theorigin and early evolution of this kind of objects.

1310.4325	density waves and star formation in grand design spirals	hii regions in the arms of spiral galaxies are indicators of recentstar-forming processes. they may have been caused by the passage of the densitywave or simply created by other means near the arms. the study of these regionsmay give us clues to clarifying the controversy over the existence of atriggering scenario, as proposed in the density wave theory. using h$\alpha$direct imaging, we characterize the hii regions from a sample of three granddesign galaxies: ngc5457, ngc628 and ngc6946. broad band images in r and i wereused to determine the position of the arms. the hii regions found to beassociated with arms were selected for the study. the age and the starformation rate of these hii regions was obtained using measures on theh$\alpha$ line. the distance between the current position of the selected hiiregions and the position they would have if they had been created in the centreof the arm is calculated. a parameter, t, which measures whether a region wascreated in the arm or in the disc, is defined. with the help of the t parameterwe determine that the majority of regions were formed some time after thepassage of the density wave, with the regions located `behind the arm' (in thedirection of the rotation of the galaxy) the zone they should have occupied hadthey been formed in the centre of the arm. the presence of the large number ofregions created after the passage of the arm may be explained by the effect ofthe density wave, which helps to create the star-forming regions after itspassage. there is clear evidence of triggering for ngc5457 and a co-rotationradius is proposed. a more modest triggering seems to exist for ngc628 and nonsignificant evidence of triggering are found for ngc6946.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1407.0159	general formulation for the calibration and characterization of  narrow-gap etalons: the osiris/gtc tunable filters case	tunable filters are a powerful way of implementing narrow-band imaging modeover wide wavelength ranges, without the need of purchasing a large number ofnarrow-band filters covering all strong emission or absorption lines at anyredshift. however, one of its main features is a wavelength variation acrossthe field of view, sometimes termed the phase effect. in this work, ananomalous phase effect is reported and characterized for the osiris instrumentat the 10.4m gran telescopio canarias. the transmitted wavelength across thefield of view of the instrument depends, not only on the distance to theoptical centre, but on wavelength. this effect is calibrated for the redtunable filter of osiris by measuring both normal-incidence light at laboratoryand spectral lamps at the telescope at non-normal incidence.  this effect can be explained by taking into account the inner coatings of theetalon. in a high spectral resolution etalon, the gap between plates is muchlarger than the thickness of the inner reflective coatings. in the case of atunable filter, like that in osiris, the coatings thickness could be of theorder of the cavity, which changes drastically the effective gap of the etalon.we show that by including thick and dispersive coatings into the interferenceequations, the observed anomalous phase effect can be perfectly reproduced. infact, we find that, for the osiris red tf, a two-coatings model fits the datawith a rms of 0.5\aa\ at all wavelengths and incidence angles. this is ageneral physical model that can be applied to other tunable-filter instruments.

1505.02113	testing microvariability in quasar differential light curves using  several field stars	microvariability consists in small time scale variations of low amplitude inthe photometric light curves of quasars, and represents an important tool toinvestigate their inner core. detection of quasar microvariations ischallenging for their non-periodicity, as well as the need for high monitoringfrequency and high signal-to-noise ratio. statistical tests developed for theanalysis of quasar differential light curves usually show either low power orlow reliability, or both. in this paper we compare two statistical proceduresthat include several stars to perform tests with enhanced power and highreliability. we perform light curve simulations of variable quasars andnon-variable stars, and analyze them with statistical procedures developed fromthe f-test and the analysis of variance. the results show a large improvementin the power of both statistical probes, and a larger reliability, when severalstars are included in the analysis. the results from the simulations agree withthose obtained from observations of real quasars. the high power and highreliability of the tests discussed in this paper improve the results that canbe obtained from short and long time scale variability studies. thesetechniques are not limited to quasar variability; on the contrary, they can beeasily implemented to other sources such as variable stars. their applicationsto future research and to the analysis of large field photometric monitoringarchives can reveal new variable sources.

1506.02670	on the nature of h$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 2$ from the hizels  survey: physical properties, ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and main sequence	we present a detailed multi-wavelength study (from rest-frame uv to far-ir)of narrow-band (nb) selected, star-forming (sf) h$\alpha$ emitters (haes) at $z\sim 2.23$ taken from the high redshift(z) emission line survey (hizels). wefind that haes have similar sed-derived properties and colors to $sbzk$galaxies and probe a well-defined portion of the sf population at $z \sim 2$.this is not true for ly$\alpha$ emitters (laes), which are strongly biasedtowards blue, less massive galaxies (missing a significant percentage of the sfpopulation). combining our h$\alpha$ observations with matched, existingly$\alpha$ data we determine that the ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{\rmesc}$) is low (only $\sim$ 4.5\% of haes show ly$\alpha$ emission) anddecreases with increasing dust attenuation, uv continuum slope, stellar mass,and star formation rate (sfr). this suggests that ly$\alpha$ preferentiallyescapes from blue galaxies with low dust attenuation. however, a smallpopulation of red and massive laes is also present in agreement with previousworks. this indicates that dust and ly$\alpha$ are not mutually exclusive.using different and completely independent measures of the total sfr we showthat the h$\alpha$ emission is an excellent tracer of star formation at $z \sim2$ with deviations typically lower than 0.3 dex for individual galaxies. wefind that the slope and zero-point of the hae main-sequence (ms) at $z \sim 2$strongly depend on the dust correction method used to recover sfr, althoughthey are consistent with previous works when similar assumptions are made.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
