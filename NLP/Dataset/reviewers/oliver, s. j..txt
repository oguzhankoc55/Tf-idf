1005.1071	herschel and scuba-2 imaging and spectroscopy of a bright, lensed  submillimetre galaxy at z = 2.3	we present a detailed analysis of the far-ir properties of the bright,lensed, z = 2.3, smg, smm j2135-0102, using new observations with herschel,scuba-2 and the vla. these data allow us to constrain the galaxy's sed and showthat it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000um luminosity, l(bol), of (2.3 +/-0.2) x 10^12 l(sun) and a likely sfr of ~400 m(sun)/yr. the galaxy sits on thefar-ir/radio correlation for far-ir-selected galaxies. at ~&gt;70um, the sed canbe described adequately by dust components with t(d) ~ 30 and 60k. usingspire's fourier transform spectrometer we report a detection of the [cii] 158umcooling line. if the [cii], co and far-ir continuum arise in photo-dissociationregions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and a far-uvradiation field, g_0, 10^3x stronger than the milky way. l([cii])/l(bol) issignificantly higher than in local ulirgs but similar to the values found inlocal star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. this is consistent with smmj2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc,evidence that smgs are not simply scaled-up ulirgs. our results show thatspire's fts has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscuredgalaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not becompetitive with ground-based co-line searches. it will, however, allowdetailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as wellas the chemistry of their ism, once more suitably bright candidates have beenfound.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.1658	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: source extraction and  cross-identifications in confusion-dominated spire images	we present the cross-identification and source photometry techniques used toprocess herschel spire imaging taken as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). cross-identifications are performed in map-spaceso as to minimise source blending effects. we make use of a combination oflinear inversion and model selection techniques to produce reliablecross-identification catalogues based on spitzer mips 24 micron sourcepositions. testing on simulations and real herschel observations show that thisapproach gives robust results for even the faintest sources s250~10 mjy. weapply our new technique to hermes spire observations taken as part of thescience demostration phase of herschel. for our real spire observations we showthat, for bright unconfused sources, our flux density estimates are in goodagreement with those produced via more traditional point source detectionmethods (sussextractor; savage &amp; oliver et al. 2006) by smith et al. 2010. whencompared to the measured number density of sources in the spire bands, we showthat our method allows the recovery of a larger fraction of faint sources thanthese traditional methods. however this completeness is heavily dependant onthe relative depth of the existing 24 micron catalogues and spire imaging.using our deepest multi-wavelength dataset in goods-n, we estimate that the useof shallow 24 micron in our other fields introduces an incompleteness at faintlevels of between 20-40 per cent at 250 micron.

1009.2715	hermes: herschel-spire observations of lyman break galaxies	we present first results of a study of the submillimetre (rest framefar-infrared) properties of z~3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) and theirlower-redshift counterparts bx/bm galaxies, based on herschel-spireobservations of the northern field of the great observatories origins deepsurvey (goods-n). we use stacking analysis to determine the properties of lbgswell below the current limit of the survey. although lbgs are not detectedindividually, stacking the infrared luminous lbgs (those detected with spitzerat 24 microns yields a statistically significant submm detection with mean flux&lt;s_{250}&gt;= 5.9+/-1.4 mjy confirming the power of spire in detecting uv-selectedhigh-redshift galaxies at submillimetre wavelengths. in comparison, the spitzer24 microns detected bx/bm galaxies appear fainter with a stacked value of&lt;s_{250}&gt; = 2.7 +/-0.8 mjy. by fitting the spectral energy distributions (seds)we derive median infrared luminosities, l_{ir}, of 2.8x10^{12} lsun and1.5x10^{11} lsun for z~3 lbgs and bx/bms, respectively. we find that $l_{ir}estimates derived from present measurements are in good agreement with thosebased on uv data for z~2 bx/bm galaxies, unlike the case for z~3 infraredluminous lbgs where the uv underestimates the true $l_{ir}. although sampleselection effects may influence this result we suggest that differences inphysical properties (such as morphologies, dust distribution and extent ofstar-forming regions) between z ~3 lbgs and z~2 bx/bms may also play asignificant role.

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.0646	hermes: lyman break galaxies individually detected at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 in  goods-n with herschel/spire	as part of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey we haveinvestigated the rest-frame far-infrared (fir) properties of a sample of morethan 4800 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the great observatories origins deepsurvey north field. most lbgs are not detected individually, but we do detect asub-sample of 12 objects at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and one object at z ~ 2.0.  the ones detected by herschel spire have redder observed nuv-u and u-r colorsthan the others, while the undetected ones have colors consistent with averagelbgs at z &gt; 2.5. the uv-to-fir spectral energy distributions of the objectsdetected in the rest-frame fir are investigated using the code cigale toestimate physical parameters. we find that lbgs detected by spire are highmass, luminous infrared galaxies.  it appears that lbgs are located in a triangle-shaped region in the a_fuv vs.log l_fuv diagram limited by a_fuv=0 at the bottom and by a diagonal followingthe temporal evolution of the most massive galaxies from the bottom-right tothe top-left of the diagram. this upper envelop can be used as upper limits forthe uv dust attenuation as a function of l_fuv}. the limits of this region arewell explained using a closed-box model, where the chemical evolution ofgalaxies produces metals, which in turn lead to higher dust attenuation whenthe galaxies age.

0710.0300	the contribution of very massive high-redshift swire galaxies to the  stellar mass function	(abridged) we selected high-z massive galaxies at 5.8 microns, in the swireelais-s1 field (1 sq. deg.). galaxies with the 1.6 microns stellar peakredshifted into the irac bands (z~1-3, called ``ir-peakers'') were identified.stellar masses were derived by means of spectro-photometric fitting and used tocompute the stellar mass function (mf) at z=1-2 and 2-3. a parametric fit tothe mf was performed, based on a bayesian formalism, and the stellar massdensity of massive galaxies above z=2 determined. we present the firstsystematic study of the very-massive tail of the galaxy stellar mass functionat high redshift. a total of 326 sources were selected. the majority of thesegalaxies have stellar masses in excess of 1e11 msun and lie at z&gt;1.5. theavailability of mid-ir data turned out to be a valuable tool to constrain thecontribution of young stars to galaxy seds, and thus their m(stars)/l ratio.the influence of near-ir data and of the chosen stellar library on the sedfitting are also discussed. a significant evolution is found not only forgalaxies with m~1e11 msun, but also in the highest mass bins considered. thecomoving number density of these galaxies was lower by more than a factor of 10at z=2-3, with respect to the local estimate. swire 5.8 micron peakers moremassive than 1.6x1e11 msun provide 30-50% of the total stellar mass density ingalaxies at z=2-3.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1109.5186	hermes: point source catalogues from deep herschel-spire observations	we describe the generation of single-band point source catalogues fromsubmillimetre herschel-spire observations taken as part of the sciencedemonstration phase of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes).flux densities are found by means of peak-finding and the fitting of a gaussianpoint-response function. with highly-confused images, careful checks must bemade on the completeness and flux density accuracy of the detected sources.this is done by injecting artificial sources into the images and analysing theresulting catalogues. measured flux densities at which 50 per cent of injectedsources result in good detections at (250, 350, 500) {\mu}m range from (11.6,13.2, 13.1) mjy to (25.7, 27.1, 35.8) mjy, depending on the depth of theobservation (where a `good' detection is taken to be one with positional offsetless than one full-width half-maximum of the point-response function, and withthe measured flux density within a factor of 2 of the flux density of theinjected source). this paper acts as a reference for the 2010 july hermespublic data release.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1203.0063	hermes: a statistical measurement of the redshift distribution of  herschel-spire sources using the cross-correlation technique	the wide-area imaging surveys with the {\it herschel} space observatory atsub-mm wavelengths have now resulted in catalogs of order one hundred thousanddusty, star-burst galaxies. we make a statistical estimate of $n(z)$ using aclustering analysis of sub-mm galaxies detected at each of 250, 350 and 500$\mu$m from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) centered onthe bo\"{o}tes field. we cross-correlate {\it herschel} galaxies against galaxysamples at optical and near-ir wavelengths from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), the noao deep wide field survey (ndwfs) and the spitzer deep wide fieldsurvey (sdwfs). we create optical and near-ir galaxy samples based on theirphotometric or spectroscopic redshift distributions and test the accuracy ofthose redshift distributions with similar galaxy samples defined with catalogsof the cosmological evolution survey (cosmos), as the cosmos field has superiorspectroscopy coverage. we model-fit the clustering auto and cross-correlationsof {\it herschel} and optical/ir galaxy samples to estimate $n(z)$ andclustering bias factors. the $s_{350} &gt; 20$ mjy galaxies have a bias factorvarying with redshift as $b(z)=1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.5}(1+z)^{1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.7}}$.this bias and the redshift dependence is broadly in agreement with galaxiesthat occupy dark matter halos of mass in the range of 10$^{12}$ to 10$^{13}$m$_{\sun}$. we find that the redshift distribution peaks around $z \sim 0.5$ to1 for galaxies selected at 250 $\mu$m with an average redshift of $&lt; z &gt; = 1.8\pm 0.2$. for 350 and 500 $\mu$m-selected spire samples the peak shifts tohigher redshift, but the average redshift remains the same with a value of $1.9\pm 0.2$.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1203.5828	connecting stellar mass and star-formation rate to dark matter halo mass  out to z ~ 2	we have constructed an extended halo model (ehm) which relates the totalstellar mass and star-formation rate (sfr) to halo mass (m_h). an empiricalrelation between the distribution functions of total stellar mass of galaxiesand host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial density of galaxies over 0&lt;z&lt;2and the clustering properties at z~0, is extended to include two differentscenarios describing the variation of sfr on m_h. we also present newmeasurements of the redshift evolution of the average sfr for star-forminggalaxies of different stellar mass up to z=2, using data from the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) for infrared-bright galaxies.  combining the ehm with the halo accretion histories from numericalsimulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history inhalos spanning a range of masses. we find that: (1) the intensity of thestar-forming activity in halos in the probed mass range has steadily decreasedfrom z~2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, halos in the mass range between a fewtimes 10^{11} m_sun and a few times 10^{12} m_sun are the most efficient athosting star formation; (3) the peak of sfr density shifts to lower mass halosover time; (4) galaxies that are forming stars most actively at z~2 evolve intoquiescent galaxies in today's group environments, strongly supporting previousclaims that the most powerful starbursts at z~2 are progenitors of today'selliptical galaxies.

0711.0843	clustering of galaxies at 3.6 microns in the spitzer wide-area infrared  extragalactic legacy survey	we investigate the clustering of galaxies selected in the 3.6 micron band ofthe spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) legacy survey. the angulartwo-point correlation function is calculated for eleven samples with fluxlimits of s_3.6 &gt; 4-400 mujy, over an 8 square degree field. the angularclustering strength is measured at &gt;5-sigma significance at all flux limits,with amplitudes of a=(0.49-29)\times10^{-3} at one degree, for a power-lawmodel, a\theta^{-0.8}. we estimate the redshift distributions of the samplesusing phenomological models, simulations and photometric redshifts, and soderive the spatial correlation lengths. we compare our results with the galics(galaxies in cosmological simulations) models of galaxy evolution and withparameterized models of clustering evolution. the galics simulations areconsistent with our angular correlation functions, but fail to match thespatial clustering inferred from the phenomological models or the photometricredshifts. we find that the uncertainties in the redshift distributions of oursamples dominate the statistical errors in our estimates of the spatialclustering. at low redshifts (median z&lt;0.5) the comoving correlation length isapproximately constant, r_0=6.1\pm0.5h^{-1} mpc, and then decreases withincreasing redshift to a value of 2.9\pm0.3h^{-1} mpc for the faintest sample,for which the median redshift is z=1. we suggest that this trend can beattributed to a decrease in the average galaxy and halo mass in the fainterflux-limited samples, corresponding to changes in the relative numbers ofearly- and late-type galaxies. however, we cannot rule out strong evolution ofthe correlation length over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1212.2650	inferring the mass of sub-millimetre galaxies by exploiting their  gravitational magnification of background galaxies	dust emission at sub-millimetre wavelengths allows us to trace the earlyphases of star formation in the universe. in order to understand the physicalprocesses involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gainknowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses -that sub-millimetre galaxies live in. here we use the magnification effect ofgravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content ofsub-millimetre galaxies with 250mu flux densities of s_250&gt;15mjy selected usingdata from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey. the positions ofhundreds of sub-millimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with thepositions of background lyman-break galaxies at z~3-5 selected using opticaldata from the canada-france hawaii telescope legacy survey. we detect across-correlation signal at the 7-sigma level over a sky area of one squaredegree, with ~80% of this signal being due to magnification, whereas theremaining ~20% comes from dust extinction. adopting some simple assumptions forthe dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us toestimate the average mass of the halos hosting the sub-millimetre galaxies tobe log(m_200/m_sun)=13.17+0.05-0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction(at radii of &gt;10kpc) to be m_dust/m_200~6x10^-5. this supports the picture thatsub-millimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside inmassive group-sized halos, and are a crucial phase in the assembly andevolution of structure in the universe.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1403.0247	imaging the environment of a z = 6.3 submillimeter galaxy with scuba-2	we describe a search for submillimeter emission in the vicinity of one of themost distant, luminous galaxies known, hermes fls3 at z=6.34, exploiting it asa signpost to a potentially biased region of the early universe, as might beexpected in hierarchical structure formation models. imaging to the confusionlimit with the innovative, wide-field submillimeter bolometer camera, scuba-2,we are sensitive to colder and/or less luminous galaxies in the surroundings ofhfls3. we use the millennium simulation to illustrate that hfls3 may beexpected to have companions if it is as massive as claimed, but find nosignificant evidence from the surface density of scuba-2 galaxies in itsvicinity, or their colors, that hfls3 marks an over-density of dusty,star-forming galaxies. we cannot rule out the presence of dusty neighbours withconfidence, but deeper 450-um imaging has the potential to more tightlyconstrain the redshifts of nearby galaxies, at least one of which likely liesat z&gt;~5. if associations with hfls3 can be ruled out, this could be taken asevidence that hfls3 is less biased than a simple extrapolation of themillennium simulation may imply. this could suggest either that it represents arare short-lived, but highly luminous, phase in the evolution of an otherwisetypical galaxy, or that this system has suffered amplification due to aforeground gravitational lens and so is not as intrinsically luminous asclaimed.

1407.4511	linking the x-ray and infrared properties of star-forming galaxies at  z&lt;1.5	we present the most complete study to date of the x-ray emission fromstar-formation in high redshift (median z=0.7; z&lt;1.5), ir-luminous(l_ir=10^10-10^13 l_sun) galaxies detected by herschel's pacs and spireinstruments. for our purpose we take advantage of the deepest x-ray data todate, the chandra deep fields (north and south). sources which host agn areremoved from our analysis by means of multiple agn indicators. we find an agnfraction of 18+/-2 per cent amongst our sample and note that agn entirelydominate at values of log[l_x/l_ir]&gt;-3 in both hard and soft x-ray bands. fromthe sources which are star-formation dominated, only a small fraction areindividually x-ray detected and for the bulk of the sample we calculate averagex-ray luminosities through stacking. we find an average soft x-ray to infraredratio of log[l_sx/l_ir]=-4.3 and an average hard x-ray to infrared ratio oflog[l_hx/l_ir]=-3.8. we report that the x-ray/ir correlation is approximatelylinear through the entire range of l_ir and z probed and, although broadlyconsistent with the local (z&lt;0.1) one, it does display some discrepancies. wesuggest that these discrepancies are unlikely to be physical, i.e. due to anintrinsic change in the x-ray properties of star-forming galaxies with cosmictime, as there is no significant evidence for evolution of the l_x/l_ir ratiowith redshift. instead they are possibly due to selection effects and remainingagn contamination. we also examine whether dust obscuration in the galaxy playsa role in attenuating x-rays from star-formation, by investigating changes inthe l_x/l_ir ratio as a function of the average dust temperature. we concludethat x-rays do not suffer any measurable attenuation in the host galaxy.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

1505.06242	hermes: current cosmic infrared background estimates can be explained by  known galaxies and their faint companions at z &lt; 4	we report contributions to cosmic infrared background (cib) intensitiesoriginating from known galaxies and their faint companions at submillimeterwavelengths. using the publicly-available ultravista catalog, and maps at 250,350, and 500 {\mu}m from the \emph{herschel} multi-tiered extragalactic survey(hermes), we perform a novel measurement that exploits the fact thatuncatalogued sources may bias stacked flux densities --- particularly if theresolution of the image is poor --- and intentionally smooth the images beforestacking and summing intensities. by smoothing the maps we are capturing thecontribution of faint (undetected in k_s ~ 23.4) sources that are physicallyassociated, or correlated, with the detected sources. we find that thecumulative cib increases with increased smoothing, reaching 9.82 +- 0.78, 5.77+- 0.43, and 2.32 +- 0.19$\, \rm nw m^{-2} sr^{-1}$ at 250, 350, and 500 {\mu}mat 300 arcsec fwhm. this corresponds to a fraction of the fiducial cib of 0.94+- 0.23, 1.07 +- 0.31, and 0.97 +- 0.26 at 250, 350, and 500 {\mu}m, where theuncertainties are dominated by those of the absolute cib. we then propose, witha simple model combining parametric descriptions for stacked flux densities andstellar mass functions, that emission from galaxies with log(m/msun) &gt; 8.5 canaccount for the most of the measured total intensities, and argue againstcontributions from extended, diffuse emission. finally, we discuss prospectsfor future survey instruments to improve the estimates of the absolute ciblevels, and observe any potentially remaining emission at z &gt; 4.

1507.00005	dust attenuation in z $\sim$ 1 galaxies from herschel and 3d-hst  h$\alpha$ measurements	we combined the spectroscopic information from the 3d-hst survey with\textit{herschel} data to characterize the h$\alpha$ dust attenuationproperties of a sample of 79 main sequence star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 1$in the goods-s field. the sample was selected in the far-ir, at $\lambda$=100and/or 160 $\mu$m, and only includes galaxies with a secure h$\alpha$ detection(s/n$&gt;$3). from the low resolution 3d-hst spectra we measured the redshifts andthe h$\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to theobserved fluxes to remove the [nii] contamination). the stellar masses(m$_{\star}$), infrared (l$_{ir}$) and uv luminosities (l$_{uv}$) were derivedfrom the seds by fitting multi-band data from galex near-uv to spire 500$\mu$m. we estimated the continuum extinction e$_{star}$(b-v) from both theirx=l$_{ir}$/l$_{uv}$ ratio and the uv-slope, $\beta$, and found an excellentagreement between the two. the nebular extinction was estimated from comparisonof the observed sfr$_{h\alpha}$ and sfr$_{uv}$. we obtained\emph{f}=e$_{star}$(b-v)/e$_{neb}$(b-v)=0.93$\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than thecanonical value of \emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local universe. our deriveddust correction produces good agreement between the h$\alpha$ and ir+uv sfrsfor galaxies with sfr$\gtrsim$ 20 m$_{\odot}$/yr and m$_{\star} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, while objects with lower sfr and m$_{\star}$ seemto require a smaller \emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher h$\alpha$ extinctioncorrection). our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sampleis comparable to that in the optical-uv continuum and suggest that the\emph{f}-factor is a function of both m$_{\star}$ and sfr, in agreement withprevious studies.

1507.07044	hermes: disentangling active galactic nuclei and star formation in the  radio source population	we separate the extragalactic radio source population above ~50 ujy intoactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star-forming sources. the primary method ofour approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed using spitzer/irac and mips and herschel/spire photometry, of 380radio sources in the extended chandra deep field-south. from the fitted seds,we determine the relative agn and star-forming contributions to their infraredemission. with the inclusion of other agn diagnostics such as x-ray luminosity,spitzer/irac colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming totalinfrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 ghz flux density, qir, we determine whetherthe radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an agn.the majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an agnat some wavelength. of the sources with agn signatures, 58 per cent are hybridsystems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. thisimplies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their starformation have a high agn fraction. below a 1.4 ghz flux density of 1 mjy,along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from purestar-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent ofthe sources. this result suggests that hybrid sources have a significantcontribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable agn, to theobserved flattening of the source counts at ~1mjy for the extragalactic radiosource population.

astro-ph;0012027	predicting the peculiar velocities of nearby psc-z galaxies using the  least action principle	we use the least action principle to predict the peculiar velocities of psc-zgalaxies inside $cz=2000$\km. linear theory is used to account for tidaleffects to $cz=15000$\km, and we iterate galaxy positions to account forredshift distortions. as the least action principle is valid beyond lineartheory, we can predict reliable peculiar velocities even for very nearbygalaxies (ie $cz \leq 500$\km). these predicted peculiar velocities are thencompared with the observed velocities of 12 galaxies with cepheid distances.the combination of the psc-z galaxy survey (with its large sky coverage anduniform selection), with the accurate cepheid distances, makes this comparisonrelatively free from systematic effects. we find that galaxies are good tracersof the mass, even at small ($\leq 10$\mpc) scales; and under the assumption ofno biasing, $0.25 \leq \beta \leq 0.75$ (at 90% confidence). we use thereliable predicted peculiar velocities to estimate the hubble constant \ho fromthe local volume without ``stepping up'' the distance ladder, finding aconfidence range of 65-75\kmm (at 90% confidence).

astro-ph;0108400	the coincidence and angular clustering of chandra and scuba sources	we explore the relationship between the hard x-ray and sub-mm populationsusing deep chandra observations of a large, contiguous scuba survey. inagreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap issmall. of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only oneis coincident with a chandra source. the resulting limits imply that themajority of scuba sources are not powered by agn, unless the central engine isobscured by compton-thick material with a low (&lt;1 per cent) scatteredcomponent. furthermore, since chandra detects only ~5 per cent of scubasources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. the x-rayupper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburstsed at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of scuba sources lie at z&gt;1even if they are purely starburst galaxies. despite the low detection rate, wefind evidence for strong angular clustering between the x-ray and sub-mmpopulations. the implication is that agn and scuba sources trace the samelarge-scale structure but do not generally coincide. if bright sub-mm sourcesrepresent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for agiven galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from theperiod of observable quasar activity.

astro-ph;0602252	the eso-spitzer imaging extragalactic survey (esis) i: wfi b,v,r deep  observations of elais-s1 and comparison to spitzer and galex data	the eso-spitzer extragalactic imaging survey (esis) is the optical follow upof the spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic (swire) survey in the elais-s1area. this paper presents b, v, r wide field imager observations of the first1.5 square degree of the esis survey. data reduction is described includingastrometric calibration, illumination and color corrections, completeness andphotometric accuracy estimates. number counts and color distributions arecompared to literature observational and theoretical data, includingnon-evolutionary, ple, evolutionary and semi-analytic lambda-cdm galaxy models,as well as milky way stellar predictions. esis data are in good agreement withprevious works and are best reproduced by evolutionary and hierarchicallambda-cdm scenarios. the elais-s1 area benefits from extensive follow-up fromx-ray to radio frequencies: some potential uses of the multi-wavelengthobservations are illustrated. optical-spitzer color-color plots promise to bevery powerful tools to disentangle different classes of sources (e.g. agns,starbursts, quiescent galaxies). ultraviolet galex data are matched to opticaland spitzer samples, leading to a discussion of galaxy properties in theuv-to-24 microns color space. the spectral energy distribution of a fewobjects, from the x-rays to the far-ir are presented as examples of themulti-wavelength study of galaxy emission components in different spectraldomains.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

astro-ph;9712228	the topology of the iras point source catalogue redshift survey	we investigate the topology of the new point source catalogue redshift survey(pscz) of iras galaxies by means of the genus statistic. the survey maps thelocal universe with approximately 15000 galaxies over 84.1 per cent of the skyand provides an unprecedented number of resolution elements for the topologicalanalysis. for comparison with the pscz data we also examine the genus of largen-body simulations of four variants of the cold dark matter cosmogony. thesimulations are part of the virgo project to simulate the formation ofstructure in the universe. we assume that the statistical properties of thegalaxy distribution can be identified with those of the dark matter particlesin the simulations. we extend the standard genus analysis by examining theinfluence of sampling noise on the genus curve and introducing a statistic ableto quantify the amount of phase correlation present in the density field, the"amplitude drop" of the genus compared to a gaussian field with identical powerspectrum. the results for pscz are consistent with the hypothesis ofrandom-phase initial conditions. in particular, no strong phase correlation isdetected on scales ranging from 10 h^(-1)mpc to 32 h^(-1)mpc, whereas there isa positive detection of phase correlation at smaller scales. among thesimulations, phase correlations are detected in all models at small scales,albeit with different strengths. when scaled to a common normalization, theamplitude drop primarily depends on the shape of the power spectrum. we findthat the constant bias standard cdm model can be ruled out at high significancebecause the shape of its power spectrum is not consistent with pscz. the othercdm models with more large-scale power all fit the pscz data almost equallywell, with a slight preference for a high-density taucdm model.

astro-ph;9912223	the iras pscz dipole	we use the pscz iras galaxy redshift survey to analyze the cosmologicalgalaxy dipole out to a distance 300 h$^{-1}$ mpc. the masked area is filled inthree different ways, firstly by sampling the whole sky at random, secondly byusing neighbouring areas to fill a masked region, and thirdly using a sphericalharmonic analysis. the method of treatment of the mask is found to have asignificant effect on the final calculated dipole.  the conversion from redshift space to real space is accomplished by using ananalytical model of the cluster and void distribution, based on 88 nearbygroups, 854 clusters and 163 voids, with some of the clusters and all of thevoids found from the pscz database.  the dipole for the whole pscz sample appears to have converged within adistance of 200 $h^{-1}$mpc and yields a value for $\beta = \omega^{0.6}/b$ =0.75 (+0.11,-0.08), consistent with earlier determinations from iras samples bya variety of methods. for b = 1, the $2-\sigma$ range for $\omega_{o}$ is0.43-1.02.  the direction of the dipole is within 13$^o$ of the cmb dipole, the mainuncertainty in direction being associated with the masked area behind thegalactic plane. the improbability that further major contributions to thedipole amplitude will come from volumes larger than those surveyed here meansthat the question of the origin of the cmb dipole is essentially resolved.

astro-ph;9912231	starburst galaxies and structure in the submillimetre background towards  the hubble deep field	we use an 850-micron scuba map of the hdf to study the dust properties ofoptically-selected starburst galaxies at high redshift. although the 850-micronmap does not allow detection of the majority of individual sources, we showthat the galaxies with the highest uv star-formation rates are detectedstatistically, with a flux density of about s_{850}=0.2 mjy for an apparent uvstar-formation rate of 1 h^{-2} msun yr^{-1}. this level of submillimetreoutput indicates that the total star-forming activity is on average a factor ofapproximately 6 times larger than the rate inferred from the uv output of thesegalaxies. the general population of optical starbursts is then predicted tocontribute at least 25 per cent of the 850-micron background. we carry out apower-spectrum analysis of the map, which yields some evidence for angularclustering of the background source population, but at a level lower than thatseen in lyman-break galaxies. together with other lines of argument,particularly from the nicmos hdf data, this suggests that the 850-micronbackground originates over an extremely wide range of redshifts -- perhaps 1 &lt;z &lt; 6.
