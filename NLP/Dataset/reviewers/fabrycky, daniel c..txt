0901.4328	on the triple origin of blue stragglers	blue straggler stars (bsss) are stars observed to be hotter and bluer thanother stars with the same luminosity in their environment. as such they appearto be much younger than the rest of the stellar population. two main channelshave been suggested to produce such stars: (1) collisions between stars inclusters or (2) mass transfer between, or merger of, the components ofprimordial short-period binaries. here we suggest a third scenario, in whichthe progenitor of bsss are formed in primordial (or dynamically formed)hierarchical triple stars. in such configurations the dynamical evolution ofthe triples through the kozai mechanism and tidal friction can induce theformation of very close inner binaries. angular momentum loss in a magnetizedwind or stellar evolution could then lead to the merger of these binaries (orto mass transfer between them) and produce bsss in binary (or triple) systems.we study this mechanism and its implications and show that it could naturallyexplain many of the characteristics of the bss population in clusters, mostnotably the large binary fraction of long period bss binaries; their uniqueperiod-eccentricity distribution (with typical periods &gt; 700 days); and thetypical location of these bsss in the color-magnitude diagram, far from thecluster turn-off point of their host clusters. we suggest that this scenariohas a major (possibly dominant) role in the formation of bsss in open clustersand give specific predictions for the the bsss population formed in thismanner. we also note that triple systems may be the progenitors of thebrightest planetary nebulae in old elliptical galaxies, which possibly evolvedfrom bsss.

0902.0737	exoplanetary spin-orbit alignment: results from the ensemble of  rossiter-mclaughlin observations	one possible diagnostic of planet formation, orbital migration, and tidalevolution is the angle psi between a planet's orbital axis and the spin axis ofits parent star. in general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planetsone can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axesvia the rossiter-mclaughlin effect. here, we show how to combine measurementsof lambda in different systems to derive statistical constraints on psi. weapply the method to 11 published measurements of lambda, using two differentsingle-parameter distributions to describe the ensemble. first, assuming arayleigh distribution (or more precisely, a fisher distribution on a sphere),we find that the peak value is less than 22 degrees with 95% confidence.second, assuming a fraction f of the orbits have random orientations relativeto the stars, and the remaining fraction (1-f) are perfectly aligned, we findf&lt;0.36 with 95% confidence. this latter model fits the data better than therayleigh distribution, mainly because the xo-3 system was found to be stronglymisaligned while the other 10 systems are consistent with perfect alignment. ifthe xo-3 result proves robust, then our results may be interpreted as evidencefor two distinct modes of planet migration.

1005.4050	radial velocity planets de-aliased. a new, short period for super-earth  55 cnc e	radial velocity measurements of stellar reflex motion have revealed manyextrasolar planets, but gaps in the observations produce aliases, spuriousfrequencies that are frequently confused with the planets' orbital frequencies.in the case of gl 581 d, the distinction between an alias and the truefrequency was the distinction between a frozen, dead planet and a planetpossibly hospitable to life (udry et al. 2007; mayor et al. 2009). to improvethe characterization of planetary systems, we describe how aliases originateand present a new approach for distinguishing between orbital frequencies andtheir aliases. our approach harnesses features in the spectral window functionto compare the amplitude and phase of predicted aliases with peaks present inthe data. we apply it to confirm prior alias distinctions for the planets gj876 d and hd 75898 b. we find that the true periods of gl 581 d and hd 73526b/c remain ambiguous. we revise the periods of hd 156668 b and 55 cnc e, whichwere afflicted by daily aliases. for hd 156668 b, the correct period is 1.2699days and minimum mass is (3.1 +/- 0.4) earth masses. for 55 cnc e, the correctperiod is 0.7365 days -- the shortest of any known planet -- and minimum massis (8.3 +/- 0.3) earth masses. this revision produces a significantly improved5-planet keplerian fit for 55 cnc, and a self-consistent dynamical fitdescribes the data just as well. as radial velocity techniques push toever-smaller planets, often found in systems of multiple planets,distinguishing true periods from aliases will become increasingly important.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1102.0543	architecture and dynamics of kepler's candidate multiple transiting  planet systems	about one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in thefirst four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. thereare 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8with four, and one each with five and six. we characterize the dynamicalproperties of these candidate multi-planet systems. the distribution ofobserved period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs areneither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. nonetheless, there aresmall but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both inresonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularlynear the 2:1 resonance. we find that virtually all candidate systems arestable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radiusrelationship. several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority ofthese multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. using the observedmultiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systemsthat matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number ofsingly-transiting systems. we provide constraints on the true multiplicity andmutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing apopulation of systems with multiple super-earth-size and neptune-size planetswith low to moderate mutual inclinations.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1107.2106	using star spots to measure the spin-orbit alignment of transiting  planets	spectroscopic follow-up of dozens of transiting planets has revealed thedegree of alignment between the equators of stars and the orbits of the planetsthey host. here we determine a method, applicable to spotted stars, that canreveal the same information from the photometric discovery data, with no needfor follow-up. a spot model fit to the global light curve, parametrized by thespin orientation of the star, predicts when the planet will transit the spots.observing several spot crossings during different transits then leads toconstraints on the spin-orbit alignment. in cases where stellar spots aresmall, the stellar inclination, and hence the true alignment, rather than justthe sky projection, can be obtained. this method has become possible with theadvent of space telescopes such as corot and kepler, which photometricallymonitor transiting planets over a nearly continuous, long time baseline. weapply our method to corot-2, and find the projected spin-orbit alignment angle,lambda= 4.7 deg +/- 12.3 deg, in excellent agreement with a previousdetermination that employed the rossiter-mclaughlin effect. the large spots ofthe parent star, corot-2, limit our precision on the stellar inclination: i_s =84 deg +/- 36 deg, where i_s &lt; 90 deg (&gt; 90 deg) indicates the rotation axis istilted towards (away from) the line of sight.

1111.0297	on the misalignment of the directly imaged planet {\beta} pictoris b  with the system's warped inner disk	the vertical warp in the debris disk beta pictoris -- an inclined inner diskextending into a flat outer disk -- has long been interpreted as the signpostof a planet on an inclined orbit. direct images spanning 2004-2010 haverevealed beta pictoris b, a planet with a mass and orbital distance consistentwith this picture. however, it was recently reported that the orbit of planet bis aligned with the flat outer disk, not the inclined inner disk, and thuslacks the inclination to warp the disk. we explore three scenarios forreconciling the apparent misalignment of the directly imaged planet betapictoris b with the warped inner disk of beta pictoris: observationaluncertainty, an additional planet, and damping of planet b's inclination. wefind that, at the extremes of the uncertainties, the orbit of beta pictoris bhas the inclination necessary to produce the observed warp. we also find thatif planet b were aligned with the flat outer disk, it would prevent anotherplanet from creating a warp with the observed properties; therefore planet bitself must be responsible for the warp. finally, planet b's inclination couldhave been damped by dynamical friction and still produce the observed diskmorphology, but the feasibility of damping depends on disk properties and thepresence of other planets. more precise observations of the orbit of planet band the position angle of the outer disk will allow us to distinguish betweenthe first and third scenario.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1206.5579	the photoeccentric effect and proto-hot jupiters ii. koi-1474.01, a  candidate eccentric planet perturbed by an unseen companion	the exoplanets known as hot jupiters---jupiter-sized planets with periodsless than 10 days---likely are relics of dynamical processes that shape allplanetary system architectures. socrates et al. (2012) argued that higheccentricity migration (hem) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-inplanets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hotjupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. hem should also createfailed-hot jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fastcircularization. using the technique we previously presented for measuringeccentricities from photometry (the "photoeccentric effect"), we are distillinga collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot jupiters from the keplerobjects of interest (koi). here we present the first, koi-1474.01, which has along orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot jupiter boundary. combining keplerphotometry, ground-based spectroscopy, and stellar evolution models, wecharacterize host koi-1474 as a rapidly-rotating f-star. statistical argumentsreveal that the transiting candidate has a low false-positive probability of3.1%. koi-1474.01 also exhibits transit timing variations of order an hour. weexplore characteristics of the third-body perturber, which is possibly the"smoking-gun" cause of koi-1474.01's large eccentricity. using the host-star'srotation period, radius, and projected rotational velocity, we findkoi-1474.01's orbit is marginally consistent with aligned with the stellar spinaxis, although a reanalysis is warranted with future additional data. finally,we discuss how the number and existence of proto-hot jupiters will not onlydemonstrate that hot jupiters migrate via hem, but also shed light on thetypical timescale for the mechanism.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

1208.3499	transit timing observations from kepler: vii. confirmation of 27 planets  in 13 multiplanet systems via transit timing variations and orbital stability	we confirm 27 planets in 13 planetary systems by showing the existence ofstatistically significant anti-correlated transit timing variations (ttvs),which demonstrates that the planet candidates are in the same system, andlong-term dynamical stability, which places limits on the masses of thecandidates---showing that they are planetary. %this overall method of planetconfirmation was first applied to \kepler systems 23 through 32. all of thesenewly confirmed planetary systems have orbital periods that place them nearfirst-order mean motion resonances (mmrs), including 6 systems near the 2:1mmr, 5 near 3:2, and one each near 4:3, 5:4, and 6:5. in addition, severalunconfirmed planet candidates exist in some systems (that cannot be confirmedwith this method at this time). a few of these candidates would also be nearfirst order mmrs with either the confirmed planets or with other candidates.one system of particular interest, kepler-56 (koi-1241), is a pair of planetsorbiting a 12th magnitude, giant star with radius over three times that of thesun and effective temperature of 4900 k---among the largest stars known to hosta transiting exoplanetary system.

1208.3712	the neptune-sized circumbinary planet kepler-38b	we discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planetkepler-38b. the stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, andconsists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (m_a = 0.949 +/- 0.059solar masses and r_a = 1.757 +/- 0.034 solar radii) paired with a low-mass star(m_b = 0.249 +/- 0.010 solar masses and r_b = 0.2724 +/- 0.0053 solar radii) ina mildly eccentric (e=0.103) orbit. a total of eight transits due to acircumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the keplerlight curve (using kepler quarters 1 through 11), from which a planetary periodof 105.595 +/- 0.053 days can be established. a photometric dynamical model fitto the radial velocity curve and kepler light curve yields a planetary radiusof 4.35 +/- 0.11 earth radii, or 1.12 +/- 0.03 neptune radii. since the planetis not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary fromkeplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of122 earth masses (7.11 neptune masses or 0.384 jupiter masses) at 95%confidence. this upper limit should decrease as more kepler data becomeavailable.

1210.4592	photometrically derived masses and radii of the planet and star in the  tres-2 system	we measure the mass and radius of the star and planet in the tres-2 systemusing 2.7 years of observations by the kepler spacecraft. the light curve showsevidence for ellipsoidal variations and doppler beaming on a period consistentwith the orbital period of the planet with amplitudes of 2.79+0.44-0.62 and3.44+0.32-0.37 parts per million (ppm) respectively, and a difference betweenthe day and night side planetary flux of 3.41+0.55-0.82 ppm. we present anasteroseismic analysis of solar-like oscillations on tres-2a which we use tocalculate the stellar mass of 0.94+/-0.05 msun and radius of 0.95+/-0.02 rsun.using these stellar parameters, a transit model fit and the phase curvevariations, we determine the planetary radius of 1.162+0.020-0.024 rjup andderive a mass for tres-2b from the photometry of 1.44+/-0.21 mjup. the ratio ofthe ellipsoidal variation to the doppler beaming amplitudes agrees to betterthan 2{\sigma} with theoretical predications, while our measured planet massand radius agree within 2-{\sigma} of previously published values based onspectroscopic radial velocity measurements. we measure a geometric albedo of0.0136+0.0022-0.0033 and an occultation (secondary eclipse) depth of6.5+1.7-1.8 ppm which we combined with the day/night planetary flux ratio tomodel the atmosphere of tres-2b. we find an atmosphere model that contains atemperature inversion is strongly preferred. we hypothesize that the keplerbandpass probes a significantly greater atmospheric depth on the night siderelative to the day side.

1211.7065	banana iv: two aligned stellar rotation axes in the young eccentric  binary system ep crucis: primordial orientation and tidal alignment	with observations of the ep cru system, we continue our series ofmeasurements of spin-orbit angles in eclipsing binary star systems, the bananaproject (binaries are not always neatly aligned). we find a close alignmentbetween the sky projections of the rotational and orbital angular momentumvectors for both stars (beta_p = -1.8+-1.6 deg and |beta_s|&lt;17 deg). we alsoderive precise absolute dimensions and stellar ages for this system. the ep cruand di her systems provide an interesting comparison: they have similar stellartypes and orbital properties, but di her is younger and has major spin-orbitmisalignments, raising the question of whether ep cru also had a largemisalignment at an earlier phase of evolution. we show that tidal dissipationis an unlikely explanation for the good alignment observed today, becauserealignment happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, andthe stars in ep cru are far from syncrhonization (they are spinning 9 times tooquickly). therefore it seems that some binaries form with aligned axes, whileother superficially similar binaries are formed with misaligned axes.

1301.0023	characterizing the cool kois iv: kepler-32 as a prototype for the  formation of compact planetary systems throughout the galaxy	the kepler space telescope has opened new vistas in exoplanet discovery spaceby revealing populations of earth-sized planets that provide a new context forunderstanding planet formation. approximately 70% of all stars in the galaxybelong to the diminutive m dwarf class, several thousand of which lie withinkepler's field of view, and a large number of these targets show planet transitsignals. kepler-32 is a typical star in the kepler m dwarf sample that presentsus with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star giving us anexpansive view of its architecture. all five planets of this compact systemorbit their host star within a distance one third the size of mercury's orbitwith the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellarphotosphere. new observations limit possible false positive scenarios allowingus to validate the entire kepler-32 system making it the richest known systemof transiting planets around an m dwarf. based on considerations of the stellardust sublimation radius, the near period commensurability of three adjacentplanets, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the volatile contentinferred for the planets, we propose that the kepler-32 planets formed atlarger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. thevolatile content inferred for the kepler-32 planets and order of magnitudeestimates for the disk migration rates suggest these planets may have formedbeyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. thekepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidatesorbiting the kepler m dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0+/- 0.1 planet per star. the formation of the kepler-32 planets thereforeoffers a plausible blueprint for the formation of one of the largest knownpopulations of planets in our galaxy.

1301.5499	transit timing observations from kepler. viii catalog of transit timing  measurements of the first twelve quarters	following ford et al. (2011, 2012) and steffen et al.

1303.0227	all six planets known to orbit kepler-11 have low densities	the kepler-11 planetary system contains six transiting planets ranging insize from 1.8 to 4.2 times the radius of earth. five of these planets orbit ina tightly-packed configuration with periods between 10 and 47 days. we performa dynamical analysis of the system based upon transit timing variationsobserved in more than three years of \ik photometric data. stellar parametersare derived using a combination of spectral classification and constraints onthe star's density derived from transit profiles together with planetaryeccentricity vectors provided by our dynamical study. combining masses of theplanets relative to the star from our dynamical study and radii of the planetsrelative to the star from transit depths together with deduced stellarproperties yields measurements of the radii of all six planets, masses of thefive inner planets, and an upper bound to the mass of the outermost planet,whose orbital period is 118 days. we find mass-radius combinations for all sixplanets that imply that substantial fractions of their volumes are occupied byconstituents that are less dense than rock. the kepler-11 system contains thelowest mass exoplanets for which both mass and radius have been measured.

1303.2150	the mass of koi-94d and a relation for planet radius, mass, and incident  flux	we measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, koi-94d. we wishto determine whether this planet, which is in a 22-day orbit and receives 2700times as much incident flux as jupiter, is as dense as jupiter or rarefied likeinflated hot jupiters. koi-94 also hosts 3 smaller transiting planets, all ofwhich were detected by the kepler mission. with 26 radial velocities of koi-94from the w. m. keck observatory and a simultaneous fit to the kepler lightcurve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is notinflated. support for the planetary interpretation of the other threecandidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timingvariations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against falsepositives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within thephotometric aperture. the radial velocity analyses of koi-94b and koi-94e offermarginal (&gt;2\sigma) mass detections, whereas the observations of koi-94c offeronly an upper limit to its mass. using the koi-94 system and other planets withpublished values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35with m &lt; 150 earth masses), we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanetsthat relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few earth masses up toten jupiter masses. these equations can be used to predict the radius or massof a planet.

1309.1177	a habitable zone census via transit timing and the imperative for  continuing to observe the kepler field	we propose a scientific program to complete a census of planets,characterizing their masses, orbital properties, and dynamical histories usingcontinued observations of the kepler field of view with the kepler spacecraftin a two reaction wheel mission. even with a significantly reduced photometricprecision, extending time-domain observations of this field is uniquely capableof pursuing several critical science goals: 1) measuring the architectures ofplanetary systems by identifying non-transiting planets interleaved among knowntransiting planets, 2) establishing the mass-radius relationship for planets inthe important transition region between small, gas-rich sub-neptune planets andlarge, rocky super-earths, and 3) uncovering dynamical evidence of theformation and evolution of the inner regions of planetary systems. to meetthese objectives, the unique multi-object observing capabilities of kepler willbe used in a set of concurrent campaigns with specific motivations. thesecampaigns focus largely on the ability to interpret transit timing variations(ttvs) that result from dynamical interactions among planets in a system andinclude: 1) observations of systems that exhibit large ttvs and areparticularly rich in dynamical information, 2) observations of systems whereadditional transit times will yield mass measurements of the constituentplanets, 3) observations of systems where the ttv signal evolves over very longtimescales, and 4) observations of systems with long-period planet candidateswhere additional transits will remove orbital period ambiguities caused by gapsin the original kepler data.

1403.0583	the banana project. v. misaligned and precessing stellar rotation axes  in cv velorum	as part of the banana project (binaries are not always neatly aligned), wehave found that the eclipsing binary cv velorum has misaligned rotation axes.based on our analysis of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, we find sky-projectedspin-orbit angles of $\beta_{\rm p} = -52\pm6^{\circ}$ and $\beta_{\rm s}=3\pm7^{\circ}$ for the primary and secondary stars (b2.5v $+$ b2.5v, $p=6.9$d). we combine this information with several measurements of changing projectedstellar rotation speeds ($v \sin i_{\star}$) over the last $30$ years, leadingto a model in which the primary star's obliquity is $\approx65^{\circ}$, andits spin axis precesses around the total angular momentum vector with a periodof about $140$ years. the geometry of the secondary star is less clear,although a significant obliquity is also implicated by the observed timevariations in the $v \sin i_{\star}$. by integrating the secular tidalevolution equations backward in time, we find that the system could haveevolved from a state of even stronger misalignment similar to di herculis, ayounger but otherwise comparable binary.

1404.4992	strong dependence of the inner edge of the habitable zone on planetary  rotation rate	planetary rotation rate is a key parameter in determining atmosphericcirculation and hence the spatial pattern of clouds. since clouds can exert adominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could becritical for determining mean planetary climate. here we investigate this ideausing a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloudscheme. we find that slowly rotating planets (like venus) can maintain anearth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets(like earth). this suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be toohot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. theexplanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weakcoriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergenceand convection in the substellar region. this produces a large area ofoptically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. incontrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form inthe deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. a particularly strikingexample of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is thata planet with modern earth's atmosphere, in venus' orbit, and with modernvenus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable. this would imply that if venuswent through a runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time.

1405.5223	mergers and obliquities in stellar triples	many close stellar binaries are accompanied by a far-away star. the"eccentric kozai-lidov" (ekl) mechanism can cause dramatic inclination andeccentricity fluctuations, resulting in tidal tightening of inner binaries oftriple stars. we run a large set of monte-carlo simulations including thesecular evolution of the orbits, general relativistic precession and tides, andwe determine the semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination and spin-orbit angledistributions of the final configurations. we find that the efficiency offorming tight binaries (&lt;~16 d) when taking the ekl mechanism into account is ~21%, and about 4% of all simulated systems ended up in a merger event. thesemerger events can lead to the formation of blue-stragglers. furthermore, wefind that the spin-orbit angle distribution of the inner binaries carries asignature of the initial setup of the system, thus observations can be used todisentangle close binaries' birth configuration. the resulting inner and outerfinal orbits' period distributions, and their estimated fraction, suggestssecular dynamics may be a significant channel for the formation of closebinaries in triples and even blue stragglers.

1405.5229	large eccentricity, low mutual inclination: the three-dimensional  architecture of a hierarchical system of giant planets	we establish the three-dimensional architecture of the kepler-419 (previouslykoi-1474) system to be eccentric yet with a low mutual inclination. kepler-419bis a warm jupiter at semi-major axis a = 0.370 +0.007/-0.006 au with a largeeccentricity e=0.85 +0.08/-0.07 measured via the "photoeccentric effect." itexhibits transit timing variations induced by the non-transiting kepler-419c,which we uniquely constrain to be a moderately eccentric (e=0.184 +/- 0.002),hierarchically-separated (a=1.68 +/- 0.03 au) giant planet (7.3 +/- 0.4 mjup).we combine sixteen quarters of kepler photometry, radial-velocity (rv)measurements from the high resolution echelle spectrometer (hires) on keck, andimproved stellar parameters that we derive from spectroscopy andasteroseismology. from the rvs, we measure the mass of inner planet to be2.5+/-0.3mjup and confirm its photometrically-measured eccentricity, refiningthe value to e=0.83+/-0.01. the rv acceleration is consistent with theproperties of the outer planet derived from ttvs. we find that, despite theirsizable eccentricities, the planets are coplanar to within 9 +8/-6 degrees, andtherefore the inner planet's large eccentricity and close-in orbit are unlikelyto be the result of kozai migration. moreover, even over many secular cycles,the inner planet's periapse is most likely never small enough for tidalcircularization. finally, we present and measure a transit time and impactparameter from four simultaneous ground-based light curves from 1m-classtelescopes, demonstrating the feasibility of ground-based follow-up of keplergiant planets exhibiting large ttvs.

1409.1605	kic 9632895 - the 10th kepler transiting circumbinary planet	we present the discovery of kic 9632895b, a 6.2 earth-radius planet in alow-eccentricity, 240.5-day orbit about an eclipsing binary. the binary itselfconsists of a 0.93 and 0.194 solar mass pair of stars with an orbital period of27.3 days. the plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and itsinclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in thelatter portion of the kepler data. thus three transits are present in thelatter half of the light curve, but none of the three conjunctions thatoccurred during the first half of the light curve produced transits. theprecession period is ~103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visibleonly ~8% of the time. this has the important implication that for every systemlike kic 9632895 that we detect, there are ~12 circumbinary systems that existbut are not currently exhibiting transits. the planet's mass is too small tonoticeably perturb the binary, consequently its mass is not measurable withthese data; but our photodynamical model places a 1-sigma upper limit of 16earth masses. with a period 8.8 times that of the binary, the planet is welloutside the dynamical instability zone. it does, however, lie within thehabitable zone of the binary, and making it the third of ten keplercircumbinary planets to do so.

1505.05749	no circumbinary planets transiting the tightest kepler binaries - a  possible fingerprint of a third star	the kepler mission has yielded the discovery of eight circumbinary systems,all found around eclipsing binaries with periods greater than 7 d. this islonger than the typical eclipsing binary period found by kepler, and hencethere is a dearth of planets around the closest binaries. in this paper wesuggest how this dearth may be explained by the presence of a distant stellartertiary companion, which shrunk the inner binary orbit by the process of kozaicycles and tidal friction, a mechanism that has been implicated for producingmost binaries with periods below 7 d. we show that the geometry and orbitaldynamics of these evolving triple-star systems are highly restrictive for acircumbinary planet, which is subject itself to kozai modulation, on one hand,and can shield the two inner stars from their kozai cycle and subsequentshrinking, on the other hand. only small planets on wide and inclined orbitsmay form, survive and allow for the inner binary shrinkage. those are difficultto detect.

1506.07067	the mass of the mars-sized exoplanet kepler-138 b from transit timing	extrasolar planets that pass in front of their host star (transit) cause atemporary decrease in the apparent brightness of the star once per orbit,providing a direct measure of the planet's size and orbital period. in somesystems with multiple transiting planets, the times of the transits aremeasurably affected by the gravitational interactions between neighbouringplanets. in favorable cases, the departures from keplerian orbits implied bythe observed transit times permit planetary masses to be measured, which is keyto determining bulk densities. characterizing rocky planets is particularlydifficult, since they are generally smaller and less massive than gaseousplanets. thus, few exoplanets near earth's size have had their masses measured.here we report the sizes and masses of three planets orbiting kepler-138, astar much fainter and cooler than the sun. we measure the mass of themars-sized inner planet based on on the transit times of its neighbour andthereby provide the first density measurement for an exoplanet smaller thanearth. the middle and outer planets are both slightly larger than earth. themiddle planet's density is similar to that of earth, while the outer planet isless than half as dense, implying that it contains a greater portion of lowdensity components such as h2o and/or h2.

1509.07514	astrometric confirmation and preliminary orbital parameters of the young  exoplanet 51 eridani b with the gemini planet imager	we present new gemini planet imager observations of the young exoplanet 51eridani b which provide further evidence that the companion is physicallyassociated with 51 eridani. combining this new astrometric measurement withthose reported in the literature, we significantly reduce the posteriorprobability that 51 eridani b is an unbound foreground or background t-dwarf ina chance alignment with 51 eridani to $2\times10^{-7}$, an order of magnitudelower than previously reported. if 51 eridani b is indeed a bound object, thenwe have detected orbital motion of the planet between the discovery epoch andthe latest epoch. by implementing a computationally efficient monte carlotechnique, preliminary constraints are placed on the orbital parameters of thesystem. the current set of astrometric measurements suggest an orbitalsemimajor axis of $14^{+7}_{-3}$ au, corresponding to a period of$41^{+35}_{-12}$ years (assuming a mass of $1.75$ $m_{\odot}$ for the centralstar), and an inclination of $138^{+15}_{-13}$ deg. the remaining orbitalelements are only marginally constrained by the current measurements. thesepreliminary values suggest an orbit which does not share the same inclinationas the orbit of the distant m-dwarf binary, gj 3305, which is a wide physicallybound companion to 51 eridani.

0806.4314	what to expect from transiting multiplanet systems	so far radial velocity (rv) measurements have discovered ~25 stars to hostmultiple planets. the statistics imply that many of the known hosts oftransiting planets should have additional planets, yet none have been solidlydetected. they will be soon, via complementary search methods of rv,transit-time variations (ttv) of the known planet, and transits of theadditional planet. when they are found, what can transit measurements add tostudies of multiplanet dynamical evolution? first, mutual inclinations becomemeasurable, for comparison to the solar system's disk-like configuration. suchmeasurements will give important constraints to planet-planet scatteringmodels, just as the rv measurements of eccentricity have done. second, therossiter-mclaughlin effect measures stellar obliquity, which can be modified bytwo-planet dynamics with a tidally evolving inner planet. third, ttv isexquisitely sensitive to planets in mean motion resonance. two planetsdifferentially migrating in the disk can establish such resonances, and tidalevolution of the planets can break them, so the configuration and frequency ofthese resonances as a function of planetary parameters will constrain theseprocesses.

astro-ph;0703418	cassini states with dissipation: why obliquity tides cannot inflate hot  jupiters	some short-period exoplanets (hot jupiters) are observed by their transits tohave anomalously large radii. it has been suggested that these planets are in aresonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of theirspin and orbital angular momenta, a cassini state, and that the attendant tidalheating inflates the planet. we argue against this. using explicit tidalintegrations, we show that although an oblique cassini state can dissipate manytimes the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be muchless than hypothesized. dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at anangle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. ifdissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that cassini equilibriumis lost. a separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extractedfrom the orbit. the source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parentstar or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angularmomentum shed by the planet. alignment removes the orbital precession requiredby the cassini state. in combination with observational bounds on the mass andsemimajor axis of a possible second planet and with bounds on the stellarrotation and obliquity, these constraints make it very unlikely that obliquitytides can be the explanation for inflated hot jupiters, especially hd 209458b.

0812.0011	stability of the directly imaged multiplanet system hr 8799: resonance  and masses	a new era of directly imaged extrasolar planets has produced a three-planetsystem (marois et al. 2008), where the masses of the planets have beenestimated by untested cooling models. we point out that the nominal circular,face-on orbits of the planets lead to a dynamical instability in ~10^5 yr, afactor of at least 100 shorter than the estimated age of the star. reducedplanetary masses produce stability only for unreasonably small planets (&lt;~2 m_jup). relaxing the face-on assumption, but still requiring circular orbitswhile fitting the observed positions, makes the instability time even shorter.a promising solution is that the inner two planets have a 2:1 commensurabilitybetween their periods, and they avoid close encounters with each other throughthis resonance. that the inner resonance has lasted until now, in spite of theperturbations of the outer planet, leads to a limit &lt;~10 m_jup on the massesunless the outer two planets are also engaged in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance.in a double resonance, which is consistent with the current data, the systemcould survive until now even if the planets have masses of ~20 m_jup. apsidalalignment can further enhance the stability of a mean-motion resonant system. acompletely different dynamical configuration, with large eccentricities andlarge mutual inclinations among the planets, is possible but finely tuned.
