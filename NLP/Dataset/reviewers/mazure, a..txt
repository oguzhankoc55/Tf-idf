0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0906.4443	very deep spectroscopy of the coma cluster line of sight: exploring new  territories	environmental effects have an important influence on cluster galaxies, butstudies at very faint magnitudes (r&gt;21) are almost exclusively based onimaging. we present here a very deep spectroscopic survey of galaxies on theline of sight to coma, based on redshifts obtained with vlt/vimos for 715galaxies in the unprecedented magnitude range 21&lt;r&lt;23 (absolute magnitude -14to -12). we confirm the substructures previously identified in coma by adami etal. (2005a), and identify three new ones. we detect many groups behind coma: alarge structure at z~0.5, the sdss great wall, and a large and very youngstructure at z~0.054. these structures account for the mass maps derived from arecent weak lensing analysis by gavazzi et al. (2009). the orbits of dwarfgalaxies are probably anisotropic and radial, and could originate from fieldgalaxies radially falling into the cluster. spectral characteristics of comadwarf galaxies show that red or absorption line galaxies have larger stellarmasses and are older than blue or emission line galaxies. r&lt;22 galaxies showless prominent absorption lines than r&gt;22 galaxies. this trend is less clearfor field galaxies, suggesting that part of the faint coma galaxies could havebeen recently injected from the field following the ngc 4911 group infall. wepresent a list of five ultra compact dwarf galaxy candidates. we also globallyconfirm spectroscopically our previous results on the galaxy luminosityfunctions and find that dwarf galaxies follow a red sequence similar to thatdrawn by bright galaxies. dwarf galaxies are very abundant in coma, and arepartly field galaxies that have fallen onto the cluster along filaments.

0707.0566	coma cluster object populations down to m_r~-9.5	this study follows a recent analysis of the galaxy luminosity functions andcolour-magnitude red sequences in the coma cluster (adami et al. 2007). weanalyze here the distribution of very faint galaxies and globular clusters inan east-west strip of $\sim 42 \times 7$ arcmin$^2$ crossing the coma clustercenter (hereafter the cs strip) down to the unprecedented faint absolutemagnitude of m$_r \sim -9.5$. this work is based on deep images obtained at thecfht with the cfh12k camera in the b, r, and i bands. the analysis shows thatthe observed properties strongly depend on the environment, and thus on thecluster history. when the cs is divided into four regions, the westernmostregion appears poorly populated, while the regions around the brightestgalaxies ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 (ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 being masked) aredominated by faint blue galaxies. they show a faint luminosity function slopeof -2, very significantly different from the field estimates. results arediscussed in the framework of galaxy destruction (which can explain part of thevery faint galaxy population) and of structures infalling on to coma.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0910.3827	galaxy cluster searches by photometric redshifts in the cfhtls	in order to enlarge publicly available optical cluster catalogs, inparticular at high redshift, we have performed a systematic search for clustersof galaxies in the cfhtls. we used the le phare photometric redshifts for thegalaxies detected with magnitude limits of i'=25 and 23 for the deep and widefields respectively. we then constructed galaxy density maps in photometricredshift bins of 0.1 based on an adaptive kernel technique and detectedstructures with sextractor. in order to assess the validity of our clusterdetection rates, we applied a similar procedure to galaxies in millenniumsimulations. we measured the correlation function of our cluster candidates. weanalyzed large scale properties and substructures by applying a minimalspanning tree algorithm both to our data and to the millennium simulations. wehave detected 1200 candidate clusters with various masses (minimal massesbetween 1.0 10$^{13}$ and 5.5 10$^{13}$ and mean masses between 1.3 10$^{14}$and 12.6 10$^{14}$ m$_\odot$), thus notably increasing the number of known highredshift cluster candidates. we found a correlation function for these objectscomparable to that obtained for high redshift cluster surveys. we also showthat the cfhtls deep survey is able to trace the large scale structure of theuniverse up to z$\geq$1. our detections are fully consistent with those made invarious cfhtls analyses with other methods. we now need accurate massdeterminations of these structures to constrain cosmological parameters.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1008.5318	the daft/fada survey. i.photometric redshifts along lines of sight to  clusters in the z=[0.4,0.9] interval	as a contribution to the understanding of the dark energy concept, the darkenergy american french team (daft, in french fada) has started a large projectto characterize statistically high redshift galaxy clusters, infer cosmologicalconstraints from weak lensing tomography, and understand biases relevant forconstraining dark energy and cluster physics in future cluster and cosmologicalexperiments. the purpose of this paper is to establish the basis of referencefor the photo-z determination used in all our subsequent papers, including weaklensing tomography studies. this project is based on a sample of 91 highredshift (z&gt;0.4), massive clusters with existing hst imaging, for which we arepresently performing complementary multi-wavelength imaging. this allows us inparticular to estimate spectral types and determine accurate photometricredshifts for galaxies along the lines of sight to the first ten clusters forwhich all the required data are available down to a limit of i_ab=24/24.5 withthe lephare software. the accuracy in redshift is of the order of 0.05 for therange 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5. we verified that the technique applied to obtain photometricredshifts works well by comparing our results to with previous works. inclusters, photoz accuracy is degraded for bright absolute magnitudes and forthe latest and earliest type galaxies. the photoz accuracy also only slightlyvaries as a function of the spectral type for field galaxies. as a consequence,we find evidence for an environmental dependence of the photoz accuracy,interpreted as the standard used spectral energy distributions being not verywell suited to cluster galaxies. finally, we modeled the lcdcs 0504 mass withthe strong arcs detected along this line of sight.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

1010.6195	the xmm-lss survey: optical assessment and properties of different x-ray  selected cluster classes	xmm and chandra opened a new area for the study of clusters of galaxies. notonly for cluster physics but also, for the detection of faint and distantclusters that were inaccessible with previous missions. this article presents66 spectroscopically confirmed clusters (0.05&lt;z&lt;1.5) within an area of 6 deg2enclosed in the xmm-lss survey. almost two thirds have been confirmed withdedicated spectroscopy only and 10% have been confirmed with dedicatedspectroscopy supplemented by literature redshifts. sub-samples, or classes, ofextended-sources are defined in a two-dimensional x-ray parameter spaceallowing for various degrees of completeness and contamination. we describe theprocedure developed to assess the reality of these cluster candidates using thecfhtls photometric data and spectroscopic information from our own follow-upcampaigns. most of these objects are low mass clusters, hence constituting astill poorly studied population. in a second step, we quantify correlationsbetween the optical properties such as richness or velocity dispersion and thecluster x-ray luminosities. we examine the relation of the clusters to thecosmic web. finally, we review peculiar structures in the surveyed area likevery distant clusters and fossil groups.

0709.1950	the xmm-lss survey: the class 1 cluster sample over the initial 5 square  degrees and its cosmological modelling	we present a sample of 29 galaxy clusters from the xmm-lss survey over anarea of some 5deg2 out to a redshift of z=1.05. the sample clusters, whichrepresent about half of the x-ray clusters identified in the region, followwell defined x-ray selection criteria and are all spectroscopically confirmed.for all clusters, we provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures as well asmasses. the cluster distribution peaks around z=0.3 and t =1.5 kev, half of theobjects being groups with a temperature below 2 kev. our l-t(z) relation pointstoward self-similar evolution, but does not exclude other physically plausiblemodels. assuming that cluster scaling laws follow self-similar evolution, ournumber density estimates up to z=1 are compatible with the predictions of theconcordance cosmology and with the findings of previous rosat surveys. our wellmonitored selection function allowed us to demonstrate that the inclusion ofselection effects is essential for the correct determination of the evolutionof the l-t relation, which may explain the contradictory results from previousstudies. extensive simulations show that extending the survey area to 10deg2has the potential to exclude the non-evolution hypothesis, but that constraintson more refined icm models will probably be limited by the large intrinsicdispersion of the l-t relation. we further demonstrate that increasing thedispersion in the scaling laws increases the number of detectable clusters,hence generating further degeneracy [in addition to sigma8, omega_m, l(m,z) andt(m,z)] in the cosmological interpretation of the cluster number counts. weprovide useful empirical formulae for the cluster mass-flux and mass-count-raterelations as well as a comparison between the xmm-lss mass sensitivity and thatof forthcoming sz surveys.

1109.0850	galaxy cluster searches based on photometric redshifts in the four  cfhtls wide fields	we have developed a method for detecting clusters in large imaging surveys,based on the detection of structures in galaxy density maps made in slices ofphotometric redshifts. this method was first applied to the canada francehawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) deep 1 field by mazure et al. (2007),then to all the deep and wide cfhtls fields available in the t0004 data releaseby adami et al. (2010). the validity of the cluster detection rate wasestimated by applying the same procedure to galaxies from the millenniumsimulation. here we analyse with the same method the full cfhtls wide survey,based on the t0006 data release. in a total area of 154 deg2, we have detected4061 candidate clusters at 3sigma or above (6802 at 2sigma and above), in theredshift range 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=1.15, with estimated mean masses between 1.3 10^14 and12.6 10^14 m_solar. this catalogue of candidate clusters will be availableonline via vizier. we compare our detections with those made in various cfhtlsanalyses with other methods. by stacking a subsample of clusters, we show thatthis subsample has typical cluster characteristics (colour-magnitude relation,galaxy luminosity function). we also confirm that the cluster-clustercorrelation function is comparable to that obtained for other cluster surveysand analyze large scale filamentary galaxy distributions. we have increased thenumber of known optical high redshift cluster candidates by a large factor, animportant step towards obtaining reliable cluster counts to measurecosmological parameters. the clusters that we detect behave as expected for asample of clusters fed by filaments at the intersection of which they arelocated.

1109.3967	intracluster light in clusters of galaxies at redshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8	the study of intracluster light can help us to understand the mechanismstaking place in galaxy clusters, and to place constraints on the clusterformation history and physical properties. however, owing to the intrinsicfaintness of icl emission, most searches and detailed studies of icl have beenlimited to redshifts z&lt;0.4.we search for icl in a subsample of ten clustersdetected by the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs), at redshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8,that are also part of our daft/fada survey. we analyze the icl by applying theov wav package, a wavelet-based technique, to deep hst acs images in the f814wfilter and to v-band vlt/fors2 images of three clusters. detection levels areassessed as a function of the diffuse light source surface brightness usingsimulations. in the f814w filter images, we detect diffuse light sources in allthe clusters, with typical sizes of a few tens of kpc (assuming that they areat the cluster redshifts). the icl detected by stacking the ten f814w imagesshows an 8sigma detection in the source center extending over a ~50x50kpc2area, with a total absolute magnitude of -21.6 in the f814w filter, equivalentto about two l* galaxies per cluster. we find a weak correlation between thetotal f814w absolute magnitude of the icl and the cluster velocity dispersionand mass. there is no apparent correlation between the cluster mass-to-lightratio (m/l) and the amount of icl, and no evidence for any preferentialorientation in the icl source distribution. we find no strong variation in theamount of icl between z=0 and z=0.8. in addition, we find wavelet-detectedcompact objects (wdcos) in the three clusters for which data in two bands areavailable; these objects are probably very faint compact galaxies that in somecases are members of the respective clusters. we have shown that icl isimportant in clusters at least up to z=0.8.

1111.6482	acoustic and optical variations during rapid downward motion episodes in  the deep north-western mediterranean sea	an acoustic doppler current profiler (adcp) was moored at the deep-sea siteof the antares neutrino telescope near toulon, france, thus providing a uniqueopportunity to compare high-resolution acoustic and optical observationsbetween 70 and 170 m above the sea bed at 2475 m. the adcp measured downwardvertical currents of magnitudes up to 0.03 m s-1 in late winter and earlyspring 2006. in the same period, observations were made of enhanced levels ofacoustic reflection, interpreted as suspended particles including zooplankton,by a factor of about 10 and of horizontal currents reaching 0.35 m s-1. theseobservations coincided with high light levels detected by the telescope,interpreted as increased bioluminescence. during winter 2006 deep dense-waterformation occurred in the ligurian subbasin, thus providing a possibleexplanation for these observations. however, the 10-20 days quasi-periodicepisodes of high levels of acoustic reflection, light and large verticalcurrents continuing into the summer are not direct evidence of this process. itis hypothesized that the main process allowing for suspended material to bemoved vertically later in the year is local advection, linked with topographicboundary current instabilities along the rim of the 'northern current'.

1311.6922	structure and substructure analysis of daft/fada galaxy clusters in the  [0.4-0.9] redshift range	we analyse the structures of all the clusters in the daft/fada survey forwhich xmm-newton and/or a sufficient number of galaxy redshifts in the clusterrange is available, with the aim of detecting substructures and evidence formerging events. these properties are discussed in the framework of standardcold dark matter cosmology.xmm-newton data were available for 32 clusters, forwhich we derive the x-ray luminosity and a global x-ray temperature for 25 ofthem. for 23 clusters we were able to fit the x-ray emissivity with abeta-model and subtract it to detect substructures in the x-ray gas. adynamical analysis based on the sg method was applied to the clusters having atleast 15 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts in the cluster range: 18 x-ray clustersand 11 clusters with no x-ray data. only major substructures will be detected.ten substructures were detected both in x-rays and by the sg method. most ofthe substructures detected both in x-rays and with the sg method are probablyat their first cluster pericentre approach and are relatively recent infalls.we also find hints of a decreasing x-ray gas density profile core radius withredshift. the percentage of mass included in substructures was found to beroughly constant with redshift with values of 5-15%, in agreement both with thegeneral cdm framework and with the results of numerical simulations. galaxiesin substructures show the same general behaviour as regular cluster galaxies;however, in substructures, there is a deficiency of both late type and oldstellar population galaxies. late type galaxies with recent bursts of starformation seem to be missing in the substructures close to the bottom of thehost cluster potential well. however, our sample would need to be increased toallow a more robust analysis.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1403.3614	the mass profile and dynamical status of the z~0.8 galaxy cluster lcdcs  0504	constraints on the mass distribution in high-redshift clusters of galaxiesare not currently very strong. we aim to constrain the mass profile, m(r), anddynamical status of the $z \sim 0.8$ lcdcs 0504 cluster of galaxiescharacterized by prominent giant gravitational arcs near its center. ouranalysis is based on deep x-ray, optical, and infrared imaging, as well asoptical spectroscopy. we model the mass distribution of the cluster with threedifferent mass density profiles, whose parameters are constrained by the stronglensing features of the inner cluster region, by the x-ray emission from theintra-cluster medium, and by the kinematics of 71 cluster members. we obtainconsistent m(r) determinations from three methods (dispersion-kurtosis,caustics and mamposst), out to the cluster virial radius and beyond. the massprofile inferred by the strong lensing analysis in the central cluster regionis slightly above, but still consistent with, the kinematics estimate. on theother hand, the x-ray based m(r) is significantly below both the kinematics andstrong lensing estimates. theoretical predictions from $\lambda$cdm cosmologyfor the concentration--mass relation are in agreement with our observationalresults, when taking into account the uncertainties in both the observationaland theoretical estimates. there appears to be a central deficit in theintra-cluster gas mass fraction compared to nearby clusters. despite therelaxed appearance of this cluster, the determinations of its mass profile bydifferent probes show substantial discrepancies, the origin of which remains tobe determined. the extension of a similar dynamical analysis to other clustersof the daft/fada survey will allow to shed light on the possible systematicsthat affect the determination of mass profiles of high-z clusters, possiblyrelated to our incomplete understanding of intracluster baryon physics.

0705.2438	the swire-vvds-cfhtls surveys: stellar mass assembly over the last 10  gyears. evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1	(abridged abstract) we present an analysis of the stellar mass growth overthe last 10 gyrs using a large 3.6$\mu$ selected sample. we split our sampleinto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. our measurements of the k-lfsand ld evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is alreadyassembled at $z\sim 1.2$. based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellarmass-to-light ratio (in k-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive thestellar mass density for the entire sample. we find that the global evolutionof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation ratederived from uv dust corrected measurements. over the last 8gyrs, we observethat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximatelyconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over thesame timescale. as a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in thequiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in activegalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. from $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, weobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by afactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch whenan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity andstart to build up the red sequence.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

astro-ph;0004091	cfht optical pdcs survey ii: evolution in the space density of clusters  of galaxies	we present the first dynamical study of the optically selected palomardistant cluster survey (pdcs). we show that eleven out of twelve pdcs clusterswe observed are real over-densities of galaxies. most clusters have velocitydispersions appropriate for clusters of galaxies. however, we find a fraction(1/3) of objects in the pdcs which have velocity dispersions in the range ofgroups of galaxies (200 +/- 100 km/s) but have richnesses appropriate forclusters of galaxies.  we measure the richness function, x-ray luminosity function (using both thedetections and upper limits), and the mass function derived from our velocitydispersions. we confirm that the space density, as a function of richness, ofclusters of galaxies in the pdcs is ~5 times that of the abell catalog.excluding the above fraction of 1/3 of objects with low velocity dispersions,we measure a space density ~3 times that of the abell catalog for equivalentmass clusters of galaxies. our space density estimates are in agreement withother low-redshift, optically-selected cluster surveys such as the edcc, apmand edcc2, which raises the possibility that the abell catalog is incomplete.our x-ray luminosity function agrees with other measurements based on bothx-ray and optically selected samples, so we find that the pdcs does not missclusters of galaxies that would be found in an x-ray selected survey. ourresulting mass function, centered around 10e14 msun/h, agrees with theexpectations from such surveys as the canadian network for observationalcosmology cluster survey, though errors on our mass measurements are too largeto constrain cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0009063	dynamical and content evolution of a sample of clusters from z~0 to  z~0.5	in this paper, we present an analysis of the dynamics and segregation ofgalaxies in rich clusters from z~0.32 to z~0.48 taken from the cfht opticalpdcs (cop) survey and from the cnoc survey (carlberg et al. 1997). our resultsfrom the cop survey are based upon the recent observational work of adami etal. (2000) and holden et al. (2000) and use new spectroscopic and photometricdata on six clusters selected from the palomar distant cluster survey (pdcs;postman et al. 1996). we have compared the cop and cnoc samples to the esonearby abell cluster survey (enacs: z~0.07). our sample shows that the z&lt;0.4clusters have the same velocity dispersion versus magnitude, morphological typeand radius relationships as nearby abell clusters. the z~0.48 clusters exhibit,however, departures from these relations. furthermore, there appears to be ahigher fraction of late-type (or bluer, e.g. butcher and oemler, 1984) galaxiesin the distant clusters compared to the nearby ones. the classical scenario inwhich massive galaxies virialize before they evolve from late into early typeexplain our observations. in such a scenario, the clusters of our sample beganto form before a redshift of ~0.8 and the late-type galaxy population had acontinuous infall into the clusters.

astro-ph;0102133	central matter distributions in rich clusters of galaxies from z~0 to  z~0.5	we have analyzed the galaxy number density and luminosity density profiles ofrich clusters of galaxies from redshifts z=0 to z=0.5. we show that theluminosity profile computed with bright galaxies is significantly cusped in thecenter of the clusters, whatever the redshift. this is in agreement with thedark matter profiles predicted by numerical simulations. the galaxy numberdensity profile for the bright galaxies is fitted equally well with a coremodel or a cusped model. in contrast, the luminosity and the galaxy numberdensity profiles of the fainter galaxies are significantly better fitted by acore rather than a cusp model. we did not detect any statistically significantdifferent fits when applied to data in range from z=0 to z=0.5. the differencein profile between faint and bright galaxies may be due to the rapid (relativeto the age of the universe at z=0 versus z=0.5) destruction of the faintgalaxies by tidal forces and merging events in the denser central regions ofthe clusters. this process could erase the cusp by turning faint galaxies intodiffuse light. in this case, the galaxies (with a cusp visible in the brightgalaxy number density and mainly in luminosity profiles) would trace the totalmass distribution.

astro-ph;0110696	group analysis in the ssrs2 catalog	we present an automated method to detect populations of groups in galaxyredshift catalogs. this method uses both analysis of the redshift distributionalong lines of sight in fixed cells to detect elementary structures and afriend-of-friend algorithm to merge these elementary structures into physicalstructures. we apply this method to the ssrs2 galaxy redshift catalog. thegroups detected with our method are similar to group catalogs detected withpure friend-of-friend algorithms. they have similar mass distribution, similarabundance versus redshift, similar 2-point correlation function and the sameredshift completeness limit, close to 5000 km/s. if instead of ssrs2, we usecatalogs of new generation, it would lead to a completeness limit ofz$\sim$0.7. we model the luminosity function for nearby galaxy groups by aschechter function with parameters m*=(-19.99+/-0.36)+5logh and alpha=-1.46 +/-0.17 to compute the mass to light ratio. the median value of the mass to lightratio is 360 h m/l and we deduce a relation between mass to light ratio andvelocity dispersion sigma (m/l=3.79 +/- 0.64)sigma -(294 +/- 570)). the moremassive the group, the higher the mass to light ratio, and therefore, thelarger the amount of dark matter inside the group. another explanation is asignificant stripping of the gas of the galaxies in massive groups as opposedto low mass groups. this extends to groups of galaxies the mild tendencyalready detected for rich clusters of galaxies. finally, we detect a barelysignificant fundamental plane for these groups but much less narrow than forclusters of galaxies.

astro-ph;0409134	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution of the galaxy luminosity function  up to z=2 in first epoch data	we investigate the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function from thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) from the present to z=2 in five (u, b, v, r and i)rest-frame band-passes. we use the first epoch vvds deep sample of 11,034spectra selected at 17.5 &lt;= i_{ab} &lt;= 24.0, on which we apply the algorithm forluminosity function (alf), described in this paper. we observe a substantialevolution with redshift of the global luminosity functions in all bands. fromz=0.05 to z=2, we measure a brightening of the characteristic magnitude m*included in the magnitude range 1.8-2.5, 1.7-2.4, 1.2-1.9, 1.1-1.8 and 1.0-1.6in the u, b, v, r and i rest-frame bands, respectively. we confirm thisdifferential evolution of the luminosity function with rest-frame wavelength,from the measurement of the comoving density of bright galaxies (m &lt;m*(z=0.1)). this density increases by a factor of around 2.6, 2.2, 1.8, 1.5,1.5 between z=0.05 and z=1 in the u, b, v, r, i bands, respectively. we alsomeasure a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of the luminosityfunctions, with \delta\alpha ~ -0.3 between z=0.05 and z=1, similar in allbands.

astro-ph;0409135	the vimos vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering to z=2  from first epoch observations	this paper presents the evolution of the clustering of the main population ofgalaxies from z=2.1 to z=0.2, from the first epoch vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), a magnitude limited sample with 17.5&lt;=i_{ab}&lt;=24. we have computed thecorrelation functions \xi(r_p,\pi) and w_p(r_p), and the correlation lengthr_0(z), for the vvds-02h and vvds-cdfs fields, for a total of 7155 galaxies ina 0.61deg^2 area. we find that the correlation length in this sample staysroughly constant from z=0.5 to z=1.1, with r_0(z)=2.5-2.8 h^{-1} mpc(comoving), for galaxies comparable in luminosity to the local 2dfgrs and sdsssamples, indicating that the amplitude of the correlation function was ~2.5xlower at z~1 than observed locally. the correlation length in our lowestredshift bin z=[0.2,0.5] is r_0=2.4 h^{-1} mpc, lower than for any otherpopulation at the same redshift, indicating the low clustering of very lowluminosity galaxies, 1.5 magnitudes fainter than in the 2dfgrs or sdss. thecorrelation length is increasing to r_0~3.0 h^{-1} mpc at higher redshiftsz=[1.3,2.1], as we are observing increasingly brighter galaxies, comparable togalaxies with mb_ab=-20.5 locally. we compare our measurement to the deep2measurements in the range z=[0.7,1.35] \citep{coil} on the population selectedapplying the same magnitude and color selection criteria as in their survey,and find comparable results. the slowly varying clustering of vvds galaxies asredshift increases is markedly different from the predicted evolution of theclustering of dark matter, indicating that bright galaxies are already tracingthe large scale structures emerging from the dark matter distribution 9-10billion years ago, a supporting evidence for a strong evolution of the galaxyvs. dark matter bias.

astro-ph;0409138	the vimos vlt deep survey: computing the two point correlation  statistics and associated uncertainties	we are presenting in this paper a detailed account of the methods used tocompute the three-dimensional two-point galaxy correlation function in thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). we investigate how instrumental selection effectsand observational biases affect the measurements and identify the methods tocorrect them. we quantify the accuracy of our correction method using anensemble of fifty mock galaxy surveys generated with the galics semi-analyticmodel of galaxy formation which incorporate the same selection biases andtiling strategy as the real data does. we demonstrate that we are able torecover the real-space two-point correlation function xi(s) to an accuracybetter than 10% on scales larger than 1 h^{-1} mpc, and of about 30% on scalesbelow 1 h^{-1} mpc, with the sampling strategy used for the first epoch vvdsdata. the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) is recovered with an accuracybetter than 10% on all scales 0.1 &lt;= r &lt;= 10 h^{-1} mpc. there is a tendencyfor a small but systematic under-estimate of the correlation length derivedfrom w_p(r_p) of 6% on average, remaining after our correction process. thelarge number of simulated surveys allows us to provide a reliable estimate ofthe cosmic error on the measurements of the correlation length r_0, of about15-20% for the first epoch vvds observation (le fevre et al.2004,astro-ph/0409133). the error estimation and measurement techniques outlined inthis paper are being used in several studies which investigate in detail theclustering properties of galaxies in the vvds data.

astro-ph;0409248	the vvds data reduction pipeline: introducing vipgi, the vimos  interactive pipeline and graphical interface	the vimos vlt deep survey (vvds), designed to measure 150,000 galaxyredshifts, requires a dedicated data reduction and analysis pipeline to processin a timely fashion the large amount of spectroscopic data being produced. thisrequirement has lead to the development of the vimos interactive pipeline andgraphical interface (vipgi), a new software package designed to simplify to avery high degree the task of reducing astronomical data obtained with vimos,the imaging spectrograph built by the virmos consortium for the europeansouthern observatory, and mounted on unit 3 (melipal) of the very largetelescope (vlt) at paranal observatory (chile). vipgi provides the astronomerwith specially designed vimos data reduction functions, a vimos-centric dataorganizer, and dedicated data browsing and plotting tools, that can be used toverify the quality and accuracy of the various stages of the data reductionprocess. the quality and accuracy of the data reduction pipeline are comparableto those obtained using well known iraf tasks, but the speed of the datareduction process is significantly increased, thanks to the large set ofdedicated features. in this paper we discuss the details of the mos datareduction pipeline implemented in vipgi, as applied to the reduction of some20,000 vvds spectra, assessing quantitatively the accuracy of the variousreduction steps. we also provide a more general overview of vipgi capabilities,a tool that can be used for the reduction of any kind of vimos data.

astro-ph;0506561	the vimos vlt deep survey: evolution of the non-linear galaxy bias up to  z=1.5	we present the first measurements of the probability distribution function(pdf) of galaxy fluctuations in the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) cone, covering0.4x0.4 deg between 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.5. the second moment of the pdf, i.e. the rmsfluctuations of the galaxy density field, is with good approximation constantover the full redshift baseline investigated: we find that, in redshift space,sigma_8 for galaxies brighter than m=-20+5log h has a mean value of 0.94\pm0.07in the redshift interval 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5. the third moment, i.e. the skewness,increases with cosmic time: we find that the probability of having underdenseregions is greater at z~0.7 than it was at z~1.5. by comparing the pdf ofgalaxy density contrasts with the theoretically predicted pdf of massfluctuations we infer the redshift-, density-, and scale-dependence of thebiasing function b(z, \delta, r) between galaxy and matter overdensities up toredshift z=1.5. our results can be summarized as follows: i) the galaxy bias isan increasing function of redshift: evolution is marginal up to z~0.8 and morepronounced for z&gt;0.8; ii) the formation of bright galaxies is inhibited below acharacteristic mass-overdensity threshold whose amplitude increases withredshift and luminosity; iii) the biasing function is non linear in all theredshift bins investigated with non-linear effects of the order of a few to 10%on scales &gt;5mpc.

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0609391	spatial variations of the optical galaxy luminosity functions and red  sequences in the coma cluster: clues to its assembly history	clusters of galaxies are believed to be at the intersections of cosmologicalfilaments and to grow by accreting matter from these filaments. such continuousinfall has major consequences not only on clusters but also on the physics ofcluster galaxies. faint galaxies are particularly interesting as they are verysensitive to environmental effects, and may have a different behaviour fromthat of bright galaxies. the aim of this paper is to sample the coma clusterbuilding history, based on the analysis of galaxy luminosity functions and redsequences in the color magnitude relation down to faint magnitudes, which areprivileged tools for this purpose. the present analysis is based on deep(r~24), wide (~0.5 deg2) multiband (bvri vega system) images of the comacluster obtained with the cfh12k camera at the cfht. we have derived lfs andcmrs in twenty 10x10 arcmin2 regions and in larger regions. in all photometricbands, we found steeply rising lfs in the north-northeast half of the cluster(due to early type galaxies at bright magnitudes and due to late type galaxiesat the faint end), and much flatter lfs in the south-southwest region. althoughthe fine behaviour of the cmr rs is different in these two regions, a goodagreement is found in general between the rs computed for faint and for brightgalaxies. all these results can be interpreted consistently in the framework ofthe building up process previously proposed. the northern coma area is arelatively quiescent region while the southern area experiences severalinfalls.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

0809.2027	photometric redshifts as a tool to study the coma cluster galaxy  populations	we investigate the coma cluster galaxy luminosity function (glf) at faintmagnitudes, in particular in the u* band by applying photometric redshifttechniques applied to deep u*, b, v, r, i images covering a region of ~1deg2 (r24). global and local glfs in the b, v, r and i bands obtained with photometricredshift selection are consistent with our previous results based on astatistical background subtraction.  in the area covered only by the u* image, the glf was also derived afterapplying a statistical background subtraction. the glf in the u* band shows anincrease of the faint end slope towards the outer regions of the cluster (fromalpha~1 in the cluster center to alpha~2 in the cluster periphery). this couldbe explained assuming a short burst of star formation in these galaxies whenentering the cluster.  the analysis of the multicolor type spatial distribution reveals that latetype galaxies are distributed in clumps in the cluster outskirts, where x-raysubstructures are also detected and where the glf in the u* band is steeper.

astro-ph;0702430	structure detection in the d1 cfhtls deep field using accurate  photometric redshifts: a benchmark	we investigate structures in the d1 cfhtls deep field in order to test themethod that will be applied to generate homogeneous samples of clusters andgroups of galaxies in order to constrain cosmology and detailed physics ofgroups and clusters. adaptive kernel technique is applied on galaxy catalogues.this technique needs none of the usual a-priori assumptions (luminosityfunction, density profile, colour of galaxies) made with other methods. itsmain drawback (decrease of efficiency with increasing background) is overcameby the use of narrow slices in photometric redshift space. there are two mainconcerns in structure detection. one is false detection and the second, theevaluation of the selection function in particular if one wants "complete"samples. we deal here with the first concern using random distributions. forthe second, comparison with detailed simulations is foreseen but we use here apragmatic approach with comparing our results to galics simulations to checkthat our detection number is not totally at odds compared to cosmologicalsimulations. we use xmm-lss survey and secured vvds redshifts up to z~1 tocheck individual detections. we show that our detection method is basicallycapable to recover (in the regions in common) 100% of the c1 xmm-lss x-raydetections in the correct redshift range plus several other candidates.moreover when spectroscopic data are available, we confirm our detections, eventhose without x-ray data.

astro-ph;9411025	on the galaxy luminosity function in the central regions of the coma  cluster	we have obtained new redshifts for 265 objects in the central48~$\times$~25~arcmin$^2$ region of the coma cluster. when supplemented withliterature data, our redshift sample is 95~\% complete up to a magnitudeb$_{26.5}$=18.0 (the magnitudes are taken from the photometric sample of godwinet al. 1983). using redshift-confirmed membership for 205 galaxies, and thelocation in the colour-magnitude diagram for another 91 galaxies, we have builta sample of cluster members which is complete up to b$_{26.5}$=20.0. we showthat the coma cluster luminosity function cannot be adequately fitted by asingle schechter (1976) function, because of a dip in the magnitudedistribution at b$_{26.5}$$\sim$17. the superposition of an erlang (or a gauss)and a schechter function provides a significantly better fit. we compare theluminosity function of coma to those of other clusters, and of the field.luminosity functions for rich clusters look similar, with a maximum at $m_{b}\simeq -19.5 + 5 \times \log h_{50}$, while the virgo and the field luminosityfunctions show a nearly monotonic behaviour. these differences may be producedby physical processes related to the environment which affect the luminositiesof a certain class of cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9511051	the eso nearby abell cluster survey. i. description of the dataset and  definition of physical systems	summary - we describe the results of the eso key-programme on `structure anddynamics of rich galaxy clusters' (or enacs). the final database contains atotal of 5634 galaxies in the directions of 107 clusters from the aco cataloguewith richness $r\ge 1$ and mean redshifts $z \le 0.1$. of the 5634 redshifts,4465 are based on absorption lines only, 583 on emission lines only and 586 onboth. the overall reliability of the 5634 accepted redshifts is 0.98. for 5615galaxies an $r_{25}$ magnitude was obtained. we discuss various methods fordefining the compact, physically relevant systems in the 107 `pencil-beam'surveys. we have chosen to apply a fixed velocity gap of 1000 km/s to separategalaxies that do not form part of the same system. with this gap size, systemsare not broken up into sub-systems, and field galaxies are hardly linked to thesystems. we present the mean redshifts of the 220 systems (with at least 4members) identified in the 107 pencil beam surveys. on average, about 75~\% ofthe 5634 galaxies are in the largest system found in the direction of the richabell cluster candidate. half of the 25~\% of galaxies outside the largestsystem belong to a secondary system along the same line of sight. for about90~\% of the nearby rich abell cluster candidates studied here we find aredshift system that either contains more than half of the total number ofredshifts, or that has at least two times as many redshifts as the next largestsystem.

astro-ph;9511052	the eso nearby abell cluster survey. ii. the distribution of velocity  dispersions of rich galaxy clusters	summary - by combining the 5634 redshifts from the eso nearby abell clustersurvey (the enacs) with another 1000 redshifts from the literature we are ableto study the distribution of velocity dispersions for a volume-limited sampleof 128 $r_{\rm aco} \geq 1$ clusters, out to a redshift $z=0.1$, in a solidangle of 2.55 sr centered on the south galactic pole. in deriving velocitydispersions we apply a new, physically motivated method for removing fore- andbackground galaxies. we discuss in detail the completeness of the clustersample for which we derive the distribution of cluster velocity dispersions.the large apparent spread between velocity dispersion and richness must belargely intrinsic. a consequence of the very broad relation between richnessand velocity dispersion is that all cluster samples complete in richness arebiased against low dispersions. for the richness limit of our sample this biasoperates below about 800 km/sec. above 800 km/s, our distribution of globalvelocity dispersions is free from systematic errors and biases, and agrees verywell with the most recent determination of the distribution of cluster x-raytemperatures. therefore, we conclude that x-ray temperature and velocitydispersion distributions statistically measure the same cluster property. westress the need for model predictions that produce exactly the same informationas provided by the observations, for a sample of model clusters with a richnesslimit that mimics that of the sample of observed clusters.

astro-ph;9512111	unveiling hidden structures in the coma cluster	we have assembled a large data-set of 613 galaxy redshifts in the comacluster, the largest presently available for a cluster of galaxies. we havedefined a sample of cluster members complete to b$_{26.5}=20.0$, using amembership criterion based on the galaxy velocity, when available, or on thegalaxy magnitude and colour, otherwise. such a data set allows us to definenearly complete samples within a region of 1~\mpc\ radius, with a sufficientnumber of galaxies per sample to make statistical analyses possible. using thissample and the {\em rosat} pspc x--ray image of the cluster, we havere-analyzed the structure and kinematics of coma, by applying the wavelet andadaptive kernel techniques. a striking coincidence of features is found in thedistributions of galaxies and hot intracluster gas. the two central dominantgalaxies, ngc4874 and ngc4889, are surrounded by two galaxy groups, mostlypopulated with galaxies brighter than b$_{26.5}=17$ and well separated invelocity space. on the contrary, the fainter galaxies tend to form a singlesmooth structure with a central peak coinciding in position with a secondarypeak detected in x--rays, and located between the two dominant galaxies; wesuggest to identify this structure with the main body of the coma cluster. acontinuous velocity gradient is found in the central distribution of thesefaint galaxies, a probable signature of tidal interactions rather thanrotation. there is evidence for a bound population of bright galaxies aroundother brightest cluster members. altogether, the coma cluster structure seemsto be better traced by the faint galaxy population, the bright galaxies beinglocated in subclusters. we discuss this evidence in terms of an ongoingaccretion of groups onto the cluster.

astro-ph;9610168	the eso nearby abell cluster survey. iii. distribution and kinematics of  emission-line galaxies	we have studied the frequency of occurrence, the kinematics and the spatialdistribution of emission-line galaxies (elg) in clusters in the eso nearbyabell cluster survey (enacs). more than 90% of the elg are spirals, but the elgrepresent only 30% of all spirals. the true elg fraction in clusters is 0.10;this is consistent with that in the field (0.21) as a result of differences inmorphological mix. the average elg fraction decreases with increasing velocitydispersion of the cluster. only 1/5 of the clusters shows a significantdifference in the average velocities of the elg and the other (non-elg)galaxies; in a similar fraction of the clusters significant differences invelocity dispersion are seen. yet, the velocity dispersion of the elg is, onaverage, 20% larger than that of the non-elg. this larger velocity dispersionis largely intrinsic, i.e. it is not likely to be the result of velocityoffsets of the elg. the surface density of the elg is significantly less peakedtowards the centre than that of the non-elg. the elg are distributed fairlysmoothly within the cluster with at most 25% in compact substructures. thedistribution and kinematics of the elg yield virial mass estimates that, onaverage, are 50% higher than those based on the non-elg. this probably meansthat the elg are on more radial orbits than the non-elg. all observedproperties of the elg are consistent with most of them being on their firstapproach of the high-density cluster core.

astro-ph;9706037	the eso-sculptor faint galaxy redshift survey: the photometric sample	we present the photometric sample of a faint galaxy survey carried out in thesouthern hemisphere, using ccds on the 3.60m and ntt-3.5m telescopes at lasilla (eso). the survey area is a continuous strip of 0.2 deg x 1.53 deglocated at high galactic latitude (-83 deg) in the sculptor constellation. thephotometric survey provides total magnitudes in the bands b, v (johnson) and r(cousins) to limiting magnitudes of 24.5, 24.0, 23.5 respectively. to theselimits, the catalog contains about 9500, 12150, 13000 galaxies in b, v, r bandsrespectively and is the first large digital multi-colour photometric catalog atthis depth. this photometric survey also provides the entry catalog for afully-sampled redshift survey of ~ 700 galaxies with r &lt; 20.5 (bellanger et al.1995). in this paper, we describe the photometric observations and the stepsused in the data reduction. the analysis of objects and the star-galaxyseparation with a neural network are performed using sextractor, a newphotometric software developed by e. bertin (1996). the photometric accuracy ofthe resulting catalog is ~ 0.05 mag for r &lt; 22. the differential galaxy numbercounts in b, v, r are in good agreement with previously published ccd studiesand confirm the evidence for significant evolution at faint magnitudes ascompared to a standard non evolving model (by factors 3.6, 2.6, 2.1). thegalaxy colour distributions b-r, b-v of our sample show a blueing trend of ~0.5 mag between 21 &lt; r &lt; 23.5 in contrast to the v-r colour distribution whereno significant evolution is observed.

astro-ph;9709256	the fundamental plane of clusters of galaxies	we have used the eso nearby abell cluster survey (enacs) in combination withthe cosmos galaxy catalogue, to investigate the existence of a fundamentalplane (fp) for rich clusters of galaxies. the 20 clusters with the most regularprojected galaxy distributions appear to define a quite narrow fp, which issimilar to the fp found by schaeffer et al., who used other clusters. ourcluster fp appears to be different from that of ellipticals, as well as fromthe virial prediction. the latter fact may have several physical explanations,or a combination thereof. if m/l varies with l this will change the fp slopeaway from the virial slope. differences in dynamical structure between clusterswill also produce deviations from the virial fp. in view of the longvirialization time-scales in all but the very central parts of galaxy clusters,the deviation of the cluster fp from the virial expectation may also resultfrom clusters not being totally virialized. the scatter of the observationsaround the cluster fp is fairly small. an important part of the observedscatter is likely to be intrinsic. if this intrinsic spread were dueexclusively to deviations from the hubble flow it would imply cluster peculiarvelocities of at most about 1000 km.s-1.

astro-ph;9709268	segregations in clusters of galaxies	we analyse a sample of about 2000 galaxies in 40 regular clusters, to lookfor evidence of segregation with respect to galaxy luminosities andmorphological types. we find evidence of luminosity segregation for galaxiesbrighter than $m_r &lt; -21.5$, i.e. typically the four brightest members of eachcluster. we also find evidence of morphological segregation: both thecore-radius and the velocity dispersion increase along the hubble sequence(ellipticals - s0 - early spirals - late spirals). galaxies of different typeshave different velocity dispersion profiles, being steeper for later typegalaxies. simple modelling allows us to show that elliptical (and, to a lesserextent, s0) orbits are mostly tangential in the cluster core, and nearlyisotropic outside, while spiral (in particular late-spiral) orbits arepredominantly radial. a viable interpretation of our results is that (1) latespirals, at variance with other type galaxies, are a non-virialized clusterpopulation, still on partially radial infalling orbits, (2) the ellipticalphase-space distribution is evolving towards energy equipartition through theprocess of dynamical friction, (3) s0 and early-spirals have intermediatedistributions between these two extremes.

astro-ph;9802355	deep probing of the coma cluster	as a continuation of our study of the faint galaxy luminosity function in thecoma cluster of galaxies, we report here on the first spectroscopicobservations of very faint galaxies (r $\le$ 21.5) in the direction of the coreof this cluster. out of these 34 galaxies, only one may have a redshiftconsistent with coma, all others are background objects. the predicted numberof coma galaxies is 6.7 $\pm$ 6.0, according to bernstein et al. (1995, b95).if we add the 17 galaxies observed by secker (1997), we end up with 5 galaxiesbelonging to coma, while the expected number is 16.0 $\pm$ 11.0 according tob95. notice that these two independent surveys lead to the same results.although the observations and predicted values agree within the error, suchresults raise into question the validity of statistical subtraction ofbackground objects commonly used to derive cluster luminosity functions (e.g.b95). more spectroscopic observations in this cluster and others are thereforeurgently needed. as a by-product, we report on the discovery of a physicalstructure at a redshift z$\simeq$0.5.

astro-ph;9804172	enacsvii, galaxy density profiles of rich clusters of galaxies	we have analyzed the projected galaxy distributions in a subset of the enacs/cosmos cluster sample. we made maximum-likelihood fits to the distribution ofcosmos galaxies for 4 theoretical profiles, with `cores' (generalized king- andhubble-profiles) and with `cusps' (generalized navarro et al., or nfw, and devaucouleurs profiles). we use the likelihood ratio to investigate whether theobservations are better described by profiles with cusps or with cores. takingthe king and nfw profiles as model of either class, we find that about 75% ofthe clusters are better fitted by the king profile than by the nfw profile.however, for the individual clusters the preference for the king profile israrely significant. when we limit ourselves to the central regions it appearsthat the significance increases drastically, with 65% of the clusters showing astrong preference for a king over an nfw profile. we constructed compositeclusters from the cosmos and enacs data, taking special care to avoid thecreation or the destruction of cusps. we scale by different ways (projecteddistances, core radii, r_{200}).in all three cases we find that the kingprofile is clearly preferred over the nfw profile. however, this preference isnot shared by the brightest galaxies. we conclude that these galaxies arerepresented almost equally well by king and nfwprofiles, but that thedistribution of the fainter galaxies clearly shows a core rather than a cusp.finally, we compared the outer slope of the galaxy distributions in ourclusterswith results for model calculations with different cosmological parameters. weconclude that the observed profile slope indicates a low value for omega_0.this is consistent with the direct estimate of omega_0 based on the m/l ratiosof the individual clusters.

astro-ph;9806162	cluster luminosity function and n^th ranked magnitude as a distance  indicator	we define here a standard candle to determine the distance of clusters ofgalaxies and to investigate their peculiar velocities by using the n^{th} rankgalaxy (magnitude m$_n$). we address the question of the universality of theluminosity function for a sample of 28 rich clusters of galaxies ($cz \simeq20000 km/s$) in order to model the influence on $m_n$ of cluster richness. thisluminosity function is found to be universal and the fit of a schechter profilegives $\alpha = -1.50 \pm 0.11$ and $m_{bj}* = -19.91 \pm 0.21$ in the range[-21,-17]. the uncorrected distance indicator $m_n$ is more efficient for thefirst ranks n. with n=5, we have a dispersion of 0.61 magnitude for the(m$_n$,5log(cz)) relation. when we correct for the richness effect and subtractthe background galaxies we reduce the uncertainty to 0.21 magnitude with n=15.simulations show that a large part of this dispersion originates from theintrinsic scatter of the standard candle itself. these provide upper bounds onthe amplitude $\sigma_v$ of cluster radial peculiar motions. at a confidencelevel of 90%, the dispersion is 0.13 magnitude and $\sigma_v$ is limited to1200 km/s for our sample of clusters.

astro-ph;9810501	the eso nearby abell cluster survey: kinematics of galaxies in clusters	we summarize several results based on the velocity data-set for clustergalaxies provided by enacs (the eso nearby abell cluster survey). we describethe distribution of velocity dispersions of a complete sample of rich galaxyclusters, and compare it to the distribution of cluster x-ray temperatures, andwith predictions of theoretical models. we then address the issue of theexistence of a fundamental plane (fp) for rich clusters, first suggested byschaeffer et al. we confirm the existence of this fp with the enacs data-set.the cluster fp is different from the fp of elliptical galaxies, and from thevirial prediction. some implications of the cluster fp are discussed. finally,we describe the phase-space distributions of different populations of clustergalaxies. different galaxy classes are defined according to their morphologicalor spectral type, and the presence of emission-lines. star-forming (late-type)galaxies have a velocity dispersion profile that (in combination with theirwider spatial distribution) is suggestive of first infall into the cluster. onthe contrary, quiescent (early-type) galaxies show evidence of a dynamicallyrelaxed distribution.

astro-ph;9910217	a turn-over in the galaxy luminosity function of the coma cluster core?	our previous study of the faint end (r$\leq$21.5) of the galaxy luminosityfunction (glf) was based on spectroscopic data in a small region near the comacluster center. in this previous study adami et al. (1998) suggested, withmoderate statistical significance, that the number of galaxies actuallybelonging to the cluster was much smaller than expected. this led us toincrease our spectroscopic sample. here, we have improved the statisticalsignificance of the results of the coma glf faint end study (r$\leq$22.5) byusing a sample of 85 redshifts. this includes both new spectroscopic data and aliterature compilation. the relatively small number of faint galaxies belongingto coma that was suggested by adami et al. (1998) and secker et al. (1998) hasbeen confirmed with these new observations. we also confirm that thecolor-magnitude relation is not well suited for finding the galaxies inside thecoma cluster core, close to the center at magnitudes fainter than r$\sim$19. weshow that there is an enhancement in the coma line of sight of field galaxiescompared to classical field counts. this can be explained by the contributionof groups and of a distant $z\sim 0.5$ cluster along the line of sight. theresult is that the coma glf appears to turn-over or at least to become flat forthe faint galaxies. we suggest that this is due to environmental effects.

0810.0357	orientations of very faint galaxies in the coma cluster	we have then searched for preferential orientations of faint galaxies in thecoma cluster (down i_vega~-11.5). by applying a deconvolution method to deep u*and i band images of the coma cluster, we were able to recover orientationsdown to faint magnitudes. no preferential orientations are found in more than95% of the cluster, and the brighter the galaxies, the fewer preferentialorientations. the minor axes of late type galaxies are radially oriented alonga northeast -southwest direction and are oriented north-south in the westernx-ray sub- structures. for early type galaxies, in the western regions showingsignificant preferential orientations, galaxy major axes are orientedperpendicularly to the north-south direction. in the eastern significant regionand close to ngc 4889, galaxy major axes also point toward the 2 clusterdominant galaxies. in the southern significant regions, galaxy planes aretangential with respect to the clustercentric direction, except close to(alpha=194.8, delta=27.65) where the orientation is close to -15deg. part ofthe orientations of the minor axes of late type galaxies and of the major axesof early type galaxies can be explained by a tidal torque model applied tocosmological filaments and local merging directions. another part (close tongc4889) can be accounted for by collimated infalls. for early type galaxies,the (alpha=194.8, delta=27.65) region shows orientations that probably resultfrom processes involving induced star formation.

0810.2172	eddington ratios of faint agn at intermediate redshift: evidence for a  population of half-starved black holes	we use one of the deepest spectroscopic samples of broad line active galacticnuclei (agn) currently available, extracted from the vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), to compute mgii and civ virial masses estimate of 120 super-massiveblack holes in the redshift range 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.9 and 2.6&lt;z&lt;4.3. we find that themass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low agnluminosities (log l_bol ~ 45). at these luminosities, there is a substantialfraction of black holes accreting far below their eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd&lt; 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for agn of higherluminosities. we speculate that these may be agn on the decaying branch oftheir light-curves, well past their peak activity. this would agree with recenttheoretical predictions of agn evolution.  in the electronic appendix of this paper we publish an update of the vvdstype-1 agn sample, including the first and most of the second epochobservations. this sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

0811.2053	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z~0.9	we derive the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies up to$z\sim0.9$, using data from the vimos vlt deep survey. automatic measurement ofemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the fullspectroscopic sample. this sample is divided into two sub-samples depending onthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;22.5$) and deep$i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;24$). these two samples span two different ranges of stellarmasses. emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxiesand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. for the star-forminggalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phaseoxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to giveconsistent results at low and high redshifts. the stellar masses have beenestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set ofstellar population synthesis models. we assume at first order that the shape ofthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. then we find astronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deepsample. we thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter athigher redshift. the observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation athigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.

0811.2085	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. ii. extending the mass-metallicity relation to the range  z=0.89-1.24	aims. we present a continuation of our study about the relation betweenstellar mass and gas-phase metallicity in the vimos vlt deep survey (vvds). inthis work we extend the determination of metallicities up to redshift = 1.24for a sample of 42 star-forming galaxies with a mean redshift value of 0.99.methods. for a selected sample of emission-line galaxies, we use bothdiagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations based on [oii] emission linesalong with the empirical relation between the intensities of the [oiii] and[neiii] emission lines and the theoretical ratios between balmer recombinationemission lines to identify star-forming galaxies and to derive theirmetallicities. we derive stellar masses by fitting the whole spectral energydistribution with a set of stellar population synthesis models. results. thesenew methods allow us to extend the mass-metallicity relation to higherredshift. we show that the metallicity determinations are consistent with moreestablished strong-line methods. taken together this allows us to study theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z = 1.24 with good control ofsystematic uncertainties. we find an evolution with redshift of the averagemetallicity of galaxies very similar to those reported in the literature: for agiven stellar mass, galaxies at z = 1 have, on average, a metallicity = 0.3 dexlower than galaxies in the local universe. however we do not see anysignificant metallicity evolution between redshifts z = 0.7 (paper i) and z =1.0 (this paper). we find also the same flattening of the mass-metallicityrelation for the most massive galaxies as reported in paper i at lowerredshifts, but again no apparent evolution of the slope is seen between z = 0.7and z = 1.0.

0811.4480	on the nature of faint low surface brightness galaxies in the coma  cluster	this project is the continuation of our study of faint low surface brightnessgalaxies (flsbs) in one of the densest nearby galaxy regions known, the comacluster. our goal is to improve our understanding of the nature of theseobjects by comparing the broad band spectral energy distribution withpopulation synthesis models. the data were obtained with the megacam and cfh12kcameras at the cfht. we used the resulting photometry in 5 broad band filters(u*, b, v, r, and i), that included new u*-band data, to fit spectral models.with these spectral fits we inferred a cluster membership criterium, as well asthe ages, dust extinctions, and photometric types of these flsbs. we show thatabout half of the coma cluster flsbs have a spectral energy distribution wellrepresented in our template library while the other half present a flux deficitat ultraviolet wavelengths. among the well represented, ~80% are probably partof the coma cluster based on their spectral energy distribution. they arerelatively young (younger than 2.3 gyrs for 90% of the sample) non-starburstobjects. the later their type, the younger flsbs are. a significant part of theflsbs are quite dusty objects. flsbs are low stellar mass objects (the latertheir type the less massive they are), with stellar masses comparable toglobular clusters for the faintest ones. their characteristics are correlatedwith infall directions, confirming the disruptive origin for part of them.
