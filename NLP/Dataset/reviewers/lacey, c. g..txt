0812.4399	testing the predictions of the cold dark matter model for the sizes,  colours, morphologies and luminosities of galaxies with the sdss	the huge size and uniformity of the sloan digital sky survey makes possiblean exacting test of current models of galaxy formation. we compare thepredictions of the galform semi-analytical galaxy formation model for theluminosities, morphologies, colours and scale-lengths of local galaxies.galform models the luminosity and size of the disk and bulge components of agalaxy, and so we can compute quantities which can be compared directly withsdss observations, such as the petrosian magnitude and the sersic index. wetest the predictions of two published models set in the cold dark mattercosmology: the baugh et al. (2005) model, which assumes a top-heavy initialmass function (imf) in starbursts and superwind feedback, and the bower et al.(2006) model, which uses agn feedback and a standard imf. the bower et al modelbetter reproduces the overall shape of the luminosity function, themorphology-luminosity relation and the colour bimodality observed in the sdssdata, but gives a poor match to the size-luminosity relation. the \baugh et al.model successfully predicts the size-luminosity relation for late-typegalaxies. both models fail to reproduce the sizes of bright early-typegalaxies. these problems highlight the need to understand better both the roleof feedback processes in determining galaxy sizes, in particular the treatmentof the angular momentum of gas reheated by supernovae, and the sizes of thestellar spheroids formed by galaxy mergers and disk instabilities.

0906.3522	modelling the dusty universe i: introducing the artificial neural  network and first applications to luminosity and colour distributions	we introduce a new technique based on artificial neural networks which allowsus to make accurate predictions for the spectral energy distributions (seds) oflarge samples of galaxies, at wavelengths ranging from the far-ultra-violet tothe sub-millimetre and radio. the neural net is trained to reproduce the sedspredicted by a hybrid code comprised of the galform semi-analytical model ofgalaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy mergerhistories, and the grasil spectro-photometric code, which carries out aself-consistent calculation of the sed, including absorption and emission ofradiation by dust. using a small number of galaxy properties predicted bygalform, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority ofcases to within 10% of those computed directly using grasil. the methodperforms best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and thefar-ultra-violet. the luminosity error introduced by the method has negligibleimpact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions orcolour distributions of galaxies. we use the neural net to predict the overlapbetween galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv and in the observer-frame sub-mmat z=2. we find that around half of the galaxies with a 850um flux above 5 mjyshould have optical magnitudes brighter than r_ab &lt; 25 mag. however, only 1% ofthe galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv down to r_ab &lt; 25 mag should have850um fluxes brighter than 5 mjy. our technique will allow the generation ofwide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame uv or mid- andfar-infrared wavelengths.

0908.1396	the redshift evolution of the mass function of cold gas in hierarchical  galaxy formation models	(abridged) accurately predicting how the cosmic abundance of neutral hydrogenevolves with redshift is a challenging problem facing modellers of galaxyformation. we investigate the predictions of four currently favouredsemi-analytical galaxy formation models applied to the millennium simulationfor the mass function of cold neutral gas (atomic and molecular) in galaxies asa function of redshift, and we use these predictions to construct number countsfor the next generation of all-sky neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) surveys.despite the different implementations of the physical ingredients of galaxyformation, we find that the model predictions are broadly consistent with oneanother; the key differences reflect how the models treat agn feedback and howthe timescale for star formation evolves with redshift. the models produce massfunctions of cold gas in galaxies that are generally in good agreement with hisurveys at $z$=0. interestingly we find that these mass functions do not evolvesignificantly with redshift. adopting a simple conversion factor for cold gasmass to hi mass that we apply to all galaxies at all redshifts, we derive massfunctions of hi in galaxies from the predicted mass functions of cold gas,which we use to predict the number counts of sources likely to be detected byhi surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the square kilometrearray and its pathfinders. we show also how adopting a conversion factor forcold gas mass to hi mass that varies from galaxy to galaxy impacts on numbercounts. in addition, we examine how the typical angular sizes of galaxies varywith redshift. taken together, these results make clear that forthcoming hisurveys will provide important and powerful tests of theoretical galaxyformation models.

0909.1567	predictions for herschel from lambdacdm: unveiling the cosmic star  formation history	we use a model for the evolution of galaxies in the far-ir based on thelambdacdm cosmology to make detailed predictions for upcoming cosmologicalsurveys with the herschel space observatory. we use the combined galformsemi-analytical galaxy formation model and grasil spectrophotometric code tocompute galaxy seds including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model,which is the same as that in baugh et al. (2005), assumes two different imfs: anormal solar neighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and avery top-heavy imf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shownpreviously that the top-heavy imf appears necessary to explain the numbercounts and redshifts of faint sub-mm galaxies. in this paper, we presentpredictions for galaxy luminosity functions, number counts and redshiftdistributions in the herschel imaging bands. we find that source confusion willbe a serious problem in the deepest planned surveys. we also show predictionsfor physical properties such as star formation rates and stellar, gas and halomasses, together with fluxes at other wavelengths (from the far-uv to theradio) relevant for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. we investigatewhat fraction of the total ir emission from dust and of the high-mass starformation over the history of the universe should be resolved by plannedsurveys with herschel, and find a fraction ~30-50%, depending on confusion.finally, we show that galaxies in herschel surveys should be significantlyclustered.

0704.1562	galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy  formation model with spitzer data	we present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,number counts and redshift distributions in the ir based on the lambda-cdmcosmological model. we use the combined galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model and grasil spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy sedsincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model, which is the sameas that in baugh et al (2005), assumes two different imfs: a normal solarneighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavyimf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shown previously thatthe top-heavy imf seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faintsub-mm galaxies. we compare the model with observational data from the spitzerspace telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen beforespitzer data became available. we find that the model matches the observedevolution in the ir remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probedby spitzer. in particular, the spitzer data show that there is strong evolutionin the mid-ir galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, andthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.on the other hand, a model with a normal imf in starbursts predicts far toolittle evolution in the mid-ir luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

0911.0669	probing dark energy with future redshift surveys: a comparison of  emission line and broad band selection in the near infrared	future galaxy surveys will map the galaxy distribution in the redshiftinterval $0.5&lt;z&lt;2$ using near-infrared cameras and spectrographs. the primaryscience goal of such surveys is to constrain the nature of the dark energy bymeasuring the large-scale structure of the universe. this requires a tracer ofthe underlying dark matter which maximizes the useful volume of the survey. weinvestigate two potential survey selection methods: an emission line samplebased on the \ha line and a sample selected in the h-band. we presentpredictions for the abundance and clustering of such galaxies, using twopublished versions of the \galform galaxy formation model. our models predictthat \ha selected galaxies tend to avoid massive dark matter haloes and insteadtrace the surrounding filamentary structure; h-band selected galaxies, on theother hand, are found in the highest mass haloes. this has implications for themeasurement of the rate at which fluctuations grow due to gravitationalinstability. we use mock catalogues to compare the effective volumes sampled bya range of survey configurations. to give just two examples: a redshift surveydown to $h_{\rm ab}=22$ samples an effective volume that is $\sim 5-10$ timeslarger than that probed by an \ha survey with $\logfha &gt; -15.4$; a flux limitof at least $\logfha = -16$ is required for an \ha sample to become competitivein effective volume.

0911.0686	empirical h-alpha emitter count predictions for dark energy surveys	future galaxy redshift surveys aim to measure cosmological quantities fromthe galaxy power spectrum. a prime example is the detection of baryonicacoustic oscillations (baos), providing a standard ruler to measure the darkenergy equation of state, w(z), to high precision. the strongest practicallimitation for these experiments is how quickly accurate redshifts can bemeasured for sufficient galaxies to map the large-scale structure. a promisingstrategy is to target emission-line (i.e. star-forming) galaxies athigh-redshift (z~0.5-2); not only is the space density of this populationincreasing out to z~2, but also emission-lines provide an efficient method ofredshift determination. motivated by the prospect of future dark energy surveystargeting h-alpha emitters at near-infrared wavelengths (i.e. z&gt;0.5), we usethe latest empirical data to model the evolution of the h-alpha luminosityfunction out to z~2, and thus provide predictions for the abundance of h-alphaemitters for practical limiting fluxes. we caution that the estimates presentedin this work must be tempered by an efficiency factor, epsilon, giving theredshift success rate from these potential targets. for a range of practicalefficiencies and limiting fluxes, we provide an estimate of np_{0.2}, where nis the 3d galaxy number density and p_{0.2} is the galaxy power spectrumevaluated at k=0.2h/mpc. ideal surveys must provide np_{0.2}&gt;1 in order tobalance shot-noise and cosmic variance errors. we show that a realisticemission-line survey (epsilon=0.5) could achieve np_{0.2}=1 out to z~1.5 with alimiting flux of 10^{-16} erg/s/cm^{-2}. if the limiting flux is a factor 5brighter, then this goal can only be achieved out to z~0.5, highlighting theimportance of survey depth and efficiency in cosmological redshift surveys.

1003.0008	the spatial distribution of cold gas in hierarchical galaxy formation  models	the distribution of cold gas in dark matter haloes is driven by key processesin galaxy formation: gas cooling, galaxy mergers, star formation and reheatingof gas by supernovae. we compare the predictions of four different galaxyformation models for the spatial distribution of cold gas. we find thatsatellite galaxies make little contribution to the abundance or clusteringstrength of cold gas selected samples, and are far less important than they arein optically selected samples. the halo occupation distribution function ofpresent-day central galaxies with cold gas mass &gt; 10^9 h^-1 msun is peakedaround a halo mass of ~ 10^11 h^-1 msun, a scale that is set by the agnsuppression of gas cooling. the model predictions for the projected correlationfunction are in good agreement with measurements from the hi parkes all-skysurvey. we compare the effective volume of possible surveys with the squarekilometre array with those expected for a redshift survey in the near-infrared.future redshift surveys using neutral hydrogen emission will be competitivewith the most ambitious spectroscopic surveys planned in the near-infrared.

1004.0711	the parameter space of galaxy formation	semi-analytic models are a powerful tool for studying the formation ofgalaxies. however, these models inevitably involve a significant number ofpoorly constrained parameters that must be adjusted to provide an acceptablematch to the observed universe. in this paper, we set out to quantify thedegree to which observational data-sets can constrain the model parameters. byrevealing degeneracies in the parameter space we can hope to better understandthe key physical processes probed by the data. we use novel mathematicaltechniques to explore the parameter space of the galform semi-analytic model.we base our investigation on the bower et al. 2006 version of galform, adoptingthe same methodology of selecting model parameters based on an acceptable matchto the local bj and k luminosity functions. the model contains 16 parametersthat are poorly constrained, and we investigate this parameter space using themodel emulator technique, constructing a bayesian approximation to the galformmodel that can be rapidly evaluated at any point in parameter space. bycombining successive waves of emulation, we show that only 0.26% of the initialvolume is of interest for further exploration. however, within this region weshow that the bower et al. 2006 model is only one choice from an extendedsub-space of model parameters that can provide equally acceptable fits. weexplore the geometry of this region and begin to explore the physicalconnections between parameters that are exposed by this analysis. we alsoconsider the impact of adding additional observational data to furtherconstrain the parameter space.

1004.3545	the evolution of lyman-break galaxies in cdm	we make a detailed investigation of the properties of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) in the lambdacdm model. we present predictions for two publishedvariants of the galform semi-analytical model: the baugh et al. (2005) model,which has star formation at high redshifts dominated by merger-drivenstarbursts with a top-heavy imf, and the bower et al. (2006) model, which hasagn feedback and a standard solar neighbourhood imf throughout. we showpredictions for the evolution of the rest-frame far-uv luminosity function inthe redshift range z=3-20, and compare with the observed luminosity functionsof lbgs at z=3-10. we find that the baugh et al. model is in excellentagreement with these observations, while the bower et al. model predicts toomany high-luminosity lbgs. dust extinction, which is predictedself-consistently based on galaxy gas contents, metallicities and sizes, isfound to have a large effect on lbg luminosities. we compare predictions forthe size evolution of lbgs at different luminosities with observational datafor 2&lt;z&lt;7, and find the baugh et al. model to be in good agreement. we presentpredictions for stellar, halo and gas masses, star formation rates, circularvelocities, bulge-to-disk ratios, gas and stellar metallicities and clusteringbias, as functions of far-uv luminosity and redshift. we find broad consistencywith current observational constraints. we then present predictions for theabundance and angular sizes of lbgs out to very high redshift (z&lt;20), findingthat planned deep surveys with jwst should detect objects out to z&lt;15. thetypical uv luminosities of galaxies are predicted to be very low at highredshifts, which has implications for detecting the galaxies responsible forreionizing the igm; for example, at z=10, 50% of the ionizing photons areexpected to be produced by galaxies fainter than m_ab(1500a)-5logh ~ -15.

1006.0230	the role of submillimetre galaxies in hierarchical galaxy formation	we study the role of submillimetre galaxies (smgs) in the galaxy formationprocess in the lambda cold dark matter cosmology. we use the baugh et al.(2005) semi-analytical model, which matches the observed smg number counts andredshift distribution by assuming a top-heavy initial mass function (imf) inbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we build galaxy merger trees and follow theevolution and properties of smgs and their descendants. our primary sample ofmodel smgs consists of galaxies which had 850 mu fluxes brighter than 5 mjy atsome redshift z&gt;1. our model predicts that the present-day descendants of suchsmgs cover a wide range of stellar masses ~ 10^{10} - 10^{12} msun/h, with amedian ~ 10^{11} msun/h, and that more than 70% of these descendants arebulge-dominated. more than 50% of present day galaxies with stellar masseslarger than 7 x 10^{11} msun/h are predicted to be descendants of such smgs. wefind that although smgs make an important contribution to the total starformation rate at z~2, the final stellar mass produced in the submillimetrephase contributes only 0.2% of the total present-day stellar mass, and 2% ofthe stellar mass of smg descendants, in stark contrast to the popular picturein which the smg phase marks the production of the bulk of the mass of presentday massive ellipticals.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

1006.4637	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies: introducing the  artificial neural network	the spectral energy distribution of galaxies is a complex function of thestar formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas ingalaxies. the computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiationthrough the dust distribution is time-consuming. this aspect becomesunacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then comparedwith multi-wavelength surveys. mainly for this aim, we have implemented anartificial neural network algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiativetransfer code grasil in order to compute the spectral energy distribution ofgalaxies in a short computing time. this allows to avoid the adoption ofempirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies outputby models. the ann has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum(the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-formingmolecular clouds and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties anddependencies). we have defined the input neurons effectively determining theiremission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and isnot linked to a particular galaxy formation model. we have trained the net forthe disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce thesed of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model forspheroidal galaxies. we have checked that for this model both the seds and thegalaxy counts in the herschel bands obtained with the ann approximation arealmost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full grasil. weconclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present theapplication to a more complex sam in another paper.

1105.3731	the nature and descendants of lyman-break galaxies in the lambdacdm  cosmology	we predict the formation histories, properties and descendants of lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) in the lambda-cdm cosmology. in our model, which incorporates atop-heavy imf in starbursts, we find that most lbgs are starbursts triggered byminor mergers of galaxies. the duration of the lbg phase is predicted to bequite short, ~20-60 myr. we investigate the distributions of stellar and halomasses and morphologies for bright (l_uv &gt; l*_uv) and faint (l_uv &gt; 0.1 l*_uv)lbgs at z=3, z=6 and z=10 (where we classify lbgs according to their rest-frameuv luminosities relative the observed characteristic luminosity l*_uv at z\approx 3). bright lbgs at z=3 are predicted to have median stellar masses ~1x10^9 msun/h and host halo masses ~ 3x10^{11} msun/h, and to be typicallymildly disk-dominated in stellar mass. on the other hand, faint lbgs at z=10are predicted to have median stellar masses of only ~ 1x10^7 msun/h and hosthalo masses 2x10^{10} msun/h, and to be generally bulge-dominated. bright lbgsat z=3 evolve to present-day galaxies with median stellar mass ~ 5x^{10} msun/h(comparable to the milky way), consisting of roughly equal numbers of disk- andbulge-dominated systems, and hosted by halos with median mass ~2x10^{13} msun/h(corresponding to medium-size galaxy groups). the model predicts that 40% ofmilky way mass galaxies at the present-day have a bright lbg progenitor in theredshift range 3&lt;z&lt;4, while 95% have a faint lbg progenitor in the sameredshift range, and 7% have a faint lbg progenitor at 10&lt;z&lt;11. with ourmultiwavelength model, we also investigate the overlap between the lbgpopulation and that of submillimetre selected galaxies (smgs); at z=3, only ~1%of bright lbgs are also predicted to also be bright smgs (with an 850 mum fluxin excess of 5 mjy).

1111.0721	the contribution of star-forming galaxies to fluctuations in the cosmic  background light	star-forming galaxies which are too faint to be detected individually produceintensity fluctuations in the cosmic background light. this contribution needsto be taken into account as a foreground when using the primordial signal toconstrain cosmological parameters. the extragalactic fluctuations are alsointeresting in their own right as they depend on the star formation history ofthe universe and the way in which this connects with the formation of cosmicstructure. we present a new framework which allows us to predict the occupationof dark matter haloes by star-forming galaxies and uses this information, inconjunction with an n-body simulation of structure formation, to predict thepower spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the infrared background. we computethe emission from galaxies at far-infrared, millimetre and radio wavelengths.our method gives accurate predictions for the clustering of galaxies both forthe one halo and two halo terms. we illustrate our new framework using apreviously published model which reproduces the number counts and redshiftdistribution of galaxies selected by their emission at $850\,\mu$m. withoutadjusting any of the model parameters, the predictions show encouragingagreement at high frequencies and on small angular scales with recent estimatesof the extragalactic fluctuations in the background made from early dataanalysed by the planck collaboration. there are, however, substantialdiscrepancies between the model predictions and observations on large angularscales and at low frequencies, which illustrates the usefulness of theintensity fluctuations as a constraint on galaxy formation models.

0710.3557	luminous red galaxies in hierarchical cosmologies	luminous red galaxies (lrgs) are much rarer and more massive than l*galaxies. coupled with their extreme colours, lrgs therefore provide ademanding testing ground for the physics of massive galaxy formation. wepresent the first self-consistent predictions for the abundance and propertiesof lrgs in hierarchical structure formation models. we test two publishedmodels which use quite different mechanisms to suppress the formation ofmassive galaxies: the bower et al. (2006) model, which invokes ``agn-feedback''to prevent gas from cooling in massive haloes, and the baugh et al. (2005)model which relies upon a ``superwind'' to eject gas before it is turned intostars. without adjusting any parameters, the bower et al. model gives anexcellent match to the observed luminosity function of lrgs in the sdss (with amedian redshift of z=0.24) and to their clustering; the baugh et al. model isless successful in these respects. both models fail to match the observedabundance of lrgs at z=0.5 to better than a factor of ~2. in the models, lrgsare typically bulge dominated systems with m* of ~2x10^11 h^{-1} m_sun andvelocity dispersions of ~250 km s^{-1}. around half of the stellar mass in themodel lrgs is already formed by z~2.2 and is assembled into one main progenitorby z~1.5; on average, only 25% of the mass of the main progenitor is addedafter z~1. lrgs are predicted to be found in a wide range of halo masses, aconclusion which relies on properly taking into account the scatter in theformation histories of haloes. remarkably, we find that the correlationfunction of lrgs is predicted to be a power law down to small pair separations,in excellent agreement with observational estimates. neither the bower et al.nor the baugh et al. model is able to reproduce the observed radii of lrgs.

1203.3598	the structure of reionization in hierarchical galaxy formation models	understanding the epoch of reionization and the properties of the firstgalaxies represents an important goal for modern cosmology. the structure ofreionization, and hence the observed power spectrum of redshifted 21cmfluctuations are known to be sensitive to the astrophysical properties of thegalaxies that drove reionization. thus, detailed measurements of the 21cm powerspectrum and its evolution could lead to measurements of the properties ofearly galaxies that are otherwise inaccessible. in this paper, we makepredictions for the ionised structure during reionization and the 21cm powerspectrum based on detailed models of galaxy formation. we combine thesemi-analytic galform model implemented within the millennium-ii dark mattersimulation, with a semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionizationstructure. using these models we show that the details of sne and radiativefeedback affect the structure and distribution of ionised regions, and hencethe slope and amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum. these results indicatethat forthcoming measurements of the 21cm power-spectrum could be used touncover details of early galaxy formation. we find that the strength of snefeedback is the dominant effect governing the evolution of structure duringreionization. in particular we show sne feedback to be more important thanradiative feedback, the presence of which we find does not influence either thetotal stellar mass or overall ionising photon budget. thus, if sne feedback iseffective at suppressing star formation in high redshift galaxies, we find thatphotoionization feedback does not lead to self-regulation of the reionizationprocess as has been thought.

1208.2985	on the role of feedback in shaping the cosmic abundance and clustering  of neutral atomic hydrogen in galaxies	we investigate the impact of feedback - from supernovae (sne), activegalactic nuclei (agn) and a photo-ionizing background at high redshifts - onthe neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) mass function, the $b_{\rm j}$ band luminosityfunction, and the spatial clustering of these galaxies at $z$=0. we use aversion of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform that calculatesself-consistently the amount of hi in a galaxy as a function of cosmic time andlinks its star formation rate to its mass of molecular hydrogen (h$_2$). wefind that a systematic increase or decrease in the strength of sne feedbackleads to a systematic decrease or increase in the amplitudes of the luminosityand hi mass functions, but has little influence on their overall shapes.varying the strength of agn feedback influences only the numbers of thebrightest or most hi massive galaxies, while the impact of varying the strengthof photo-ionization feedback is restricted to changing the numbers of thefaintest or least hi massive galaxies.our results suggest that the hi massfunction is a more sensitive probe of the consequences of cosmologicalreionization for galaxy formation than the luminosity function. we find thatincreasing the strength of any of the modes of feedback acts to weaken theclustering strength of galaxies, regardless of their hi-richness. in contrast,weaker agn feedback has little effect on the clustering strength whereas weakersne feedback increases the clustering strength of hi-poor galaxies morestrongly than hi-rich galaxies. these results indicate that forthcoming hisurveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the square kilometre arrayand its pathfinders will be exploited most fruitfully as part ofmultiwavelength survey campaigns.

1209.2152	the uv colours and dust attenuation of lyman-break galaxies	using galform, a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation in the lambda colddark matter cosmology, we study the rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) colours oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) in the redshift range 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 10. as the impactof dust on uv luminosity can be dramatic, our model includes a self-consistentcomputation of dust attenuation based on a radiative transfer model. we findthat intrinsically brighter galaxies suffer stronger dust attenuation thanfainter ones, though the relation has a large scatter. the model predictsgalaxies with uv colours consistent with the colour selection regions designedto select lbgs in observational surveys. we find that the drop-out techniquethat selects lbgs based on two rest-frame uv colours is robust and effective,selecting more than 70 per cent of uv bright galaxies at a given redshift. weinvestigate the impact on the predicted uv colours of varying selected modelparameters. we find that the uv colours are most sensitive to the modelling ofdust attenuation and in particular, to the extinction curve used in theradiative transfer calculation. if we assume a milky way dust extinction curve,the predicted uv continuum slopes are, in general, bluer than observed.however, we find that the opposite is true when using the small magellaniccloud dust extinction curve. this demonstrates the strong dependence of uvcolours on dust properties and highlights the inadequacy of using the uvcontinuum slope as a tracer of dust attenuation without any further knowledgeof the galaxy inclination or dust characteristics in high redshift galaxies.

0712.2280	the assembly bias of dark matter haloes to higher orders	we use an extremely large volume ($2.4h^{-3}{\rm gpc}^{3}$), high resolutionn-body simulation to measure the higher order clustering of dark matter haloesas a function of mass and internal structure. as a result of the largesimulation volume and the use of a novel ``cross-moment'' counts-in-cellstechnique which suppresses discreteness noise, we are able to measure theclustering of haloes corresponding to rarer peaks than was possible in previousstudies; the rarest haloes for which we measure the variance are 100 times moreclustered than the dark matter. we are able to extract, for the first time,halo bias parameters from linear up to fourth order. for all orders measured,we find that the bias parameters are a strong function of mass for haloes moremassive than the characteristic mass $m_{*}$. currently, no theoretical modelis able to reproduce this mass dependence closely. we find that the biasparameters also depend on the internal structure of the halo up to fourthorder. for haloes more massive than $m_{*}$, we find that the more concentratedhaloes are more weakly clustered than the less concentrated ones. we see nodependence of clustering on concentration for haloes with masses $m&lt;m_{*}$;this is contrary to the trend reported in the literature when segregatinghaloes by their formation time. our results are insensitive to whether haloesare labelled by the total mass returned by the friends-of-friends group finderor by the mass of the most massive substructure. this implies that ourconclusions are not an artefact of the particular choice of group findingalgorithm. our results will provide important input to theoretical models ofgalaxy clustering.

1303.3051	variation in the escape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies and  the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum during reionization	the observed power spectrum of redshifted 21cm fluctuations is known to besensitive to the astrophysical properties of the galaxies that drovereionization. thus, detailed measurements of the 21cm power spectrum and itsevolution could lead to measurements of the properties of early galaxies thatare otherwise inaccessible. in this paper, we study the effect of mass andredshift dependent escape fractions of ionizing radiation on the ability offorthcoming experiments to constrain galaxy formation via the redshifted 21cmpower spectrum. we use a model for reionization which combines the hierarchicalgalaxy formation model galform implemented within the millennium-ii dark mattersimulation, with a semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionizationstructure. using this model we show that the structure and distribution ofionised regions at fixed neutral fraction, and hence the slope and amplitude ofthe 21 cm power spectrum, is dependent on the variation of ionising photonescape fraction with galaxy mass and redshift. however, we find that theinfluence of the unknown escape fraction and its evolution is smaller than thedominant astrophysical effect provided by sne feedback strength in highredshift galaxies. the unknown escape fraction of ionizing radiation fromgalaxies is therefore unlikely to prevent measurement of the properties of highredshift star formation using observations of the 21cm power spectrum.

1303.7228	how well can we really estimate the stellar masses of galaxies from  broadband photometry?	the estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize howthe galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. if stellar masses can beestimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such asthe stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxyformation. we explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fittingbroad-band spectral energy distributions (seds) with stellar population models,can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for thestar-formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dustattenuation curves of galaxies. we apply the observational technique ofbroad-band sed fitting to model galaxy seds calculated by the theoreticalgalaxy formation model galform, isolating the effect of each of theseassumptions. we find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, thecommon assumption of exponentially declining star-formation histories does notadversely affect stellar mass estimation. we show that fixing the metallicityin sed fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce massdependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. we find that the commonassumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dustscreen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantlyunderestimated. finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered byapplying sed fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differsignificantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functionspredicted by a given model. given these differences, our methodology of usingstellar masses estimated from model galaxy seds offers a new, self-consistentway to compare model predictions with observations.

1305.2199	the most luminous quasars do not live in the most massive dark matter  haloes at any redshift	quasars represent the brightest active galactic nuclei (agn) in the universeand are thought to indicate the location of prodigiously growing black holes(bhs), with luminosities as high as 10^48 erg/sec. it is often expected thoughthat such an extremely energetic process will take place in the most massivebound structures in the dark matter (dm) distribution. we show that in contrastto this expectation, in a galaxy formation model which includes agn feedback,quasars are predicted to live in average dm halo environments with typicalmasses of a few times 10^12 msun. this fundamental prediction arises from thefact that quasar activity (i.e., bh accretion with luminosity greater than10^46 erg/sec) is inhibited in dm haloes where agn feedback operates. thegalaxy hosts of quasars in our simulations are identified with over massive (ingas and stars) spheroidal galaxies, in which bh accretion is triggered via agalaxy merger or secular processes. we further show that the z=0 descendants ofhigh redshift (z~6) qsos span a wide range of morphologies, galaxy and halomasses. the z~6 bhs typically grow only by a modest factor by the present day.remarkably, high redshift qsos never inhabit the largest dm haloes at that timeand their descendants are very seldom found in the most massive haloes at z=0.we also show that observationally it is very likely to find an enhancement inthe abundance of galaxies around quasars at z~5. however, these enhancementsare considerably weaker compared to the overdensities expected at the extremepeaks of the dm distribution. thus, it is very unlikely that a quasar detectedin the $z\gtrsim5$ universe pinpoints the location of the progenitors ofsuperclusters in the local universe.

1305.2200	constraints on black hole fuelling modes from the clustering of x-ray  agn	we present a clustering analysis of x-ray selected agn by compiling x-raysamples from the literature and re-estimating the dark matter (dm) halo massesof agn in a uniform manner. we find that moderate luminosity agn (lx(2-10kev)=10^42-10^44 erg/sec) in the z=0-1.3 universe are typically found in dmhaloes with masses of ~10^13 msun. we then compare our findings to thetheoretical predictions of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation modelgalform. we find good agreement when our calculation includes the hot-halo modeof accretion onto the central black hole. this type of accretion, which isadditional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxymergers, is tightly coupled to the agn feedback in the model. the hot-halo modebecomes prominent in dm haloes with masses greater than ~10^12.5 msun, whereagn feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderateluminosity agn that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. cold gas fuellingof the black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred dm halo masses ofx-ray agn. switching off agn feedback in the model results in a largepopulation of luminous quasars (lx(2-10 kev) &gt; 10^44 erg/sec) in dm haloes withmasses up to ~10^14 msun, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering ofquasars. the abundance of hot-halo agn decreases significantly in the z~3-4universe. at such high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsiblefor shaping the environment of moderate luminosity agn. our analysis supportstwo accretion modes (cold and hot) for the fuelling of supermassive black holesand strongly underlines the importance of agn feedback in cosmological modelsboth of galaxy formation and black hole growth.

1309.3350	the cross-power spectrum between 21cm emission and galaxies in  hierarchical galaxy formation models	the correlation between 21cm fluctuations and galaxies is sensitive to theastrophysical properties of the galaxies that drove reionization. thus,detailed measurements of the cross-power spectrum and its evolution couldprovide a powerful measurement both of the properties of early galaxies and theprocess of reionization. in this paper, we study the evolution of thecross-power spectrum between 21cm emission and galaxies using a model whichcombines the hierarchical galaxy formation model galform implemented within themillennium-ii dark matter simulation, with a semi-numerical scheme to describethe resulting ionization structure. we find that inclusion of differentfeedback processes changes the cross-power spectrum shape and amplitude. inparticular, the feature in the cross-power spectrum corresponding to the sizeof ionized regions is significantly affected by supernovae feedback. wecalculate predicted observational uncertainties of the cross-correlationcoefficient based on specifications of the murchison widefield array (mwa)combined with galaxy surveys of varying area and depth. we find that thecross-power spectrum could be detected over several square degrees of galaxysurvey with galaxy redshift errors less than 0.1.

1309.7057	a new model of galaxy formation: how sensitive are predicted galaxy  luminosities to the choice of sps model?	we present a new release of the galform semi-analytical model of galaxyformation and evolution, which exploits a millennium simulation-class n-bodyrun performed with the wmap7 cosmology. we use this new model to study theimpact of the choice of stellar population synthesis (sps) model on thepredicted evolution of the galaxy luminosity function. the semi-analyticalmodel is run using seven different sps models. in each case we obtain therest-frame luminosity function in the far-ultra-violet, optical andnear-infrared (nir) wavelength ranges. we find that both the predictedrest-frame ultra-violet and optical luminosity function are insensitive to thechoice of sps model. however, we find that the predicted evolution of therest-frame nir luminosity function depends strongly on the treatment of thethermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stellar phase in the spsmodels, with differences larger than a factor of 2 for model galaxies brighterthan $m_{\rm ab}(k)-5$log$h&lt;-22$ ($\sim$l$_*$ for $0\leq z\leq 1.5$). we havealso explored the predicted number counts of galaxies, finding remarkableagreement between the results with different choices of sps model, except whenselecting galaxies with very red optical-nir colours. the predicted numbercounts of these extremely red galaxies appear to be more affected by thetreatment of star formation in disks than by the treatment of tp-agb stars inthe sps models.

1310.4178	which galaxies dominate the neutral gas content of the universe?	we study the contribution of galaxies with different properties to the globaldensities of star formation rate (sfr), atomic (hi) and molecular hydrogen (h2)as a function of redshift. we use the galform model of galaxy formation, whichis set in the lcdm framework. this model includes a self-consistent calculationof the sfr, which depends on the h2 content of galaxies. the predicted sfrdensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellarmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. the modelpredicts a modest evolution of the hi density at z&lt;3, which is also inagreement with the observations. the hi density is predicted to be alwaysdominated by galaxies with sfr&lt;1msun/yr. this contrasts with the h2 density,which is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with sfr&gt;10msun/yr. currenthigh-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxieswith sfr&gt;30msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the h2 in theuniverse. in terms of stellar mass, the predicted h2 density is dominated bymassive galaxies, mstellar&gt;10^10msun, while the hi density is dominated by lowmass galaxies, mstellar&lt;10^9msun. in the context of upcoming neutral gassurveys, we suggest that the faint nature of the galaxies dominating the hicontent of the universe will hamper the identification of optical counterparts,while for h2, we expect follow up observations of molecular emission lines ofalready existing galaxy catalogues to be able to uncover the h2 density of theuniverse.

1410.5437	the origin of the atomic and molecular gas contents of early-type  galaxies. ii. misaligned gas accretion	we study the origin of the wide distribution of angles between the angularmomenta of the stellar and gas components, $\alpha_{\rm g,s}$, in early-typegalaxies (etgs). we use the galform model of galaxy formation, set in the$\lambda$ cold dark matter framework, and coupled it with a monte-carlosimulation to follow the angular momenta flips driven by matter accretion ontohaloes and galaxies. we consider a gas disk to be misaligned with respect tothe stellar body if $\alpha_{\rm g,s}&gt;30$~degrees. by assuming that the onlysources of misaligments in galaxies are galaxy mergers, we place a lower limitof $2-5$ per cent on the fraction of etgs with misaligned gas/stellarcomponents. these low fractions are inconsistent with the observed value of$\approx 42\pm 6$ per cent in atlas$^{\rm 3d}$. in the more general case, inwhich smooth gas accretion in addition to galaxy mergers can drivemisalignments, our calculation predicts that $\approx 46$ per cent of etgs have$\alpha_{\rm g,s}&gt;30$~degrees. in this calculation, we find correlationsbetween $\alpha_{\rm g,s}$ and stellar mass, cold gas fraction and starformation rate, such that etgs with high masses, low cold gas fractions and lowstar formation rates are more likely to display aligned cold gas and stellarcomponents. we confirm these trends observationally for the first time usingatlas$^{\rm 3d}$ data. we argue that the high fraction of misaligned gas discsobserved in etgs is mostly due to smooth gas accretion (e.g. cooling from thehot halo of galaxies) which takes place after most of the stellar mass of thegalaxy is in place and comes misaligned with respect to the stellar component.galaxies that have accreted most of their cold gas content prior to the timewhere most of the stellar mass was in place show aligned components.

1501.01564	galaxy formation &amp; dark matter modelling in the era of the square  kilometre array	theoretical galaxy formation models are an established and powerful tool forinterpreting the astrophysical significance of observational data, particularlygalaxy surveys. such models have been utilised with great success by opticalsurveys such as 2dfgrs and sdss, but their application to radio surveys of coldgas in galaxies has been limited. in this chapter we describe recentdevelopments in the modelling of the cold gas properties in the models, and howthese developments are essential if they are to be applied to cold gas surveysof the kind that will be carried out with the ska. by linking explicitly agalaxy's star formation rate to the abundance of molecular hydrogen in thegalaxy rather than cold gas abundance, as was assumed previously, the latestmodels reproduce naturally many of the global atomic and molecular hydrogenproperties of observed galaxies. we review some of the key results of thelatest models and highlight areas where further developments are necessary. wediscuss also how model predictions can be most accurately compared withobservational data, what challenges we expect when creating synthetic galaxysurveys in the ska era, and how the ska can be used to test models of darkmatter.

1511.03052	a hybrid multi resolution scheme to efficiently model the structure of  reionization on the largest scales	redshifted 21cm measurements of the structure of ionised regions that growduring reionization promise to provide a new probe of early galaxy andstructure formation. one of the challenges of modelling reionization is toaccount both for the sub-halo scale physics of galaxy formation and the regionsof ionization on scales that are many orders of magnitude larger. to bridgethis gap we first calculate the statistical relationship between ionizingluminosity and mpc-scale overdensity using detailed models of galaxy formationcomputed using relatively small volume - ($\sim$100mpc/$h$)$^{3}$, highresolution dark matter simulations. we then use a monte-carlo technique toapply this relationship to reionization of the intergalactic medium withinlarge volume dark matter simulations - ($&gt;$1gpc/$h$)$^{3}$. the resultingsimulations can be used to address the contribution of very large scaleclustering of galaxies to the structure of reionization, and show that volumeslarger than 500mpc/$h$ are required to probe the largest reionization featuresmid-way through reionization. as an example application of our technique, wedemonstrate that the predicted 21cm power spectrum amplitude and gradient couldbe used to determine the importance of supernovae feedback for early galaxyformation.

astro-ph;0001308	the infrared side of galaxy formation. i. the local universe in the  semi-analytical framework	we present a new evolutionary model for the far-uv to sub-mm properties ofthe galaxy population. this combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelbased on hierarchical clustering (galform) with a spectro-photometric codewhich includes dust reprocessing (grasil). the former provides the starformation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass andvarious geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formedin different density environments. these quantities allow us to model the sedsof galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction andre-emission. two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. themodel includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starburststriggered by galaxy mergers. we test our models against the observedspectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local universe. the modelsreproduce fairly well the seds of normal spirals and starbursts, and theirinternal extinction properties. the starbursts follow the observed relationshipbetween the fir to uv luminosity ratio and the slope of the uv continuum. theyalso reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (calzetti et al 99). thisresult is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the milkyway extinction law. it suggests that the observed attenuation law is related tothe geometry of the stars and dust. we compute galaxy luminosity functions overour wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement withobservational data. the uv continuum turns out to be a poor star formationindicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

astro-ph;0002457	non-uniform reionization by galaxies and its effect on the cosmic  microwave backgroun	we present predictions for the reionization of the intergalactic medium bystars in high-redshift galaxies. we calculate ionizing luminosities ofgalaxies, including the effects of absorption by interstellar gas and dust onthe escape fraction, in order to calculate the filling factor of ionizedhydrogen in the igm. for a $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ cosmology and a physicalcalculation of the escape fraction, we find that the hydrogen in the igm willbe reionized at redshift z=6.1 if the igm has uniform density, but only byz=4.5 if the igm is clumped. we combine our model with an n-body simulation ofthe distribution of dark matter in the universe in order to calculate thesecondary temperature anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background(cmb) by scattering off free electrons. the models predict a spectrum ofsecondary anisotropies covering a broad range of angular scales, withfractional temperature fluctuations $\sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ on arcminute scales.the amplitude depends somewhat on the geometry of reionization, with models inwhich the regions of highest gas density are reionized first giving larger cmbfluctuations than the case where galaxies ionize surrounding spherical regions,and models where low density regions reionize first giving the smallestfluctuations. measurement of these anisotropies can therefore put importantconstraints on the reionization process, in particular, the redshift evolutionof the filling factor, and should be a primary objective of a next generationsubmillimeter telescope such as the atacama large millimeter array.

astro-ph;0006109	the impact of galaxy formation on the x-ray evolution of clusters	we present a new model for the x-ray properties of the intracluster mediumthat explicitly includes heating of the gas by the energy released during theevolution of cluster galaxies. we calculate the evolution of clusters bycombining the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation of cole et al. with asimple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas. we focus on thecluster x-ray luminosity function and on the relation between x-ray temperatureand luminosity. we show that cooling alone is not enough to account for theflatness of the observed t-l relation or for the lack of strong redshiftevolution in the observed x-ray luminosity function. gas heating, on the otherhand, can solve these two problems: in the \lambda-cdm cosmology, our modelreproduces fairly well the t-l relation and the x-ray luminosity function.furthermore, it predicts only weak evolution in these two properties out toz=0.5, in agreement with recent observational data. a successful model requiresan energy input of 1--2 x 10^49 ergs per solar mass of stars formed. this iscomparable to the total energy released by the supernovae associated with theformation of the cluster galaxies. thus, unless the transfer of supernovaeenergy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically) efficient,additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from agn winds arerequired. however, the amplification of an initial energy input by the responseof the intracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energyrequirements. our model makes definite predictions for the x-ray properties ofgroups and clusters at high redshift which may soon be tested with data fromthe chandra and newton satellites.

astro-ph;0008216	modelling the extinction properties of galaxies	recently (granato, lacey, silva et al. 2000, astro-ph/0001308) we havecombined our spectrophotometric galaxy evolution code which includes dustreprocessing (grasil, silva et al. 1998) with semi-analytical galaxy formationmodels (galform, cole et al. 1999). one of the most characteristic features ofthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloudcomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellarmedium. as a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have differentgeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential inunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular thoseundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. indeed, our mergedgrasil+galform model reproduces fairly well the seds of normal spirals andstarbursts from the far-uv to the sub-mm and their internal extinctionproperties. in particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law(calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,and has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.

astro-ph;0101368	polarization of the cosmic microwave background from non-uniform  reionization	we study the signal in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarizationanisotropy resulting from patchy reionization. it is well known that theprimordial polarization of the cmb is very sensitive to the details ofreionization. combining a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, in which theoptical depth to the reionization epoch is in the range 0.014 to 0.048, with ahigh resolution n-body simulation we find that reionization generates a peakwith amplitude 0.05~0.15 \mu k at large angular scales. the position of thispeak reveals the size of the horizon at reionization, whilst its amplitude is ameasure of the optical depth to reionization. on small scales, ionized patchesprior to full reionization create a second order polarization signal due to thecoupling of the free electron density fluctuation with the quadrupole moment ofthe temperature anisotropy. careful study reveals that the coupling generatesthe same power spectra for electric and magnetic modes, whose amplitudes ofpolarization anisotropies from this process are predicted to be ~10nk. theamplitude depends strongly on the total baryon density $\omega_b$ and on thespatial correlations of the free electron density in the ionized regions, andweakly on the fraction of ionizing photons able to escape their source galaxy,$f_{esc}$. the first- and second-order signals are therefore sensitive to thedetails of how the reionization occurred. detection of these signals will placeimportant constraints on the reionization history of the universe.

astro-ph;0103092	the evolution of the galaxy distribution	we follow the evolution of the galaxy population in a lambda-cdm cosmology bymeans of high-resolution n-body simulations in which the formation of galaxiesand their observable properties are calculated using a semi-analytic model. wedisplay images of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations thatillustrate its evolution and provide a qualitative understanding of theprocesses responsible for various biases that develop. we consider threespecific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlationlength (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, themorphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxyisodensity surfaces. for galaxies with luminosity below l*, the z=0 correlationlength depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brightergalaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10mpc/h. the"accelerated" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,which is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strongmorphology-density relation. remarkably, this relation is alreadywell-established at z=1. the genus curves of the galaxies are significantlydifferent from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due togenuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of thedensity field provided by galaxies. the predictions of our model at z=0 will betested by forthcoming data from the 2df and sloan galaxy surveys, and those atz=1 by the deep and virmos surveys.

astro-ph;0108217	the effects of photoionization on galaxy formation - i: model and  results at z=0	we develop a coupled model for the evolution of the global properties of theintergalactic medium (igm) and the formation of galaxies, in the presence of aphotoionizing background due to stars and quasars. we use this model to predictthe thermodynamic history of the igm when photoionized by galaxies forming in acold dark matter (cdm) universe. the evolution of the galaxies is calculatedusing a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects oftidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting insidelarger dark matter halos. we include in the model the negative feedback ongalaxy formation from the photoionizing background. photoionization inhibitsgalaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos in two ways: (i) heating of theigm and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark halos by the igm pressure,and (ii) reduction in the radiative cooling of gas within halos. the result ofour method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the igm. the igmis reheated twice (during reionization of hi and heii), and we find that thestar formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episodeof reheating. we find that galaxies brighter than l_* are mostly unaffected byreionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced,leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint endslopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. reionization alsoaffects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandableway.

astro-ph;0302450	what shapes the luminosity function of galaxies?	we investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function.beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos, we show how gas cooling,photoionization, feedback, merging and thermal conduction affect the shape ofthe luminosity function. we consider three processes whereby supernovae canaffect the forming galaxy: (1) reheating of disk gas to the halo temperature;(2) expansion of the diffuse halo gas; (3) expulsion of cold disk gas from thehalo. while feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of theluminosity function, this alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed atlarge luminosities. feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve this problem.the relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if coolingin massive halos is strongly suppressed. conduction is a promising mechanism,but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to thedesired level. if, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of brightgalaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to thegalaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernovaexplosions. the mechanism is only viable if the formation of centralsupermassive black holes play a crucial role in limiting the amount of starsthat form in the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0307298	heating of galactic disks by infalling satellites	we develop an analytic model to calculate the rate at which galaxy disks areheated by dark matter substructures orbiting in their halos. the model takesinto account the internal structure, mass function and accretion rate ofsatellites expected in the lambdacdm cosmology, as well as the growth of thedisk by accretion and mergers, but it ignores resonant heating of the disk andthe dynamical effects of spiral arms and bars. we calibrate this model againstn-body simulations and demonstrate that it is able to reproduce the n-bodyheating rates to within a factor of 3 in the majority of cases. our model givesthe distribution of disk scale-heights for galaxies of different luminosities.for l* spiral galaxies, it predicts a median disk thickness of only 5% of theradial scale-length if substructure is the only source of heating. the mediandisk thickness increases to nearly 20% of the radial scale-length when heatingdue to gravitational scattering of stars by molecular clouds is also included.the latter value is close to the thickness estimated observationally for thedisk of the milky way galaxy. the distribution of disk thickness predicted bythe model is also consistent with a recent observational determination forsub-l* galaxies by bizyaev &amp; mitronova. thus, the observed thickness of thestellar disks of spiral galaxies seems to be entirely compatible with theabundance of substructure in dark matter halos predicted by the standardlambda-dominated cold dark matter model of structure formation. in an omega_0=1universe, our best model of galaxy formation produces similar scale-heights, aconsequence of the fact that similar amounts of substructure are accreted byhalos during the lifetime of the disk in omega_0=1 and omega_0=0.3,lambda_0=0.7 cold dark matter cosmologies.

astro-ph;0406069	can the faint sub-mm galaxies be explained in the lambda-cdm model?	we present predictions for the abundance of sub-mm galaxies (smgs) andlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology. a key feature of ourmodel is the self-consistent calculation of the absorption and emission ofradiation by dust. the new model successfully matches the lbg luminosityfunction, as well reproducing the properties of the local galaxy population inthe optical and ir. the model can also explain the observed galaxy numbercounts at $850\mum$, but only if we assume a top-heavy imf for the stars formedin bursts. the predicted redshift distribution of smgs depends relativelylittle on their flux over the range 1-$10\mjy$, with a median value of$z\approx 2.0$ at a flux of $5\mjy$, in very good agreement with the recentmeasurement by chapman et al the counts of smgs are predicted to be dominatedby ongoing starbursts. however, in the model these bursts are responsible formaking only a few per cent of the stellar mass locked up in massive ellipticalsat the present day.

astro-ph;0508186	the properties of ly-alpha emitting galaxies in hierarchical galaxy  formation models	we present detailed predictions for the properties of ly-alpha-emittinggalaxies in the framework of the lambda-cdm cosmology, calculated using thesemi-analytical galaxy formation model galform. we explore a model whichassumes a top-heavy imf in starbursts, and which has previously been shown toexplain the sub-mm number counts and the luminosity function of lyman-breakgalaxies at high redshift. we show that this model, with the simple assumptionthat a fixed fraction of ly-alpha photons escape from each galaxy, isremarkably successful at explaining the observed luminosity function ofly-alpha emitters over the redshift range 3&lt;z&lt;6.6. we also examine thedistribution of ly-alpha equivalent widths and the broad-band continuummagnitudes of emitters, which are in good agreement with the availableobservations. we look more deeply into the nature of ly-alpha emitters,presenting predictions for fundamental properties such as the stellar mass andradius of the emitting galaxy and the mass of the host dark matter halo. themodel predicts that the clustering of ly-alpha emitters at high redshiftsshould be strongly biased relative to the dark matter, in agreement withobservational estimates. we also present predictions for the luminosityfunction of ly-alpha emitters at z&gt;7, a redshift range which is starting to bebe probed by near-ir surveys and using new instruments such as dazle.

astro-ph;0511338	the broken hierarchy of galaxy formation	recent observations of the distant universe suggest that much of the stellarmass of bright galaxies was already in place at $z&gt;1$. this presents achallenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembledlate in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (cdm). in this paper,we discuss a new implementation of the durham semi-analytic model in whichfeedback due to active galactic nuclei (agn) is assumed to quench cooling flowsin massive halos. this mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxyluminosity function at bright magnitudes. the model is implemented within themillennium n-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and largenumber of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulationprovides results in highly accurate statistics. after adjusting the values ofthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of localgalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the k-band luminosity andgalaxy stellar mass functions. we also calculate the volume averaged starformation rate density of the universe as a function of redshift and the way inwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. the modelrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift$z\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasingredshift in objects of all masses. although observational data on theseproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxyformation, we find that when agn feedback is taken into account, thefundamentally hierachical cdm model provides a very good match to theseobservations.

astro-ph;0512364	the epoch of reionization	we have modelled the process of reionization of the igm by photoionization bygalaxies, in order to predict the epoch of reionization. we use a sophisticatedsemi-analytic model to track the formation of galaxies. our study represents amuch more complete and physically consistent modelling of reionization than hasbeen conducted in the past, containing significant improvements in themodelling of the collapse of baryons into dark matter halos, and in the modelfor the cooling and condensation of gas within halos (including photoheatingfrom a self-consistently computed ionizing background and cooling due to h2).we find that reionization can be achieved by z~10-20 in a lcdm cosmologicalmodel with sigma8~0.9. however, a cosmological model with a running spectralindex is only able to achieve reionization before z~9 if extreme assumptionsare made about the physics of feedback at high redshifts. we also consider thegalaxy formation model discussed by baugh et al., and find that it is able toreionize the universe by z~12. the previous results assume that all of theionizing photons produced by stars in galaxies are able to escape and ionizethe igm. if this is not the case, then the redshift of reionization could besubstantially reduced. we find that extended periods of partial reionizationand double reionizations can occur in models in which the first stars formedvia cooling by h2 molecules, are very massive, and in which the escape fractionof ionizing photons ~10-30%. such models do not fully reionize until z~6-7, butpredict an electron scattering optical depth as large as 0.15. models withlower sigma8=0.7-0.8 as suggested by the recent wmap three year data havereduced redshifts of reionization, but can be consistent with the lower opticaldepth also suggested by the wmap three year data.

astro-ph;0603679	the nature of (sub)-mm galaxies in hierarchical models	we present a hierarchical galaxy formation model which can account for thenumber counts of sources detected through their emission at sub-millimetrewavelengths. the first stage in our approach is an ab initio calculation of thestar formation histories for a representative sample of galaxies, which iscarried out using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform. thesestar formation histories are then input into the spectro-photometric codegrasil, to produce a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy. dustextinction and emission are treated self consistently in our model, withouthaving to resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the amount of attenuation by dustor the temperature at which the dust radiates. we argue that it is necessary tomodify the form of the stellar initial mass function in starbursts in order tomatch the observed number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previousgood matches enjoyed between observations and model predictions in the localuniverse. we also list some other observational tests that have been passed byour model.

astro-ph;0605305	luminosity functions for galaxies and quasars in the spitzer wide-area  infrared extra-galactic (swire) legacy survey	we construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24microns over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2 for galaxies and 0&lt;z&lt;4 for optical qsos,using optical and infrared data from the spitzer wide-area infraredextragalactic survey. the 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxy lfs show evidence formoderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passiveageing of evolved stellar populations. their comoving luminosity density wasfound to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,or even declining, at higher redshift. conversely, the 24 micron galaxy lf,which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or agn activity,undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived ir energy density and sfrdensity proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and themajority of this evolution occurring since z~1. optical qsos, however, showpositive luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts(3&lt;z&lt;4). modelling as l* proportional to (1+z)^gamma gavegamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 4.5 micronand stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths (5.8, 8 and 24 micron), ofgamma~3. comparison of the galaxy lfs to predictions from a semi-analytic modelbased on cdm indicate that an imf skewed towards higher mass star formation inbursts compared to locally is preferred. as a result the currently inferredmassive star formation rates in distant sub-mm sources may require substantialdownwards revision.

astro-ph;0607424	black hole growth in hierarchical galaxy formation	we incorporate a model for black hole growth during galaxy mergers into thesemi-analytical galaxy formation model based on lambda-cdm proposed by baugh etal. (2005). our black hole model has one free parameter, which we set bymatching the observed zeropoint of the local correlation between black holemass and bulge luminosity. we present predictions for the evolution withredshift of the relationships between black hole mass and bulge properties. oursimulations reproduce the evolution of the optical luminosity function ofquasars. we study the demographics of the black hole population and address theissue of how black holes acquire their mass. we find that the direct accretionof cold gas during starbursts is an important growth mechanism for lower massblack holes and at high redshift. on the other hand, the re-assembly ofpre-existing black hole mass into larger units via merging dominates the growthof more massive black holes at low redshift. this prediction could be tested byfuture gravitational wave experiments. as redshift decreases, progressivelyless massive black holes have the highest fractional growth rates, in line withrecent claims of "downsizing" in quasar activity.

astro-ph;0608544	the structural and photometric properties of early-type galaxies in  hierarchical models	we present predictions for the structural and photometric properties ofearly-type galaxies in the cold dark matter cosmology from the publishedsemi-analytical galaxy formation models of baugh et al. and bower et al. thesecalculations were made with the galform code, which tracks the evolution of thedisc and bulge components of a galaxy, using a self-consistent model to computethe scalelengths. the sizes of galactic discs are determined by theconservation of the angular momentum of cooling gas. the sizes of mergerremnants are computed by applying the virial theorem and conserving the bindingenergy of the progenitors and their orbital energy. we compare the modelpredictions with observational results derived from the sdss. the model enjoysa number of notable successes, such as giving reasonable reproductions of thelocal faber-jackson relation, the velocity dispersion-age relation, and thefundamental plane relating the luminosity, velocity dispersion and effectiveradius of spheroids. these achievements are all the more remarkable when onebears in mind that none of the parameters have been adjusted to refine themodel predictions. we study how the residuals around the fundamental planerelation depend on galaxy properties. we examine in detail the physicalingredients of the calculation of galaxy sizes. we also study the evolution ofthe scaling relations with redshift. however, there are some importantdisagreements between the predictions of the model and observations: thebrightest model spheroids have effective radii smaller than observed and thezero-point of the fundamental plane shows little or no evolution with redshiftin the model.

astro-ph;0702543	the detectability of baryonic acoustic oscillations in future galaxy  surveys	we assess the detectability of baryonic acoustic oscillations (bao) in thepower spectrum of galaxies using ultra large volume n-body simulations of thehierarchical clustering of dark matter and semi-analytical modelling of galaxyformation. a step-by-step illustration is given of the various effects(nonlinear fluctuation growth, peculiar motions, nonlinear and scale dependentbias) which systematically change the form of the galaxy power spectrum onlarge scales from the simple prediction of linear perturbation theory. using anew method to extract the scale of the oscillations, we nevertheless find thatthe bao approach gives an unbiased estimate of the sound horizon scale.sampling variance remains the dominant source of error despite the huge volumeof our simulation box ($=2.41 h^{-3}{\rm gpc}^{3}$). we use our results toforecast the accuracy with which forthcoming surveys will be able to measurethe sound horizon scale, $s$, and, hence constrain the dark energy equation ofstate parameter, $w$ (with simplifying assumptions and without marginalizingover the other cosmological parameters). pan-starrs could potentially yield ameasurement with an accuracy of $\delta s/s = 0.5-0.7 % $ (corresponding to$\delta w \approx 2-3% $), which is competitive with the proposed wfmos survey($\delta s/s = 1% $ $\delta w \approx 4 % $). achieving $\delta w \le 1% $using bao alone is beyond any currently commissioned project and will requirean all-sky spectroscopic survey, such as would be undertaken by the spacemission concept under proposal to esa.

astro-ph;9612109	numerical and analytical modelling of galaxy formation and evolution	we review recent developments in theoretical studies of galaxy formation andevolution. in combination with new data from hst, keck and other largetelescopes, numerical and semi-analytic modelling is beginning to build up acoherent picture of galaxy formation. we summarize the current status ofmodelling of various galactic properties such as the structure of dark matterhalos, the galaxy luminosity function, the tully-fisher relation, thecolour-magnitude relation for ellipticals, the gross morphological propertiesof galaxies and the counts of faint galaxies as a function of magnitude,redshift and morphology. many of these properties can be explained, at least atsome level, within a broad class of cdm cosmologies, but a number offundamental issues remain unresolved. we use our semi-analytic model of galaxyformation to interpret the evolutionary status of the lyman-break galaxies at$z\simeq 3-3.5$ recently discovered by steidel et al. the abundance and globalproperties of these objects are compatible with model predictions in a varietyof cdm cosmologies, including the standard version. all these models predictmild evolution in the distribution of star formation rates which peaks ataround $z\simeq 1$, but is never much larger than it is at present. the steidelet al. lyman-break galaxies are among the very first objects in whichappreciable star formation is taking place; they thus signal the onset ofgalaxy formation. we present three example evolutionary histories oflyman-break galaxies which illustrate that these objects are the precursors ofpresent day, normal, bright ellipticals and spirals.

astro-ph;9703111	the epoch of galaxy formation	we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in hierarchical clusteringtheories to interpret recent data on galaxy formation and evolution, focussingprimarily on the recently discovered population of lyman-break galaxies at$z\simeq 3$. for a variety of cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies we constructmock galaxy catalogues subject to identical selection criteria to those appliedto the real data. we find that the expected number of lyman-break galaxies isvery sensitive to the assumed stellar initial mass function and to thenormalization of the primordial power spectrum. for reasonable choices of theseand other model parameters, it is possible to reproduce the observed abundanceof lyman-break galaxies in cdm models with $\omega_0=1$ and with $\omega_0&lt;1$.these galaxies generally form from rare peaks at high redshift and, as aresult, their spatial distribution is strongly biased, with a typical biasparameter, $b\simeq 4$, and a comoving correlation length, $r_0\simeq 4 \mpc$.the typical sizes of these galaxies, $\sim 0.5\kpc$, are substantially smallerthan those of present day bright galaxies. in combination with data at lowerredshifts, the lyman-break galaxies can be used to trace the cosmic starformation history. most galaxies (in our models and in the data) neverexperience star formation rates in excess of a few solar masses per year. ourmodels predict that even at $z=5$, the integrated star formation rate issimilar to that measured locally, although less than 1% of all the stars haveformed prior to this redshift. these galaxies mark the onset of the epoch ofgalaxy formation that continues into the present day. the basic ingredients ofa consistent picture of galaxy formation may well be now in place.

astro-ph;9803030	the seeds of rich galaxy clusters in the universe	the discovery of a population of young galaxies at an epoch when the universewas about one tenth of its current age has shed new light on the question ofwhen and how galaxies formed. within the context of popular models this is thepopulation of primeval galaxies that built themselves up to the size ofpresent--day galaxies through the process of repeated mergers. but the recentdetection of a large concentration of these primeval galaxies (steidel et al.1997) appears to be incompatible with hierarchical clustering models, whichgenerally predict that clusters of this size are fully formed later in time.here we use a combination of two powerful theoretical techniques--semi-analytic modelling and n-body simulations-- to show that such largeconcentrations should be quite common in a universe dominated by cold darkmatter, and that they are the progenitors of the rich galaxy clusters seentoday. we predict the clustering properties of primeval galaxies which should,when compared with data that will be collected in the near future, test ourunderstanding of galaxy formation within the framework of a universe dominatedby cold dark matter.

astro-ph;9808209	early type galaxies in the hierarchical universe	any realistic theory of galaxy formation must be set in the context of amodel for the formation of structure in the universe. we describe a powerfulapproach -- semi-analytic modelling -- that combines a set of simple rulesdescribing the gas processes involved in galaxy formation with a scheme tofollow the hierarchical growth of dark matter haloes. surprisingly few freeparameters are required to specify the model, and these are fixed withreference to a subset of local observational data. the model produces the fullstar formation history of a galaxy, allowing a wide range of predictions to bemade. we review some of the successes of the models, namely the star formationhistory of the universe and the evolution of galaxy clustering, before focusingour attention on early-type galaxies. we discuss the observational evidenceagainst the classical picture in which early-type galaxies form at somearbitrarily high redshift in a single monolithic collapse and burst of starformation. the alternative scenario in which spheroidal systems are formed bythe merger of disk galaxies is outlined. we review some of the predictions ofthis model, namely the colour-magnitude relation, the faint counts and theevolution of cluster membership.

astro-ph;9811222	modelling the evolution of galaxy clustering	measurements of galaxy clustering are now becoming possible over a range ofredshifts out to z=3. we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation tocompute the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function withredshift. we illustrate how the degree of clustering evolution is sensitive tothe details of the sample selection. for a fixed apparent magnitude limit,galaxies selected at higher redshifts are located in progressively rarer darkmatter haloes, compared with the general population of galaxies in place ateach redshift. as a result these galaxies are highly biased tracers of theunderlying dark matter distribution and exhibit stronger clustering than thedark matter. in general, the correlation length measured in comoving units,decreases at first with increasing redshift, before increasing again at higherredshift. we show that the epsilon-model often used to interpret the angularcorrelation function of faint galaxies gives an inadequate description of theevolution of clustering, and offers no physical insight into the clusteringprocess. we compare our predictions with those of a simple, popular model inwhich a one-to-one correspondence between galaxies and dark halos is assumed.qualitatively, this model reproduces the correct evolutionary behaviour at highredshift, but the quantitative results can be significantly in error. ourtheoretical expectations are in good agreement with the high redshiftclustering data of carlberg etal and postman etal but are higher than themeasurements of le fevre etal.

astro-ph;9903343	the nature of galaxy bias and clustering	we have used a combination of high resolution cosmological n-body simulationsand semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processesthat determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (cdm)models. the galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency withwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. in small mass halos, galaxyformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,whereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of thegas. as a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at thehalo mass associated with l* galaxies. this leads to a scale dependent bias inthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. on largescales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to thebias in the distribution of massive halos. on small scales, the correlationfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including thespatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the numberof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,dynamical friction. remarkably, these processes conspire to produce acorrelation function in a flat, omega_0=0.3, cdm model that is close to apower-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. this model agreeswell with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the apm survey. onsmall scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the darkmatter whereas on large scales, they trace the occupied halos. our clusteringpredictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formationmodel, provided only those models that match the bright end of the galaxyluminosity function are considered.

astro-ph;9910488	the dependence of velocity and clustering statistics on galaxy  properties	we use a combination of n-body simulations of the hierarchical clustering ofdark matter and semi-analytic modelling of the physics of galaxy formation toprobe the relationship between the galaxy distribution and the massdistribution. the pairwise line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies issensitive to the number of galaxies present in halos of different mass. thegalaxy velocity dispersion is ~40% lower than that of the dark matter and is inreasonable agreement with the values measured in the las campanas redshiftsurvey by jing et al. over two decades in pair separation. the origin of thisoffset is statistical rather than dynamical, and depends upon the relativeefficiency of galaxy formation in dark matter halos of different mass. althoughthe model galaxies and the dark matter have markedly different correlationfunctions in real space, such biases conspire to cause the redshift spacecorrelation functions to be remarkably similar to each other. the predictedredshift-space galaxy correlation function agrees well with observations. wefind no evidence in the model for a dependence of clustering strength onintrinsic galaxy luminosity, unless extremely bright galaxies, two magnitudesbrighter than l*, are considered. however, there are significant differenceswhen model galaxies are selected either by morphology or by colour. early typeor red galaxies show a much stronger clustering amplitude than late type orblue galaxies, particularly on small scales, again in good agreement withobservations.

0810.2177	the fate of substructures in cold dark matter haloes	we use the millennium simulation, a large, high resolution n-body simulationof the evolution of structure in a lambdacdm cosmology, to study the propertiesand fate of substructures within a large sample of dark matter haloes. we findthat the subhalo mass function departs significantly from a power law at thehigh mass end. we also find that the radial and angular distributions ofsubstructures depend on subhalo mass. in particular, high mass subhaloes tendto be less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer tothe direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their lessmassive counterparts. we find that mergers between subhaloes occur. these tendto be between substructures that were already dynamically associated beforeaccretion into the main halo. for subhaloes larger than 0.001 times the mass ofthe host halo, it is more likely that the subhalo will merge with the centralor main subhalo than with another subhalo larger than itself. for lower masses,subhalo-subhalo mergers become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo.our results have implications for the variation of galaxy properties withenvironment and for the treatment of mergers in galaxy formation models.

0811.2134	massive, red galaxies in a hierarchical universe i. counts of extremely  red objects and basic properties	we present predictions for the abundance and nature of extremely red objects(eros) in the lambda cold dark matter model. eros are red, massive galaxiesobserved at z&gt;= 1 and their numbers and properties pose a challenge tohierarchical galaxy formation models. we compare the predictions from twopublished models, one of which invokes a "superwind" to regulate star formationin massive haloes and the other which suppresses gas cooling in haloes through"radio-mode" agn feedback. the superwind model underestimates the number countsof eros by an order of magnitude, whereas the radio-mode agn feedback modelgives excellent agreement with the number counts and redshift distribution oferos. in the agn feedback model the ero population is dominated by old,passively evolving galaxies, whereas observations favour an equal split betweenold galaxies and dusty starbursts. also, the model predicts a more extendedredshift distribution of passive galaxies than is observed. these comparisonssuggest that star formation may be quenched too efficiently in this model.
