0903.0102	galaxy stellar mass assembly between 0.2&lt;z&lt;2 from the s-cosmos survey	we follow the galaxy stellar mass assembly by morphological and spectral typein the cosmos 2-deg^2 field. we derive the stellar mass functions and stellarmass densities from z=2 to z=0.2 using 196,000 galaxies selected at f(3.6micron) &gt; 1 microjy with accurate photometric redshifts(sigma_((zp-zs)/(1+zs))=0.008 at i&lt;22.5). using a spectral classification, wefind that z~1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly ofquiescent galaxies. their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex betweenz=1.5-2 and z=0.8-1 (delta t ~2.5 gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z=0.8-1 andz~0.1 (delta t ~ 6 gyr). then, we add the morphological information and findthat 80-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies (log(m)~11) have an ellipticalmorphology at z&lt;0.8. therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of starformation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies.still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a spi/irrmorphology at low mass (40-60% at log(m)~9.5), but this fraction is smallerthan predicted by semi-analytical models using a ``halo quenching'' recipe. wealso analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into``intermediate activity'' and ``high activity'' galaxies. we find that the mostmassive ``high activity'' galaxies end their high star formation rate phasefirst. finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomeslower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z&lt;1. as aconsequence, the rate of ``wet mergers'' involved in the formation of the mostmassive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z&lt;1, which could explain theobserved slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.

0904.0448	stellar and total baryon mass fractions in groups and clusters since  redshift 1	we investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon massfraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups isconsidered.  to this purpose, 91 candidate x-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 &lt; z&lt; 1 are selected from the cosmos 2 deg^2 survey, based only on their x-rayluminosity and extent. this sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with arobust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside r_500. thetotal sample of 118 groups and clusters with z &lt; 1 spans a range in m_500 of~10^13--10^15 m_sun. we find that the stellar mass fraction associated withgalaxies at r_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (m_500)^-0.37 \pm0.04, independent of redshift. estimating the total gas mass fraction from arecently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction(f_500^stars+gas=f_500^stars+f_500^gas) is found to increase by ~ 25% whenm_500 increases from &lt;m&gt;=5 x 10^13 m_sun to &lt;m&gt; = 7 x 10^14 m_sun. afterconsideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22%of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assemblyprocess (10% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon massfraction are still lower than the latest cmb measure of the same quantity(wmap5), at a significance level of 3.3\sigma for groups of &lt;m&gt;=5 x10^13~m_sun. the discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such thatit is 1\sigma at &lt;m&gt;= 7 x 10^14~m_sun. we discuss this result in terms ofnon--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.

0905.1674	star formation and dust obscuration at z~2: galaxies at the dawn of  downsizing	we present first results of a study aimed to constrain the star formationrate and dust content of galaxies at z~2. we use a sample of bzk-selectedstar-forming galaxies, drawn from the cosmos survey, to perform a stackinganalysis of their 1.4 ghz radio continuum as a function of different stellarpopulation properties, after removing agn contaminants from the sample. dustunbiased star formation rates are derived from radio fluxes assuming the localradio-ir correlation. the main results of this work are: i) specific starformation rates are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to thehighest stellar mass probed; ii) the dust attenuation is a strong function ofgalaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lowermass objects; iii) a single value of the uv extinction applied to all galaxieswould lead to grossly underestimate the sfr in massive galaxies; iv) correctingthe observed uv luminosities for dust attenuation based on the calzetti recipeprovide results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones; v) the meanspecific star formation rate of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of ~4with decreasing redshift from z=2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of ~40 down the localuniverse.  these empirical sfrs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass ifmaintained all the way to low redshifts, we suggest that this does not happenbecause star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the mostmassive galaxies.

0906.4035	wide and deep near-uv (360nm) galaxy counts and the extragalactic  background light with the large binocular camera	deep multicolour surveys are the main tool to explore the formation andevolution of the faint galaxies which are beyond the spectroscopic limit withthe present technology. the photometric properties of these faint galaxies areusually compared with current renditions of semianalytical models to provideconstraints on the fundamental physical processes involved in galaxy formationand evolution, namely the mass assembly and the star formation. galaxy countsover large sky areas in the near-uv band are important because they aredifficult to obtain given the low efficiency of near-uv instrumentation, evenat 8m class telescopes. a large instrumental field of view helps in minimizingthe biases due to the cosmic variance. we have obtained deep images in the360nm u band provided by the blue channel of the large binocular camera at theprime focus of the large binocular telescope. we have derived over an area of~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to u=27 in the vega system(corresponding to u=27.86 in the ab system) at a completeness level of 30%reaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. the shapeof the galaxy counts in the u band can be described by a double power-law, thebright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparableor greater areas. the slope bends over significantly at u&gt;23.5 ensuring theconvergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the ebl in thenear-uv band to a value which is more than 70% of the most recent upper limitsderived for this band. we have jointly compared our near-uv and k band countscollected from the literature with few selected hierarchical cdm modelsemphasizing critical issues in the physical description of the galaxy formationand evolution.

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0909.4303	deep spitzer 24mic cosmos imaging -- i. the evolution of luminous dusty  galaxies - confronting the models	we present the first results obtained from the identification of ~30,000sources in the 24mic observations of the cosmos field at s24&gt;~80mujy. usingaccurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolvewith unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-ir background across cosmicages. we find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originatefrom galaxies at z&lt;~1 and z&lt;~2 respectively, supporting the scenario wherehighly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z&gt;~2) contribute onlymarginally to the cib. assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection stronglyincreases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forminggalaxies have undergone with lookback time. nonetheless this rising trend showsa clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by thecomplexity of seds in the mid-ir. finally, we compare our results with thepredictions from different models of galaxy formation. we note thatsemi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributionsobserved at 24mic. furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit r-k colors muchbluer than observed and the predicted k-band fluxes are systematicallyunderestimated at z&gt;0.5. unless these discrepancies result from an incorrecttreatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicteddensity of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would pointto more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in thesimulations. the most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonablywell the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although noneof them is able to exactly match our results at all redshifts.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0910.0444	spectroscopy of luminous z&gt;7 galaxy candidates and sources of  contamination in z&gt;7 galaxy searches	we present three bright z+ dropout candidates selected from deepnear-infrared (nir) imaging of the cosmos 2 square degree field. all threeobjects match the 0.8-8um colors of other published z&gt;7 candidates but arethree magnitudes brighter, facilitating further study. deep spectroscopy of twoof the candidates covering 0.64-1.02um with keck-deimos and all three covering0.94-1.10um and 1.52-1.80um with keck-nirspec detects weak spectral featurestentatively identified as ly-alpha at z=6.95 and z=7.69 in two of the objects.the third object is placed at z~1.6 based on a 24um and weak optical detection.a comparison with the spectral energy distributions of known z&lt;7 galaxies,including objects with strong spectral lines, large extinction, and largesystematic uncertainties in the photometry yields no objects with similarcolors. however, the lambda&gt;1um properties of all three objects can be matchedto optically detected sources with photometric redshifts at z~1.8, so thenon-detection in the i+ and z+ bands are the primary factors which favors a z&gt;7solution. if any of these objects are at z~7 the bright end of the luminosityfunction is significantly higher at z&gt;7 than suggested by previous studies, butconsistent within the statistical uncertainty and the dark matter halodistribution. if these objects are at low redshift, the lyman-break selectionmust be contaminated by a previously unknown population of low redshift objectswith very strong breaks in their broad band spectral energy distributions andblue nir colors. the implications of this result on luminosity functionevolution at high redshift is discussed. we show that the primary limitation ofz&gt;7 galaxy searches with broad filters is the depth of the available opticaldata.

0911.1126	the build-up of the hubble sequence in the cosmos field	we use ~8,600 &gt;5e10 msol cosmos galaxies to study how the morphological mixof massive ellipticals, bulge-dominated disks, intermediate-bulge disks,bulge-less disks and irregular galaxies evolves from z=0.2 to z=1. themorphological evolution depends strongly on mass. at m&gt;3e11 msol, no evolutionis detected in the morphological mix: ellipticals dominate since z=1, and thehubble sequence has quantitatively settled down by this epoch. at the 1e11 msolmass scale, little evolution is detected, which can be entirely explained withmajor mergers. most of the morphological evolution from z=1 to z=0.2 takesplace at masses 5e10 - 1e11 msol, where: (i) the fraction of spiralssubstantially drops and the contribution of early-types increases. thisincrease is mostly produced by the growth of bulge-dominated disks, which varytheir contribution from ~10% at z=1 to &gt;30% at z=0.2 (cf. the ellipticalfraction grows from ~15% to ~20%). thus, at these masses, transformations fromlate- to early-types result in disk-less elliptical morphologies with astatistical frequency of only 30% - 40%. otherwise, the processes which areresponsible for the transformations either retain or produce a non-negligibledisk component. (ii) the bulge-less disk galaxies, which contribute ~15% to theintermediate-mass galaxy population at z=1, virtually disappear by z=0.2. themerger rate since z=1 is too low to account for the disappearance of thesemassive bulge-less disks, which most likely grow a bulge via secular evolution.

1001.1736	bars in early- and late-type disks in cosmos	we investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of m&gt; 10^10.5 msun disk galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 in the cosmos field. the fractionof barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific starformation rate (ssfr). at intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun)the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by afactor ~2, than that in late-type disks. this trend is reversed at higherstellar mass (m &gt; 10^11 msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disksbecomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.the bar fractions for galaxies with low and high ssfrs closely follow those ofthe morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,respectively. this indicates a close correspondence between morphology and ssfrin disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. interestingly, the total bar fractionin 10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over theredshift interval explored, while for m &gt; 10^11 msun disks it remains roughlyconstant. this indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphologicaltransformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to thefamiliar hubble sequence that we observe in the local universe, while forintermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limitedsamples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. finally, theevolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on thelarge-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probedwith the available photometric redshifts).

0801.4027	the structural properties and star formation history of leo t from deep  lbt photometry	we present deep, wide-field g and r photometry of the transition type dwarfgalaxy leo t, obtained with the blue arm of the large binocular telescope. thedata confirm the presence of both very young (&lt;1 gyr) as well as much older (&gt;5gyr) stars. we study the structural properties of the old and young stellarpopulations by preferentially selecting either population based on their colorand magnitude. the young population is significantly more concentrated than theold population, with half-light radii of 104+-8 and 148+-16 pc respectively,and their centers are slightly offset. approximately 10% of the total stellarmass is estimated to be represented by the young stellar population. comparisonof the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) with theoretical isochrones as well asnumerical cmd-fitting suggest that star formation began over 10 gyr ago andcontinued in recent times until at least a few hundred myr ago. the cmd-fittingresults are indicative of two distinct star formation bursts, with a quiescentperiod around 3 gyr ago, albeit at low significance. the results are consistentwith no metallicity evolution and [fe/h] ~ -1.5 over the entire age of thesystem. finally, the data show little if any sign of tidal distortion of leo t.

1501.07028	towards a better understanding of the grb phenomenon: a new model for  grb prompt emission and its effects on the new non-thermal  l$_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{nt}$-e$_\mathrm{peak,i}^\mathrm{rest,nt}$ relation	we reanalyze the prompt emission of two of the brightest fermi grbs (080916cand 090926a) with a new model composed of 3 components: (i) a thermal-likecomponent--approximated with a black body (bb)--interpreted as the jetphotosphere emission of a magnetized relativistic outflow, (ii) a non-thermalcomponent--approximated with a band function--interpreted as synchrotronradiation in an optically thin region above the photosphere either frominternal shocks or magnetic field dissipation, and (iii) an extra power law(pl) extending from low to high energies likely of inverse compton origin, eventhough it remains challenging. through fine-time spectroscopy down to the 100ms time scale, we follow the smooth evolution of the various components. fromthis analysis the band function is globally the most intense component,although the additional pl can overpower the others in sharp time structures.the band function and the bb component are the most intense at early times andglobally fade across the burst duration. the additional pl is the most intensecomponent at late time and may be correlated with the extended high-energyemission observed thousands of seconds after the burst with the fermi/largearea telescope (lat). unexpectedly, this analysis also shows that theadditional pl may be present from the very beginning of the burst. weinvestigate the effect of the three components on the new time-resolvedluminosity-hardness relation in both the observer and rest frames and show thata strong correlation exists between the flux of the non-thermal component andits e$_{peak}$ only when the three components are fitted simultaneously to thedata (i.e., f$_i^{nt}$-e$_{peak,i}^{nt}$ relation). in addition, this resultpoints toward a universal relation between those two quantities for all grbswhen transposed to the central engine rest frame (i.e.,l$_i^{nt}$-e$_{peak,i}^{rest,nt}$ relation).

0805.1412	the environments of high redshift qsos	we present a sample of $i_{775}$-dropout candidates identified in five hubbleadvanced camera for surveys fields centered on sloan digital sky survey qsos atredshift $z\sim 6$. our fields are as deep as the great observatory originsdeep survey (goods) acs images which are used as a reference field sample. wefind them to be overdense in two fields, underdense in two fields, and as denseas the average density of goods in one field. the two excess fields showsignificantly different color distributions from that of goods at the 99%confidence level, strengthening the idea that the excess objects are indeedassociated with the qso. the distribution of $i_{775}$-dropout counts in thefive fields is broader than that derived from goods at the 80% to 96%confidence level, depending on which selection criteria were adopted toidentify $i_{775}$-dropouts; its width cannot be explained by cosmic variancealone. thus, qsos seem to affect their environments in complex ways. we suggestthe picture where the highest redshift qsos are located in very massiveoverdensities and are therefore surrounded by an overdensity of lower masshalos. radiative feedback by the qso can in some cases prevent halos frombecoming galaxies, thereby generating in extreme cases an underdensity ofgalaxies. the presence of both enhancement and suppression is compatible withthe expected differences between lines of sight at the end of reionization asthe presence of residual diffuse neutral hydrogen would provide young galaxieswith shielding from the radiative effects of the qso.

0806.3190	on the origin of approximate custodial symmetry in the two-higgs doublet  model	we argue that the consistent implementation of the multiple point principle(mpp) in the general non-supersymmetric two higgs doublet model (2hdm) can leadto a set of approximate global custodial symmetries that ensure cp conservationin the higgs sector and the absence of flavour changing neutral currents (fcnc)in the considered model. in particular the existence of a large set ofdegenerate vacua at some high energy scale $\lambda$ caused by the mpp canresult in approximate u(1) and z(2) symmetries that suppress fcnc andcp--violating interactions in the 2hdm. we explore the renormalisation group(rg) flow of the yukawa and higgs couplings within the mpp inspired 2hdm withapproximate custodial symmetries and show that the solutions of the rgequations are focused near quasi--fixed points at low energies if the mpp scalescale $\lambda$ is relatively high. we study the higgs spectrum and couplingsnear the quasi--fixed point at moderate values of $\tan\beta$ and compute atheoretical upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass. if $\lambda\gtrsim10^{10} {gev}$ the lightest cp--even higgs boson is always lighter than $125{gev}$. when the mpp scale is low, the mass of the lightest higgs particle canreach $180-220 {gev}$ while its coupling to the top quark can be significantlylarger than in the sm, resulting in the enhanced production of higgs bosons atthe lhc.

0807.1565	galaxy clusters in the irac dark field i: growth of the red sequence	using three newly identified galaxy clusters at z~1 (photometric redshift) wemeasure the evolution of the galaxies within clusters from high redshift to thepresent day by studying the growth of the red cluster sequence. the clustersare located in the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) dark field, anextremely deep mid-infrared survey near the north ecliptic pole with photometryin 18 total bands from x-ray through far-ir. two of the candidate clusters areadditionally detected as extended emission in matching chandra data in thesurvey area allowing us to measure their masses to be m_{500}= 6.2 \pm 1.0\times 10^{13} and 3.6 \pm 1.1 \times 10^{13} solar masses. for all threeclusters we create a composite color magnitude diagram in rest-frame b-k usingour deep hst and spitzer imaging. by comparing the fraction of low luminositymember galaxies on the composite red sequence with the corresponding populationin local clusters at z=0.1 taken from the cosmos survey, we examine the effectof a galaxy's mass on its evolution. we find a deficit of faint galaxies on thered sequence in our z~1 clusters which implies that more massive galaxies haveevolved in clusters faster than less massive galaxies, and that the lessmassive galaxies are still forming stars in clusters such that they have notyet settled onto the red sequence.

astro-ph;0010604	multi-color classification in the calar alto deep imaging survey	we use a multi-color classification method introduced by wolf, meisenheimer &amp;roeser (2000) to reliably identify stars, galaxies and quasars in the up to16-dimensional color space provided by the filter set of the calar alto deepimaging survey (cadis). the samples of stars, galaxies and quasars obtainedthis way have been used for dedicated studies published in separate papers. theclassification is good enough to detect quasars rather completely andefficiently without confirmative spectroscopy. the multi-color redshifts areaccurate enough for most statistical applications, e.g. evolutionary studies ofthe galaxy luminosity function. we characterize our current dataset on thecadis 1h-, 9h- and 16h-fields. using monte-carlo simulations we model theclassification performance expected for cadis. we present a summary of theclassification results and discuss unclassified objects. more than 99% of thewhole catalog sample at r&lt;22 (more than 95% at r&lt;23) are successfullyclassified matching the expectations derived from the simulations. a smallnumber of peculiar objects challenging the classification are discussed indetail. spectroscopic observations are used to check the reliability of themulti-color classification (6 mistakes among 151 objects with r&lt;24). we alsodetermine the accuracy of the multi-color redshifts which are rather good forgalaxies (sigma_z = 0.03) and useful for quasars. we find the classificationperformance derived from the simulations to compare well with results from thereal survey. finally, we locate areas for potential improvement of theclassification.

astro-ph;0011400	evidence for galaxy formation at high redshift	we have shown previously that galaxy counts from the uv to the near-ir arewell-fitted by simple evolutionary models where the space density of galaxiesremains constant with look-back time while the star-formation rate risesexponentially. we now extend these results, first by using data from theherschel deep field to show that these same models give detailed fits to thefaint galaxy r-i:b-r colour-colour diagram. we then use these models to predictthe number counts of high redshift galaxies detected by the lyman breaktechnique. at z~3 there is almost exact agreement between ou r prediction andthe data, suggesting that the space density of galaxies at z~3 may be close toits local value. at z~4 the space density of bright galaxies remains unchanged;however, the space density of dwarf galaxies is significantly lower than it islocally, suggesting that we have detected an epoch of dwarf galaxy formation atz~4. finally, significant numbers of lyman-break galaxy candidates are alsodetected at z~6 in the hubble and herschel deep fields; taking this observationtogether with a number of recent detections of spectroscopically confirmed z~6galaxies suggests that the space density of bright galaxies at z~6 remainscomparable to the local space density and thus that the epoch of formation ofbright galaxies may lie at yet higher redshift.

astro-ph;0101269	the calar alto deep imaging survey: k-band galaxy number counts	we present k-band number counts for the faint galaxies in the calar alto deepimaging survey (cadis). we covered 4 cadis fields, a total area of 0.2deg^2, inthe broad band filters b, r and k. we detect about 4000 galaxies in the k-bandimages, with a completeness limit of k=19.75mag, and derive the k-band galaxynumber counts in the range of 14.25 &lt; k &lt; 19.75mag. this is the largest mediumdeep k-band survey to date in this magnitude range. the b- and r-band numbercounts are also derived, down to completeness limits of b=24.75mag andr=23.25mag. the k-selected galaxies in this magnitude range are of particularinterest, since some medium deep near-infrared surveys have identified breaksof both the slope of the k-band number counts and the mean b-k color atk=17\sim18mag. there is, however, a significant disagreement in the k-bandnumber counts among the existing surveys. our large near-infrared selectedgalaxy sample allows us to establish the presence of a clear break in the slopeat k=17.0mag from dlogn/dm = 0.64 at brighter magnitudes to dlogn/dm = 0.36 atthe fainter end. we construct no-evolution and passive evolution models, andfind that the passive evolution model can simultaneously fit the b-, r- andk-band number counts well. the b-k colors show a clear trend to bluer colorsfor k &gt; 18mag. we also find that most of the k=18-20mag galaxies have a b-kcolor bluer than the prediction of a no-evolution model for an l_* sbc galaxy,implying either significant evolution, even for massive galaxies, or theexistence of an extra population of small galaxies.

astro-ph;0302299	the first measurement of spectral lines in a short-period star bound to  the galaxy's central black hole: a paradox of youth	we have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one ofthe high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the galaxy's central supermassiveblack hole. both brgamma (2.1661 micron) and he i (2.1126 micron) are seen inabsorption in s0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 ang &amp; 1.7+-0.4 ang) and aninferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent withthat of an o8-b0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 msun), young(&lt;10 myr) main sequence star. this presents a major challenge to star formationtheories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reachedby s0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 au) and the difficulty in migratingthis star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces shouldno longer preclude star formation. the radial velocity measurements (-510+-40km/s) and our reported proper motions for s0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(ro/8kpc)^3msun. the keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by afactor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the firsttime, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, whileconsistent with the nominal infrared position of sgr a*, is localized to afactor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). furthermore, the ambiguity inthe inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radialvelocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at thetime of closest approach and counter-revolving against the galaxy. with furtherradial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of s0-2 willprovide the most robust estimate of the distance to the galactic center.

astro-ph;0304166	peculiar broad absorption line quasars found in dposs	with the recent release of large (i.e., &gt; hundred million objects),well-calibrated photometric surveys, such as dposs, 2mass, and sdss,spectroscopic identification of important targets is no longer a simple issue.in order to enhance the returns from a spectroscopic survey, candidate sourcesare often preferentially selected to be of interest, such as brown dwarfs orhigh redshift quasars. this approach, while useful for targeted projects, risksmissing new or unusual species. we have, as a result, taken the alternativepath of spectroscopically identifying interesting sources with the solecriterion being that they are in low density areas of the g - r and r - icolor-space defined by the dposs survey. in this paper, we present threepeculiar broad absorption line quasars that were discovered during thisspectroscopic survey, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. pssj0052+2405 is an iron lobal quasar at a redshift z = 2.4512 with very broadabsorption from many species. pss j0141+3334 is a reddened lobal quasar at z =3.005 with no obvious emission lines. pss j1537+1227 is a iron lobal at aredshift of z = 1.212 with strong narrow mgii and feii emission. follow-up highresolution spectroscopy of these three quasars promises to improve ourunderstanding of bal quasars. the sensitivity of particular parameter spaces,in this case a two-color space, to the redshift of these three sources isdramatic, raising questions about traditional techniques of defining quasarpopulations for statistical analysis.

astro-ph;0611215	high resolution imaging of the anomalous flux-ratio gravitational lens  system class b2045+265: dark or luminous satellites?	the existence of flux-ratio anomalies between fold and cusp images ingalaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on thepresence of a high mass-fraction of cold-dark-matter (cdm) substructures aroundgalaxies, as predicted by numerical n-body simulations. the flux-ratio anomalyis particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens systemclass b2045+265. in this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical, andinfrared imaging of b2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on thisanomaly and its possible causes. first, deep very long baseline arrayobservations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but withno evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. second, opticaland infrared observations with the hubble space telescope and throughadaptive-optics imaging with the w. m. keck telescope, show a previouslyundiscovered object -- interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellitebased on its colours and slight extension -- between the main lens galaxy andthe three anomalous flux-ratio images. third, colour variations in theearly-type lens galaxy indicate recent star-formation, possibly the result ofsecondary infall of gas-rich satellites. a population of such galaxies aroundthe lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [o ii] emission.however, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxycannot be excluded. in light of these new data, we propose a lens model for thesystem, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positionaland flux-ratio constraints, without the need for additional cdm substructure.[abridged]

astro-ph;0611644	cosmos morphological classification with zest (the zurich estimator of  structural types) and the evolution since z=1 of the luminosity function of  early-, disk-, and irregular galaxies	(abridged) motivated by the desire to reliably and automatically classifystructure of thousands of cosmos galaxies, we present zest, the zurichestimator of structural types. to classify galaxy structure, zest uses: (i)five non-parametric diagnostics: asymmetry, concentration, gini coefficient,2nd-order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels, and ellipticity; and(ii) the exponent n of single--sersic fits to the 2d surface brightnessdistributions. to fully exploit the wealth of information while reducing theredundancy present in these diagnostics, zest performs a principal component(pc) analysis. we use a sample of ~56,000 i&lt;24 cosmos galaxies to show that thefirst three pcs fully describe the key aspects of the galaxy structure, i.e.,to calibrate a three-dimensional classification grid of axis pc_1, pc_2, andpc_3. we demonstrate the robustness of the zest grid on the z=0 sample of freiet al. (1996). the zest classification breaks most of the degeneracy betweendifferent galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications basedon only some of the diagnostics included in zest. as a first application, wepresent the evolution since z~1 of the luminosity functions of cosmos galaxiesof early, disk and irregular galaxies and, for disk galaxies, of differentbulge-to-disk ratios. overall, we find that the lf up to a redshift z=1 isconsistent with a pure-luminosity evolution (of about 0.95 magnitudes at z\~0.7). we highlight however two trends, that are in general agreement with adown-sizing scenario for galaxy formation: (1.) a deficit of a factor of abouttwo at z~0.7 of mb&gt;-20.5 structurally--classified early--type galaxies; and(2.) an excess of a factor of about three, at a similar redshift, of irregulargalaxies.

astro-ph;0612358	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: iii. optical  identification and multiwavelength properties of a large sample of x-ray  selected sources	[abriged] we present the optical identification of a sample of 695 x-raysources detected in the first 1.3 deg^2 of the xmm-cosmos survey, down to a0.5-2 kev (2-10 kev) limiting flux of ~10^-15 erg cm-2 s-1 (~5x10^-15 erg cm^-2s-1). we were able to associate a candidate optical counterpart to ~90% (626)of the x-ray sources, while for the remaining ~10% of the sources we were notable to provide a unique optical association due to the faintness of thepossible optical counterparts (i_ab&gt;25) or to the presence of multiple opticalsources within the xmm-newton error circles. we also cross-correlated thecandidate optical counterparts with the subaru multicolor and acs catalogs andwith the magellan/imacs, zcosmos and literature spectroscopic data; thespectroscopic sample comprises 248 objects (~40% of the full sample). ouranalysis reveals that for ~80% of the counterparts there is a very goodagreement between the spectroscopic classification, the morphologicalparameters as derived from acs data, and the optical to near infrared colors.about 20% of the sources show an apparent mismatch between the morphologicaland spectroscopic classifications. all the ``extended'' bl agn lie at redshift&lt;1.5, while the redshift distribution of the full bl agn population peaks atz~1.5. our analysis also suggests that the type 2/type 1 ratio decreasestowards high luminosities, in qualitative agreement with the results from x-rayspectral analysis and the most recent modeling of the x-ray luminosity functionevolution.

astro-ph;0701482	the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos): a large-scale structure at z=0.73  and the relation of galaxy morphologies to local environment	we have identified a large-scale structure at z~0.73 in the cosmos field,coherently described by the distribution of galaxy photometric redshifts, anacs weak-lensing convergence map and the distribution of extended x-ray sourcesin a mosaic of xmm observations. the main peak seen in these maps correspondsto a rich cluster with tx= 3.51+0.60/-0.46 kev and lx=(1.56+/-0.04) x 10^{44}erg/s ([0.1-2.4] kev band). we estimate an x-ray mass within $r500$corresponding to m500~1.6 x 10^{14} msun and a total lensing mass (extrapolatedby fitting a nfw profile) m(nfw)=(6+/-3) x 10^15 msun. we use an automatedmorphological classification of all galaxies brighter than i_ab=24 over thestructure area to measure the fraction of early-type objects as a function oflocal projected density sigma_10, based on photometric redshifts derived fromground-based deep multi-band photometry. we recover a robust morphology-densityrelation at this redshift, indicating, for comparable local densities, asmaller fraction of early-type galaxies than today. interestingly, thisdifference is less strong at the highest densities and becomes more severe inintermediate environments. we also find, however, local "inversions'' of theobserved global relation, possibly driven by the large-scale environment. inparticular, we find direct correspondence of a large concentration of diskgalaxies to (the colder side of) a possible shock region detected in the x-raytemperature map and surface brightness distribution of the dominant cluster. weinterpret this as potential evidence of shock-induced star formation inexisting galaxy disks, during the ongoing merger between two sub-clusters.

astro-ph;0701746	the redshift evolution of early-type galaxies in cosmos: do massive  early-type galaxies form by dry mergers?	abridged: we study the evolution since z~1 of the rest-frame b luminosityfunction of the early-type galaxies (etgs) in ~0.7 deg^2 in the cosmos field.in order to identify all progenitors of local etgs we construct the sample ofhigh-z galaxies using two complementary criteria: (i) a morphological selectionbased on the zurich estimator of structural types, and (ii) a photometricselection based on the galaxy properties in the (u-v)-m_v color-magnitudediagram. we furthermore constrain both samples so as to ensure that theselected progenitors of etgs are compatible with evolving into systems whichobey the mu_b-r_{hl} kormendy relation. assuming the luminosity evolutionderived from studies of the fundamental plane for high-z etgs, our analysisshows no evidence for a decrease in the number density of the most massive etgsout to z~ 0.7: both the morphologically- and the photometrically-selectedsub-samples show no evolution in the number density of bright (~l&gt;2.5l*) etgs.allowing for different star formation histories, and cosmic variance, weestimate a maximum decrease in the number density of massive galaxies at thatredshift of ~30%. we observe, however, in both the photometrical andmorphological samples, a deficit of up to ~2-3 of fainter etgs over the samecosmic period. our results argue against a significant contribution of recentdissipationless ``dry'' mergers to the formation of the most massive etgs. wesuggest that the mass growth in low luminosity etgs can be explained with aconversion from z~0.7 to z=0 of blue, irregular and disk galaxies into low- andintermediate-mass ``red'' etgs, possibly also through gas rich mergers.

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

0809.2101	cosmos photometric redshifts with 30-bands for 2-deg2	we present accurate photometric redshifts in the 2-deg2 cosmos field. theredshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrow bands coveringthe uv (galex), visible-nir (subaru, cfht, ukirt and noao) and mid-ir(spitzer/irac). a chi2 template-fitting method (le phare) was used andcalibrated with large spectroscopic samples from vlt-vimos and keck-deimos. wedevelop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions fromemission lines (oii, hbeta, halpha and ly) to the spectral energy distributions(seds). the treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by afactor of 2.5. comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopicredshifts (i.e. delta z = zs - zp) indicates a dispersion of sigma_{deltaz/(1+zs)}=0.007 at i&lt;22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlierphoto-z in the cosmos, cfhtls and combo-17 survey fields. at fainter magnitudesi&lt;24 and z&lt;1.25, the accuracy is sigma_{delta z/(1+zs)}=0.012. the deep nir andirac coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z~2 albeit with a loweraccuracy (sigma_{delta z/(1+zs)}=0.06 at i~24). the redshift distribution oflarge magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found torange from z=0.66 at 22&lt;i&lt;22.5 to z=1.06 at 24.5&lt;i&lt;25. at i&lt;26.0, themulti-wavelength cosmos catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects. thecosmos-30 photo-z enable the full exploitation of this survey for studies ofgalaxy and large scale structure evolution at high redshift.

astro-ph;9610135	a narrowband imaging survey for high redshift galaxies in the near  infrared	a narrowband imaging survey of 276 square minutes of arc was carried out atnear infrared wavelengths to search for emission line objects at highredshifts. most of the fields contained a known quasar or radio galaxy at aredshift that placed one of the strong, restframe optical emission lines(h-alpha, [o iii], h-beta, or [o ii]) in the bandpass of the narrowband filter.the area weighted line flux limit over the entire survey was 3.4x10e-16erg/cm2/s (3-sigma), while the most sensitive limits reached 1.4x10e-16erg/cm2/s. integrating the volume covered by all four optical emission lines ineach image yields a total comoving volume surveyed of 1.4x10e5 cubicmegaparsecs. considering only h-alpha emission in the k band (2.05 &lt; z &lt; 2.65),where the survey is most sensitive, the survey covered a comoving volume of3.0x10e4 cubic megaparsecs to a volume-weighted average star formation rate of112 m-solar/yr (for ho = 50 km/s/mpc, omega = 1). this is the most extensivenear-infrared survey which is deep enough to have a reasonable chance atdetecting strong line emission from an actively star-forming population ofgalaxies, when d against simple models of galaxy formation. one emission linecandidate was identified in this survey, and subsequently confirmedspectroscopically.

astro-ph;9910310	constraints on the space density of methane dwarfs and the substellar  mass function from a deep near-infrared survey	we report preliminary results of a deep near-infrared search formethane-absorbing brown dwarfs; almost five years after the discovery of gl229b, there are only a few confirmed examples of this type of object. new jband, wide-field images, combined with pre-existing r band observations, allowefficient identification of candidates by their extreme (r-j) colours.follow-up measurements with custom filters can then confirm objects withmethane absorption. to date, we have surveyed a total of 11.4 square degrees toj~20.5 and r~25. follow-up ch_4 filter observations of promising candidates in1/4 of these fields have turned up no methane absorbing brown dwarfs. with 90%confidence, this implies that the space density of objects similar to gl 229bis less than 0.012 per cubic parsec. these calculations account for thevertical structure of the galaxy, which can be important for sensitivemeasurements. combining published theoretical atmospheric models with ourobservations sets an upper limit of alpha &lt;= 0.8 for the exponent of theinitial mass function power law in this domain.
