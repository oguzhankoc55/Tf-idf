0901.0820	a keck/deimos spectroscopic survey of the faint m31 satellites and xv  and and xvi	we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discoveredm31 satellites and xv and and xvi, lying at projected distances from the centreof m31 of 93 and 130 kpc respectively. these satellites lie to the south ofm31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide field imaging has revealed asrelative voids (compared to the degree-scale coherent stream-like structures).using the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mounted on the keck iitelescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which wederive radial velocities as precise as ~6 km/s down to i~21.5. while thedistance to and xvi remains the same as previously reported (525pm50 kpc), wehave demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define thetip of the red giant branch (trgb) in and xv are in fact galactic, and and xvis actually likely to be much more distant at 770pm70 kpc (compared to theprevious 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from mv -9.4 to mv~-9.8. the andxv velocity dispersion is resolved with vr =-339+7-6 km/s and sigma-v = 11+7-5km/s. the and xvi dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr =-385+5-6km/s and sigma-v = 0+10-indef km/s. using the photometry of the confirmedmember stars, we find metallicities of and xv (median [fe/h]=-1.58, interquar-tile range +-0.08), and and xvi (median [fe/h]=-2.23, interquartile range+-0.12). stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic[fe/h]=-1.8 (-2.1) for and xv (and xvi), with a uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in bothcases. our measure- ments of and xv reasonably resolve its mass (~10^8 msun)and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of and xvi suggests it isapproaching the m31 escape velocity given its large m31-centric distance.

0903.4701	a spectroscopic survey of ec4, an extended cluster in andromeda's halo	we present a spectroscopic survey of candidate red giant branch stars in theextended star cluster, ec4, discovered in the halo of m31 from our cfht/megacamsurvey, overlapping the tidal streams, stream cp and stream cr. theseobservations used the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph (deimos) mountedon the keck ii telescope to obtain spectra around the caii triplet region with~1.3 angstroms resolution. six stars lying on the red giant branch within 2core-radii of the centre of ec4 are found to have an averagevr=-287.9^{+1.9}_{-2.4}km/s and velocity dispersion of 2.7^{+4.2}_{-2.7}km/s,taking instrumental errors into account. the resulting mass-to-light ratio forec4 is m/l=6.7^{+15}_{-6.7}msun/lsun, a value that is consistent with aglobular cluster within the 1 sigma errors we derive. from the summed spectraof our member stars, we find ec4 to be metal-poor, with [fe/h]=-1.6+/-0.15. wediscuss several formation and evolution scenarios which could account for ourkinematic and metallicity constraints on ec4, and conclude that ec4 is mostcomparable with an extended globular cluster. we also compare the kinematicsand metallicity of ec4 with stream cp and stream cr, and find that ec4 bears astriking resemblance to stream cp in terms of velocity, and that the twostructures are identical in terms of both their spectroscopic and photometricmetallicities. from this we conclude that ec4 is likely related to stream cp.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

1010.5276	the kinematic identification of a thick stellar disc in m31	we present the first characterization of a thick disc component in theandromeda galaxy (m31) using kinematic data from the deimos multi-objectspectrograph instrument on keck ii. using 21 fields in the south west of thegalaxy, we measure the lag of this component with respect to the thin disc, aswell as the dispersion, metallicity and scale length of the component. we findan average lag between the two components of &lt;dv&gt;=46.0+/-3.9km/s. the velocitydispersion of the thick disc is sigma_{thick}=50.8+/-1.9km/s, greater than thevalue of dispersion we determine for the thin disc,sigma_{thin}=35.7+/-1.0km/s. the thick disc is more metal poor than the thindisc, with [fe/h]_{spec}=-1.0+/-0.1 compared to [fe/h]_{spec}=-0.7+/-0.05 forthe thin disc. we measure a radial scale length of the thin and thick discs ofh_r=7.3+/-1.0 kpc and h_r=8.0+/-1.2 kpc. from this, we infer scale heights forboth discs of 1.1+/-0.2 kpc and 2.8+/-0.6 kpc, both of which are ~2--3 timeslarger than those observed in the milky way. we estimate a mass range for thethick disc component of 2.4x10^{10}msun&lt; m_{*,thick} &lt;4.1x10^{10}msun. thisvalue provides a useful constraint on possible formation mechanisms, as anyproposed method for forming a thick disc must be able to heat (or deposit) atleast this amount of material.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1206.5730	dynamics in the satellite system of triangulum: is andxxii a dwarf  satellite of m33?	we present results from a spectroscopic survey of the dwarf spheroidal andxxii and the two extended clusters ec1 and ec2. these three objects arecandidate satellites of the triangulum galaxy, m33, which itself is likely asatellite of m31. we use the deep imaging multi-object spectrograph mounted onthe keck-ii telescope to derive radial velocities for candidate member stars ofthese objects and thereby identify the stars that are most likely actualmembers. eleven most probable stellar members (of 13 candidates) are found forandxxii. we obtain an upper limit of sigma_v &lt; 6.0 km s-1 for the velocitydispersion of andxxii, [fe/h] ~ -1.6 for its metallicity, and 255pc for theplummer radius of its projected density profile. we construct a colourmagnitude diagram for andxxii and identify both the red giant branch and thehorizontal branch. the position of the latter is used to derive a heliocentricdistance to and xxii of 853 pm 26 kpc. the combination of the radial velocity,distance, and angular position of andxxii indicates that it is a strongcandidate for being the first known satellite of m33 and one of the very fewexamples of a galactic satellite of a satellite. n-body simulations imply thatthis conclusion is unchanged even if m31 and m33 had a strong encounter in thepast few gyr. we test the hypothesis that the extended clusters highlighttidally stripped galaxies by searching for an excess cloud of halo-like starsin their vicinity. we find such a cloud for the case of ec1 but not ec2. thethree objects imply a dynamical mass for m33 that is consistent with previousestimates.

1307.6586	grb 120521c at z~6 and the properties of high-redshift grbs	we present optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of the afterglow ofgrb 120521c. by modeling the multi-wavelength dataset, we derive a photometricredshift of z~6.0, which we confirm with a low signal-to-noise ratio spectrumof the afterglow. we find that a model with a constant-density environmentprovides a good fit to the afterglow data, with an inferred density of0.05/cm^3. the radio observations reveal the presence of a jet break at 7 d,corresponding to a jet opening angle of ~ 3 deg. the beaming-correctedgamma-ray and kinetic energies are both ~ 3e50 erg. we quantify theuncertainties in our results using a detailed markov chain monte carloanalysis, which allows us to uncover degeneracies between the physicalparameters of the explosion. to compare grb 120521c to other high-redshiftbursts in a uniform manner we re-fit all available afterglow data for the twoother bursts at z&gt;6 with radio detections (grbs 050904 and 090423). we find ajet break at ~ 15 d for grb 090423, in contrast to previous work. based onthese three events, we find that grbs at z&gt;6 appear to explode inconstant-density environments, and exhibit a wide range of energies anddensities that span the range inferred for lower redshift bursts. on the otherhand, we find a hint for narrower jets in the z&gt;6 bursts, potentiallyindicating a larger true event rate at these redshifts. overall, our resultsindicate that long grbs share a common progenitor population at least to z~8.

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

astro-ph;0212334	a multi-colour study of the dark grb 000210 host galaxy and its  environment	we present ubvrizjshks broad band photometry of the host galaxy of the darkgamma-ray burst (grb) of february 10, 2000. these observations represent themost exhaustive photometry given to date of any grb host galaxy. a grid ofspectral templates have been fitted to the spectral energy distribution (sed)of the host. the derived photometric redshift is z=0.842^+0.054_-0.042, whichis in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic redshift (z=0.8463+/-0.0002)proposed by piro et al. (2002) based on a single emission line. furthermore, wehave determined the photometric redshift of all the galaxies in an area of6'x6' around the host galaxy, in order to check for their overdensity in theenvironment of the host. we find that the grb 000210 host galaxy is asubluminous galaxy (l ~ 0.5+/-0.2 l*), with no companions above our detectionthreshold of 0.18+/-0.06 l*. based on the restframe ultraviolet flux a starformation rate of 2.1+/-0.2 solar masses per year is estimated. the best fit tothe sed is obtained for a starburst template with an age of 0.181^+0.037_-0.026gyr and a very low extinction (av~0). we discuss the implications of theinferred low value of av and the age of the dominant stellar population for thenon detection of the grb 000210 optical afterglow.

astro-ph;0307153	the blue host galaxy of the red grb 000418	we report on multi-band (ubvrizjsks) observations of the host galaxy of theapril 18, 2000 gamma-ray burst. the spectral energy distribution (sed) isanalysed by fitting empirical and synthetic spectral templates. we find that:(i) the best sed fit is obtained with a starburst template, (ii) thephotometric redshift is consistent with the spectroscopic redshift, (iii) thecolours of the host are inconsistent with an old stellar population, and (iv)the global extinction is constrained to be in the range av=0.12-0.61 mag. thederived global extinction agrees with the one reported for the afterglow(av=0.4-0.9 mag), suggesting a homogeneous distribution of the interstellarmedium (ism) in the host galaxy. these findings are supplemented bymorphological information from hubble space telescope (hst) imaging: thesurface brightness profile is smooth, symmetric and compact with no underlyingstructures (like dust lanes, spiral arms or disks). a natural scenario whichaccounts of all the above results is a nuclear starburst that harbours a youngpopulation of stars from which the grb originated.

astro-ph;0307222	the afterglow and the host galaxy of grb 011211	we present optical, near-infrared, and x-ray observations of the opticalafterglow (oa) of the x-ray rich, long-duration gamma-ray burst grb 011211.hubble space telescope (hst) data obtained 14, 26, 32, and 59 days after theburst, show the host galaxy to have a morphology that is fairly typical of bluegalaxies at high redshift. we measure its magnitude to be r = 24.95 +/- 0.11.we detect a break in the oa r-band light curve which is naturally accounted forby a collimated outflow geometry. by fitting a broken power-law to the data wefind a best fit with a break 1.56 +/- 0.02 days after the burst, a pre-breakslope of alpha_1 = -0.95 +/- 0.02, and a post-break slope of alpha_2 = -2.11+/- 0.07. the uv-optical spectral energy distribution (sed) around 14 hoursafter the burst is best fit with a power-law with index beta = -0.56 +/- 0.19reddened by an smc-like extinction law with a modest a_v = 0.08 +/- 0.08 mag.by comparison, from the xmm-newton x-ray data at around the same time, we finda decay index of alpha_x = -1.62 +/- 0.36 and a spectral index of beta_x =-1.21 +0.10/-0.15. interpolating between the uv-optical and x-ray implies thatthe cooling frequency is located close to ~10^16 hz in the observer frame atthe time of the observations. we argue, using the various temporal and spectralindices above, that the most likely afterglow model is that of a jet expandinginto an external environment that has a constant mean density rather than awind-fed density structure. we estimate the electron energy index for thisburst to be p ~ 2.3.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0601176	a radial velocity survey of low galactic latitude structures: iii. the  monoceros ring in front of the carina and andromeda galaxies	as part of our radial velocity survey of low galactic latitude structuresthat surround the galactic disc, we report the detection of the so calledmonoceros ring in the foreground of the carina dwarf galaxy at galacticcoordinates (l,b)=(260,-22) based on vlt/flames observations of the dwarfgalaxy. at this location, 20 degrees in longitude greater than previousdetections, the ring has a mean radial velocity of 145+/-5 km/s and a velocitydispersion of only 17+/-5 km/s. based on keck/deimos observations, we alsodetermine that the ring has a mean radial velocity of -75+/-4 km/s in theforeground of the andromeda galaxy at (l,b)\sim(122,-22), along with a velocitydispersion of 26+/-3 km/s. these two kinematic detections are both highlycompatible with known characteristics of the structure and, along with previousdetections provide radial velocity values of the ring over the 120&lt;l&lt;260 range.this should add strong constraints on numerical models of the accretion of thedwarf galaxy that is believed to be the progenitor of the ring.

astro-ph;0602604	a kinematically selected, metal-poor stellar halo in the outskirts of  m31	we present evidence for a metal-poor, [fe/h]$\sim-1.4$ $\sigma$=0.2 dex,stellar halo component detectable at radii from 10 kpc to 70 kpc, in ournearest giant spiral neighbor, the andromeda galaxy. this metal-poor sampleunderlies the recently-discovered extended rotating component, and has nodetected metallicity gradient. this discovery uses a large sample of 9861radial velocities of red giant branch (rgb) stars obtained with the keck-iitelescope and deimos spectrograph, with 827 stars with robust radial velocitymeasurements isolated kinematically to lie in the halo component primarily bywindowing out the extended rotating component which dominates the photometricprofile of andromeda out to $&lt;$50 kpc (de-projected). the stars lie in 54spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 square degree region, and are expected tofairly sample the halo to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. the halo sample shows nosignificant evidence for rotation. fitting a simple model in which the velocitydispersion of the component decreases with radius, we find a central velocitydispersion of $152\kms$ decreasing by $-0.90\kms/\kpc$. by fitting acosmologically-motivated nfw halo model to the halo stars we constrain thevirial mass of m31 to be greater than $9.0 \times 10^{11} \msun$ with 99%confidence. the properties of this halo component are very similar to thatfound in our milky way, revealing that these roughly equal mass galaxies mayhave led similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early universe.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0607471	multi-wavelength afterglow observations of the high redshift grb 050730	grb 050730 is a long duration high-redshift burst (z=3.967) discovered byswift. the afterglow shows variability and is well monitored over a widewavelength range. we present comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis ofthe afterglow of grb 050730 including observations from the millimeter tox-rays. we use multi-wavelength afterglow data to understand the temporal andspectral decay properties with superimposed variability of this high redshiftburst. five telescopes were used to study the decaying afterglow of grb 050730in the b, v, r', r, i', i, j and k photometric pass bands. a spectral energydistribution was constructed at 2.9 hours post-burst in the k, j, i, r, v and bbands. x-ray data from the satellites swift and xmm-newton were used to studythe afterglow evolution at higher energies. the early afterglow showsvariability at early times and shows a steepening at ~0.1 days (8.6 ks) in theb, v, r', r, i', i, j and k passbands. the early afterglow light curve decayedwith alpha_1 = -0.60+/-0.07 and alpha_2 = -1.71+/-0.06 based on r and i banddata. a millimeter detection of the afterglow around 3 days after the burstshows an excess in comparison to predictions. the early x-ray light curveobserved by swift is complex and contains flares. at late times the x-ray lightcurve can be fit by a powerlaw alpha_x = -2.5+/-0.15 which is steeper than theoptical light curve. a spectral energy distribution (sed) was constructed at\~2.9 hours after the burst. an electron energy index, p, of ~ 2.3 wascalculated using the sed and the photon index from the x-ray afterglow spectraand indicates that the synchrotron cooling frequency nu_c is above observedfrequencies.

astro-ph;0607472	discovery and analysis of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular  cluster in the outer halo of the andromeda galaxy	we present the discovery of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular clusterin the halo of the andromeda galaxy (m31), found in our megacam survey thatspans the southern quadrant of m31, from a projected distance of ~50 kpc to\~150 kpc. though the survey covers 57 sq. degrees, the four satellites liewithin 2\deg of one another. we estimate that the globular cluster lies at atotal distance of 175+/-55 kpc from m31, making it the farthest m31 globularcluster known. it also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globularcluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3+/-0.2 pc and an absolute magnitude inthe v band of m_{v,0}=-8.5+/-0.3 and contains a very old population with ametallicity of [fe/h]~-1.3. the three dwarf galaxies are all very faint, withabsolute magnitudes in the range -7.3&lt;m_{v,0}&lt;-6.4, and show strikingly similarcharacteristics with metallicities of [fe/h]~-1.4 and half-light radii of\~120+/-45 pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than thesmallest previously known satellites of m31. we estimate them to be between 740and 955 kpc from the sun. extrapolating from the coverage of the survey, weestimate that up to 45+/-20 satellites brighter than m_v~-6.5 should beorbiting m31. hence faint dwarf galaxies cannot alone account for the missingsatellites that are predicted by $\lambda$cdm models, unless they reside indark matter mini-halos that are more massive than the typical masse of 10^7solar masses currently inferred from their central radial velocity dispersion.(abridged)

astro-ph;0607601	anatomy of a dark burst - the afterglow of grb 060108	we report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a grb (060108) thatwould have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-basedoptical imaging with the 2-m robotic faulkes telesscope (ftn). ourmultiwavelength analysis reveals an x-ray light curve typical of many swiftlong grbs (3-segments plus flare). its optical afterglow, however, was alreadyfainter than the detection limit of the uvot within 100s of the burst. opticalimaging in bvri' filters with the ftn began 2.75 minutes after the burst andresulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a ukirtk-band identification at ~45 mins. r and i'-band light curves are consistentwith a single power law decay in flux, f(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 &lt;0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. deep vlt r-band imaging at ~12 daysreveals a faint, extended object (r ~23.5 mag) at the location of theafterglow. although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of thea_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. this impliesthat the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observedin the x-rays. we derive a maximum photometric redshift z&lt;3.2 for grb 060108and a best-fitting optical-to-x-ray sed at 1000 s after the burst consistentwith a power law with index beta_ox = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.the unambiguous detection at b-band and the derived photometric redshift ruleout a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of grb 060108.instead, the hard opt/x-ray spectral index confirms it as one of theoptically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains theuvot non-detection (abridged).

astro-ph;0701736	the nature of the x-ray flash of august 24 2005	we present comprehensive photometric r-band observations of the fadingoptical afterglow of the x-ray flash xrf050824, from 11 minutes to 104 daysafter the burst. the r-band lightcurve of the afterglow resembles thelightcurves of long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a power-law albeitwith a rather shallow slope of alpha=0.6. our late r-band images reveal thehost galaxy with a rest-frame b-band luminosity corresponding to roughly 0.5lstar. the star-formation rate as determined from the [o ii] emission lineluminosity is about 1.8 msun per year. when accounting for the hostcontribution, the slope is alpha=0.65+-0.01 and a break in the lightcurve isalso suggested. a potential lightcurve bump at 2 weeks can be interpreted as asupernova only if this is a supernova with a fast rise and a fast decay.however, the overall fit still show excess scatter in the lightcurve due towiggles and bumps. the flat lightcurves in the optical and x-rays could beexplained by a continuous energy injection scenario with an on-axis viewingangle and a wide jet opening angle (theta_j&gt;10 deg). if the energy injectionsare episodic, this could potentially help explain the bumps and wiggles.spectroscopy of the afterglow give a redshift of z=0.828+-0.005 from bothabsorption and emission lines. the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theafterglow has a power-law shape with slope beta=0.56+-0.04. this can becompared to the x-ray spectral index which is betax=1.0+-0.1. the curvature ofthe sed constrain the dust reddening towards the burst to av&lt;0.5 mag.(abridged)

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.
