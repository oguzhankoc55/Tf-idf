0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0903.2340	short-term spectroscopic monitoring of two cool dwarfs with strong  magnetic fields	context: there is now growing evidence that some brown dwarfs (bds) have verystrong magnetic fields, and yet their surface temperatures are so low that thecoupling is expected to be small between the matter and the magnetic field inthe atmosphere. in the deeper layers, however, the coupling is expected to bemuch stronger. aims: this raises the question of whether the magnetic fieldstill leads to the formation of structures in the photosphere. methods: wecarried out a spectroscopic monitoring campaign of two ultracool dwarfs thathave strong magnetic fields: the bd lp944-20 and 2massw j0036159+182110.lp944-20 was observed simultaneously in the optical and in the near infraredregime, 2massw j0036159+182110 only in the infrared. results: both dwarfsturned out to be remarkably constant. in the case of lp944-20, theteff-variations are &lt;50k, and the rms-variations in the equivalent widths ofhalpha small. we also find that the equivalent widths of photospheric lines areremarkably constant. we did not find any significant variations in the case of2massw j0036159+182110 either. thus the most important result is that nosignificant variability was found at the time of our observations. whencomparing our spectra with spectra taken over the past 11 years, we recognizesignificant changes during this time. conclusions: we interpret these resultsas evidence that the photosphere of these objects are remarkably homogeneous,with only little structure in them, and despite the strong magnetic fields.thus, unlike active stars, there are no prominent spots on these objects.

0903.4057	lucky imaging of m subdwarfs	the knowledge of the binary properties of metal-poor and solar-metallicitystars can shed light on the potential differences between the formationprocesses responsible for both types of objects.  the aim of the project is to determine the binary properties (separation,mass ratio, frequency of companions) for m subdwarfs, the low-metallicitycounterparts of field m dwarfs, and investigate any potential differencesbetween both populations.  we have obtained high-resolution imaging in the optical for a sample of 24early-m subdwarfs and nine extreme subdwarfs with the ``lucky imaging''technique using the astralux instrument on the calar alto 2.2-m telescope.  we are sensitive to companions at separations larger than 0.1 arcsec anddifferences of ~2 magnitudes at 0.1 arcsec and ~5 mag at 1 arcsec. we havefound no companion around the 24 subdwarfs under study and one close binary outof nine extreme subdwarfs. a second image of lhs 182 taken three months laterwith the same instrument confirms the common proper motion of the binaryseparated by about 0.7 arcsec. moreover, we do not confirm the common propermotion of the faint source reported by riaz and collaborators at ~2 arcsec fromlhs 1074. we derive a binary frequency of 3+/-3% for m subdwarfs from oursample of 33 objects for separations larger than about five astronomical units.adding to our sample the additional 28 metal-poor early-m dwarfs observed withthe hubble space telescope by riaz and collaborators, we infer a binaryfraction of 3.7+/-2.6% (with a 1 sigma confidence limit), significantly lowerthan the fraction of resolved binary m dwarfs (~20%) over the same mass andseparation ranges (abridged).

0903.4461	physical parameters of t dwarfs derived from high-resolution  near-infrared spectra	we determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and projectedrotational velocity of nine t dwarfs from the comparison of high-resolutionnear-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate the mass and age ofthe objects from state-of-the-art models. we use the ames-cond cloudless solarmetallicity models provided by the phoenix code to match the spectra of the tdwarfs observed with the nir high-resolution spectrograph nirspec using tenechelle orders to cover part of the j band from 1.165 to 1.323 microns withr~20,000. the projected rotational velocity, teff and logg of the objects aredetermined based on the minimum rms of the differences between the modelled andobserved relative fluxes. the modelled spectra reproduce quite well theobserved features for most of the t dwarfs, with teff in the range of 922-1009k, and logg between 4.3 and 5 (cm s^-2). our results support the assumption ofa dust free atmosphere for t dwarfs later than t5, where dust grains form andthen gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. the modelled spectra donot accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the ki doublet at1.2436 and 1.2525 microns. our modelled spectra does not match well theobserved spectra of the two t dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely sdsspj125453.90-012247.4 (t2) and 2mass j05591914-1404488 (t4.5), which is likelydue to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in themodels used here. by comparing our results and their uncertainties toevolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval ~5-75 mj for t dwarfslater than t5, which are in good agreement with those found in the literature.we found apparent young ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few gyr forthe same t dwarfs, which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.

1011.3282	source to accretion disk tilt	many different system types retrogradely precess, and retrograde precessioncould be from a tidal torque by the secondary on a misaligned accretion disk.however, a source to cause and maintain disk tilt is unknown. in this work, weshow that accretion disks can tilt due to a force called lift. lift resultsfrom differing gas stream supersonic speeds over and under an accretion disk.because lift acts at the disk's center of pressure, a torque is applied arounda rotation axis passing through the disk's center of mass. the disk responds tolift by pitching around the disk's line of nodes. if the gas stream flow ebbs,then lift also ebbs and the disk attempts to return to its originalorientation.  to first approximation, lift does not depend on magnetic fields or radiationsources but does depend on mass and the surface area of the disk. also, fordisk tilt to be initiated, a minimum mass transfer rate must be exceeded. forexample, a $10^{-11}m_{\odot}$ disk around a 0.8$m_{\odot}$ compact centralobject requires a mass transfer rate greater than$\sim10^{-13}$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, a value well below known mass transferrates in cataclysmic variable dwarf novae systems that retrogradely precess andthat exhibit negative superhumps in their light curves and a value well belowmass transfer rates in protostellar forming systems.

1108.1724	wise/2mass-sdss brown dwarfs candidates using virtual observatory tools	massive far-red and infrared imaging surveys in different bandpasses are themain contributors to the discovery of brown dwarfs. the virtual observatoryrepresents an adequate framework to handle these vast datasets efficiently andfilter them out according to specific requirements. a statistically significantnumber of bds is mandatory for understanding their general properties betterfor identifing peculiar objects. wise, an all-sky survey in the mid-infrared,provides an excellent opportunity to increase the number of bds significantly,in particular those at the lower end of the temperature scale. we aim todemonstrate that vo tools are efficient in identifing and characterizing bds bycross-correlating public catalogues released by large surveys. using vo toolswe performed a cross-match of the wise preliminary release, the 2mass pointsource and the sdss data release 7 catalogues over the whole area of sky thatthey have in common ($\sim$ 4000 deg$^{2}$). photometric and proper motioncriteria were used to obtain a list of bd candidates. a temperature estimate isprovided for each candidate based on their spectral energy distribution usingvosa, a vo tool for sed fitting. we derive the spectral types from theeffective temperatures. distances, calculated from the absolute magnitude-spectral type relation, place our candidates at 14-80 pc from the sun, assumingthat they are single. we have identified 31 bd candidates, 25 of which havealready been reported in the literature. the remaining six candidates have beenclassified as l- (four) and t-type (two) objects. the high rate of recovery ofknown bds ($\sim$ 90% of the t dwarfs catalogued in 2mass) demonstrates thevalidity of our strategy to identify them with vo tools.

1109.4151	young stellar objects in ngc 6823	ngc 6823 is a young open cluster that lies at a distance of ~2 kpc in thevulpecula ob1 association. previous studies using ccd photometry andspectroscopy have identified a trapezium system of bright o- and b-type starsat its center. we present optical, near-infrared and spitzer photometricobservations of the cluster. our survey reaches down to i~22 mag and ks~18 mag.there is significant differential reddening within the cluster. we find abimodal distribution for av, with a peak at ~3 mag and a broader peak at ~10mag. we find a ~20% fraction of class i/class ii young stellar objects (ysos)in the cluster, while a large 80% fraction of the sources have a class iiiclassification. we have made use of the iphas survey in order to probe thestrength in halpha emission for this large population of class iii sources.nearly all of the class iii objects have photospheric (r'-halpha) colors,implying an absence of halpha in emission. this large population of class iiisources is thus likely the extincted field star population rather than thediskless ysos in the cluster. there is a higher concentration of the class i/iisystems in the eastern region of the cluster and close to the centraltrapezium. the western part of the cluster mostly contains class iii/fieldstars and seems devoid of disk sources. we find evidence of a pre-main sequencepopulation in ngc 6823, in addition to an upper main-sequence population. thepre-main sequence population mainly consists of young disk sources with agesbetween ~1-5 myr, and at lower masses of ~0.1-0.4 msun. there may be a possiblemass dependent age spread in the cluster, with the older stars being moremassive than the younger ones. the presence of young disk sources in ngc 6823indicates similar star formation properties in the outer regions of the galaxyas observed for young clusters in the solar neighborhood.

0710.2776	new constraints on the membership of the t dwarf s ori 70 in the sigma  orionis cluster	(abridged) the nature of s ori 70, a faint mid-t type object found towardsthe direction of the young sigma orionis cluster, is still under debate. weintend to disentangle whether it is a field brown dwarf or a 3-myr oldplanetary-mass member of the cluster. we report on near-infrared jhk_s andmid-infrared [3.6] and [4.5] irac/spitzer photometry recently obtained for sori 70. the new near-infrared images (taken 3.82 yr after the discovery data)have allowed us to derive a very small proper motion (11.0 +/- 5.9 mas/yr) forthis object, which is consistent with the proper motion of the cluster within1.5 sigma the astrometric uncertainty. the colors (h-k_s), (j-k_s) andk_s-[3.6] appear discrepant when compared to t4-t7 dwarfs in the field. thisbehavior could be ascribed to a low-gravity atmosphere or alternatively to anatmosphere with a metallicity significantly different than solar. taking intoaccount the small proper motion of s ori 70 and its new near- and mid-infraredcolors, a low-gravity atmosphere remains as the most likely explanation toaccount for our observations. this supports s ori 70's membership in sigmaorionis, with an estimated mass in the interval 2-7 mjup, in agreement with ourprevious derivation.

1111.4480	the radial distribution of dust species in young brown dwarf disks	we present a study of the radial distribution of dust species in young browndwarf disks. our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20micron silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the taurus-aurigastar-forming region. a fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfsexhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,compared to the higher mass t tauri stars in taurus. for nearly all of ourtargets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the strongersigns of dust processing observed in these disks. for the case of one browndwarf, 2m04230607, we find the forsterite mass fraction to be a factor of ~3higher in the outer disk compared to the inner disk region. simple large-scaleradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemicalcomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective inthis disk. the relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outercold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets. inthis context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanismsthat have been proposed for comets on the formation and the outward transportof high-temperature material. we also present chandra x-ray observations fortwo taurus brown dwarfs, 2m04414825 and cfht-bd-tau 9. we find 2m04414825,which has a ~12% crystalline mass fraction, to be more than an order ofmagnitude brighter in x-ray than cfht-bd-tau 9, which has a ~35% crystallinemass fraction. combining with previous x-ray data, we find the inner diskcrystalline mass fractions to be anti-correlated with the x-ray strength.

1206.1200	four ultra-short period eclipsing m-dwarf binaries in the wfcam transit  survey	we report on the discovery of four ultra-short period (p&lt;0.18 days) eclipsingm-dwarf binaries in the wfcam transit survey. their orbital periods aresignificantly shorter than of any other known main-sequence binary system, andare all significantly below the sharp period cut-off at p~0.22 days as seen inbinaries of earlier type stars. the shortest-period binary consists of two m4type stars in a p=0.112 day orbit. the binaries are discovered as part of anextensive search for short-period eclipsing systems in over 260,000 stellarlightcurves, including over 10,000 m-dwarfs down to j=18 mag, yielding 25binaries with p&lt;0.23 days. in a popular paradigm, the evolution of short periodbinaries of cool main-sequence stars is driven by loss of angular momentumthrough magnetised winds. in this scheme, the observed p~0.22 day periodcut-off is explained as being due to timescales that are too long forlower-mass binaries to decay into tighter orbits. our discovery of low-massbinaries with significantly shorter orbits implies that either these timescaleshave been overestimated for m-dwarfs, e.g. due to a higher effective magneticactivity, or that the mechanism for forming these tight m-dwarf binaries isdifferent from that of earlier type main-sequence stars.

1206.6619	narrow band halpha photometry of the super-earth gj 1214b with  gtc/osiris tunable filters	the super-earth planet gj 1214b has recently been the focus of severalstudies, using the transit spectroscopy technique, trying to determine thenature of its atmosphere. here we focus on the halpha line as a tool to furtherrestrict the nature of gj1214's atmosphere. we used the gran telescopiocanarias (gtc) osiris instrument to acquire narrow band photometry with tunablefilters. with our observations, we were able to observe the primary transit ofthe super-earth gj 1214b in three bandpasses: two centered in the continuumaround halpha (653.5 nm and 662.0 nm) and one centered at the line core (656.3nm). we measure the depth of the planetary transit at each wavelengthinterval.by fitting analytic models to the measured light curves we were ableto compute the depth of the transit at the three bandpasses. taking thedifference in the computed planet to star radius ratio between the line and thecomparison continuum filters, we find delta (rp/rstar)_{halpha-653.5} = (6.60+/- 3.54) 10^-3 and delta (rp/rstar)_{halpha-662.0} = (3.30 +/- 3.61) 10^-3.although the planet radius is found to be larger in the halpha line than in thesurrounding continuum, the quality of our observations and the sigma level ofthe differences (1.8 and 1.0, respectively) does not allow us to claim anhalpha excess in gj1214's atmosphere. further observations will be needed toresolve this issue.

1211.5288	j band variability of m dwarfs in the wfcam transit survey	we present an analysis of the photometric variability of m dwarfs in thewfcam transit survey. although periodic lightcurve variability in low massstars is generally dominated by photospheric star spot activity, m dwarfvariability in the j band has not been as thoroughly investigated as at visiblewavelengths. spectral type estimates for a sample of over 200,000 objects aremade using spectral type-colour relations, and over 9600 dwarfs (j&lt;17) withspectral types later than k7 were found. the light curves of the late-typesample are searched for periodicity using a lomb-scargle periodogram analysis.a total of 68 periodic variable m dwarfs are found in the sample with periodsranging from 0.16 days to 90.33 days, with amplitudes in the range of ~0.009 to~0.115 in the j band. we simulate active m dwarfs with a range oflatitude-independent spot coverages and estimate a periodically variablefractions of 1-3 per cent for stars where spots cover more than 10 per cent ofthe star's surface. our simulated spot distributions indicate that operating inthe j band, where spot contrast ratios are minimised, enables variability inonly the most active of stars to be detected. these findings affirm thebenefits of using the $j$ band for planetary transit searches compared tovisible bands. we also serendipitously find a \delta j&gt;0.2 mag flaring eventfrom an m4v star in our sample.

1303.0945	a highly unequal-mass eclipsing m-dwarf binary in the wfcam transit  survey	in this paper we present the discovery of a highly unequal-mass eclipsingm-dwarf binary, providing a unique constraint on binary star formation theoryand on evolutionary models for low-mass binary stars. the binary is discoveredusing high- precision infrared light curves from the wfcam transit survey (wts)and has an orbital period of 2.44 d. we find stellar masses of m1 = 0.53 (0.02)msun and m2 = 0.143 (0.006) msun (mass ratio 0.27), and radii of r1 = 0.51(0.01) rsun and r2 = 0.174 (0.006) rsun. this puts the companion in a verysparsely sampled and important late m-dwarf mass-regime. since both stars sharethe same age and metallicity and straddle the theoretical boundary betweenfully and partially convective stellar interiors, a comparison can be made tomodel predictions over a large range of m-dwarf masses using the same modelisochrone. both stars appear to have a slightly inflated radius compared to 1gyr model predictions for their masses, but future work is needed to properlyaccount for the effects of star spots on the light curve solution. asignificant, subsynchronous, ~2.56 d signal with ~2% peak-to-peak amplitude isdetected in the wfcam light curve, which we attribute to rotational modulationof cool star spots. we propose that the subsynchronous rotation is either dueto a stable star-spot complex at high latitude on the (magnetically active)primary (i.e. differential rotation), or to additional magnetic braking, or tointeraction of the binary with a third body or circumbinary disk during itspre-main-sequence phase.

1306.3225	astrometric orbit of a low-mass companion to an ultracool dwarf	little is known about the existence of extrasolar planets around ultracooldwarfs. furthermore, binary stars with sun-like primaries and very low-massbinaries composed of ultracool dwarfs show differences in the distributions ofmass ratio and orbital separation that can be indicative of distinct formationmechanisms. using fors2/vlt optical imaging for high precision astrometry weare searching for planets and substellar objects around ultracool dwarfs toinvestigate their multiplicity properties for very low companion masses. herewe report astrometric measurements with an accuracy of two tenths of amilli-arcsecond over two years that reveal orbital motion of the nearby l1.5dwarf denis-p j082303.1-491201 located at 20.77 +/- 0.08 pc caused by an unseencompanion that revolves about its host on an eccentric orbit in 246.4 +/- 1.4days. we estimate the l1.5 dwarf to have 7.5 +/- 0.7 % of the sun's mass thatimplies a companion mass of 28 +/- 2 jupiter masses. this new system has thesmallest mass ratio (0.36 +/- 0.02) of known very low-mass binaries withcharacterised orbits. with this discovery we demonstrate 200 micro-arcsecondastrometry over an arc-minute field and over several years that is sufficientto discover sub-jupiter mass planets around ultracool dwarfs. we also show thatthe achieved parallax accuracy of &lt; 0.4 % makes it possible to remove distanceas a dominant source of uncertainty in the modelling of ultracool dwarfs.

1310.1178	dead layer on silicon p-i-n diode charged-particle detectors	semiconductor detectors in general have a dead layer at their surfaces thatis either a result of natural or induced passivation, or is formed during theprocess of making a contact. charged particles passing through this regionproduce ionization that is incompletely collected and recorded, which leads todepartures from the ideal in both energy deposition and resolution. the silicon\textit{p-i-n} diode used in the katrin neutrino-mass experiment has such adead layer. we have constructed a detailed monte carlo model for the passage ofelectrons from vacuum into a silicon detector, and compared the measured energyspectra to the predicted ones for a range of energies from 12 to 20 kev. thecomparison provides experimental evidence that a substantial fraction of theionization produced in the "dead" layer evidently escapes by diffusion, with46% being collected in the depletion zone and the balance being neutralized atthe contact or by bulk recombination. the most elementary model of a thinnerdead layer from which no charge is collected is strongly disfavored.

1504.02469	astrometric planet search around southern ultracool dwarfs iii.  discovery of a brown dwarf in a 3-year orbit around de0630-18	using astrometric measurements obtained with the fors2/vlt camera, we aresearching for low-mass companions around 20 nearby ultracool dwarfs. with asingle-measurement precision of 0.1 milli-arcseconds, our survey is sensitiveto a wide range of companion masses from planetary companions to binarysystems. here, we report the discovery and orbit characterisation of a newultracool binary at a distance of 19.5 pc from earth that is composed of them8.5-dwarf primary de0630-18 and a substellar companion. the nearly edge-onorbit is moderately eccentric (e=0.23) with an orbital period of 1120 d, whichcorresponds to a relative separation in semimajor axis of approximately 1.1 au.we obtained a high-resolution optical spectrum with uves/vlt and measured thesystem's heliocentric radial velocity. the spectrum does not exhibit lithiumabsorption at 670.8 nm, indicating that the system is not extremely young. apreliminary estimate of the binary's physical parameters tells us that it iscomposed of a primary at the stellar-substellar limit and a massive brown-dwarfcompanion. de0630-18 is a new very low-mass binary system with awell-characterised orbit.

(2006). seven of the new t dwarfs havespectral types of t2.5-t4.5, five have spectral types of t5-t5.5, one is at6.5p, and two are t7-7.5. we assess spectral morphology and colours toidentify t dwarfs in our sample that may have non-typical physical properties(by comparison to solar neighbourhood populations). the colours of the fullsample of las t dwarfs show a possible trend to bluer y-j with decreasingeffective temperature beyond t8. by accounting for the main sources ofincompleteness (selection, follow-up and spatial) as well as the effects ofunresolved binarity and malmquist bias, we estimate that there are 17+-4 &gt;=t4dwarfs in the j&lt;=19 volume of the las second data release. comparing this totheoretical predictions is most consistent with a sub-stellar mass functionexponent alpha between -1.0 and 0. this is consistent with the latest2mass/sdss constraint (which is based on lower number statistics), and issignificantly lower than the alpha~1.0 suggested by l dwarf field populations,possibly a result of the lower mass range probed by the t dwarf class.

astro-ph;0003391	a search for jovian-mass planets around cm draconis using eclipse minima  timing	for the eclipsing binary system cm draconis, eclipse minimum times have beenmonitored with high precision between 1994 and 1999. periodic deviations ofminimum times from a linear ephemeris may indicate the presence of an orbitingthird body. individual measurements of 41 eclipse minimum times result in astandard deviation from linear ephemeris of 5.74 seconds. a power spectralanalysis of the residuals reveals only one periodicity with more then 2 secondsamplitude. this feature, with a periodicity between 750 and 1050 days has anamplitude of 2.8+-0.5 seconds, and is also present with similar phases if thepower spectral analysis is performed independently for primary and secondaryeclipses. it would be compatible with a planet of 1.5-3 jupiter masses at anorbital distance of 1.1-1.45 au to the binary barycenter. the assignation of aplanet to the cm dra system can however only be upheld if this periodicity canbe followed in future observations for several years. for low-mass eclipsingbinary stars, the method of eclipse minimum timing allows one to reach masslimits for the detection of third bodies well below that feasible by radialvelocity measurements.

astro-ph;0004174	membership and multiplicity among very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs  in the pleiades cluster	we present near-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy of very low-massstars and brown dwarf candidates in the pleiades open cluster. the membershipstatus of these objects is assessed. eight objects out of 45 appear to benon-members. a search for companions among 34 very low-mass pleiades members(m$\le$0.09 m$_\odot$) in high-spatial resolution images obtained with thehubble space telescope and the adaptive optics system of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope produced no resolved binaries with separationslarger than 0.2 arcsec (a ~ 27 au; p ~ 444 years). nevertheless, we findevidence for a binary sequence in the color-magnitude diagrams, in agreementwith the results of steele &amp; jameson (1995) for higher mass stars. we comparethe multiplicity statistics of the pleiades very low-mass stars and browndwarfs with that of g and k-type main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood(duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991). we find that there is some evidence for a deficiencyof wide binary systems (separation &gt;27 au) among the pleiades very low-massmembers. we briefly discuss how this result can fit with current scenarios ofbrown dwarf formation. we correct the pleiades substellar mass function for thecontamination of cluster non-members found in this work. we find acontamination level of 33% among the brown dwarf candidates identified bybouvier et al. (1998). assuming a power law imf across the substellar boundary,we find a slope dn/dm ~ m^{-0.53}, implying that the number of objects per massbin is still rising but the contribution to the total mass of the cluster isdeclining in the brown dwarf regime.

astro-ph;0104097	the substellar mass function in sigma orionis	we combine results from imaging searches for substellar objects in the sigmaorionis cluster and follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations toderive a census of the brown dwarf population in a region of 847 arcmin^2. weidentify 64 very low-mass cluster member candidates in this region. we haveavailable three color (izj) photometry for all of them, spectra for 9 objects,and k photometry for 27% of our sample. these data provide a well definedsequence in the i vs i-j, i-k color magnitude diagrams, and indicate that thecluster is affected by little reddening despite its young age (~5 myr). usingstate-of-the-art evolutionary models, we derive a mass function from thelow-mass stars (0.2 msol) across the complete brown dwarf domain (0.075 msol to0.013 msol), and into the realm of free-floating planetary-mass objects (&lt;0.013msol). we find that the mass spectrum (dn/dm ~ m^{-alpha}) increases towardlower masses with an exponent alpha = 0.8+/-0.4. our results suggest thatplanetary-mass isolated objects could be as common as brown dwarfs; both kindsof objects together would be as numerous as stars in the cluster. if thedistribution of stellar and substellar masses in sigma orionis isrepresentative of the galactic disk, older and much lower luminosityfree-floating planetary-mass objects with masses down to about 0.005 msolshould be abundant in the solar vicinity, with a density similar to m-typestars.

0809.0996	low-resolution spectroscopy and spectral energy distributions of  selected sources towards sigma orionis	aims: we investigated in detail nine sources in the direction of the youngsigma orionis cluster, which is considered a unique site for studying stellarand substellar formation. the nine sources were selected because of somepeculiar properties, such as extremely red infrared colours or too stronghalpha emission for their blue optical colours. methods: we took high-quality,low-resolution spectroscopy (r ~ 500) of the nine targets with alfosc at thenordic optical telescope. we also re-analyzed [24]-band photometry frommips/spitzer and compiled the best photometry available at the vijhks passbandsand the four irac/spitzer channels for constructing accurate spectral energydistributions covering from 0.55 to 24 mum. results: the nine targets wereclassified into: one herbig ae/be star with a scatterer edge-on disc, twog-type stars, one x-ray flaring, early-m, young star with chromospheric halphaemission, one very low-mass, accreting, young spectroscopic binary, two youngobjects at the brown dwarf boundary with the characteristics of classical ttauri stars, and two emission-line galaxies, one undergoing star formation, andanother one whose spectral energy distribution is dominated by an activegalactic nucleus. besides, we discover three infrared sources associated tooverdensities in a cold cloud in the cluster centre. conclusions:low-resolution spectroscopy and spectral energy distributions are a vital toolfor measuring the physical properties and the evolution of young stars andcandidates in the sigma orionis cluster.

astro-ph;0512258	multiplicity of very low-mass objects in the upper scorpius ob  association: a possible wide binary population	we report the initial results of a vlt/naco high spatial resolution imagingsurvey for multiple systems among 58 m-type members of the nearby upperscorpius ob association. nine pairs with separations below 100 have beenresolved. their small angular separations and the similarity in the brightnessof the components (dmagk &lt;1 for all of them), indicate there is a reasonablelikelihood several of them are true binaries rather than chance projections.follow-up imaging observations with wht/liris of the two widest binariesconfirm that their near-infrared colours are consistent with physical very lowmass binaries. for one of these two binaries, wht/liris spectra of eachcomponent were obtained. we find that the two components have similar m6-m7spectral types and signatures of low-gravity, as expected for a young browndwarf binary in this association. our preliminary results indicate a possiblepopulation of very low-mass binaries with semimajor axis in the range 100 au150 au, which has not been seen in the pleiades open cluster. if thesecandidates are confirmed (one is confirmed by this work), these results wouldindicate that the binary properties of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs maydepend on the environment where they form.

astro-ph;0603194	spectroscopic rotational velocities of brown dwarfs	we have obtained projected rotation velocities (vsini) of a sample of 19ultracool dwarfs with spectral types in the interval m6.5-t8 usinghigh-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with nirspec and the keck iitelescope. among our targets there are two young brown dwarfs, two likely fieldstars, and fifteen likely brown dwarfs (30-72 mjup) of the solar neighborhood.our results indicate that the t-type dwarfs are fast rotators in markedcontrast to m-type stars. we have derived vsini velocities between &lt;15 and 40km/s for them, and have found no clear evidence for t dwarfs rotating stronglyfaster than l dwarfs. however, there is a hint for an increasing lower envelopeon moving from mid-m to the l spectral types in the vsini-spectral type diagramthat was previously reported in the literature; our vsini results extend it toeven cooler types. assuming that field brown dwarfs have a size of 0.08-0.1rsol, we can place an upper limit of 12.5 h on the equatorial rotation periodof t-type brown dwarfs. in addition, we have compared our vsini measurements tospectroscopic rotational velocities of very young brown dwarfs of similar massavailable in the literature. the comparison, although model-dependent, suggeststhat brown dwarfs lose some angular momentum during their contraction; however,their spin down time seems to be significantly longer than that of solar-typeto early-m stars.

astro-ph;0608659	are isolated planetary-mass objects really isolated? a brown  dwarf-exoplanet system candidate in the sigma orionis cluster	the recent detection by direct imaging of three giant planets at wideseparation (50-250 au) from their primaries has raised the question about the``true isolation'' of planetary-mass objects in clusters. our goal was to testthe possibility that some free-floating planetary-mass object could in fact bepart of wide planetary systems. we searched in the literature for stellar andbrown-dwarf member candidates of the sigma orionis cluster at small angularseparations from published candidate planetary-mass objects. we found onecandidate planetary system, se 70, composed of an x-ray source and aplanetary-mass object, namely s ori 68, separated by only 4.6 arcsec. in orderto assess the cluster membership of the x-ray source, we obtainedmid-resolution optical spectroscopy using isis on the william herscheltelescope. we also compiled additional data on the target from availableastronomical catalogues. we have found that se 70 follows thespectrophotometric sequence of the cluster and displays spectroscopic featuresof youth, such as lithium in absorption and chromospheric halpha emission. theradial velocity is consistent with cluster membership. hence, se 70 is veryprobably a sigma orionis cluster member. the projected physical separationbetween se 70 and s ori 68 is 1700+/-300 au at the distance of the cluster. ifthe common proper motion is confirmed in the near future, the system would becomposed of an m5-6 brown dwarf with an estimated mass of ~45 m_jup and anl5+/-2 giant planet with an estimated mass of ~5 m_jup. it would be the widestand one of the lowest-mass planetary systems known so far.

(1992). our radialvelocity measurements are found to be generally consistent with the meancluster velocity to within the measurement errors. halpha equivalent widthshave been measured and compared to previous published data for other knownmembers of the cluster. a turnover in chromospheric activity around spectraltype m3-m4 is observed. the brown dwarf candidate, located in the cool side ofthe turnover, is confirmed to exhibit a strong halpha variability. it is thecoolest alpha per candidate member for which spectra are available and forwhich chromospheric activity has been measured. using the lii doublet at lambda6707.8 angstroms, we derive upper limits to the atmospheric li abundance in thesample and discuss them in the context of the most recent stellar evolutionarytracks. the non-detection of the lii line in the spectrum of the brown dwarfcandidate implies a mass greater than 0.08 solar masses, and therefore it isnot a substellar object. however, its position in the hr diagram implies thatthis star is indeed very close to the substellar limit.

astro-ph;9703131	on a rapid lithium enrichment and depletion of k giant stars	a model scenario has recently been introduced to explain the presence of verystrong li lines in the spectra of some low mass k giant stars (de la reza etal. 1996). in this scenario all ordinary, li poor, k giants become li richduring a short time ($\sim 10^5 yr$) when compared to the red giant phase of 510^7 yr. in this ``li period'', a large part of the stars are associated withan expanding thin circumstellar shell supposedly triggered by an abruptinternal mixing mechanism resulting in a surface new ^7li enrichment. thisletter presents near 40 li rich k giants known up to now. the distribution ofthese li rich giants, along with other 41 observed k giants that have shell,but are not li rich, in a color-color iras diagram confirms this scenario,indicating, also as a new result, that a rapid li depletion takes place on atime scale of between $\sim 10^3$ and 10^5 yr. this model explains the problemof the presence of k giants with far infrared excesses presented by zuckermanet al.
