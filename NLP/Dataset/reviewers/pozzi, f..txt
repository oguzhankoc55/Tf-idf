0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0902.4236	the hellas2xmm survey. xii. the infrared/sub-millimeter view of an x-ray  selected type 2 quasar at z=2	we present multi-wavelength observations (from optical to sub-millimeter,including spitzer and scuba) of h2xmmj 003357.2-120038 (also gd158_19), anx-ray selected, luminous narrow-line (type 2) quasar at z=1.957 selected fromthe hellas2xmm survey. its broad-band properties can be reasonably well modeledassuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical andnear-ir emission, an agn component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting activenucleus), dominant in the mid-ir, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along theline of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) oftau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140degrees, and a far-ir starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation)to reproduce the wide bump observed longward of 70 micron. the derivedstar-formation rate is about 1500 solar masses per year. the overall modelingindicates that gd158_19 is a high-redshift x-ray luminous, obscured quasar withcoeval powerful agn activity and intense star formation. it is probably caughtbefore the process of expelling the obscuring gas has started, thus quenchingthe star formation.

0909.2535	spectroscopic identifications of spitzer sources in the  swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field: a large fraction of active galactic nuclei  with high f(24micron)/f(r) ratio	we present a catalog of optical spectroscopic identifications of sourcesdetected by spitzer at 3.6 or 24 micron down to 10 and 280 microjy,respectively, in the swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field and classified via linewidth analysis and diagnostic diagrams. a total of 1376 sources down to r~24.2mag have been identified (1362 detected at 3.6 micron, 419 at 24 micron, and405 at both) by low-resolution optical spectroscopy carried out with fors2,vimos, and efosc2 at the very large telescope and 3.6m eso telescopes. thespectroscopic campaigns have been carried out over the central 0.6 squaredegrees area of elais-s1 which, in particular, has also been observed byxmm-newton and chandra. we find the first direct optical spectroscopic evidencethat the fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn; mostly agn2) increases withincreasing f(24 micron)/f(r) ratio, reaching values of 70(+/-20)% in the range316&lt;f(24 micron)f(r)&lt;1000. we present an irac-mips color-color diagram able toseparate agn1 from obscured agn2 candidates. after having corrected for thespectroscopic incompleteness of our sample, it results that the agn fraction atf(24 micron)=0.8 mjy is ~22(+/-7)% and decreases slowly to ~19(+/-5)% down tof(24 micron)=0.3 mjy.

0909.5044	spectroscopic cosmological surveys in the far-ir	we show the feasibility of spectroscopic cosmological surveys with the safariinstrument onboard of spica. the work is done through simulations that make useof both empirical methods, i.e. the use of observed luminosity functions andtheoretical models for galaxy formation and evolution. the relations assumedbetween the line emission to trace agn and star formation activity have beenderived from the observations of local samples of galaxies. the resultsconverge to indicate the use of blind spectroscopy with the safari fts atvarious resolutions to study galaxy evolution from the local to the distant(z~3) universe. specifically, two different and independent galaxy evolutionmodels predict about 7-10 sources to be spectroscopically detected in more thanone line in a 2'x 2'safari field of view, down to the expected flux limits ofsafari, with about 20% of sources to be detected at z&gt;2. spica-safari will betherefore excellent at detecting high-z sources and at assessing in a directway their nature (e.g whether mainly agn or star formation powered) thanks toblind spectroscopy.

0707.2342	agn counts at 15um. xmm observations of the elais-s1-5 sample	context: the counts of galaxies and agn in the mid infra-red (mir) bands areimportant instruments for studying their cosmological evolution. however, theclassic spectral line ratios techniques can become misleading when trying toproperly separate agn from starbursts or even from apparently normal galaxies.  aims: we use x-ray band observations to discriminate agn activity inpreviously classified mir-selected starburst galaxies and to derive updatedagn1 and (compton thin) agn2 counts at 15 um.  methods: xmm observations of the elais-s1 15um sample down to flux limits~2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-10 kev band) were used. we classified as agn allthose mir sources with a unabsorbed 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity higher that~10^42 erg/s.  results: we find that at least about 13(+/-6) per cent of the previouslyclassified starburst galaxies harbor an agn. according to these figures, weprovide an updated estimate of the counts of agn1 and (compton thin) agn2 at 15um. it turns out that at least 24% of the extragalactic sources brighter than0.6 my at 15 um are agn (~13% contribution to the extragalactic backgroundproduced at fluxes brighter than 0.6 mjy).

1001.2005	discovery of compton-thick quasars in the sloan digital sky survey	we present new and archival chandra snapshot (10 ks each) observations of 15optically identified (from the sloan digital sky survey, sdss) type 2 quasarsat z=0.40-0.73. when combined with existing x-ray data, this work providescomplete x-ray coverage for all 25 radio-quiet type 2 quasars withlogl_[oiii]&gt;9.28 l_sun from zakamska et al. (2003). two targets out of 15 werenot detected by chandra and most of the remaining sources are x-ray weak, withnine having less than 10 counts in the 0.5-8kev band. low-to-moderate qualityspectral analysis was limited to three sources, whose properties are consistentwith the presence of column densities in the range nh~10^22-10^23 cm^-2 in thesource rest frame. if the [oiii] luminosity is a reliable proxy for theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, the current x-ray data indicate that compton-thickquasars may hide among ~65 per cent of the sdss type 2 quasar population (l_{x,meas}/l_{x, [oiii]}&lt;0.01); however, since the type 2 quasar sample is selectedon [oiii] luminosity, the estimated compton-thick quasar fraction may beoverestimated. using archival spitzer observations, we find that ~50 per centof sdss type 2 quasars appear to be obscured by compton-thick material based onboth the l_{x, meas}/l_{x, mid-ir} (where mid-ir corresponds to rest-frame 12.3micron) and l_{x, meas}/l_{x, [oiii]} ratios. we use this information toprovide an estimate of the compton-thick quasar number density at z=0.3-0.8,which we find is in broad agreement with the expectations from x-ray backgroundmodels.

1003.5563	the hellas2xmm survey. xiii. multi-component analysis of the spectral  energy distribution of obscured agn	we combine near-to-mid-ir spitzer data with shorter wavelength observations(optical to x-rays) to get insights on the properties of a sample of luminous,obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). we aim at modeling their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds) in order to estimate the main parametersrelated to the dusty torus. the sample comprises 16 obscured high-redshift(0.9&lt;z&lt;2.1) xray luminous quasars (l_2-10 ~ 10^44 erg s-1) selected from thehellas2xmm survey. the seds are described by a multi-component model includinga stellar component, an agn component and a starburst. the majority (~80%) ofthe sources show moderate optical depth (tau_9.7um&lt;3) and the derived columndensities n_h are consistent with the xray inferred values (10^22 &lt;n_h&lt; 3x10^23cm-2) for most of the objects, confirming that the sources are moderatelyobscured compton-thin agn. accretion luminosities in the range 5x10^44 &lt; lbol &lt;4x10^46 erg s-1 are inferred. we compare model luminosities with those obtainedby integrating the observed sed, finding that the latter are lower by a factorof ~2 in the median. the discrepancy can be as high as an order of magnitudefor models with high optical depth (tau_9.7um=10). the ratio between theluminosities obtained by the fitting procedure and from the observed sedsuggest that, at least for type~2 agn, observed bolometric luminosities arelikely to underestimate intrinsic ones and the effect is more severe for highlyobscured sources. bolometric corrections from the hard x-ray band are computedand have a median value of k_2-10kev ~ 20. the obscured agn in our sample arecharacterized by relatively low eddington ratios (median lambda_edd~0.08). onaverage, they are consistent with the eddington ratio increasing at increasingbolometric correction (e.g. vasudevan &amp; fabiam 2009).

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.1473	pep: first herschel probe of dusty galaxy evolution up to z~3	we exploit the deepest existing far-infrared (fir) data obtained so far byherschel at 100 and 160 um in the goods-n, as part of the pacs evolutionaryprobe (pep) survey, to derive for the first time the evolution of therest-frame 60-um, 90-um, and total ir luminosity functions (lfs) of galaxiesand agns from z=0 to unprecedented high redshifts (z~2-3). the pep lfs werecomputed using the 1/vmax method. the fir sources were classified by means of adetailed broad- band sed-fitting analysis and spectral characterisation. basedon the best-fit model results, k-correction and total ir (8-1000 um) luminositywere obtained for each source. lfs (monochromatic and total) were then derivedfor various ir populations separately in different redshift bins and comparedto backward evolution model predictions. we detect strong evolution in the lfto at least z~2. objects with seds similar to local spiral galaxies are themajor contributors to the star formation density (sfd) at z&lt; 0.3, then, asredshift increases, moderate sf galaxies - most likely containing alow-luminosity agn - start dominating up to z ~= 1.5. at &gt;1.5 the sfd isdominated by the contributions of starburst galaxies. in agreement withprevious findings, the comoving ir ld derived from our data evolvesapproximately as (1 + z)^(3.8+/-0.3) up to z~1, there being some evidence offlattening up to z~2.

1005.1575	herschel deep far-infrared counts through the abell 2218 cluster-lens	gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters allows study of thepopulation of intrinsically faint infrared galaxies that lie below thesensitivity and confusion limits of current infrared and submillimetertelescopes. we present ultra-deep pacs 100 and 160 microns observations towardthe cluster lens abell 2218, to penetrate the herschel confusion limit. wederive source counts down to a flux density of 1 mjy at 100 microns and 2 mjyat 160 microns, aided by strong gravitational lensing. at these levels, sourcedensities are 20 and 10 beams/source in the two bands, approaching sourcedensity confusion at 160 microns. the slope of the counts below the turnover ofthe euclidean-normalized differential curve is constrained in both bands and isconsistent with most of the recent backwards evolutionary models. byintegrating number counts over the flux range accessed by abell 2218 lensing(0.94-35 mjy at 100 microns and 1.47-35 mjy at 160 microns, we retrieve acosmic infrared background (cib) surface brightness of ~8.0 and ~9.9 nw m^-2sr^-1, in the respective bands. these values correspond to 55% (+/- 24%) and77% (+/- 31%) of dirbe direct measurements. combining abell 2218 results withwider/shallower fields, these figures increase to 62% (+/- 25%) and 88% (+/-32%) cib total fractions, resolved at 100 and 160 microns, disregarding thehigh uncertainties of dirbe absolute values.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.1902	unveiling far-infrared counterparts of bright submillimeter galaxies  using pacs imaging	we present a search for herschel-pacs counterparts of dust-obscured,high-redshift objects previously selected at submillimeter and millimeterwavelengths in the great observatories origins deep survey north field. wedetect 22 of 56 submillimeter galaxies (39%) with a snr of &gt;=3 at 100 microndown to 3.0 mjy, and/or at 160 micron down to 5.7 mjy. the fraction of smgsseen at 160 micron is higher than that at 100 micron. about 50% ofradio-identified smgs are associated with pacs sources. we find a trend betweenthe scuba/pacs flux ratio and redshift, suggesting that these flux ratios couldbe used as a coarse redshift indicator. pacs undetected submm/mm selectedsources tend to lie at higher redshifts than the pacs detected ones. a total of12 sources (21% of our smg sample) remain unidentified and the fact that theyare blank fields at herschel-pacs and vla 20 cm wavelength may imply higherredshifts for them than for the average smg population (e.g., z&gt;3-4). theherschel-pacs imaging of these dust-obscured starbursts at high-redshiftssuggests that their far-infrared spectral energy distributions havesignificantly different shapes than template libraries of local infraredgalaxies.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1010.0768	the m_bh-m_star relation of obscured agns at high redshift	we report the detection of broad halpha emission in three x-ray selectedobscured agns at z=1-2. by exploiting the halpha width and the intrinsic x-rayluminosity, we estimate their black hole masses, which are in the range0.1-3x10^9 msun. by means of multi-band photometric data, we measure thestellar mass of their host galaxy and, therefore, infer their m_bh/m_starratio. these are the first obscured agns at high-z, selected based on theirblack hole accretion (i.e. on the basis of their x-ray luminosity), that can belocated on the m_bh-m_star relation at high-z. all of these obscured high-zagns are fully consistent with the local m_bh-m_star relation. this resultconflicts with those for other samples of agns in the same redshift range,whose m_bh/m_star ratio departs significantly from the value observed in localgalaxies. we suggest that the obscured agns in our sample are in an advancedevolutionary stage, have already settled onto the local m_bh-m_star relation,and whose nuclear activity has been temporarily revived by recent galaxyinteractions.

1102.4329	the redshift and nature of aztec/cosmos 1: a starburst galaxy at z=4.6	based on broad/narrow-band photometry and keck deimos spectroscopy we reporta redshift of z=4.64-0.08+0.06 for aztec/cosmos 1, the brightest sub-mm galaxyin the aztec/cosmos field. in addition to the cosmos-survey x-ray to radiodata, we report observations of the source with herschel/pacs (100, 160micron), cso/sharc ii (350 micron), carma and pdbi (3 mm). we do not detectco(5-4) line emission in the covered redshift ranges, 4.56-4.76 (pdbi/carma)and 4.94-5.02 (carma). if the line is within this bandwidth, this sets 3sigmaupper limits on the gas mass to &lt;~8x10^9 m_sol and &lt;~5x10^10 m_sol,respectively (assuming similar conditions as observed in z~2 smgs). this couldbe explained by a low co-excitation in the source. our analysis of the uv-irspectral energy distribution of aztec 1 shows that it is an extremely young(&lt;~50 myr), massive (m*~10^11 m_sol), but compact (&lt;~2 kpc) galaxy formingstars at a rate of ~1300 m_sol/yr. our results imply that aztec 1 is formingstars in a 'gravitationally bound' regime in which gravity prohibits theformation of a superwind, leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy andfurther generations of star formation.

1105.1955	modelling galaxy and agn evolution in the ir: black hole accretion  versus star-formation activity	we present a new backward evolution model for galaxies and agns in theinfrared (ir). what is new in this model is the separate study of theevolutionary properties of the different ir populations (i.e. spiral galaxies,starburst galaxies, low-luminosity agns, "unobscured" type 1 agns and"obscured" type 2 agns) defined through a detailed analysis of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of large samples of ir selected sources. theevolutionary parameters have been constrained by means of all the availableobservables from surveys in the mid- and far-ir (source counts, redshift andluminosity distributions, luminosity functions). by decomposing the sedsrepresentative of the three agn classes into three distinct components (astellar component emitting most of its power in the optical/near-ir, an agncomponent due to hot dust heated by the central black hole peaking in themid-ir, and a starburst component dominating the far-ir spectrum) we havedisentangled the agn contribution to the monochromatic and total ir luminosityemitted by the different populations considered in our model from that due tostar-formation activity. we have then obtained an estimate of the total irluminosity density (and star-formation density - sfd - produced by ir galaxies)and the first ever estimate of the black hole mass accretion density (bhar)from the ir. the derived evolution of the bhar is in agreement with estimatesfrom x-rays, though the bhar values we derive from ir are slightly higher thanthe x-ray ones. finally, we have simulated source counts, redshiftdistributions and sfd and bhar that we expect to obtain with the futurecosmological surveys in the mid-/far-ir that will be performed with jwst-miriand spica-safari.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.1647	on the nature of the absorber in iras 09104+4109: the x-ray and  mid-infrared view	we present a long (~76 ks) chandra observation of iras 09104+4109, ahyper-luminous galaxy, optically classified as a type 2 agn hosted in a cdgalaxy in a cluster at z=0.442. we also report on the results obtained byfitting its broad-band spectral energy distribution. the compton-thick natureof this source (which has been often referred to as an "archetype" ofcompton-thick type 2 quasars) was formerly claimed on the basis of its marginaldetection in the pds instrument onboard bepposax, being then disputed usingxmm-newton data. both chandra analysis and optical/mid-ir spectral fitting areconsistent with the presence of heavy (~1-5 10^{23} cm^{-2}) but not extreme(compton-thick) obscuration. however, using the mid-ir and the [oiii] emissionas proxies of the nuclear hard x-ray luminosity suggests the presence ofheavier obscuration. the 54-month swift bat map shows excess hard x-rayemission likely related to a nearby (z=0.009) type 2 agn, close enough to iras09104+4109 to significantly enhance and contaminate its emission in the earlybepposax pds data.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

1106.3194	the evolution of quiescent galaxies at high redshift (z &gt; 1.4)	we have studied the evolution of high redshift quiescent galaxies over aneffective area of ~1.7 deg^2 in the cosmos field. galaxies have been dividedaccording to their star-formation activity and the evolution of the differentpopulations has been investigated in detail. we have studied an irac (mag_3.6 &lt;22.0) selected sample of ~18000 galaxies at z &gt; 1.4 with multi-wavelengthcoverage. we have derived accurate photometric redshifts (sigma=0.06) and otherimportant physical parameters through a sed-fitting procedure. we have dividedour sample into actively star-forming, intermediate and quiescent galaxiesdepending on their specific star formation rate. we have computed the galaxystellar mass function of the total sample and the different populations atz=1.4-3.0. we have studied the properties of high redshift quiescent galaxiesfinding that they are old (1-4 gyr), massive (log(m/m_sun)~10.65), weakly starforming stellar populations with low dust extinction (e(b-v) &lt; 0.15) and smalle-folding time scales (tau ~ 0.1-0.3 gyr). we observe a significant evolutionof the quiescent stellar mass function from 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 to 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.6,increasing by ~ 1 dex in this redshift interval. we find that z ~ 1.5 is anepoch of transition of the gsmf. the fraction of star-forming galaxiesdecreases from 60% to 20% from z ~ 2.5-3.0 to z ~ 1.4-1.6 for log(m/m_sun) &gt;11, while the quiescent population increases from 10% to 50% at the sameredshift and mass intervals. we compare the fraction of quiescent galaxiesderived with that predicted by theoretical models and find that the kitzbichler&amp; white (2007) model is the one that better reproduces the data. finally, wecalculate the stellar mass density of the star-forming and quiescentpopulations finding that there is already a significant number of quiescentgalaxies at z &gt; 2.5 (rho~6.0 msunmpc^-3).

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

1206.2319	herschel observations of a z~2 stellar mass selected galaxy sample drawn  from the goods nicmos survey	we present a study of the far-ir properties of a stellar mass selected sampleof 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 galaxies with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 9.5 drawn from the goods nicmossurvey (gns), the deepest h-band hubble space telescope survey of its typeprior to the installation of wfc3. we use far-ir and sub-mm data from the pacsand spire instruments on-board herschel, taken from the pacs evolutionary probe(pep) and herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key projectsrespectively. we find a total of 22 gns galaxies, with median log(m_*/m_sun) =10.8 and z = 2.0, associated with 250 um sources detected with snr &gt; 3. wederive mean total ir luminosity log l_ir (l_sun) = 12.36 +/- 0.05 andcorresponding star formation rate sfr_(ir+uv) = (280 +/- 40) m_sun/yr for theseobjects, and find them to have mean dust temperature t_dust ~ 35 k. we findthat the sfr derived from the far-ir photometry combined with uv-basedestimates of unobscured sfr for these galaxies is on average more than a factorof 2 higher than the sfr derived from extinction corrected uv emission alone,although we note that the ir-based estimate is subject to substantial malmquistbias. to mitigate the effect of this bias and extend our study to fainterfluxes, we perform a stacking analysis to measure the mean sfr in bins ofstellar mass. we obtain detections at the 2-4 sigma level at spire wavelengthsfor samples with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 10. in contrast to the herschel detected gnsgalaxies, we find that estimates of sfr_(ir+uv) for the stacked samples arecomparable to those derived from extinction corrected uv emission, although theuncertainties are large. we find evidence for an increasing fraction of dustobscured star formation with stellar mass, finding sfr_ir/sfr_uv \proptom_*^{0.7 +/- 0.2}, which is likely a consequence of the mass--metallicityrelation.

1206.2642	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei in the xmm-cosmos survey	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of both x-ray selectedbroad-line (type-1) and narrow-line (type-2) agn from the xmm-newton survey inthe cosmos field are presented. the sample is composed by 929 agn (382 type-1agn and 547 type-2 agn) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, x-rayluminosities and absorbing column densities. about 65% of the sources arespectroscopically identified as either type-1 or type-2 agn (83% and 52%respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the restof the sample. the study of such a large sample of x-ray selected agn with ahigh quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with theinclusion of herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron) to the optical-uvallows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections and eddington ratios. the kbol-lbol relations derived in thepresent work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable agn sample,and rely on observed redshifts, x-ray luminosities and column densitydistributions. we find that kbol is significantly lower at high lbol withrespect to previous estimates by marconi et al. (2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1207.2795	deep observations of co line emission from star-forming galaxies in a  cluster candidate at z=1.5	we report results from a deep jansky very large array (jvla) search for co1-0 line emission from galaxies in a candidate galaxy cluster at z~1.55 in thecosmos field. we target 4 galaxies with optical spectroscopic redshifts in therange z=1.47-1.59. two of these 4 galaxies, id51613 and id51813, are nominallydetected in co line emission at the 3-4 sigma level. we find co luminosities of2.4x10^10 k km/s pc^2 and 1.3x10^10 k km/s pc^2, respectively. taking advantagefrom the clustering and 2-ghz bandwidth of the jvla, we perform a search foremission lines in the proximity of optical sources within the field of view ofour observations. we limit our search to galaxies with k&lt;23.5 (ab) andz_phot=1.2-1.8. we find 2 bright optical galaxies to be associated withsignificant emission line peaks (&gt;4 sigma) in the data cube, which we identifywith the co line emission. to test the reliability of the line peaks found, weperformed a parallel search for line peaks using a bayesian inference method.monte carlo simulations show that such associations are statisticallysignificant, with probabilities of chance association of 3.5% and 10.7% for id51207 and id 51380, respectively. modeling of their optical/ir seds indicatesthat the co detected galaxies and candidates have stellar masses and sfrs inthe range (0.3-1.1)x10^11 m_sun and 60-160 m_sun/yr, with sfes comparable tothat found in other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. by comparingthe space density of co emitters derived from our observations with the spacedensity derived from previous co detections at z~1.5, and with semi-analyticpredictions for the co luminosity function, we suggest that the latter tend tounderestimate the number of co galaxies detected at high-redshift. finally, weargue about the benefits of future blind co searches in clustered fields withupcoming submm/radio facilities.

1209.1640	accreting smbhs in the cosmos field and the connection to their host  galaxies	using the wide multi-band photometry available in the cosmos field we explorethe host galaxy properties of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (agn)obtained by combining x-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. based on acareful study of their spectral energy distribution (sed), which has beenparametrized using a 2-component (agn+galaxy) model fit, we deriveddust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formationrates (sfrs). we find that agn hosts span a large range of stellar masses andsfrs. no color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the agn hosts, which arefound to be mainly massive, red galaxies. once accounting for the color-massdegeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginalenhancement of agn incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific starformation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of ourability to properly account for agn light contamination and dust extinction.interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black holegrowing at any given "specific accretion rate" (i.e. the ratio of x-rayluminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxymass, while it decreases as a power-law with lx/m. by analyzing thenormalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence ofagn increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance withthe overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxypopulation. although agn activity and star formation in galaxies do appear tohave a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within thecosmos sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signalingpowerful agn influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1301.4496	panchromatic spectral energy distributions of herschel sources	(abridged) far-infrared herschel photometry from the pep and hermes programsis combined with ancillary datasets in the goods-n, goods-s, and cosmos fields.based on this rich dataset, we reproduce the restframe uv to fir ten-colorsdistribution of galaxies using a superposition of multi-variate gaussian modes.the median sed of each mode is then fitted with a modified version of themagphys code that combines stellar light, emission from dust heated by starsand a possible warm dust contribution heated by an agn. the defined gaussiangrouping is also used to identify rare sources. the zoology of outliersincludes herschel-detected ellipticals, very blue z~1 ly-break galaxies,quiescent spirals, and torus-dominated agn with star formation. out of thesegroups and outliers, a new template library is assembled, consisting of 32 sedsdescribing the intrinsic scatter in the restframe uv-to-submm colors ofinfrared galaxies. this library is tested against l(ir) estimates with andwithout herschel data included, and compared to eight other popular methodsoften adopted in the literature. when implementing herschel photometry, theseapproaches produce l(ir) values consistent with each other within a medianabsolute deviation of 10-20%, the scatter being dominated more by fine tuningof the codes, rather than by the choice of sed templates. finally, the libraryis used to classify 24 micron detected sources in pep goods fields. agn appearto be distributed in the stellar mass (m*) vs. star formation rate (sfr) spacealong with all other galaxies, regardless of the amount of infrared luminositythey are powering, with the tendency to lie on the high sfr side of the "mainsequence". the incidence of warmer star-forming sources grows for objects withhigher specific star formation rates (ssfr), and they tend to populate the"off-sequence" region of the m*-sfr-z space.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.3556	herschel reveals the obscured star formation in hizels h\alpha\ emitters  at z=1.47	we describe the far-infrared (fir; rest-frame 8--1000\mu m) properties of asample of 443 h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the cosmos and udsfields detected by the hizels imaging survey. sources are identified usingnarrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformlyselect h\alpha\ (and [oii] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice atz = 1.47+/-0.02. we use a stacking approach in spitzer, herschel (from pep andhermes surveys) and aztec images to describe their typical fir properties. wefind that hizels galaxies with observed h\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}lo have bolometric fir luminosities of typical lirgs, l_fir ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}lo. combining the h\alpha\ and fir luminosities, we derive median sfr = 32+/-5mo/yr and h\alpha\ extinctions of a(h\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. perhapssurprisingly, little difference is seen in typical hizels extinction levelscompared to local star-forming galaxies. we confirm previous empirical stellarmass (m*) to a(h\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =1.47. for hizels galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the sfras a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. we find that theobserved h\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant sfr tracer when (u-z)_rest ~&lt; 0.9mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry &gt; 22 mag (vega) or when m* &lt; 10^9.7 mo. we donot find any correlation between the [oii]/h\alpha\ and fir luminosity,suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of themost obscured star-forming regions. the luminosity-limited hizels sample tendsto lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,especially at low m*. this work suggests that obscured star formation is linkedto the assembly of m*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxiesproviding dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

1308.2199	cosmological model dependence of the galaxy luminosity function:  far-infrared results in the lemaitre-tolman-bondi model	this is the first paper of a series aiming at investigating galaxy formationand evolution in the giant-void class of the lemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) modelsthat best fits current cosmological observations. here we investigate theluminosity function (lf) methodology, and how its estimates would be affectedby a change on the cosmological model assumed in its computation. are thecurrent observational constraints on the allowed cosmology enough to yieldrobust lf results? we use the far-infrared source catalogues built on theobservations performed with the herschel/pacs instrument, and selected as partof the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey. schechter profiles are obtained inredshift bins up to z approximately 4, assuming comoving volumes in both thestandard model, that is, friedmann-lemaitre-robertson-walker metric with aperfect fluid energy-momentum tensor, and non-homogeneous ltb dust models,parametrized to fit the current combination of results stemming from theobservations of supernovae ia, the cosmic microwave background, and baryonicacoustic oscillations. we find that the luminosity functions computed assumingboth the standard model and ltb void models show in general good agreement.however, the faint-end slope in the void models shows a significant departurefrom the standard model up to redshift 0.4. we demonstrate that this result isnot artificially caused by the used lf estimator which turns out to be robustunder the differences in matter-energy density profiles of the models. thedifferences found in the lf slopes at the faint end are due to variation in theluminosities of the sources, which depend on the geometrical part of the model.it follows that either the standard model is over-estimating the number densityof faint sources or the void models are under-estimating it.

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1311.1305	the incidence of obscuration in active galactic nuclei	we study the incidence of nuclear obscuration on a complete sample of 1310agn selected on the basis of their rest-frame 2-10 kev x-ray flux from thexmm-cosmos survey, in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5. we classify the agn asobscured or un-obscured on the basis of either the optical spectral propertiesand the overall sed or the shape of the x-ray spectrum. the two classificationsagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be furthersubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities x-ray un-obscured agndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/uv continuum emission in theiroptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at highluminosities broad line agn may have absorbed x-ray spectra, which hints at anincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. weconfirm that the fraction of obscured agn is a decreasing function of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significantevolution only for the most luminous agn, which appear to be more commonlyobscured at higher redshift. we find no significant difference between the meanstellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured agn hosts.we conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscurationin agn is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclearluminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere ofinfluence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the widerscale galactic conditions.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1312.1087	the dust content of qso hosts at high redshift	infrared observations of high-z quasar (qso) hosts indicate the presence oflarge masses of dust in the early universe. when combined with otherobservables, such as neutral gas masses and star formation rates, the dustcontent of z~6 qso hosts may help constraining their star formation history. wehave collected a database of 58 sources from the literature discovered byvarious surveys and observed in the fir. we have interpreted the available databy means of chemical evolution models for forming proto-spheroids,investigating the role of the major parameters regulating star formation anddust production. for a few systems, given the derived small dynamical masses,the observed dust content can be explained only assuming a top-heavy initialmass function, an enhanced star formation efficiency and an increased rate ofdust accretion. however, the possibility that, for some systems, the dynamicalmass has been underestimated cannot be excluded. if this were the case, thedust mass can be accounted for by standard model assumptions. we providepredictions regarding the abundance of the descendants of qso hosts; albeitrare, such systems should be present and detectable by future deep surveys suchas euclid already at z&gt;4.

1312.1248	alma reveals a warm and compact starburst around a heavily obscured  supermassive black hole at z=4.75	we report alma cycle 0 observations at 1.3mm of less j033229.4-275619(xid403), an ultraluminous infrared galaxy at $z=4.75$ in the chandra deepfield south hosting a compton-thick qso. the source is not resolved in our dataat a resolution of $\sim$0.75 arcsec, placing an upper-limit of 2.5 kpc to thehalf-light radius of the continuum emission from heated-dust. afterdeconvolving for the beam size, however, we found a $\sim3\sigma$ indication ofan intrinsic source size of $0.27\pm0.08$ arcsec (gaussian fwhm), which wouldcorrespond to $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc. we build the far-ir sed of xid403 bycombining datapoints from both alma and herschel and fit it with a modifiedblackbody spectrum. for the first time, we measure the dust temperature$t_d=58.5\pm5.3$ k in this system, which is comparable to what has beenobserved in other high-z submillimeter galaxies. the measured star formationrate is sfr=$1020\pm150$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, in agreement with previousestimates at lower s/n. based on the measured sfr and source size, we constrainthe sfr surface density to be $\sigma_{sfr}&gt;26\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$($\sim200\;m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for $r_{half}\sim0.9$ kpc). thecompactness of this starburst is comparable to what has been observed in otherlocal and high-z starburst galaxies. if the gas mass measured from previous[cii] and co(2-1) observations at low resolution is confined within the samedust region, assuming $r_{half}\sim0.9\pm0.3$ kpc, this would produce a columndensity of $n_h\sim0.3-1.1\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ towards the central smbh,similar to the column density of $\approx1.4\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ measuredfrom the x-rays. then, in principle, if both gas and dust were confined onsub-kpc scales, this would be sufficient to produce the observed x-ray columndensity without any need of a pc-scale absorber [abridged].

1401.4503	tracing the cosmic growth of super massive black holes to z ~ 3 with  herschel	we study a sample of herschel-pacs selected galaxies within the goods-southand the cosmos fields in the framework of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)project. starting from the rich multi-wavelength photometric data-setsavailable in both fields, we perform a broad-band spectral energy distribution(sed) decomposition to disentangle the possible active galactic nucleus (agn)contribution from that related to the host galaxy. we find that 37 per cent ofthe herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 percent confidence level. the probability to reveal agn activity increases forbright ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt; 10^{11} \rm l_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at$z&gt;0.3$, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt;10^{12} \rm l_{\odot}$) infrared (ir) galaxies at $z \geq 1$. finally, wereconstruct the agn bolometric luminosity function and the super-massive blackhole growth rate across cosmic time up to $z \sim 3$ from a far-infrared (fir)perspective. this work shows general agreement with most of the panchromaticestimates from the literature, with the global black hole growth peaking at $z\sim 2$ and reproducing the observed local black hole mass density withconsistent values of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm rad}$($\sim$0.07).

1404.7014	the pep survey: infrared properties of radio-selected agn	by exploiting the vla-cosmos and the herschel-pep surveys, we investigate thefar infrared (fir) properties of radio-selected agn. to this purpose, fromvla-cosmos we considered the 1537, f[1.4 ghz]&gt;0.06 mjy sources with a reliableredshift estimate, and sub-divided them into star-forming galaxies and agnsolely on the basis of their radio luminosity. the agn sample is complete withrespect to radio selection at all z&lt;~3.5. 832 radio sources have a counterpartin the pep catalogue. 175 are agn. their redshift distribution closelyresembles that of the total radio-selected agn population, and exhibits twomarked peaks at z~0.9 and z~2.5. we find that the probability for aradio-selected agn to be detected at fir wavelengths is both a function ofradio power and redshift, whereby powerful sources are more likely to be firemitters at earlier epochs. this is due to two distinct effects: 1) at allradio luminosities, fir activity monotonically increases with look-back timeand 2) radio activity of agn origin is increasingly less effective atinhibiting fir emission. radio-selected agn with fir emission arepreferentially located in galaxies which are smaller than those hostingfir-inactive sources. furthermore, at all z&lt;~2, there seems to be apreferential (stellar) mass scale m ~[10^{10}-10^{11}] msun which maximizes thechances for fir emission. we find such fir (and mir) emission to be due toprocesses indistinguishable from those which power star-forming galaxies. itfollows that radio emission in at least 35% of the entire agn population is thesum of two contributions: agn accretion and star-forming processes within thehost galaxy.

1406.1189	a multiwavelength consensus on the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies at z~2	we compare various star formation rate (sfr) indicators for star-forminggalaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5$ in the cosmos field. the main focus is on the sfrs fromthe far-ir (pacs-herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxiesselected according to the bzk criterion. fir-selected samples lead to a vastlydifferent slope of the sfr-stellar mass ($m_*$) relation, compared to that ofthe dominant main sequence population as measured from the uv, since the firselection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. however, there isoverall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two sfrindicators, when stacking on the pacs maps the bzk-selected galaxies. theresulting logarithmic slope of the sfr-{$m_*$} relation is $\sim0.8-0.9$, inagreement with that derived from the dust-corrected uv-luminosity. exploitingdeeper 24$\mu$m-spitzer data we have characterized a sub-sample of galaxieswith reddening and sfrs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the $b$band. the combination of herschel with spitzer data have allowed us to largelybreak the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, bydistinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in b-z because of being heavilydust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being)quenched. finally, we have compared our sfr(uv) to the sfrs derived by stackingthe radio data and to those derived from the h$\alpha$ luminosity of a sampleof star-forming galaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the two sets of sfrs are broadlyconsistent as they are with the sfrs derived from the uv and by stacking thecorresponding pacs data in various mass bins.

1407.1863	large scale clustering measurements with photometric redshifts:  comparing the dark matter halos of x-ray agn, star-forming and passive  galaxies at z~1	we combine multiwavelength data in the aegis-xd and c-cosmos surveys tomeasure the typical dark matter halo mass of x-ray selected agn[lx(2-10kev)&gt;1e42 erg/s] in comparison with far-infrared selected star-forminggalaxies detected in the herschel/pep survey (pacs evolutionary probe; lir&gt;1e11solar) and quiescent systems at z~1. we develop a novel method to measure theclustering of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions in addition to any spectroscopy. this isadvantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clusteringanalysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. the method works bestfor large samples. the loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy isbalanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering. wefind that x-ray agn, far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies and passivesystems in the redshift interval 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 are found in halos of similar mass,$\log m_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. we argue that this is becausethe galaxies in all three samples (agn, star-forming, passive) have similarstellar mass distributions, approximated by the j-band luminosity. thereforeall galaxies that can potentially host x-ray agn, because they have stellarmasses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes of $\logm_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formationrates. this suggests that the stellar mass of x-ray agn hosts is driving theobserved clustering properties of this population. we also speculate thattrends between agn properties (e.g. luminosity, level of obscuration) and largescale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of the hostgalaxies.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1408.3234	exploring the relationship between black hole accretion and star  formation with blind mid-/far-infrared spectroscopic surveys	we present new estimates of redshift-dependent luminosity functions of irlines detectable by spica/safari and excited both by star formation and by agnactivity. the new estimates improve over previous work by using updatedevolutionary models and dealing in a self consistent way with emission ofgalaxies as a whole, including both the starburst and the agn component. newrelationships between line and agn bolometric luminosity have been derived andthose between line and ir luminosities of the starburst component have beenupdated. these ingredients were used to work out predictions for the sourcecounts in 11 mid/far-ir emission lines partially or entirely excited by agnactivity. we find that the statistics of the emission line detection ofgalaxies as a whole is mainly determined by the star formation rate, because ofthe rarity of bright agns. we also find that the slope of the line integralnumber counts is flatter than 2 implying that the number of detections at fixedobserving time increases more by extending the survey area than by goingdeeper. we thus propose a wide spectroscopic survey of 1 hour integration perfield-of-view over an area of 5 deg$^{2}$ to detect (at 5$\sigma$) $\sim$760agns in [oiv]25.89$\mu$m $-$ the brightest agn mid-infrared line $-$ out to$z\sim2$. pointed observations of strongly lensed or hyper-luminous galaxiespreviously detected by large area surveys such as those by herschel and by thespt can provide key information on the galaxy-agn co-evolution out to higherredshifts.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

1501.04634	relationship between star formation rate and black hole accretion at  z=2: the different contributions in quiescent, normal and starburst galaxies	we investigate the co-evolution of black-hole-accretion-rate (bhar) andstar-formation-rate (sfr) in $1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5$ galaxies displaying a greaterdiversity of star-forming properties compared to previous studies. we combinex-ray stacking and far-ir photometry of stellar mass-limited samples of normalstar-forming, starburst and quiescent/quenched galaxies in the cosmos field. wecorroborate the existence of a strong correlation between bhar (i.e. the x-rayluminosity, l_x), and stellar mass (m*) for normal star-forming galaxies,although find a steeper relation than previously reported. we find thatstarbursts show a factor of 3 enhancement in bhar compared to normal sfgalaxies (against a factor of 6 excess in sfr), while quiescents show a deficitof a factor 5.5 at a given mass. one possible interpretation of this is thatthe starburst phase does not coincide with cosmologically relevant bh growth,or that starburst-inducing mergers are more efficient at boosting sfr thanbhar. contrary to studies based on smaller samples, we find the bhar/sfr ratioof main sequence (ms) galaxies is not mass invariant, but scales weakly asm*^(0.43\pm0.09}, implying faster bh growth in more massive galaxies at$z\sim2$. furthermore, bhar/sfr during the starburst is a factor of 2 lowerthan in ms galaxies, at odds with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulationsof merger galaxies that foresee a sudden enhancement of l_x/sfr during themerger. finally, we estimate that the bulk of the accretion density of theuniverse at $z\sim2$ is associated with normal star-forming systems, with only6(+/-1)% and 11(+/-1)% associated with starburst and quiescent galaxies,respectively.

1501.07602	mapping the average agn accretion rate in the sfr-m* plane for herschel  selected galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation of agn accretion, star formation rate (sfr), andstellar mass (m$_*$) using a sample of $\approx$ 8600 star-forming galaxies upto z=2.5 selected with \textit{herschel} imaging in the goods and cosmosfields. for each of them we derive sfr and m$_*$, both corrected, whennecessary, for emission from an active galactic nucleus (agn), through thedecomposition of their spectral energy distributions (seds). about 10 per centof the sample are detected individually in \textit{chandra} observations of thefields. for the rest of the sample we stack the x-ray maps to get average x-rayproperties. after subtracting the x-ray luminosity expected from star formationand correcting for nuclear obscuration, we derive the average agn accretionrate for both detected sources and stacks, as a function of m$_{*}$, sfr andredshift. the average accretion rate correlates with sfr and with m$_*$. thedependence on sfr becomes progressively more significant at z$&gt;$0.8. this maysuggest that sfr is the original driver of these correlations. we find thataverage agn accretion and star formation increase in a similar fashion withoffset from the star-forming "main-sequence". our interpretation is thataccretion onto the central black hole and star formation broadly trace eachother, irrespective of whether the galaxy is evolving steadily on themain-sequence or bursting.

1502.03686	are z&gt;2 herschel galaxies proto-spheroids?	we present a backward approach for the interpretation of the evolution of thenear-infrared and the far-infrared luminosity functions across the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;3. in our method, late-type galaxies are treated by means of aparametric phenomenological method based on pep/hermes data up to z~4, whereasspheroids are described by means of a physically motivated backward model. thespectral evolution of spheroids is modelled by means of a single-mass model,associated to a present-day elliptical with k-band luminosity comparable to thebreak of the local early-type luminosity function. the formation ofproto-spheroids is assumed to occurr across the redshift range 1&lt; z &lt; 5. thekey parameter is represented by the redshift z_0.5 at which halfproto-spheroids are already formed. a statistical study indicates for thisparameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3. we assume as fiducial valuez_0.5~2, and show that this assumption allows us to describe accourately theredshift distributions and the source counts. by assuming z_0.5 ~ 2 at thefar-ir flux limit of the pep-cosmos survey, the pep-selected sources observedat z&gt;2 can be explained as progenitors of local spheroids caught during theirformation. we also test the effects of mass downsizing by dividing thespheroids into three populations of different present-day stellar masses. theresults obtained in this case confirm the validity of our approach, i.e. thatthe bulk of proto-spheroids can be modelled by means of a single model whichdescribes the evolution of galaxies at the break of the present-day early typek-band lf.

0805.0705	the contribution of agn and star-forming galaxies to the mid-infrared as  revealed by their spectral energy distributions	we present the broad-band spectral energy distributions (seds) of the largestavailable highly (72%) complete spectroscopic sample of mid-infrared (mir)selected galaxies and agn at intermediate redshift. the sample contains 203extragalactic sources from the 15-micron survey in the elais-swire field s1,all with measured spectroscopic redshift. most of these sources have fullmulti-wavelength coverage from the far-uv to the far-infrared and lie in theredshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3. due to its size, this sample allows us for the firsttime to characterise the spectral properties of the sources responsible for thestrong evolution observed in the mir. based on sed-fitting technique we haveclassified the mir sources, identifying agn signatures in about 50% of them.this fraction is significantly higher than that derived from opticalspectroscopy (~29%) and is due in particular to the identification of agnactivity in objects spectroscopically classified as galaxies. it is likely thatin most of our objects, the agn is either obscured or of low-luminosity, andthus it does not dominate the energetic output at any wavelength, except in themir, showing up just in the range where the host galaxy sed has a minimum. thefraction of agn strongly depends on the flux density, with that derived throughthe sed-fitting being about 20% at s(15)~0.5-1 mjy and gradually increasing upto 100% at s(15)&gt;10 mjy, while that obtained from optical spectroscopy neverbeing &gt;30%, even at the higher flux densities. the results of this work will bevery useful for updating all the models aimed at interpreting the deep infraredsurvey data and, in particular, for constraining the nature and the role ofdust-obscured systems in the intermediate/high-redshift universe.

1505.01153	the most obscured agn in the cosmos field	highly obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) are common in nearby galaxies,but are difficult to observe beyond the local universe, where they are expectedto significantly contribute to the black hole accretion rate density.furthermore, compton-thick (ct) absorbers (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) suppress even thehard x-ray (2-10 kev) agn nuclear emission, and therefore the column densitydistribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. we present theidentification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (nh&gt;~10^25cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (l(2-10kev)&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn at z=0.353 inthe cosmos field. several independent indicators, such as the shape of thex-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution andx-ray/[nev] and x-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that thenuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. the hostgalaxy properties show that this highly obscured agn is hosted in a massivestar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlatewith the presence of ct absorbers. finally, asymmetric and blueshiftedcomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate thepresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense agn activity(l(bol)/l(edd) = 0.3-0.5). such highly obscured, highly accreting agn areintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be muchmore common at the peak of the star formation and bh accretion history, atz~2-3. we demonstrate that a fully multi-wavelength approach can recover asizable sample of such peculiar sources in large and deep surveys such ascosmos.

1506.02135	predictions for surveys with the spica mid-infrared instrument	we present predictions for number counts and redshift distributions ofgalaxies detectable in continuum and in emission lines with the mid-infrared(mir) instrument (smi) proposed for the space infrared telescope for cosmologyand astrophysics (spica). we have considered 24 mir fine-structure lines, fourpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands (at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3$\mu$m)and two silicate bands (in emission and in absorption) at 9.7$\mu$m and18.0$\mu$m. six of these lines are primarily associated with active galacticnuclei (agns), the others with star formation. a survey with the smispectrometers of 1 hour integration per field-of-view (fov) over an area of$1\,\hbox{deg}^2$ will yield $5\,\sigma$ detections of $\simeq 140$ agn linesand of $\simeq 5.2\times10^{4}$ star-forming galaxies, $\simeq 1.6\times10^{4}$of which will be detected in at least two lines. the combination of a shallow($20.0\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$, $1.4\times10^{-1}$ h integration per fov) and a deepsurvey ($6.9\times10^{-3}\,\hbox{deg}^{2}$, $635$ h integration time), with thesmi camera, for a total of $\sim$1000 h, will accurately determine the mirnumber counts of galaxies and of agns over five orders of magnitude in fluxdensity, reaching values more than one order of magnitude fainter than thedeepest spitzer $24\,\mu$m surveys. this will allow us to determine the cosmicstar formation rate (sfr) function down to sfrs more than 100 times fainterthan reached by the herschel observatory.

1508.01679	the star formation rate cookbook at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3: extinction-corrected  relations for uv &amp; [oii]{\lambda}3727 luminosities	we use a spectroscopic sample of 286 star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 1&lt;z&lt;3from the gmass survey to study different star formation rate (sfr) estimators.infrared (ir) data are used to derive empirical calibrations to correctultraviolet (uv) and [oii]{\lambda}3727 luminosities for dust extinction anddust-corrected estimates of sfr. in the selection procedure we fully exploitthe available spectroscopic information. on the basis of three continuumindices, we are able to identify and exclude from the sample galaxies in whichold stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to irluminosity (lir) and continuum reddening. using spitzer-mips and herschel-pacsdata we derive lir for two-thirds of our sample. the lir/luv ratio is used as aprobe of effective attenuation (airx) to search for correlations with continuumand spectroscopic features. the relation between airx and uv continuum slope({\beta}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with theliterature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion withrespect to uv-selected samples. we find a correlation between the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) of the [oii]{\lambda}3727 line and {\beta}, which is themain result of this work. we therefore propose the [oii]{\lambda}3727 line ewas a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through airx, though theassumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actualattenuation towards the [oii]{\lambda}3727 line. we tested the issue ofdifferential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: ourresults are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuationtowards nebular lines. a set of relations is provided that allows the recoveryof the total unattenuated sfr from uv and [oii]{\lambda}3727 luminosities.(abridged)

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

0705.2864	unveiling obscured accretion in the chandra deep field south	a large population of heavily obscured, compton thick agns is predicted bymodels of galaxy formation, models of cosmic x-ray background and by the``relic'' super-massive black-hole mass function measured from local bulges.however, so far only a handful of compton thick agns have been possiblydetected using even the deepest chandra and xmm surveys. compton-thick agns canbe recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the agn uv emission in the infraredby selecting sources with agn luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faintnear-infrared and optical emission. to this purpose, we make use of deep hst,vlt, spitzer and chandra data on the chandra deep field south to constrain thenumber of compton thick agn in this field. we show that sources with high24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct sourcepopulation, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by agn emission.analysis of the x-ray properties of these extreme sources shows that most ofthem (80$\pm15%$) are indeed likely to be highly obscured, compton thick agns.the number of infrared selected, compton thick agns with 5.8$\mu$m luminosityhigher than $10^{44.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ turns out to be similar to that of x-rayselected, unobscured and moderately obscured agns with 2-10 kev luminosityhigher than $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the redshift bin 1.2-2.6. this ``factorof 2'' source population is exactly what it is needed to solve thediscrepancies between model predictions and x-ray agn selection.

astro-ph;0308283	the european large area iso survey (elais): the final band-merged  catalogue	we present the final band-merged elais catalogue at 6.7, 15, 90, and 175$\mu$m, and the associated data at u,g,r,i,z,j,h,k, and 20cm. the origin of thesurvey, infrared and radio observations, data-reduction and opticalidentifications are briefly reviewed, and a summary of the area covered, andcompleteness limit for each infrared band is given. a detailed discussion ofthe band-merging and optical association strategy is given. the totalcatalogues consists of 2860 sources. for extragalactic sources observed in 3 ormore infrared bands, colour-colour diagrams are presented and discussed interms of the contributing infrared populations. spectral energy distributionsare shown for selected sources and compared with cirrus, m82 and arp220starburst, and agn dust torus models.  spectroscopic redshifts are tabulated, where available. for the n1 and n2areas, the int ugriz wide field survey, permits photometric redshifts to beestimated for galaxies and quasars. these agree well with the spectroscopicredshifts, within the uncertainty of the photometric method. the redshiftdistribution is given for selected elais bands and colour-redshift diagrams arediscussed.  there is a high proportion of ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the elaiscatalogue ($&gt; 10 %$ of 15 $\mu$m sources), many with arp220-like colours. 10hyperluminous infrared galaxies and 10 eros are found in the survey. the largenumbers of ultraluminous galaxies imply very strong evolution in thestar-formation rate between z = 0 and 1.

astro-ph;0401289	the european large area iso survey ix: the 90 micron luminosity function  from the final analysis sample	we present the 90 micron luminosity function of the final analysis of theeuropean large area iso survey (elais), extending the sample size of ourprevious analysis (paper iv) by about a factor of 4. our sample extends toz=1.1, around 50 times the comoving volume of paper iv, and 10^{7.7} &lt;h^{-2}l/lsun &lt; 10^{12.5}. from our optical spectroscopy campaigns of thenorthern elais 90 mircon survey (7.4 deg^2 in total, to s(90um)&gt;70mjy), weobtained redshifts for 61% of the sample (151 redshifts) to b&lt;21 identified at7 microns, 15 microns, 20cm or with bright (b&lt;18.5) optical identifications.the selection function is well-defined, permitting the construction of the 90micron luminosity function of the final analysis catalogue in the elaisnorthern fields, which is in excellent agreement with our preliminary analysisluminosity function in the elais s1 field from paper iv. the luminosityfunction is also in good agreement with the iras-based prediction of serjeant &amp;harrison (2004), which if correct requires luminosity evolution of (1+z)^{3.4+/- 1.0} for consistency with the source counts. this implies an evolution incomoving volume averaged star formation rate at z&lt;~1 consistent with thatderived from rest-frame optical and ultraviolet surveys.

astro-ph;0403211	the nature of the mid-infrared population from optical identifications  of the elais-s1 sample	we present a multi-wavelength catalog (15 um, r, k-band, 1.4 ghz flux) plusspectroscopic identifications for 406 15 um sources detected in the elaisregion s1, over the flux density range 0.5&lt;s&lt;150 mjy. 332 (~82%) sources areoptically identified down to r~23.0. spectra or bona fide stellaridentifications are obtained for 290 objects. the areal coverage, mir andoptical completeness of the sample are discussed in order to allow statisticaland evolutionary analyses. two main spectroscopic classes have been found todominate the mir extragalactic population: z&lt;0.5 star-forming galaxies (fromabsorbed to extreme starbursts: nul_nu~10^8-10^11 l_odot), which account for\~75% of the sources, and agn (both type 1 and 2), which account for ~25% ofthe sources. about 20% of the extragalactic sources are dust-enshroudedstarburst galaxies [e(a) spectra], and all the starburst galaxies appear moredust extincted in the optical than nearby normal galaxies. we also identified91 stellar objects (~22% of the mir sources). the counts for starburst galaxiesand agn down to 0.6 mjy have been derived. a general trend is found in theoptical-mir sed of the galaxies, where the mir-luminous objects have larger mirto optical luminosity ratios.

astro-ph;0403242	the mid-ir luminosity function of galaxies in the elais southern fields	we present the first determination of the 15micron luminosity functiogalaxies from the european large area iso survey (elais) southern fields. wehave adopted a new criterion to separate the quiescent, non-evolving and thestarburst, evolving populations based on the ratio of mid-infrared to opticalluminosities. strong evolution is suggested by our data for the starburstgalaxy population, while normal spiral galaxies are consistent with noevolution. the starburst population must evolve both in luminosity and indensity with rates of the order l(z) (1+z)^(3.5) and rho(z) (1+z)^3.8 up toz~1. the evolutionary parameters of our model have been tested by comparing themodel predictions with other observables, like source counts at all fluxdensity levels (from 0.1 to 300 mjy) and redshift distributions and luminosityfunctions at high-z (0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 from hdf-n data). the agreement between ourmodel predictions and the observed data is remarkably good. we use our data toestimate the star-formation density of the universe up to z=0.4 and we use theluminosity function model to predict the trend of the star-formation history upto z=1.

astro-ph;0404315	final analysis of elais 15 $\mu$m observations : method, reduction and  catalogue	we present the final analysis of the european large area iso survey (elais)15 $\mu$m observations, carried out with the isocam instrument on board theinfrared space observatory (iso).  the data reduction method, known as lari method, is based on a mathematicalmodel of the detector's behaviour and was specifically designed for thedetection of faint sources in iso-cam/phot data. the method is fullyinteractive and leads to very reliable and complete source lists.  the resulting catalogue includes 1923 sources detected with $s/n &gt; 5$ in the{0.5 -- 100 mjy} flux range and over an area of 10.85 {deg$^2$} split into fourfields, making it the largest non-serendipitous extragalactic source catalogueobtained to date from iso data.  this paper presents the concepts underlying the data reduction methodtogether with its latest enhancements. the data reduction process, theproduction and basic properties of the resulting catalogue are discussed. thecatalogue quality is assessed by means of detailed simulations, opticalidentifications and comparison with previous analyses.

astro-ph;0503258	the redshift-space two point correlation function of elais-s1 galaxies	we investigate the clustering properties of galaxies in the recentlycompleted elais-s1 redshift survey through their spatial two pointautocorrelation function. we used a sub-sample of the elais-s1 catalog coveringapproximately 4 deg^2 and consisting of 148 objects selected at 15 micron witha flux &gt;0.5 mjy and redshift z&lt;0.5. we detected a positive signal in thecorrelation function that, in the range of separations 1-10 h mpc is wellapproximated by a power law with a slope gamma = 1.4 and a correlation length s=5.4 h mpc. this result is in good agreement with the redshift-spacecorrelation function measured in more local samples of mid infrared selectedgalaxies like the iras psc$z$ redshift survey. this suggests a lack ofsignificant clustering evolution of infrared selected objects out to $z=0.5$that is further confirmed by the consistency found between the correlationfunctions measured in a local (z&lt;0.2) and a distant (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5) subsample ofelais-s1 galaxies. we also confirm that optically selected galaxies in thelocal redshift surveys, especially those of the sdss sample, are significantlymore clustered than infrared objects.

astro-ph;0511563	counting individual galaxies from deep 24 micron spitzer surveys: beyond  the confusion limit	we address the question of how to deal with confusion limited surveys in themid-infrared domain by using informations from higher frequency observationsover the same sky regions. such informations, once applied to apparentlyextended mid-infrared sources, which are indeed ``blends'' of two or moredifferent sources, allow us to disentangle the single counterparts and to splitthe measured flux density into different components. we present the applicationof this method to the 24 micron spitzer archival data in the goods-en1 testfield, where apparently extended, ``blended'' sources constitute about 20% of areliable sample of 983 sources detected above the 5-sigma threshold down to 23microjy. as higher frequency data-set we have considered the public irac imagesand catalogues on the same field. we show that the 24 micron sample is almostunbiased down to ~40 microjy and the careful application of the deblendingprocedure does not require any statistical completeness correction (at least atthe flux level considered). this is probed by direct comparison of our resultswith those of chary et al. (2004), who analysed the same data-set throughextensive monte carlo simulations. the deblending procedure reduces of about30% the confusion limit of the mips 24 micron survey, allowing one to obtainreliable source counts down to ~40 microjy. the extrapolation of the sourcecounts down to fainter fluxes suggests that our 24 micron sample is able toresolve ~62% of the cosmic background down to a flux level of 38 microjy.

astro-ph;0601355	active galactic nuclei in the mid-ir. evolution and contribution to the  cosmic infrared background	we study the evolution of the luminosity function (lf) of type-1 and type-2agn in the mid-infrared, and derive their contribution to the cosmic infraredbackground (cirb) and the expected deep source counts to be observed by spitzerat 24 micron. the sample of type-1 and type-2 agn was selected at 15 micron(iso) and 12 micron (iras), and classified on the basis of their opticalspectra. local templates of type-1 and type-2 agn have been used to derive theintrinsic 15 micron luminosities. we adopted an evolving smooth two-power lawshape of the lf, whose parameters have been derived using an un-binned maximumlikelihood method. we find that the lf of type-1 agn is compatible with a pureluminosity evolution (l(z)=l(0)(1+z)^k_l) model where k_l~2.9. a smallflattening of the faint slope of the lf with increasing redshift is favoured bythe data. a similar evolutionary scenario is found for the type-2 populationwith a rate k_l ranging from ~1.8 to 2.6, depending significantly on theadopted mid-infrared spectral energy distribution. also for type-2 agn aflattening of the lf with increasing redshift is suggested by the data,possibly caused by the loss of a fraction of type-2 agn hidden within theoptically classified starburst and normal galaxies. the type-1 agn contributionto the cirb at 15 micron is (4.2-12.1) x 10e-11 w m^-2 sr^-1, while the type-2agn contribution is (5.5-11.0) x 10e-11 w m^-2 sr^-1. we expect that spitzerwill observe, down to a flux limit of s_24 = 0.01 mjy, a density of ~1200deg^-2 type-1 and ~1000 deg^-2 type-2 optically classified agn. the derivedtotal contribution of the agn galaxies to the cirb (4-10%) and spitzer countsshould be considered as lower limits, because of a possible loss of type-2sources caused by the optical classification.

astro-ph;0605305	luminosity functions for galaxies and quasars in the spitzer wide-area  infrared extra-galactic (swire) legacy survey	we construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24microns over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2 for galaxies and 0&lt;z&lt;4 for optical qsos,using optical and infrared data from the spitzer wide-area infraredextragalactic survey. the 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxy lfs show evidence formoderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passiveageing of evolved stellar populations. their comoving luminosity density wasfound to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,or even declining, at higher redshift. conversely, the 24 micron galaxy lf,which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or agn activity,undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived ir energy density and sfrdensity proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and themajority of this evolution occurring since z~1. optical qsos, however, showpositive luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts(3&lt;z&lt;4). modelling as l* proportional to (1+z)^gamma gavegamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 4.5 micronand stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths (5.8, 8 and 24 micron), ofgamma~3. comparison of the galaxy lfs to predictions from a semi-analytic modelbased on cdm indicate that an imf skewed towards higher mass star formation inbursts compared to locally is preferred. as a result the currently inferredmassive star formation rates in distant sub-mm sources may require substantialdownwards revision.
