0901.3258	measuring the neutron star equation of state with gravitational wave  observations	we report the results of a first study that uses numerical simulations toestimate the accuracy with which one can use gravitational wave observations ofdouble neutron star inspiral to measure parameters of the neutron-star equationof state. the simulations use the evolution and initial-data codes of shibataand uryu to compute the last several orbits and the merger of neutron stars,with matter described by a parametrized equation of state. previous worksuggested the use of an effective cutoff frequency to place constraints on theequation of state. we find, however, that greater accuracy is obtained bymeasuring departures from the point-particle limit of the gravitationalwaveform produced during the late inspiral.  as the stars approach their final plunge and merger, the gravitational wavephase accumulates more rapidly for smaller values of the neutron starcompactness (the ratio of the mass of the neutron star to its radius). weestimate that realistic equations of state will lead to gravitational waveformsthat are distinguishable from point particle inspirals at an effective distance(the distance to an optimally oriented and located system that would produce anequivalent waveform amplitude) of 100 mpc or less. as lattimer and prakashobserved, neutron-star radius is closely tied to the pressure at density notfar above nuclear. our results suggest that broadband gravitational waveobservations at frequencies between 500 and 1000 hz will constrain thispressure, and we estimate the accuracy with which it can be measured. relatedfirst estimates of radius measurability show that the radius can be determinedto an accuracy of ~1 km at 100 mpc.

0902.0416	gravitational waves from black hole-neutron star binaries i:  classification of waveforms	using our new numerical-relativity code sacra, long-term simulations forinspiral and merger of black hole (bh)-neutron star (ns) binaries areperformed, focusing particularly on gravitational waveforms. as the initialconditions, bh-ns binaries in a quasiequilibrium state are prepared in amodified version of the moving-puncture approach. the bh is modeled by anonspinning moving puncture and for the ns, a polytropic equation of state with$\gamma=2$ and the irrotational velocity field are employed. the mass ratio ofthe bh to the ns, $q=m_{\rm bh}/m_{\rm ns}$, is chosen in the range between 1.5and 5. the compactness of the ns, defined by ${\cal c}=gm_{\rm ns}/c^2r_{\rmns}$, is chosen to be between 0.145 and 0.178. for a large value of $q$ forwhich the ns is not tidally disrupted and is simply swallowed by the bh,gravitational waves are characterized by inspiral, merger, and ringdownwaveforms. in this case, the waveforms are qualitatively the same as that frombh-bh binaries. for a sufficiently small value of $q \alt 2$, the ns may betidally disrupted before it is swallowed by the bh. in this case, the amplitudeof the merger and ringdown waveforms is very low, and thus, gravitational wavesare characterized by the inspiral waveform and subsequent quick damping. thedifference in the merger and ringdown waveforms is clearly reflected in thespectrum shape and in the "cut-off" frequency above which the spectrumamplitude steeply decreases. when an ns is not tidally disrupted (e.g., forq=5), kick velocity, induced by asymmetric gravitational wave emission, agreesapproximately with that derived for the merger of bh-bh binaries, whereas forthe case that the tidal disruption occurs, the kick velocity is significantlysuppressed.

0904.4551	longterm general relativistic simulation of binary neutron stars  collapsing to a black hole	general relativistic simulations for the merger of binary neutron stars areperformed as an extension of a previous work\cite{shibata:2006nm}. we preparebinary neutron stars with a large initial orbital separation and employ themoving-puncture formulation, which enables to follow merger and ringdown phasesfor a long time, even after black hole formation. for modeling inspiralingneutron stars, which should be composed of cold neutron stars, theakmal-pandhalipande-ravenhall (apr) equation of state (eos) is adopted. afterthe onset of the merger, the hybrid-type eos is used; i.e., the cold andthermal parts are given by the apr and $\gamma$-law eoss, respectively. threeequal-mass binaries each with mass $1.4m_\odot,1.45m_\odot,1.5m_\odot$ and twounequal-mass binaries with mass 1.3--$1.6m_\odot$, 1.35--$1.65m_\odot$ areprepared. we focus primarily on the black hole formation case, and explore massand spin of the black hole, mass of disks which surround the black hole, andgravitational waves emitted during the black hole formation. we find that (i)for the systems of $m_0=2.9$--$3.0m_\odot$ and of mass ratio $\approx 0.8$, themass of disks which surround the formed black hole is 0.006--$0.02m_{\odot}$;(ii) the spin of the formed black hole is $0.78 \pm 0.02$ when a black hole isformed after the merger in the dynamical time scale. this value depends weaklyon the total mass and mass ratio, and is about 0.1 larger than that of a blackhole formed from nonspinning binary black holes; (iii) for the black-holeformation case, fourier spectrum shape of gravitational waves emitted in themerger and ringdown phases has a universal qualitative feature irrespective ofthe total mass and mass ratio, but quantitatively, the spectrum reflects theparameters of the binary neutron stars.

0906.0889	quasiequilibrium states of black hole-neutron star binaries in the  moving-puncture framework	general relativistic quasiequilibrium states of black hole-neutron starbinaries are computed in the moving-puncture framework. we propose threeconditions for determining the quasiequilibrium states and compare thenumerical results with those obtained in the excision framework. we find thatthe results obtained in the moving-puncture framework agree with those in theexcision framework and with those in the third post-newtonian approximation forthe cases that (i) the mass ratio of the binary is close to unity irrespectiveof the orbital separation, and (ii) the orbital separation is large enough($m_0\omega \alt 0.02$ where $m_0$ and $\omega$ are the total mass and theorbital angular velocity, respectively) irrespective of the mass ratio. for$m_0 \omega \agt 0.03$, both of the results in the moving-puncture and excisionframeworks deviate, more or less, from those in the third post-newtonianapproximation. thus the numerical results do not provide a quasicircular state,rather they seem to have a nonnegligible eccentricity of order 0.01--0.1. weshow by numerical simulation that a method in the moving-puncture framework canprovide approximately quasicircular states in which the eccentricity is by afactor of $\sim 2$ smaller than those in quasiequilibrium given by otherapproaches.

0706.4154	a formation mechanism of collapsar black hole -- early evolution phase	the latest studies of massive star evolution indicate that an initiallyrapidly rotating star with sufficiently low metallicity can produce a rapidlyrotating, massive stellar core that could be a progenitor of long-softgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs). motivated by these studies, we follow the collapse ofa rapidly rotating massive stellar core to a 'collapsar' black hole (bh)surrounded by a massive, hot accretion disk performing fully generalrelativistic simulations. we focus on the general relativistic dynamics of thecollapse, and the relevant microphysics is treated in a qualitative manner. thesimulations are performed until the system consisting of the bh and the diskhas relaxed to a quasi-stationary state. a novel mechanism found in this studyis that strong shock waves are formed at the inner part of the disk after theformation of the bh. these shock waves propagate mainly along the rotationaxis, heating the disk and sweeping materials around the rotational axis, andthereby forming a low density region. the temperature of the disk is highenough for copious neutrino emission. all these features indicate that thedirect formation of a rapidly rotating bh is a promising source of lgrbs evenin the absence of strong magnetic fields.

0907.2760	higher-dimensional numerical relativity: formulation and code tests	we derive a formalism of numerical relativity for higher-dimensionalspacetimes and develop numerical codes for simulating a wide variety offive-dimensional (5d) spacetimes for the first time. first, thebaumgarte-shapiro-shibata-nakamura formalism is extended for arbitraryspacetime dimensions $d \ge 4$, and then, the so-called cartoon method, whichwas originally proposed as a robust method for simulating axisymmetric 4dspacetimes, is described for 5d spacetimes of several types of symmetries.implementing 5d numerical relativity codes with the cartoon methods, we performtest simulations by evolving a 5d schwarzschild spacetime and a 5d spacetimecomposed of a gravitational-wave packet of small amplitude. the numericalsimulations are stably performed for a sufficiently long time, as done in the4d case, and the obtained numerical results agree well with the analyticsolutions: the numerical solutions are shown to converge at the correct order.we also confirm that a longterm accurate evolution of the 5d schwarzschildspacetime is feasible using the so-called puncture approach. in addition, wederive the landau-lifshitz pseudo tensor in arbitrary dimensions, and show thatit gives a robust tool for computing the energy flux of gravitational waves.the formulations and methods developed in this paper provide a powerful toolfor studying nonlinear dynamics of higher-dimensional gravity.

0908.0579	non-conformally flat initial data for binary compact objects	a new method is described for constructing initial data for a binaryneutron-star (bns) system in quasi-equilibrium circular orbit. two formulationsfor non-conformally flat data, waveless (wl) and near-zone helically symmetric(nhs), are introduced; in each formulation, the einstein-euler system, writtenin 3+1 form on an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface, is exactly solvedfor all metric components, including the spatially non-conformally flatpotentials, and for irrotational flow. a numerical method applicable to bothformulations is explained with an emphasis on the imposition of a spatial gaugecondition. results are shown for solution sequences of irrotational bns withmatter approximated by parametrized equations of state that use a few segmentsof polytropic equations of state. the binding energy and total angular momentumof solution sequences computed within the conformally flat --isenberg-wilson-mathews (iwm) -- formulation are closer to those of the thirdpost-newtonian (3pn) two point particles up to the closest orbits, for the morecompact stars, whereas sequences resulting from the wl/nhs formulations deviatefrom the 3pn curve even more for the sequences with larger compactness. wethink it likely that this correction reflects an overestimation in the iwmformulation as well as in the 3pn formula, by $\sim 1$ cycle in thegravitational wave phase during the last several orbits. the work suggests thatimposing spatial conformal flatness results in an underestimate of thequadrupole deformation of the components of binary neutron-star systems in thelast few orbits prior to merger.

1004.4970	bar-mode instability of rapidly spinning black hole in higher  dimensions: numerical simulation in general relativity	numerical-relativity simulation is performed for rapidly spinning black holes(bhs) in a higher-dimensional spacetime of special symmetries for thedimensionality $6 \leq d \leq 8$. we find that higher-dimensional bhs, spinningrapidly enough, are dynamically unstable against nonaxisymmetric bar-modedeformation and spontaneously emit gravitational waves, irrespective of $d$ asin the case $d=5$ \cite{sy09}. the critical values of a nondimensional spinparameter for the onset of the instability are $q:=a/\mu^{1/(d-3)} \approx0.74$ for $d=6$, $\approx 0.73$ for $d=7$, and $\approx 0.77$ for $d=8$ where$\mu$ and $a$ are mass and spin parameters. black holes with a spin smallerthan these critical values ($q_{\rm crit}$) appear to be dynamically stable forany perturbation. longterm simulations for the unstable bhs are also performedfor $d=6$ and 7. we find that they spin down as a result of gravitational-waveemission and subsequently settle to a stable stationary bh of a spin smallerthan $q_{\rm crit}$. for more rapidly spinning unstable bhs, the timescale, forwhich the new state is reached, is shorter and fraction of the spin-down islarger. our findings imply that a highly rapidly spinning bh with $q &gt; q_{\rmcrit}$ cannot be a stationary product in the particle accelerators, even if itwould be formed as a consequence of a tev-gravity hypothesis. its implicationsfor the phenomenology of a mini bh are discussed.

1008.1460	gravitational waves from nonspinning black hole-neutron star binaries:  dependence on equations of state	we report results of a numerical-relativity simulation for the merger of ablack hole-neutron star binary with a variety of equations of state (eoss)modeled by piecewise polytropes. we focus in particular on the dependence ofthe gravitational waveform at the merger stage on the eoss. the initialconditions are computed in the moving-puncture framework, assuming that theblack hole is nonspinning and the neutron star has an irrotational velocityfield. for a small mass ratio of the binaries (e.g., mbh/mns = 2 where mbh andmns are the masses of the black hole and neutron star, respectively), theneutron star is tidally disrupted before it is swallowed by the black holeirrespective of the eos. especially for less-compact neutron stars, the tidaldisruption occurs at a more distant orbit. the tidal disruption is reflected ina cutoff frequency of the gravitational-wave spectrum, above which the spectrumamplitude exponentially decreases. a clear relation is found between the cutofffrequency of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the compactness of the neutronstar. this relation also depends weakly on the stiffness of the eos in the coreregion of the neutron star, suggesting that not only the compactness but alsothe eos at high density is reflected in gravitational waveforms. the mass ofthe disk formed after the merger shows a similar correlation with the eos,whereas the spin of the remnant black hole depends primarily on the mass ratioof the binary, and only weakly on the eos. properties of the remnant disks arealso analyzed.

1009.5303	formation of black hole and accretion disk in a massive high-entropy  stellar core collapse	we present the first numerical result of fully general relativisticaxisymmetric simulations for the collapse of a rotating high-entropy stellarcore to a black hole and an accretion disk. the simulations are performedtaking into account the relevant microphysics. we adopt as initial condition aspherical core with constant electron fraction ($y_e = 0.5$) and entropy perbaryon $s$ = 8 $k_b$, and angular velocity is superimposed. in the early phase,the core collapses in a homologous manner. then, it experiences a weak bouncedue to the gas pressure of free nucleons. because the bounce is weak, the corecollapses eventually to a black hole. subsequent evolution depends on initialangular velocity. when the rotation is not fast, a geometrically thin (butoptically thick) accretion disk is formed, and shock waves are formed in theinner part of the disk. for the moderately rotating case, the thin accretiondisk expands eventually to be a geometrically thick torus after sufficientaccumulation of the thermal energy generated at the shocks. furthermore,convection occurs inside the torus. neutrino luminosities vary violently withtime because of the convective motion. for the rapidly rotating case, bycontrast, a geometrically thick torus is formed soon after the black holeformation, and convective activity is weak due to the presence of epicyclicmode.

1104.5561	non-axisymmetric instabilities of neutron star with toroidal magnetic  fields	the aim of this paper is to clarify the stabilities of neutron stars withstrong toroidal magnetic fields against non-axisymmetric perturbation. themotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\sim10^{15}$g, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after themagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magneticfields. long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamicsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidalmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. to explore the effects ofrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating andrigidly rotating models. we find the emergence of the parker and/or taylerinstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. for bothnon-rotating and rotating models, the parker instability is the primaryinstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. theinterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. it is found thatrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the parker instability, and thisfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. the reason for this isthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, inthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,unstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile isdeveloped. after the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.contrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach anequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence. this conclusionsuggests that three-dimensional simulation is indispensable for exploring theformation of magnetars or prominence activities of magnetars such as giantflares.

1105.4370	binary neutron star mergers: dependence on the nuclear equation of state	we perform a numerical-relativity simulation for the merger of binary neutronstars with 6 nuclear-theory-based equations of state (eoss) described bypiecewise polytropes. our purpose is to explore the dependence of the dynamicalbehavior of the binary neutron star merger and resulting gravitationalwaveforms on the eos of the supernuclear-density matter. the numerical resultsshow that the merger process and the first outcome are classified into threetypes; (i) a black hole is promptly formed, (ii) a short-lived hypermassiveneutron star (hmns) is formed, (iii) a long-lived hmns is formed. the type ofthe merger depends strongly on the eos and on the total mass of the binaries.for the eos with which the maximum mass is larger than 2msun, the lifetime ofthe hmns is longer than 10 ms for a total mass m_0=2.7msun. a recent radioobservation suggests that the maximum mass of spherical neutron stars is m_max\geq 1.97\pm 0.04msun in one \sigma level. this fact and our results supportthe possible existence of a hmns soon after the onset of the merger for atypical binary neutron star with m_0=2.7msun. we also show that the torus masssurrounding the remnant black hole is correlated with the type of the mergerprocess; the torus mass could be large, \geq 0.1msun, in the case that along-lived hmns is formed. we also show that gravitational waves carryinformation of the merger process, the remnant, and the torus mass surroundinga black hole.

1206.5911	radiation magnetohydrodynamics for black hole-torus system in full  general relativity: a step toward physical simulation	a radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulation for the black hole-torus system isperformed in the framework of full general relativity for the first time. atruncated moment formalism is employed for a general relativistic neutrinoradiation transport. several systems in which the black hole mass is $m_{\rmbh}=3$ or $6m_{\odot}$, the black hole spin is zero, and the torus mass is$\approx 0.14$--$0.38m_{\odot}$ are evolved as models of the remnant formedafter the merger of binary neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries.the equation of state and microphysics for the high-density andhigh-temperature matter are phenomenologically taken into account in asemi-quantitative manner. it is found that the temperature in the inner regionof the torus reaches $\agt 10$ mev which enhances a high luminosity ofneutrinos $\sim 10^{51}$ ergs/s for $m_{\rm bh}=6m_{\odot}$ and $\sim 10^{52}$ergs/s for $m_{\rm bh}=3m_{\odot}$. it is shown that neutrinos are likely to beemitted primarily toward the outward direction in the vicinity of therotational axis and their energy density may be high enough to launch alow-energy short gamma-ray burst via the neutrino-antineutrinopair-annihilation process with the total energy deposition $\sim10^{47}$--$10^{49}$ ergs. it is also shown in our model that for $m_{\rmbh}=3m_{\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity is larger than the electromagneticluminosity while for $m_{\rm bh}=6m_{\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity iscomparable to or slightly smaller than the electromagnetic luminosity.

1303.6298	extracting equation of state parameters from black hole-neutron star  mergers: aligned-spin black holes and a preliminary waveform model	information about the neutron-star equation of state is encoded in thewaveform of a black hole-neutron star system through tidal interactions and thepossible tidal disruption of the neutron star. during the inspiral thisinformation depends on the tidal deformability lambda of the neutron star, andwe find that lambda is the best measured parameter during the merger andringdown as well. we performed 134 simulations where we systematically variedthe equation of state as well as the mass ratio, neutron star mass, and alignedspin of the black hole. using these simulations we have developed an analyticrepresentation of the full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform calibrated tothese numerical waveforms, and we use this analytic waveform to estimate theaccuracy to which lambda can be measured with gravitational-wave detectors. wefind that although the inspiral tidal signal is small, coherently combiningthis signal with the merger-ringdown matter effect improves the measurabilityof lambda by a factor of ~3 over using just the merger-ringdown matter effectalone. however, incorporating correlations between all the waveform parametersthen decreases the measurability of lambda by a factor of ~3. the uncertaintyin lambda increases with the mass ratio, but decreases as the black hole spinincreases. overall, a single advanced ligo detector can measure lambda for massratios q = 2--5, black hole spins j_bh/m_bh^2 = -0.5--0.75, neutron star massesm_ns = 1.2m_sun--1.45m_sun, and an optimally oriented distance of 100mpc to anuncertainty of ~10%--100%. for the proposed einstein telescope, the uncertaintyin lambda is an order of magnitude smaller.

1310.2774	radioactively powered emission from black hole-neutron star mergers	detection of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave (gw) sourcesis important to unveil the nature of compact binary coalescences. we performthree-dimensional, time-dependent, multi-frequency radiative transfersimulations for radioactively powered emission from the ejecta of black hole(bh) - neutron star (ns) mergers. depending on the bh to ns mass ratio, spin ofthe bh, and equations of state of dense matter, bh-ns mergers can eject morematerial than ns-ns mergers. in such cases, radioactively powered emission fromthe bh-ns merger ejecta can be more luminous than that from ns-ns mergers. weshow that, in spite of the expected larger distances to bh-ns merger events,observed brightness of bh-ns mergers can be comparable to or even higher thanthat of ns-ns mergers. we find that, when the tidally disrupted bh-ns mergerejecta are confined to a small solid angle, the emission from bh-ns mergerejecta tends to be bluer than that from ns-ns merger ejecta for a given totalluminosity. thanks to this property, we might be able to distinguish bh-nsmerger events from ns-ns merger events by multi-band observations of theradioactively powered emission. in addition to the gw observations, suchelectromagnetic observations can potentially provide independent information onthe nature of compact binary coalescences.

1402.7317	production of all the r-process nuclides in the dynamical ejecta of  neutron star mergers	recent studies suggest that binary neutron star (ns-ns) mergers robustlyproduce the heavy r-process nuclei above the atomic mass number a ~ 130 becauseof their ejecta consisting of almost pure neutrons (electron fraction of y_e &lt;0.1). however, little production of the lighter r-process nuclei (a = 90-120)conflicts with the spectroscopic results of r-process-enhanced galactic halostars. we present, for the first time, the result of nucleosynthesiscalculations based on the fully general-relativistic simulation of a ns-nsmerger with approximate neutrino transport. it is found that the bulk of thedynamical ejecta are appreciably shock-heated and neutrino-processed, resultingin a wide range of y_e (= 0.09-0.45). the mass-averaged abundance distributionof calculated nucleosynthesis yields is in reasonable agreement with thefull-mass range (a = 90-240) of the solar r-process curve. this implies, if ourmodel is representative of such events, that the dynamical ejecta of ns-nsmergers can be the origin of the galactic r-process nuclei. our result alsoshows that the radioactive heating after ~ 1 day from the merging, giving riseto r-process-powered transient emission, is dominated by the beta-decays ofseveral species close to stability with precisely measured half-lives. thisimplies that the total radioactive heating rate for such an event can be wellconstrained within about a factor of two if the ejected material has asolar-like r-process pattern.

1410.0738	quasiequilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars undergoing dynamical  scalarization	we calculate quasiequilibrium sequences of equal-mass, irrotational binaryneutron stars (bnss) in a scalar-tensor (st) theory of gravity that admitsdynamical scalarization. we model neutron stars with realistic equations ofstate (notably through piecewise polytropic equations of state). using thesequasiequilibrium sequences we compute the binary's scalar charge and bindingenergy versus orbital angular frequency. we find that the absolute value of thebinding energy is smaller than in general relativity (gr), differing at most by~14% at high frequencies for the cases considered. we use the newly computedbinding energy and the balance equation to estimate the number ofgravitational-wave (gw) cycles during the adiabatic, quasicircular inspiralstage up to the end of the sequence, which is the last stable orbit or themass-shedding point, depending on which comes first. we find that, depending onthe st parameters, the number of gw cycles can be substantially smaller than ingr. in particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around agw frequency of ~130 hz, the sole inclusion of the st binding energy causes areduction of gw cycles from ~120 hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 hz) of~11% with respect to the gr case. we estimate that when the st energy flux isalso included the reduction in gw cycles becomes of ~24%. quite interestingly,dynamical scalarization can produce a difference in the number of gw cycleswith respect to the gr point-particle case that is much larger than the effectdue to tidal interactions, which is on the order of only a few gw cycles. theseresults further clarify and confirm recent studies that have evolved bnsseither in full numerical relativity or in post-newtonian theory, and point outthe importance of developing accurate st-theory waveforms for systems composedof strongly self-gravitating objects, such as bnss.

1502.05402	dynamical mass ejection from black hole-neutron star binaries	we investigate properties of material ejected dynamically in the merger ofblack hole-neutron star binaries by numerical-relativity simulations. wesystematically study the dependence of ejecta properties on the mass ratio ofthe binary, spin of the black hole, and equation of state of the neutron-starmatter. dynamical mass ejection is driven primarily by tidal torque, and theejecta is much more anisotropic than that from binary neutron star mergers. inparticular, the dynamical ejecta is concentrated around the orbital plane witha half opening angle of 10--20deg and often sweeps out only a half of theplane. the ejecta mass can be as large as ~0.1m_sun, and the velocity issubrelativistic with ~0.2--0.3c for typical cases. the ratio of the ejecta massto the bound mass (disk and fallback components) is larger, and the ejectavelocity is larger, for larger values of the binary mass ratio, i.e., forlarger values of the black-hole mass. the remnant black hole-disk systemreceives a kick velocity of o(100)km/s due to the ejecta linear momentum, andthis easily dominates the kick velocity due to gravitational radiation.structures of postmerger material, velocity distribution of the dynamicalejecta, fallback rates, and gravitational waves are also investigated. we alsodiscuss the effect of ejecta anisotropy on electromagnetic counterparts,specifically a macronova/kilonova and synchrotron radio emission, developinganalytic models.

1502.06660	the dynamical mass ejection from binary neutron star mergers:  radiation-hydrodynamics study in general relativity	we perform radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergersin numerical relativity on the japanese "k" supercomputer, taking into accountneutrino cooling and heating by an updated leakage-plus-transfer scheme for thefirst time. neutron stars are modeled by three modern finite-temperatureequations of state (eos) developed by hempel and his collaborators. we findthat the properties of the dynamical ejecta of the merger such as total mass,average electron fraction, and thermal energy depend strongly on the eos. onlyfor a soft eos (the so-called sfho), the ejecta mass exceeds $0.01m_{\odot}$.in this case, the distribution of the electron fraction of the ejecta becomesbroad due to the shock heating during the merger. these properties arewell-suited for the production of the solar-like $r$-process abundance. for theother stiff eos (dd2 and tm1), for which a long-lived massive neutron star isformed after the merger, the ejecta mass is smaller than $0.01m_{\odot}$,although broad electron-fraction distributions are achieved by the positroncapture and the neutrino heating.

0805.2712	evolution of neutron stars with toroidal magnetic fields: axisymmetric  simulation in full general relativity	we study the stability of neutron stars with toroidal magnetic fields bymagnetohydrodynamic simulation in full general relativity under assumption ofaxial symmetry. nonrotating and rigidly rotating neutron stars are prepared fora variety of magnetic field configuration. for modeling the neutron stars, thepolytropic equation of state with the adiabatic index $\gamma=2$ is used forsimplicity. it is found that nonrotating neutron stars are dynamically unstablefor the case that toroidal magnetic field strength varies $\propto\varpi^{2k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$ (here $\varpi$ is the cylindrical radius),whereas for $k=1$ the neutron stars are stable. after the onset of theinstability, unstable modes grow approximately in the alfv\'en time scale and,as a result, a convective motion is excited to change the magnetic fieldprofile until a new state, which is stable against axisymmetric perturbation,is reached. we also find that rotation plays a role in stabilization, althoughthe instability still sets in in the alfv\'en time scale when the ratio ofmagnetic energy to rotational kinetic energy is larger than a critical value$\sim 0.2$. implication for the evolution of magnetized protoneutron stars isdiscussed.

0805.3099	nada: a new code for studying self-gravitating tori around black holes	we present a new two-dimensional numerical code called nada designed to solvethe full einstein equations coupled to the general relativistic hydrodynamicsequations. the code is mainly intended for studies of self-gravitatingaccretion disks (or tori) around black holes, although it is also suitable forregular spacetimes. concerning technical aspects the einstein equations areformulated and solved in the code using a formulation of the standard 3+1 (adm)system, the so-called bssn approach. a key feature of the code is thatderivative terms in the spacetime evolution equations are computed using afourth-order centered finite difference approximation in conjunction with thecartoon method to impose the axisymmetry condition under cartesian coordinates(the choice in nada), and the puncture/moving puncture approach to carry outblack hole evolutions. correspondingly, the general relativistic hydrodynamicsequations are written in flux-conservative form and solved withhigh-resolution, shock-capturing schemes. we perform and discuss a number oftests to assess the accuracy and expected convergence of the code, namely(single) black hole evolutions, shock tubes, and evolutions of both sphericaland rotating relativistic stars in equilibrium, the gravitational collapse of aspherical relativistic star leading to the formation of a black hole. inaddition, paving the way for specific applications of the code, we also presentresults from fully general relativistic numerical simulations of a systemformed by a black hole surrounded by a self-gravitating torus in equilibrium.

1509.00512	aligned spin neutron star-black hole mergers: a gravitational waveform  amplitude model	the gravitational radiation emitted during the merger of a black hole with aneutron star is rather similar to the radiation from the merger of two blackholes when the neutron star is not tidally disrupted. when tidal disruptionoccurs, gravitational waveforms can be broadly classified in two groups,depending on the spatial extent of the disrupted material. extending previouswork by some of us, here we present a phenomenological model for thegravitational waveform amplitude in the frequency domain encompassing the threepossible outcomes of the merger: no tidal disruption, "mild" and "strong" tidaldisruption. the model is calibrated to 134 general-relativistic numericalsimulations of binaries where the black hole spin is either aligned orantialigned with the orbital angular momentum. all simulations were producedusing the sacra code and piecewise polytropic neutron star equations of state.the present model can be used to determine when black-hole binary waveforms aresufficient for gravitational-wave detection, to extract information on theequation of state from future gravitational-wave observations, to obtain moreaccurate estimates of black hole-neutron star merger event rates, and todetermine the conditions under which these systems are plausible candidates ascentral engines of gamma-ray bursts, macronovae and kilonovae.

1509.06209	gravitational-wave cutoff frequencies of tidally disruptive neutron  star-black hole binary mergers	tidal disruption has a dramatic impact on the outcome of neutron star-blackhole mergers. the phenomenology of these systems can be divided in threeclasses: nondisruptive, mildly disruptive or disruptive. the cutoff frequencyof the gravitational radiation produced during the merger (which is potentiallymeasurable by interferometric detectors) is very different in each regime, andwhen the merger is disuptive it carries information on the neutron starequation of state. here we use semianalytical tools to derive a formula for thecritical binary mass ratio $q=m_{\rm bh}/m_{\rm ns}$ below which mergers aredisruptive as a function of the stellar compactness $\mathcal{c}=m_{\rmns}/r_{\rm ns}$ and the dimensionless black hole spin $\chi$. we then employ anew gravitational waveform amplitude model, calibrated to $134$ generalrelativistic numerical simulations of binaries with black hole spin(anti-)aligned with the orbital angular momentum, to obtain a fit to thegravitational-wave cutoff frequency in the disruptive regime as a function of$\mathcal{c}$, $q$ and $\chi$. our findings are important to buildgravitational wave template banks, to determine whether neutron star-black holemergers can emit electromagnetic radiation (thus helping multimessengersearches), and to improve event rate calculations for these systems.

0806.4007	simulating coalescing compact binaries by a new code sacra	we report our new code (named sacra) for numerical relativity simulations inwhich an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is implemented. in this code, theeinstein equations are solved in the bssn formalism with a fourth-order finitedifferencing, and the hydrodynamic equations are solved by a third-orderhigh-resolution central scheme. the fourth-order runge-kutta scheme is adoptedfor integration in time. to test the code, simulations for coalescence of blackhole-black hole (bh-bh), neutron star-neutron star (ns-ns), and blackhole-neutron star (bh-ns) binaries are performed, and also, properties of bhsformed after the merger and gravitational waveforms are compared among thosethree cases. for the simulations of bh-bh binaries, we adopt the same initialconditions as those by buonanno et al. and compare numerical results. we findreasonable agreement except for a slight disagreement possibly associated withthe difference in choice of gauge conditions and numerical schemes. for anns-ns binary, we performed simulations employing both sacra and shibata'sprevious code, and find reasonable agreement. for a bh-ns binary, we comparenumerical results with our previous ones, and find that gravitational waveformsand properties of the bh formed after the merger agree well with those of ourprevious ones, although the disk mass formed after the merger is less than 0.1%of the total rest mass, which disagrees with the previous result. we alsoreport numerical results of a longterm simulation (with $\sim 4$ orbits) for abh-ns binary for the first time. all these numerical results show behavior ofconvergence, and extrapolated numerical results for time spent in the inspiralphase agree with post-newtonian predictions in a reasonable accuracy.

astro-ph;0005378	the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars:  simulations in full general relativity	we study the dynamical stability against bar-mode deformation of rapidlyspinning neutron stars with differential rotation. we perform fullyrelativistic 3d simulations of compact stars with $m/r \geq 0.1$, where $m$ isthe total gravitational mass and $r$ the equatorial circumferential radius. weadopt an adiabatic equation of state with adiabatic index $\gamma=2$. as innewtonian theory, we find that stars above a critical value of $\beta \equivt/w$ (where $t$ is the rotational kinetic energy and $w$ the gravitationalbinding energy) are dynamically unstable to bar formation. for our adoptedchoices of stellar compaction and rotation profile, the critical value of$\beta = \beta_{dgr}$ is $\sim 0.24-0.25$, only slightly smaller than thewell-known newtonian value $\sim 0.27$ for incompressible maclaurin spheroids.the critical value depends only very weakly on the degree of differentialrotation for the moderate range we surveyed. all unstable stars form bars on adynamical timescale. models with sufficiently large $\beta$ subsequently formspiral arms and eject mass, driving the remnant to a dynamically stable state.models with moderately large $\beta \gtrsim \beta_{dgr}$ do not develop spiralarms or eject mass but adjust to form dynamically stable ellipsoidal-likeconfigurations. if the bar-mode instability is triggered in supernovae collapseor binary neutron star mergers, it could be a strong and observable source ofgravitational waves. we determine characteristic wave amplitudes andfrequencies.

astro-ph;0010201	dynamical bar instability in rotating stars: effect of general  relativity	we study the dynamical stability against bar-mode deformation of rapidly anddifferentially rotating stars in the first post-newtonian approximation ofgeneral relativity. we vary the compaction of the star $m/r$ (where $m$ is thegravitational mass and $r$ the equatorial circumferential radius) between 0.01and 0.05 to isolate the influence of relativistic gravitation on theinstability. for compactions in this moderate range, the critical value of$\beta \equiv t/w$ for the onset of the dynamical instability (where $t$ is therotational kinetic energy and $w$ the gravitational binding energy) slightlydecreases from $\sim 0.26$ to $\sim 0.25$ with increasing compaction for ourchoice of the differential rotational law. combined with our earlier findingsbased on simulations in full general relativity for stars with highercompaction, we conclude that relativistic gravitation {\em enhances} thedynamical bar-mode instability, i.e. the onset of instability sets in forsmaller values of $\beta$ in relativistic gravity than in newtonian gravity. wealso find that once a triaxial structure forms after the bar-mode perturbationsaturates in dynamically unstable stars, the triaxial shape is maintained, atleast for several rotational periods. to check the reliability of our numericalintegrations, we verify that the general relativistic kelvin-helmholtzcirculation is well-conserved, in addition to rest-mass energy, totalmass-energy, linear and angular momentum. conservation of circulation indicatesthat our code is not seriously affected by numerical viscosity. we determinethe amplitude and frequency of the quasi-periodic gravitational waves emittedduring the bar formation process using the quadrupole formula.

astro-ph;0104408	equilibrium and stability of supermassive stars in binary systems	we investigate the equilibrium and stability of supermassive stars of mass $m\agt 10^5m_{\odot}$ in binary systems. we find that corotating binaries aresecularly unstable for close, circular orbits with $r \alt4r(m/10^6m_{\odot})^{1/6}$ where $r$ is the orbital separation and $r$ thestellar radius. we also show that corotation cannot be achieved for distantorbits with $r \agt 12 r (m/10^6m_{\odot})^{-11/24}$, since the timescale forviscous angular momentum transfer associated with tidal torques is longer thanthe evolution timescale due to emission of thermal radiation. these factssuggest that the allowed mass range and orbital separation for corotatingsupermassive binary stars is severely restricted. in particular, forsupermassive binary stars of large mass $m \agt 6\times 10^6m_{\odot}$,corotation cannot be achieved, as viscosity is not adequate to mediate thetransfer between orbital and spin angular momentum. one possible outcome forbinary supermassive stars is the onset of quasi-radial, relativisticinstability which drives each star to collapse prior to merger: we discussalternative outcomes of collapse and possible spin states of the resultingblack holes. we estimate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational wavesemitted during several inspiral and collapse scenarios.

astro-ph;0202112	collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a supermassive black hole:  post-newtonian simulations	we study the gravitational collapse of a rotating supermassive star (sms) bymeans of a (3+1) hydrodynamical simulation in a post-newtonian (pn) approxi-mation of general relativity. this problem is particularly challenging becauseof the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course ofcol- lapse. we evolve a uniformly rotating sms from the onset of radialinstability at r_{p}/m=411, where r_{p} is the proper polar radius of the starand m is the total mass-energy, to the point at which the pn approximationbreaks down. we introduce a scale factor and a "comoving" coordinate to handlethe large varia- tion in radius during the collapse and focus on the centralcore. since t/w, the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to thegravitational binding energy, is nearly proportional to 1/r_{p} throughout thecollapse, the imploding star may ultimately exceed the critical value of t/wfor dynamical instability to bar-mode formation. however, for stars rotatinguniformly at the onset of col- lapse, we do not find any unstable growth ofbars prior to the termination of our simulation. we do find that the collapseis likely to form a supermassive black hole (bh) coherently, with almost all ofthe matter falling into the hole, leaving very little ejected matter to form adisk. in the absence of nonaxi- symmetric bar formation, the collapse of auniformly rotating sms does not lead to appreciable quasi-periodicgravitational wave (gw) emission by the time our integrations terminate.however, the coherent nature of the implosion suggests that rotating smscollapse will be a promising source of gw bursts. we also expect that,following bh formation, long wavelength quasi-periodic waves will result fromquasi-normal ringing. these waves may be detectable by lisa.

astro-ph;0209251	collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a supermassive black hole:  analytic determination of the black hole mass and spin	the collapse of a uniformaly rotating, supermassive star (sms) to asupermassive black hole (smbh) has been followed recently by means ofhydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity. the initial sms ofarbitrary mass m in these simulations rotates uniformly at the mass--sheddinglimit and is marginally unstable to radial collapse. the final black hole hasmass m_h/m = 0.9 and and spin j_h/m_h^2 = 0.75, approximately. the remainingmass goes into a disk of mass m_disk/m = 0.1, also approximately. here we showthat these black hole and disk parameters can be calculated analytically fromthe initial stellar density and angular momentum distribution. the analyticcalculation thereby corroborates and provides a simple physical explanation forthe computational discovery that sms collapse inevitably terminates in thesimultaneous formation of a smbh and a rather substantial ambient disk. thisdisk arises even though the total spin of the progenitor star, j/m^2 = 0.97, issafely below the kerr limit. the calculation performed here applies to anymarginally unstable n = 3 polytrope uniformly rotating at the break--up speed,independent of stellar mass or the source of internal pressure. it illustrateshow the black hole and disk parameters can be determined for the collapse ofother types of stars with different initial density and rotation profiles.

astro-ph;0603145	merger of binary neutron stars to a black hole: disk mass, short  gamma-ray bursts, and quasinormal mode ringing	three-dimensional simulations for the merger of binary neutron stars (bnss)are performed in the framework of full general relativity. we pay particularattention to the black hole (bh) formation case and to the resulting mass ofthe surrounding disk for exploring possibility for formation of the centralengine of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. hybrid equations of state (eoss) areadopted mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear eoss, for which the maximum allowedgravitational mass of cold and spherical neutron stars (nss), m_sph, is largerthan 2m_sun. for the simulations, we focus on bnss of the adm mass m&gt;2.6m_sun.for m&gt;m_thr, the merger results in prompt formation of a bh irrespective of themass ratio q_m with 0.65&lt;q_m&lt;1. the value of m_thr is approximately written as1.3-1.35m_sph for the chosen eoss. for the bh formation case, we evolve thespacetime using a bh excision technique and determine the mass of aquasistationary disk surrounding the bh. the disk mass steeply increases withdecreasing the value of q_m for given adm mass and eos. for m&lt;m_thr, theoutcome is a hypermassive neutron star (hmns) of a large ellipticity. if thehmns collapses to a bh after the longterm angular momentum transport, the diskmass may be &gt;0.01m_sun. gravitational waves (gws) are computed in terms of agauge-invariant wave extraction technique. in the formation of the hmns,quasiperiodic gws of frequency (3-3.5khz) are emitted. the effective amplitudeof gws can be &gt;5x10^{-21} at a distance of 50 mpc. for the bh formation case,the bh excision technique enables a longterm computation and extraction ofring-down gws associated with a bh quasinormal mode. it is found that thefrequency and amplitude are 6.5-7khz and 10^{-22} at a distance of 50mpc form=2.7-2.9m_sun.

astro-ph;0605331	evolution of magnetized, differentially rotating neutron stars:  simulations in full general relativity	we study the effects of magnetic fields on the evolution of differentiallyrotating neutron stars, which can form in stellar core collapse or binaryneutron star coalescence. magnetic braking and the magnetorotationalinstability (mri) both redistribute angular momentum; the outcome of theevolution depends on the star's mass and spin. simulations are carried out inaxisymmetry using our recently developed codes which integrate the coupledeinstein-maxwell-mhd equations. for initial data, we consider three categoriesof differentially rotating, equilibrium configurations, which we label normal,hypermassive and ultraspinning. hypermassive stars have rest masses exceedingthe mass limit for uniform rotation. ultraspinning stars are not hypermassive,but have angular momentum exceeding the maximum for uniform rotation at thesame rest mass. we show that a normal star will evolve to a uniformly rotatingequilibrium configuration. an ultraspinning star evolves to an equilibriumstate consisting of a nearly uniformly rotating central core, surrounded by adifferentially rotating torus with constant angular velocity along magneticfield lines, so that differential rotation ceases to wind the magnetic field.in addition, the final state is stable against the mri, although it hasdifferential rotation. for a hypermassive neutron star, the mhd-driven angularmomentum transport leads to catastrophic collapse of the core. the resultingrotating black hole is surrounded by a hot, massive, magnetized torusundergoing quasistationary accretion, and a magnetic field collimated along thespin axis--a promising candidate for the central engine of a short gamma-rayburst.

astro-ph;0610840	magnetorotational collapse of massive stellar cores to neutron stars:  simulations in full general relativity	we study magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) effects arising in the collapse ofmagnetized, rotating, massive stellar cores to proto-neutron stars (pnss). weperform axisymmetric numerical simulations in full general relativity with ahybrid equation of state. the formation and early evolution of a pns arefollowed with a grid of 2500 x 2500 zones, which provides better resolutionthan in previous (newtonian) studies. we confirm that significant differentialrotation results even when the rotation of the progenitor is initially uniform.consequently, the magnetic field is amplified both by magnetic winding and themagnetorotational instability (mri). even if the magnetic energy e_em is muchsmaller than the rotational kinetic energy t_rot at the time of pns formation,the ratio e_em/t_rot increases to 0.1-0.2 by the magnetic winding. followingpns formation, mhd outflows lead to losses of rest mass, energy, and angularmomentum from the system. the earliest outflow is produced primarily by theincreasing magnetic stress caused by magnetic winding. the mri amplifies thepoloidal field and increases the magnetic stress, causing further angularmomentum transport and helping to drive the outflow. after the magnetic fieldsaturates, a nearly stationary, collimated magnetic field forms near therotation axis and a blandford-payne type outflow develops along the fieldlines. these outflows remove angular momentum from the pns at a rate given by\dot{j} \sim \eta e_em c_b, where \eta is a constant of order 0.1 and c_b is atypical ratio of poloidal to toroidal field strength. as a result, the rotationperiod quickly increases for a strongly magnetized pns until the degree ofdifferential rotation decreases. our simulations suggest that rapidly rotating,magnetized pnss may not give rise to rapidly rotating neutron stars.

gr-qc;0007042	properties of general relativistic, irrotational binary neutron stars in  close quasiequilibrium orbits : polytropic equations of state	we investigate close binary neutron stars in quasiequilibrium states in ageneral relativistic framework. we assume conformal flatness for the spatialmetric and irrotational velocity field for the neutron stars. we adopt thepolytropic equation of state. the computation is performed for the polytropicindex n(=0.5, 0.66667, 0.8, 1, 1.25), and compactness of neutron starsm/r(=0.03 - 0.3). results of this paper are as follows. (i) the sequences ofthe irrotational binary are always terminated at an innermost orbit where acusp (inner lagrange point)appears at the inner edges of the stellar surface.the binaries with cusps are found to be dynamically unstable for n=0.5 andstable for n &gt; 0.8 irrespective of m/r &lt; 0.2. for n=0.66667, the stabilitychanges depending on m/r. (ii) the gravitational wave frequency at theinnermost orbit turns out to be between 800 and 1500 hz for realisticcompactness 0.14 &lt; m/r &lt; 0.2. (iii) the isco for n=0.5 appears to be determinedby a hydrodynamic instability for m/r &lt; 0.2. we derive fitting formulae for therelation between the orbital angular velocity at the isco and the compactnessto clarify it. (iv) the maximum density of neutron stars in binary systemsslightly decreases with decreasing the orbital separation and hence they arestable against individual radial collapse during the inspiral. (v) q =j_tot/m_adm^2 at the innermost orbits is always less than unity for m/r &gt; 0.13irrespective of n, which indicates that the realistic binary neutron starssatisfy a necessary condition (q&lt;1) for formation of a black hole before themerger. (vi) the specific angular momentum of any mass element in irrotationalbinary neutron stars at the innermost orbit appears to be too small to form adisk around black holes formed after the merger.

gr-qc;0007049	axisymmetric simulations of rotating stellar collapse in full general  relativity --- criteria for prompt collapse to black holes	motivated by a recent paper by the potsdam numerical relativity group, wehave constructed a new numerical code for hydrodynamic simulation ofaxisymmetric systems in full general relativity. in this code, we solve theeinstein field equation using cartesian coordinates with appropriate boundaryconditions. on the other hand, the hydrodynamic equations are solved incylindrical coordinates. using this code, we perform simulations to studyaxisymmetric collapse of rotating stars, which thereby become black holes ornew compact stars, in full general relativity. to investigate the effects ofrotation on the criterion for prompt collapse to black holes, we first adopt apolytropic equation of state, $p=k\rho^{\gamma}$, where $p$, $\rho$, and $k$are the pressure, rest mass density, and polytropic constant, with $\gamma=2$.in this case, the collapse is adiabatic (i.e., no change in entropy), and wecan focus on the bare effect of rotation. as the initial conditions, we preparerigidly and differentially rotating stars in equilibrium and then decrease thepressure to induce collapse. in this paper, we consider cases in which $q\equiv j/m_g^2 &lt; 1$, where $j$ and $m_g$ are the angular momentum and thegravitational mass. it is found that the criterion of black hole formation isstrongly dependent on the angular momentum parameter $q$. for $q &lt; 0.5$, thecriterion is not strongly sensitive to $q$; more precisely, if the rest mass isslightly larger than the maximum allowed value of spherical stars, a black holeis formed. however, for $q \alt 1$, it changes significantly: for $q \simeq0.9$, the maximum allowed rest mass becomes $\sim 70$ - 80% larger than thatfor spherical stars.

gr-qc;0102076	dynamical bar instability in relativistic rotating stars	we study by computational means the dynamical stability against bar-modedeformation of rapidly and differentially rotating stars in a post-newtonianapproximation of general relativity. we vary the compaction of the star $m/r$(where $m$ is the gravitational mass and $r$ the equatorial circumferentialradius) between 0.01 and 0.05 to isolate the influence of relativisticgravitation on the instability. for compactions in this moderate range, thecritical value of $\beta = t/w$ for the onset of the dynamical instability(where $t$ is the rotational kinetic energy and w the gravitational bindingenergy) slightly decreases from $\sim$ 0.26 to $\sim$ 0.25 with increasingcompaction for our choice of the differential rotational law. combined with ourearlier findings based on simulations in full general relativity for stars withhigher compaction, we conclude that relativistic gravitation enhances thedynamical bar-mode instability, i.e. the onset of instability sets in forsmaller values of $\beta$ in relativistic gravity than in newtonian gravity. wealso find that once a triaxial structure forms after the bar-mode perturbationsaturates in dynamically unstable stars, the triaxial shape is maintained, atleast for several rotational periods. to check the reliability of our numericalintegrations, we verify that the general relativistic kelvin-helmholtzcirculation is well-conserved, in addition to rest-mass and total mass-energy,linear and angular momentum. conservation of circulation indicates that ourcode is not seriously affected by numerical viscosity. we determine theamplitude and frequency of the quasi-periodic gravitational waves emittedduring the bar formation process using the quadrupole formula.

gr-qc;0108070	thermodynamics of binary black holes and neutron stars	we consider compact binary systems, modeled in general relativity as vacuumor perfect-fluid spacetimes with a helical killing vector k^\alpha,heuristically, the generator of time-translations in a corotating frame.systems that are stationary in this sense are not asymptotically flat, but haveasymptotic behavior corresponding to equal amounts of ingoing and outgoingradiation. for black-hole binaries, a rigidity theorem implies that the killingvector lies along the horizon's generators, and from this one can deduce thezeroth law (constant surface gravity of the horizon). remarkably, although themass and angular momentum of such a system are not defined, there is an exactfirst law, relating the change in the asymptotic noether charge to the changesin the vorticity, baryon mass, and entropy of the fluid, and in the area ofblack holes.  binary systems with m\omega small have an approximate asymptopia in which onecan write the first law in terms of the asymptotic mass and angular momentum.asymptotic flatness is precise in two classes of solutions used to model binarysystems: spacetimes satisfying the post-newtonian equations, and solutions to amodified set of field equations that have a spatially conformally flat metric.(the spatial conformal flatness formalism with helical symmetry, however, isconsistent with maximal slicing only if replaces the extrinsic curvature in thefield equations by an artificially tracefree expression in terms of the shiftvector.) for these spacetimes, nearby equilibria whose stars have the samevorticity obey the relation \delta m = \omega \delta j, from which one canobtain a turning point criterion that governs the stability of orbits.

gr-qc;0109026	computation of gravitational waves from inspiraling binary neutron stars  in quasiequilibrium circular orbits : formulation and calibration	gravitational waves from binary neutron stars in quasiequilibrium circularorbits are computed using an approximate method which we propose in this paper.in the first step of this method, we prepare general relativistic irrotationalbinary neutron stars in a quasiequilibrium circular orbit, neglectinggravitational waves. we adopt the so-called conformal flatness approximationfor a three-metric to obtain the quasiequilibrium states in this paper. in thesecond step, we compute gravitational waves, solving linear perturbationequations in the background spacetime of the quasiequilibrium states. comparingnumerical results with post newtonian waveforms and luminosity of gravitationalwaves from two point masses in circular orbits, we demonstrate that this methodcan produce accurate waveforms and luminosity of gravitational waves. it isshown that the effects of tidal deformation of neutron stars and strong generalrelativistic gravity modify the post newtonian results for compact binaryneutron stars in close orbits. we indicate that the magnitude of a systematicerror in quasiequilibrium states associated with the conformal flatnessapproximation is fairly large for close and compact binary neutron stars.several formulations for improving the accuracy of quasiequilibrium states areproposed.

gr-qc;0203037	gravitational waves from the merger of binary neutron stars in a fully  general relativistic simulation	we performed 3d numerical simulations of the merger of equal-mass binaryneutron stars in full general relativity using a new large scale supercomputer.we take the typical grid size as (505,505,253) for (x,y,z) and the maximum gridsize as (633,633,317). these grid numbers enable us to put the outer boundariesof the computational domain near the local wave zone and hence to calculategravitational waveforms of good accuracy (within $\sim 10%$ error) for thefirst time. to model neutron stars, we adopt a $\gamma$-law equation of statein the form $p=(\gamma-1)\rho\epsilon$, where p, $\rho$, $\varep$ and $\gamma$are the pressure, rest mass density, specific internal energy, and adiabaticconstant. it is found that gravitational waves in the merger stage havecharacteristic features that reflect the formed objects. in the case that amassive, transient neutron star is formed, its quasi-periodic oscillations areexcited for a long duration, and this property is reflected clearly by thequasi-periodic nature of waveforms and the energy luminosity. in the case ofblack hole formation, the waveform and energy luminosity are likely dampedafter a short merger stage. however, a quasi-periodic oscillation can still beseen for a certain duration, because an oscillating transient massive object isformed during the merger. this duration depends strongly on the initialcompactness of neutron stars and is reflected in the fourier spectrum ofgravitational waves. to confirm our results and to calibrate the accuracy ofgravitational waveforms, we carried out a wide variety of test simulations,changing the resolution and size of the computational domain.

gr-qc;9710023	numerical study on the hydrodynamic instability of binary stars in the  first post newtonian approximation of general relativity	we present numerical results on the hydrodynamic stability of coalescingbinary stars in the first post newtonian(1pn) approximation of generalrelativity. we pay particular attention to the hydrodynamical instability ofcorotating binary stars in equilibrium states assuming the stiff polytropicequation of state with the adiabatic constant $\gamma=3$. in previous 1pnnumerical studies on corotating binary stars in equilibrium states, it wasfound that along the sequence of binary stars as a function of the orbitalseparation, they have the energy and/or angular momentum minima where thesecular instability sets in, and that with increase of the 1pn correction, theorbital separation at these minima decreases while the angular velocity thereincreases. in this paper, to know the location of the innermost stable circularorbit(isco), we perform numerical simulations and find where the hydrodynamicalinstability along the corotating sequences of binary sets in. from thenumerical results, we found that the dynamical stability limit seems to existnear the energy and/or angular momentum minima not only in the newtonian, butalso in the 1pn cases. this means that the 1pn effect of general relativityincreases the angular frequency of gravitational waves at the isco.

gr-qc;9809039	irrotational and incompressible ellipsoids in the first post-newtonian  approximation of general relativity	first post-newtonian (1pn) hydrostatic equations for an irrotational fluidwhich have been recently derived are solved for an incompressible star. the 1pnconfigurations are expressed as a deformation of the newtonian irrotationalriemann ellipsoid using lagrangian displacement vectors introduced bychandrasekhar. for the 1pn solutions, we also calculate the luminosity ofgravitational waves in the 1pn approximation using the blanchet-damourformalism. it is found that the solutions of the 1pn equations exhibitsingularities at points where the axial ratios of semi-axes are 1:0.5244:0.6579and 1:0.2374:0.2963, and the singularities seem to show that at the points, theirrotational riemann ellipsoid is unstable to the deformation induced by theeffect of general relativity. for stable cases (a_2/a_1 &gt; 0.5244, where a_1 anda_2 are the semi-major and minor axes, respectively) we find that whenincreasing the 1pn correction, the angular velocity and total angular momentumincrease, while the total energy and luminosity of gravitational wavesdecrease. these 1pn solutions will be useful when examining the accuracy ofnumerical code for obtaining relativistic irrotational stars.  we also investigate the validity of an ellipsoidal approximation, in which a1pn solution is obtained assuming an ellipsoidal figure and neglecting thedeformation. it is found that for $a_2/a_1 &gt; 0.7$, the ellipsoidalapproximation gives a fairly accurate result for the energy, angular momentum,and angular velocity, although in the approximation we cannot find thesingularities.

gr-qc;9905058	fully general relativistic simulation of merging binary clusters --  spatial gauge condition --	we have carried out simulations of the coalescence between two relativisticclusters of collisionless particles using a 3d numerical relativity code. wehave adopted a new spatial gauge condition obtained by slightly modifying theminimum distortion gauge condition proposed by smarr and york and resulting ina simpler equation for the shift vector. using this gauge condition, we haveperformed several simulations of the merger between two identical clusters inwhich we have varied the compaction, the type of internal motion in theclusters, and the magnitude of the orbital velocity. as a result of thecoalescence, either a new rotating cluster or a black hole is formed. in thecase in which a black hole is not formed, simulations could be carried out fora time much longer than the dynamical time scale, and the resultinggravitational waveforms were calculated fairly accurately: in these cases, theamplitude of gravitational waves emitted can be $\sim10^{-18}(m/10^6m_{\odot})$ at a distance 4000mpc, and $\sim 0.5%$ of the restmass energy may be dissipated by the gravitational wave emission in the finalphase of the merger. these results confirm that the new spatial gauge conditionis promising in many problems at least up to the formation of black holes. inthe case in which a black hole is formed, on the other hand, the gaugecondition seems to be less adequate, but we suggest a strategy to improve it inthis case. all of the results obtained confirm the robustness of ourformulation and the ability of our code for stable evolution of stronggravitational fields of compact binaries.

gr-qc;9905064	black hole formation in the friedmann universe: formulation and  computation in numerical relativity	we study formation of black holes in the friedmann universe. we present aformulation of the einstein equations under the constant mean curvaturetime-slicing condition. our formalism not only gives us the analytic solutionof the perturbation equations for non-linear density and metric fluctuations onsuperhorizon scales, but also allows us to carry out a numerical relativitysimulation for black hole formation after the scale of the density fluctuationsis well within the hubble horizon scale. we perform a numerical simulation ofspherically symmetric black hole formation in the radiation-dominated,spatially flat background universe for a realistic initial condition suppliedfrom the analytic solution. it is found that the initial metric perturbationhas to be non-linear (the maximum value of 3d conformal factor $\psi_0$ at$t=0$ should be larger than $\sim 1.4$) for a black hole to be formed, but thethreshold amplitude for black hole formation and the final black hole massconsiderably depend on the initial density (or metric) profile of theperturbation: the threshold value of $\psi_0$ at $t=0$ for formation of a blackhole is smaller for a high density peak surrounded by a low density region thanfor that surrounded by the average density region of the flat universe. thissuggests that it is necessary to take into account the spatial correlation ofdensity fluctuations in the study of primordial black hole formation.

gr-qc;9908027	fully general relativistic simulation of coalescing binary neutron  stars: preparatory tests	we present our first successful numerical results of 3d general relativisticsimulations in which the einstein equation as well as the hydrodynamicequations are fully solved. this paper is especially devoted to simulations oftest problems such as spherical dust collapse, stability test of perturbedspherical stars, and preservation of (approximate) equilibrium states ofrapidly rotating neutron star and/or corotating binary neutron stars. thesetest simulations confirm that simulations of coalescing binary neutron starsare feasible in a numerical relativity code. it is illustrated that using ournumerical code, simulations of these problems, in particular those ofcorotating binary neutron stars, can be performed stably and fairly accuratelyfor a couple of dynamical timescales. these numerical results indicate that ourformulation for solving the einstein field equation and hydrodynamic equationsare robust and make it possible to perform a realistic simulation of coalescingbinary neutron stars for a long time from the innermost circular orbit up toformation of a black hole or neutron star.

gr-qc;9911058	simulation of merging binary neutron stars in full general relativity:  $\gamma=2$ case	we have performed 3d numerical simulations for merger of equal mass binaryneutron stars in full general relativity. we adopt a $\gamma$-law equation ofstate in the form $p=(\gamma-1)\rho\epsilon$ where p, $\rho$, $\varep$ and$\gamma$ are the pressure, rest mass density, specific internal energy, and theadiabatic constant with $\gamma=2$. as initial conditions, we adopt models ofcorotational and irrotational binary neutron stars in a quasi-equilibrium statewhich are obtained using the conformal flatness approximation for the threegeometry as well as an assumption that a helicoidal killing vector exists. inthis paper, we pay particular attention to the final product of thecoalescence. we find that the final product depends sensitively on the initialcompactness parameter of the neutron stars : in a merger between sufficientlycompact neutron stars, a black hole is formed in a dynamical timescale. as thecompactness is decreased, the formation timescale becomes longer and longer. itis also found that a differentially rotating massive neutron star is formedinstead of a black hole for less compact binary cases, in which the rest massof each star is less than 70-80% of the maximum allowed mass of a sphericalstar. in the case of black hole formation, we roughly evaluate the mass of thedisk around the black hole. for the merger of corotational binaries, a disk ofmass $\sim 0.05-0.1m_*$ may be formed, where m_* is the total rest mass of thesystem. on the other hand, for the merger of irrotational binaries, the diskmass appears to be very small : &lt; 0.01m_*.
