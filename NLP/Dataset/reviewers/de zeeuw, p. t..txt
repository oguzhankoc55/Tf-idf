0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0906.0018	stellar velocity profiles and line strengths out to four effective radii  in the early-type galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 821	we use the integral-field spectrograph sauron to measure the stellarline-of-sight velocity distribution and absorption line strengths out to foureffective radii (re) in the early-type galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 821. with ournewly developed observing technique we can now probe these faint regions ingalaxies that were previously not accessible with traditional long-slitspectroscopy. we make optimal use of the large field-of-view and highthroughput of the spectrograph: by adding the signal of all ~1400 lenslets intoone spectrum, we obtain sufficient signal-to-noise in a few hours of observingtime to reliably measure the absorption line kinematics and line strengths outto large radius.  we find that the line strength gradients previously observed within 1 reremain constant out to at least 4 re, which puts constraints on the mergerhistories of these galaxies. the stellar halo populations are old andmetal-poor. by constructing orbit-based schwarzschild dynamical models we findthat dark matter is necessary to explain the observed kinematics in ngc 3379and ngc 821, with 30 - 50 per cent of the total matter being dark within 4 re.the radial anisotropy in our best-fit halo models is less than in our modelswithout halo, due to differences in orbital structure. the halo also has aneffect on the mgb - vesc relation: its slope is steeper when a dark matter halois added to the model.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0911.3667	dissecting the lyman alpha emission halo of lab1	we report observations of lyman alpha blob 1 (lab1) in the ssa 22protocluster region (z=3.09) with the integral-field spectrograph sauron. weincreased the signal-to-noise in the spectra by more than a factor threecompared to our previous observations. this allows us to probe the structure ofthe lab system in detail, examining its structure in the spatial and wavelengthdimensions. we find that the emission from the system comes largely from fivedistinct blobs. two of the emission regions are associated with lyman breakgalaxies, while a third appears to be associated with a heavily obscuredsubmillimeter galaxy. the fourth and fifth components do not appear to beassociated with any galaxy despite the deep imaging that is available in thisfield. if we interpret wavelength shifts in the line centroid as velocitystructure in the underlying gas, many of these emission systems show evidenceof velocity shear. it remains difficult to distinguish between an underlyingrotation of the gas and an outflow driven by the central object. we haveexamined all of the line profiles for evidence of strong absorption features.while several systems are better fitted by the inclusion of a weak absorptioncomponent, we do not see evidence for a large-scale coherent absorption featuresuch as that seen in lab2.

0912.0274	the sauron project - xv. modes of star formation in early-type galaxies  and the evolution of the red sequence	we combine sauron integral field data of a representative sample of localearly-type, red sequence galaxies with spitzer/irac imaging in order toinvestigate the presence of trace star formation in these systems. with thespitzer data, we identify galaxies hosting low-level star formation, as tracedby pah emission, with measured star formation rates that compare well to thoseestimated from other tracers. this star formation proceeds according toestablished scaling relations with molecular gas content, in surface densityregimes characteristic of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. we findthat star formation in early-type galaxies happens exclusively in fast-rotatingsystems and occurs in two distinct modes. in the first, star formation is adiffuse process, corresponding to widespread young stellar populations and highmolecular gas content. the equal presence of co- and counter-rotatingcomponents in these systems strongly implies an external origin for thestar-forming gas, and we argue that these star formation events may be thefinal stages of (mostly minor) mergers that build up the bulges of red sequencelenticulars. in the second mode of star formation, the process is concentratedinto well-defined disk or ring morphologies, outside of which the host galaxiesexhibit uniformly evolved stellar populations. this implies that these starformation events represent rejuvenations within previously quiescent stellarsystems. evidence for earlier star formation events similar to these in allfast rotating early-type galaxies suggests that this mode of star formation maybe common to all such galaxies, with a duty cycle of roughly 1/10, and likelycontributes to the embedded, co-rotating inner stellar disks ubiquitous in thispopulation.

1004.4003	formation of slowly rotating early-type galaxies via major mergers: a  resolution study	we study resolution effects in numerical simulations of gas-rich and gas-poormajor mergers, and show that the formation of slowly-rotating ellipticalgalaxies often requires a resolution that is beyond the present-day standardsto be properly modelled. our sample of equal-mass merger models encompassesvarious masses and spatial resolutions, ranging from about 200pc and 10^5particles per component, typical of some recently published major mergersimulations, to up to 32pc and 10^3 m_sun in simulations using 2.4 x 10^7collisionless particles and 1.2 x 10^7 gas particles, among the highestresolutions reached so far for gas-rich major merger of massive disc galaxies.we find that the formation of fast-rotating early-type galaxies, that areflattened by a significant residual rotation, is overall correctly reproducedat all such resolutions. however, the formation of slow-rotating early-typegalaxies, which have a low residual angular momentum and are supported mostlyby anisotropic velocity dispersions, is strongly resolution-dependent. theevacuation of angular momentum from the main stellar body is largely missed atstandard resolution, and systems that should be slow rotators are then found tobe fast rotators. the effect is most important for gas-rich mergers, but isalso witnessed in mergers with an absent or modest gas component. the effect isrobust with respect to our initial conditions and interaction orbits, andoriginates in the physical treatment of the relaxation process during thecoalescence of the galaxies. our findings show that a high-enough resolution isrequired to accurately model the global properties of merger remnants and theevolution of their angular momentum. the role of gas-rich mergers of spiralgalaxies in the formation of slow-rotating ellipticals may therefore have beenunderestimated.

1102.0911	investigating the merger origin of early-type galaxies using ultra-deep  optical images	the mass assembly of galaxies leaves various imprints on their surroundings,such as shells, streams and tidal tails. the frequency and properties of thesefine structures depend on the mechanism driving the mass assembly: e.g. amonolithic collapse, rapid cold-gas accretion followed by violent diskinstabilities, minor mergers or major dry / wet mergers. therefore, by studyingthe outskirts of galaxies, one can learn about their main formation mechanism.i present here our on-going work to characterize the outskirts of early-typegalaxies (etgs), which are powerful probes at low redshift of the hierarchicalmass assembly of galaxies. this work relies on ultra-deep optical imagesobtained at cfht with the wide-field of view megacam camera of field andcluster etgs obtained as part of the atlas-3d and ngvs projects. state of theart numerical simulations are used to interpret the data. the images reveal awealth of unknown faint structures at levels as faint as 29 mag arcsec-2 in theg-band. initial results for two galaxies are presented here.

1102.1922	molecular gas and star formation in local early-type galaxies	the molecular gas content of local early-type galaxies is constrained anddiscussed in relation to their evolution. first, as part of the atlas3d survey,we present the first complete, large (260 objects), volume-limited single-dishsurvey of co in normal local early-type galaxies. we find a surprisingly highdetection rate of 22%, independent of luminosity and at best weakly dependenton environment. second, the extent of the molecular gas is constrained with cosynthesis imaging, and a variety of morphologies is revealed. the kinematics ofthe molecular gas and stars are often misaligned, implying an external gasorigin in over a third of the systems, although this behaviour is drasticallydiffferent between field and cluster environments. third, many objects appearto be in the process of forming regular kpc-size decoupled disks, and a starformation sequence can be sketched by piecing together multi-wavelengthinformation on the molecular gas, current star formation, and young stars.last, early-type galaxies do not seem to systematically obey all our usualprejudices regarding star formation, following the standard schmidt-kennicuttlaw but not the far infrared-radio correlation. this may suggest a greaterdiversity in star formation processes than observed in disk galaxies. usingmultiple molecular tracers, we are thus starting to probe the physicalconditions of the cold gas in early-types.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1105.4076	the atlas3d project - vi. simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the  link with fast rotators, slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies through mergers with a sampleof 70 high-resolution (softening length &lt; 60 pc and 12*10^6 particles)numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies and 16 simulations ofetg remergers. these simulations, designed to accompany observations and modelsconducted within the atlas3d project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. the progenitor discgalaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of sb and scgalaxies. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the atlas3dcriterion (based on the lambda_r parameter): they preserve the structure of theinput fast rotating spiral progenitors. they have intrinsic ellipticitieslarger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_r values between 0.2 and 0.6, withinthe range of observed fast rotators. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the fast rotators produced inmajor mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and0.6. most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. besides a handful ofspecific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators inthe nearby universe. the mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamentalparameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but italso requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (sb) progenitor galaxywith respect to the orbital angular momentum.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

0704.3050	optical bvi imaging and hi synthesis observations of the dwarf irregular  galaxy eso 364-g 029	as part of an effort to enlarge the number of well-studied magellanic-typegalaxies, we obtained broadband optical imaging and neutral hydrogen radiosynthesis observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy eso 364-g 029. the opticalmorphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sidedspiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offsetphotometric and kinematic centers. the hi distribution is mildly asymmetricand, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows theoptical brightness distribution, extending to over 1.2 holmberg radii (wheremu_b = 26.5 mag/arcsec^2). in particular, the highest hi column densitiesclosely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. therotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the opticalextent. the total hi flux f_hi = 23.1 pm 1.2 jy km/s, yielding a total hi massm_hi= (6.4 pm 1.7) x 10^8 msun (for a distance d = 10.8 pm 1.4 mpc) and a totalhi mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio m_hi/l_b = (0.96 pm 0.14) msun / lsun,b(distance independent). the hi data suggest a very complex small-scale histructure, with evidence of large shells and/or holes, but deeper observationsare required for a detailed study. follow-up observations are also desirablefor a proper comparison with the large magellanic cloud, where despite anoptical morphology very similar to eso 364-g 029 the hi bears littleresemblance to the optical.

1111.5011	a dynamical n-body model for the central region of $\omega$ centauri	supermassive black holes (smbhs) are fundamental keys to understand theformation and evolution of their host galaxies. however, the formation andgrowth of smbhs are not yet well understood. one of the proposed formationscenarios is the growth of smbhs from seed intermediate-mass black holes(imbhs, 10^2 to 10^5 m_{\odot}) formed in star clusters. in this context, andalso with respect to the low mass end of the m-sigma relation for galaxies,globular clusters are in a mass range that make them ideal systems to look forimbhs. among galactic star clusters, the massive cluster $\omega$ centauri is aspecial target due to its central high velocity dispersion and also itsmultiple stellar populations. we study the central structure and dynamics ofthe star cluster $\omega$ centauri to examine whether an imbh is necessary toexplain the observed velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles. weperform direct n-body simulations to follow the dynamical evolution of $\omega$centauri. the simulations are compared to the most recent data-sets in order toexplain the present-day conditions of the cluster and to constrain the initialconditions leading to the observed profiles. we find that starting fromisotropic spherical multi-mass king models and within our canonicalassumptions, a model with a central imbh mass of 2% of the cluster stellarmass, i.e. a 5x10^4 m_{\odot} imbh, provides a satisfactory fit to both theobserved shallow cusp in surface brightness and the continuous rise towards thecenter of the radial velocity dispersion profile. in our isotropic sphericalmodels, the predicted proper motion dispersion for the best-fit model is thesame as the radial velocity dispersion one.

1112.3641	the atlas3d project -- xi. dense molecular gas properties of co-luminous  early-type galaxies	surveying eighteen 12co-bright galaxies from the atlas3d early-type galaxysample with the institut de radio astronomie millim\'etrique (iram) 30mtelescope, we detect 13co(1-0) and 13co(2-1) in all eighteen galaxies, hcn(1-0)in 12/18 and hco+(1-0) in 10/18. we find that the line ratios12co(1-0)/13co(1-0) and 12co(1-0)/hcn(1-0) are clearly correlated with severalgalaxy properties: total stellar mass, luminosity-weighted mean stellar age,molecular to atomic gas ratio, dust temperature and dust morphology. we suggestthat these correlations are primarily governed by the optical depth in the 12colines; interacting, accreting and/or starbursting early-type galaxies have moreoptically thin molecular gas while those with settled dust and gas discs hostoptically thick molecular gas. the ranges of the integrated line intensityratios generally overlap with those of spirals, although we note some outliersin the 12co(1- 0)/13co(1-0), 12co(2-1)/13co(2-1) and hcn/hco+(1-0) ratios. inparticular, three galaxies are found to have very low 12co(1-0)/13co(1-0) and12co(2-1)/13co(2-1) ratios. such low ratios may signal particularly stablemolecular gas which creates stars less efficiently than 'normal' (i.e. belowschmidt-kennicutt prediction), consistent with the low dust temperatures seenin these galaxies.

1201.0885	simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the link with fast rotators,  slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies (etgs) through mergers with asample of 70 high-resolution numerical simulations of binary mergers of discgalaxies. these simulations encompass various mass ratios, initial conditionsand orbital parameters. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with massratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators accordingto the atlas3d criterion: they preserve the structure of the input fastrotating spiral progenitors. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1)lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the slow rotators hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. the mass ratio of theprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators inbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitorgalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. the importance of theinitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxymergers of the galmer project.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

0711.1775	the shape of the dark matter halo in the early-type galaxy ngc 2974	we present hi observations of the elliptical galaxy ngc 2974, obtained withthe very large array. these observations reveal that the previously detected hidisc in this galaxy (kim et al. 1988) is in fact a ring. by studying theharmonic expansion of the velocity field along the ring, we constrain theelongation of the halo and find that the underlying gravitational potential isconsistent with an axisymmetric shape.  we construct mass models of ngc 2974 by combining the hi rotation curve withthe central kinematics of the ionised gas, obtained with the integral-fieldspectrograph sauron. we introduce a new way of correcting the observedvelocities of the ionised gas for asymmetric drift, and hereby disentangle therandom motions of the gas caused by gravitational interaction from those causedby turbulence. to reproduce the observed flat rotation curve of the hi gas, weneed to include a dark halo in our mass models. a pseudo-isothermal sphereprovides the best model to fit our data, but we also tested an nfw halo andmodified newtonian dynamics (mond), which fit the data marginally worse.  the mass-to-light ratio m/l_i increases in ngc 2974 from 4.3 (m/l_i)sun atone effective radius to 8.5 (m/l_i)sun at 5 re. this increase of m/l alreadysuggests the presence of dark matter: we find that within 5 re at least 55 percent of the total mass is dark.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1207.5799	gemini gmos and wht sauron integral-field spectrograph observations of  the agn driven outflow in ngc 1266	we use the sauron and gmos integral field spectrographs to observe the activegalactic nucleus (agn) powered outflow in ngc 1266. this unusual galaxy isrelatively nearby (d=30 mpc), allowing us to investigate the process of agnfeedback in action. we present maps of the kinematics and line strengths of theionised gas emission lines halpha, hbeta, [oiii], [oi], [nii] and [sii], andreport on the detection of sodium d absorption. we use these tracers to explorethe structure of the source, derive the ionised and atomic gas kinematics andinvestigate the gas excitation and physical conditions. ngc 1266 contains twoionised gas components along most lines of sight, tracing the ongoing outflowand a component closer to the galaxy systemic, the origin of which is unclear.this gas appears to be disturbed by a nascent agn jet. we confirm that theoutflow in ngc 1266 is truly multiphase, containing radio plasma, atomic,molecular and ionised gas and x-ray emitting plasma. the outflow has velocitiesup to \pm900 km/s away from the systemic velocity, and is very likely to beremoving significant amounts of cold gas from the galaxy. the liner-likeline-emission in ngc 1266 is extended, and likely arises from fast shockscaused by the interaction of the radio jet with the ism. these shocks havevelocities of up to 800 km/s, which match well with the observed velocity ofthe outflow. sodium d equivalent width profiles are used to set constraints onthe size and orientation of the outflow. the ionised gas morphology correlateswith the nascent radio jets observed in 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz continuum emission,supporting the suggestion that an agn jet is providing the energy required todrive the outflow.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.3441	quenching of star formation in molecular outflow host ngc 1266	we detail the rich molecular story of ngc 1266, its serendipitous discoverywithin the atlas3d survey (cappellari et al. 2011) and how it plays host to anagn-driven molecular outflow, potentially quenching all of its star formation(sf) within the next 100 myr. while major mergers appear to play a role ininstigating outflows in other systems, deep imaging of ngc 1266 as well asstellar kinematic observations from sauron, have failed to provide evidencethat ngc 1266 has recently been involved in a major interaction. the moleculargas and the instantaneous sf tracers indicate that the current sites of starformation are located in a hypercompact disk within 200 pc of the nucleus (fig.1; sf rate ~ 2 msuns/yr). on the other hand, tracers of recent star formation,such as the h{\beta} absorption map from sauron and stellar population analysisshow that the young stars are distributed throughout a larger area of thegalaxy than current star formation. as the agn at the center of ngc 1266continues to drive cold gas out of the galaxy, we expect star formation ratesto decline as the star formation is ultimately quenched. thus, ngc 1266 is inthe midst of a key portion of its evolution and continued studies of thisunique galaxy may help improve our understanding of how galaxies transitionfrom the blue to the red sequence (alatalo et al. 2011).

1211.4615	the atlas3d project - xxi. correlations between gradients of local  escape velocity and stellar populations in early-type galaxies	we explore the connection between the local escape velocity, v_esc, and thestellar population properties in the atlas3d survey, a complete, volume-limitedsample of nearby early-type galaxies. we make use of ugriz photometry toconstruct multi-gaussian expansion models of the surface brightnesses of ourgalaxies. we are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profilesfound in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results ofstate-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. weutilise these photometric models and sauron integral-field spectroscopy,combined with jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local v_esc derivedfrom the surface brightness. we find that the local v_esc is tightly correlatedwith the mgb and fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlatedwith the hbeta linestrength. in the case of the mgb and colour - v_escrelations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows theglobal relation between different galaxies. we intentionally ignored anyuncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empiricaldescription of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that isideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. we identify apopulation of galaxies that occur only at low v_esc that exhibit negativegradients in the mgb - and colour -v_esc relations. these galaxies typicallyhave young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts ofmolecular gas and dust. combining these results with n-body simulations ofbinary mergers we use the mgb-v_esc relation to constrain the possible numberof dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - atypical massive etg can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers beforebecoming a significant outlier in the mgb-v_esc relation.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1310.7588	detection of a high brightness temperature radio core in the agn-driven  molecular outflow candidate ngc 1266	we present new high spatial resolution karl g. jansky very large array (vla)hi absorption and very long baseline array (vlba) continuum observations of theactive galactic nucleus (agn)-driven molecular outflow candidate ngc 1266.although other well-known systems with molecular outflows may be driven by starformation in a central molecular disk, the molecular mass outflow rate reportedin alatalo et al. (2011) in ngc 1266 of 13 m$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$ exceeds starformation rate estimates from a variety of tracers. this suggests that anadditional energy source, such as an agn, may play a significant role inpowering the outflow. our high spatial resolution hi absorption data revealcompact absorption against the radio continuum core co-located with theputative agn, and the presence of a blueshifted spectral component re-affirmsthat gas is indeed flowing out of the system. our vlba observations at 1.65 ghzreveal one continuum source within the densest portion of the molecular gas,with a diameter d &lt; 8 mas (1.2 pc), a radio power $p_{\mathrm{rad}}$ = 1.48$\times$ 10$^{20}$ w hz$^{-1}$, and a brightness temperature $t_{\mathrm{b}}$ &gt;1.5 x 10$^7$ k that is most consistent with an agn origin. the radio continuumenergetics implied by the compact vlba source, as well as archival vlacontinuum observations at lower spatial resolution, further support thepossibility that the agn in ngc 1266 could be driving the molecular outflow.these findings suggest that even low-level agns may be able to launch massiveoutflows in their host galaxies.

1311.0284	the atlas$^{\rm{3d}}$ project - xxv: two-dimensional kinematic analysis  of simulated galaxies and the cosmological origin of fast and slow rotators	we present a detailed two-dimensional stellar dynamical analysis of a sampleof 44 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of individual central galaxiesand their satellites. kinematic maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity,velocity dispersion, and higher-order gauss-hermite moments $h_3$ and $h_4$ areconstructed for each central galaxy and for the most massive satellites. theamount of rotation is quantified using the $\lambda_{\mathrm{r}}$-parameter.the velocity, velocity dispersion, $h_3$, and $h_4$ fields of the simulatedgalaxies show a diversity similar to observed kinematic maps of early-typegalaxies in the atlas$^{\rm{3d}}$ survey. this includes fast (regular), slow,and misaligned rotation, hot spheroids with embedded cold disk components aswell as galaxies with counter-rotating cores or central depressions in thevelocity dispersion. we link the present day kinematic properties to theindividual cosmological formation histories of the galaxies. in general, majorgalaxy mergers have a significant influence on the rotation propertiesresulting in both a spin-down as well as a spin-up of the merger remnant. lowermass galaxies with significant in-situ formation of stars, or with additionalgas-rich major mergers - resulting in a spin-up - in their formation history,form elongated fast rotators with a clear anti-correlation of $h_3$ and$v/\sigma$. an additional formation path for fast rotators includes gas poormajor mergers leading to a spin-up of the remnants. this formation path doesnot result in anti-correlated $h_3$ and $v/\sigma$. the galaxies mostconsistent with the rare class of non-rotating round early-type galaxies growby gas-poor minor mergers alone. in general, more massive galaxies have lessin-situ star formation since $z \sim 2$, rotate slower and have older stellarpopulations.

1312.6318	the atlas3d project -- xxvii. cold gas and the colours and ages of  early-type galaxies	we present a study of the cold gas contents of the atlas3d early-typegalaxies, in the context of their optical colours, near-uv colours, and h\beta\absorption line strengths. early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies arenot as gas-poor as previously thought, and at least 40% of local early-typegalaxies are now known to contain molecular and/or atomic gas. this cold gasoffers the opportunity to study recent galaxy evolution through the processesof cold gas acquisition, consumption (star formation), and removal. molecularand atomic gas detection rates range from 10% to 34% in red sequence early-typegalaxies, depending on how the red sequence is defined, and from 50% to 70% inblue early-type galaxies. notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies(stellar masses &gt; 5e10 msun, derived from dynamical models) are found to havehi masses up to m(hi)/mstar ~ 0.06 and h_2 masses up to m(h$_2$)/mstar ~ 0.01.some 20% of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/ormolecular gas through their transition to the red sequence. however, kinematicand metallicity signatures of external gas accretion (either from satellitegalaxies or the intergalactic medium) are also common, particularly at stellarmasses &lt;= 5e10 msun, where such signatures are found in ~ 50% of h$_2$-richearly-type galaxies. our data are thus consistent with a scenario in which fastrotator early-type galaxies are quenched former spiral galaxies which haveundergone some bulge growth processes, and in addition, some of them alsoexperience cold gas accretion which can initiate a period of modest starformation activity. we discuss implications for the interpretation ofcolour-magnitude diagrams.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1410.4556	suppression of star formation in ngc 1266	ngc1266 is a nearby lenticular galaxy that harbors a massive outflow ofmolecular gas powered by the mechanical energy of an active galactic nucleus(agn). it has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation (sf) intheir host galaxies, providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxyformation. previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremelyrare, high power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback ontheir hosts. here we present detailed observations of the gas and dustcontinuum of ngc1266 at millimeter wavelengths. our observations show thatmolecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at $\dot{m}_{\rm out}\approx 110 m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, of which the vast majority cannot escape thenucleus. only 2 $m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is actually capable of escaping the galaxy.most of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars.the far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact ($\lesssim50$pc)source that could either be powered by an agn or by an ultra-compact starburst.the ratio of the sf surface density ($\sigma_{\rm sfr}$) to the gas surfacedensity ($\sigma_{\rm h_2}$) indicates that sf is suppressed by a factor of$\approx 50$ compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is formingstars, and $\approx$150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if thecentral region is is powered by an ultra-compact starburst. the agn-driven bulkoutflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering thefragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through aprocess of turbulent injection. this result suggests that even relativelycommon, low-power agns are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxiesas their black holes grow onto the m-$\sigma$ relation.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1509.04707	kmos view of the galactic centre i. young stars are centrally  concentrated	the galactic centre hosts a crowded, dense nuclear star cluster with ahalf-light radius of 4 pc. most of the stars in the galactic centre are coollate-type stars, but there are also &gt;100 hot early-type stars in the centralparsec of the milky way. these stars are only 3-8 myr old. our knowledge of thenumber and distribution of early-type stars in the galactic centre isincomplete. only a few spectroscopic observations have been made beyond aprojected distance of 0.5 pc of the galactic centre. the distribution andkinematics of early-type stars are essential to understand the formation andgrowth of the nuclear star cluster. we cover the central &gt;4pc^2 of the galacticcentre using the integral-field spectrograph kmos. we extracted more than 1,000spectra from individual stars and identified early-type stars based on theirspectra. our data set contains 114 bright early-type stars: 6 have narrowemission lines, 23 are wolf-rayet stars, 9 stars have featureless spectra, and76 are o/b type stars. our wide-field spectroscopic data confirm that thedistribution of young stars is compact, with 90% of the young stars identifiedwithin 0.5 pc of the nucleus. we identify 24 new o/b stars primarily at largeradii. we estimate photometric masses of the o/b stars and show that the totalmass in the young population is &gt;12,000m_sun. the o/b stars all appear to bebound to the milky way nuclear star cluster, while less than 30% belong to theclockwise rotating disk. the central concentration of the early-type stars is astrong argument that they have formed in situ. a large part of the young o/bstars is not on the disk, which either means that the early-type stars did notall form on the same disk or that the disk is dissolving rapidly.

0807.1505	the sauron project - xii. kinematic substructures in early-type  galaxies: evidence for disks in fast rotators	[abridged] we analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxiesobtained with the sauron and oasis integral-field spectrographs usingkinemetry, a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher order momentsof the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd). in the sauron sample, wefind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of themulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest havingthree. in addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. we find that the velocitymaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in thetransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. in terms of e/s0classification, this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components withdisk-like kinematics. for the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axialratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary towhat is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations.the position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly inslow rotators. velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similarto the distribution of light. we constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - v/sigmaand h4 - v/sigma diagrams from sauron observations. we confirm the classicalanti-correlation of h3 and v\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero insome objects or even weakly correlated with v/sigma. the distribution of h4 forfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. the difference betweenslow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the losvd, withevidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likelydifferent evolutionary paths.

astro-ph;0008156	triaxial haloes and particle dark matter detection	this paper presents the properties of a family of scale-free triaxial haloes.we adduce arguments to suggest that the velocity ellipsoids of such models arealigned in conical coordinates. we provide an algorithm to find the set ofconically aligned velocity second moments that support a given density againstthe gravity field of the halo. the case of the logarithmic ellipsoidal model --the simplest triaxial generalisation of the familiar isothermal sphere -- isexamined in detail. the velocity dispersions required to hold up theself-consistent model are analytic. the velocity distribution of the darkmatter can be approximated as a triaxial gaussian with semiaxes equal to thevelocity dispersions. there are roughly twenty experiments worldwide that aresearching for evidence of scarce interactions between weakly-interactingmassive-particle dark matter (wimps) and detector nuclei. the annual modulationsignal, caused by the earth's rotation around the sun, is a crucialdiscriminant between wimp events and the background. the greatest rate is injune, the least in december. we compute the differential detection rate forenergy deposited by the rare wimp-nucleus interactions in our logarithmicellipsoidal halo models. triaxiality and velocity anisotropy change the totalrate by up to 40 %, and have a substantial effect on the amplitude of theannual modulation signal. the overall rate is greatest, but the amplitude ofthe modulation is weakest, in our radially anisotropic halo models. even thesign of the signal can be changed. restricting attention to low energy events,the models predict that the maximum rate occurs in december, and not in june.

(i) we find that the runaway star zetaophiuchi and the pulsar psr j1932+1059 originated about 1 myr ago in asupernova explosion in a binary in the upper scorpius subgroup of the sco ob2association. the pulsar received a kick velocity of about 350 km/s in thisevent, which dissociated the binary, and gave zeta oph its large spacevelocity. (ii) blaauw &amp; morgan and gies &amp; bolton already postulated a commonorigin for the runaway-pair ae aur and mu col, possibly involving the massivehighly-eccentric binary iota ori, based on their equal and opposite velocities.we demonstrate that these three objects indeed occupied a very small volume\sim 2.5myr ago, and show that they were ejected from the nascent trapeziumcluster.  we identify the parent group for two more pulsars: both likely originate inthe 50 myr old association per ob3, which contains the open cluster alphapersei. at least 21 of the 56 runaway stars in our sample can be linked to thenearby associations and young open clusters. these include the classicalrunaways 53 arietis (ori ob1), xi persei (per ob2), and lambda cephei (cepob3), and fifteen new identifications, amongst which a pair of stars runningaway in opposite directions from the region containing the lambda ori cluster.other currently nearby runaways and pulsars originated beyond 700 pc, where ourknowledge of the parent groups is very incomplete.

(2.) the large observed range of the strength of the nuclearstellar cusps seen in the hst optical study of spiral galaxies reflects aphysical difference between galaxies, and is not an artifact caused by nucleardust and/or recent star formation. (3.) the dichotomy between $r^{1/4}$ bulges,with steep nuclear stellar cusps $&lt;\gamma &gt; \sim 1$, and exponential bulges,with shallow nuclear stellar cusps $&lt;\gamma &gt; &lt; 0.3$, is also not an artifactof the effects of dust or recent star formation.

astro-ph;0201086	a sauron study of m32: measuring the intrinsic flattening and the  central black hole mass	we present dynamical models of the nearby compact elliptical galaxy m32,using high quality kinematical measurements, obtained with the integral-fieldspectrograph sauron mounted on the william herschel telescope on la palma. wealso include stis data obtained by joseph et al. we find a best-fit black holemass of (2.5 +/- 0.5) million solar masses and a stellar i-band mass-to-lightratio of (1.85 +/- 0.15) in solar units. for the first time, we are also ableto constrain the inclination along which m32 is observed to (70 +/- 5) degrees.combined with an averaged observed flattening of 0.73, this corresponds to anintrinsic flattening of approximately 0.68 +/- 0.03.  these tight constraints are mainly caused by the use of integral-field data.we show this quantitatively by comparing with models that are constrained bymultiple slits only. we show the phase-space distribution and intrinsicvelocity structure of the best-fit model and investigate the effect ofregularisation on the orbit distribution.

astro-ph;0301070	a sauron view of galaxies	we have measured the two-dimensional kinematics and line-strengthdistributions of 72 representative nearby early-type galaxies, out toapproximately one effective radius, with our panoramic integral-fieldspectrograph sauron. the resulting maps reveal a rich variety in kinematicalstructures and linestrength distributions, indicating that early-type galaxiesare more complex systems than often assumed. we are building detailed dynamicalmodels for these galaxies, to derive their intrinsic shape and dynamicalstructure, and to determine the mass of the supermassive central black hole.here we focus on two examples, the compact elliptical m32 and the e3 galaxyngc4365. these objects represent two extreme cases: m32 has very regularkinematics which can be represented accurately by an axisymmetric model inwhich all stars rotate around the short axis, while ngc4365 is a triaxialgalaxy with a prominent kinematically decoupled core, with an inner core thatrotates about an axis that is nearly perpendicular to the rotation axis of themain body of the galaxy. our dynamical models for these objects demonstratethat two-dimensional observations are essential for deriving the intrinsicorbital structure and dark matter content of galaxies.

astro-ph;0302172	general solution of the jeans equations for triaxial galaxies with  separable potentials	the jeans equations relate the second-order velocity moments to the densityand potential of a stellar system. for general three-dimensional stellarsystems, there are three equations and six independent moments. by assumingthat the potential is triaxial and of separable staeckel form, the mixedmoments vanish in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates. consequently, the threejeans equations and three remaining non-vanishing moments form a closed systemof three highly-symmetric coupled first-order partial differential equations inthree variables. these equations were first derived by lynden-bell, over 40years ago, but have resisted solution by standard methods. we present thegeneral solution here.  we consider the two-dimensional limiting cases first. we solve their jeansequations by a new method which superposes singular solutions. the singularsolutions, which are new, are standard riemann-green functions. thetwo-dimensional solutions are applied to non-axisymmetric discs, oblate andprolate spheroids, and also to the scale-free triaxial limit. we then extendthe method of singular solutions to the triaxial case, and obtain a fullsolution. the general solution can be expressed in terms of complete(hyper)elliptic integrals which can be evaluated in a straightforward way, andprovides the full set of second moments which can support a triaxial densitydistribution in a separable triaxial potential.

astro-ph;0402456	deep sauron spectral-imaging of the diffuse lyman-alpha halo lab1 in  ssa22	we have used the sauron panoramic integral field spectrograph to study thestructure of the ly-alpha emission-line halo, lab1, surrounding thesub-millimeter galaxy smm j221726+0013. this emission-line halo was discoveredduring a narrow-band imaging survey of the z=3.1 large-scale structure in thessa22 region. our observations trace the emission halo out to almost 100 kpcfrom the sub-millimeter source and identify two distinct ly-alpha `mini-haloes'around the nearby lyman-break galaxies. the main emission region has a broadline profile, with variations in the line profile seeming chaotic and lackingevidence for a coherent velocity structure. the data also suggests thatly-alpha emission is suppressed around the sub-mm source. interpretation of theline structure needs care because ly-alpha may be resonantly scattered, leadingto complex radiative transfer effects, and we suggest that the suppression inthis region arises because of such effects. we compare the structure of thecentral emission-line halo with local counter-parts, and find that the emissionline halo around ngc 1275 in the perseus cluster may be a good local analogue,although the high redshift halo is factor of ~100 more luminous and appears tohave higher velocity broadening. around the lyman-break galaxy c15, theemission line is narrower, and a clear shear in the emission wavelength isseen. a plausible explanation for the line profile is that the emission gas isexpelled from c15 in a bipolar outflow, similar to that seen in m82.

astro-ph;0507315	the discovery of a galaxy-wide superwind from a young massive galaxy at  redshift z~3	high-velocity galactic outflows, driven by intense bursts of star formationand black hole accretion, are invoked by current theories of galaxy formationto terminate star formation in the most massive galaxies and to deposit heavyelements in the intergalactic medium. from existing observational evidence onhigh-redshift galaxies, it is unclear whether such outflows are localized toregions of intense star formation just a few kiloparsecs in extent, or whetherthey instead have a significant impact on the entire galaxy and itssurroundings. here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of a star-forminggalaxy at redshift z=3.09 (seen 11.5 gyr ago, when the universe was 20 per centof its current age): its spatially extended ly-alpha emission appears to beabsorbed by hi in a foreground screen covering the entire galaxy, with alateral extent of at least 100 kpc and remarkable velocity coherence. it wasplausibly ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 1e8 yr earlier andhas subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium andcooled. this demonstrates the galaxy-wide impact of high-redshift superwinds.

astro-ph;0509227	radial velocities in the globular cluster omega centauri	we have used the argus multi-object spectrometer at the ctio 4m blancotelescope to obtain 2756 radial velocity measurements for 1966 individual starsin the globular cluster omega centauri brighter than blue photographicmagnitude of about 16.5. of these, 1589 stars are cluster members. a comparisonwith two independent radial velocity studies, carried out by suntzeff &amp; kraftand by mayor et al., demonstrates that the median error of our measurements isbelow 2 km/s for the stars brighter than b-magnitude 15, which constitute thebulk of the sample. the observed velocity dispersion decreases from about 15km/s in the inner few arcmin to about 6 km/s at a radius of 25 arcmin. thecluster shows significant rotation, with a maximum amplitude of about 6 km/s inthe radial zone between 6 and 10 arcmin. in a companion paper by van de ven etal., we correct these radial velocities for the perspective rotation caused bythe space motion of the cluster, and combine them with the internal propermotions of nearly 8000 cluster members measured by van leeuwen et al., toconstruct a detailed dynamical model of omega centauri and to measure itsdistance.

astro-ph;9403051	the orion ob1 association i. stellar content	walraven photometry of established and probable members of the orion ob1association is presented. effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosityand mass are derived for all stars, using atmosphere models by kurucz (1979).absolute magnitudes are calculated using the straizys and kuriliene (1981)tables. distance moduli and visual extinctions are determined. a comparison ofthe visual extinctions to iras $100\um$ data shows that the near edge of theorion a and b clouds lies at a distance of $\sim 320\pc$, while the far edge isat $\sim 500\pc$. a method for deriving the ages of the subgroups by comparingtheoretical isochrones to the observations in the log g, log t plane ispresented. the derived ages suggest, contrary to earlier studies, that subgroup1b is younger than 1c, which can possibly be explained by past geometries ofthe system of stars and gas. the initial mass function for orion ob1 is derivedwith the aid of the kolmogorov-smirnoff test. through extensive simulations, weshow that it is very difficult to derive accurately the imf from the availabledata. to within somewhat weak limits the imf is found to be of the form $\xi(\log m)=am^{-1.7\pm 0.2}$ for all subgroups. the energy output of thesubgroups in the form of stellar winds and supernovae is calculated andcompared to the observed size and expansion velocity of the orion-eridanusbubble. it is shown that the energy output of the association can account forthe morphology and kinematics of the ism.

astro-ph;9412067	axisymmetric galaxy models wth central bhs, with an application to m32	the contour integral method of hunter &amp; qian is applied to axisymmetricgalaxy models in which the distribution function (df) is of the formf=f(e,l_z), where e and l_z are the classical integrals of motion in anaxisymmetric potential. a practical way to construct the unique even part ofthe df for such systems is presented. it is applied to models, both oblate andprolate, in which the mass density is stratified on similar concentricspheroids.  the spheroids with scale-free densities are discussed in detail. theseprovide useful approximations to the behaviour of more realistic models in thelimit of small and large radii. the self-consistent case is treated, as well asthe case in which there are additional contributions to the potential from acentral black hole or dark halo. the range of axis ratios and density profileslopes is determined for which spheroidal power--law cusps with a central blackhole have a physical two--integral df.  more generally, the f(e,l_z) dfs are discussed for a set of spheroidal`(alpha,beta)-models', characterized by a power-law density cusp with slopealpha at small radii, and a power-law density fall-off with slope [alpha + 2beta] at large radii. as an application, the df is constructed for the(alpha,beta) model with a 1.8 x 10^6 solar mass black hole used by van dermarel et al. to interpret their high spatial resolution spectroscopic data form32. the results confirm that the model fits the observed line-of-sightvelocity profiles remarkably well. the model is used to calculate predictionsfor future spectroscopic observations with the hst.

astro-ph;9501054	velocity profiles of osipkov-merritt models	a simple algorithm is presented for the calculation of the projectedline-of-sight velocity profiles (vps) of non-rotating anisotropic sphericalstellar dynamical models with a phase-space distribution function of theosipkov-merritt type. the velocity distribution in these models is isotropicinside the anisotropy radius r_a and becomes increasingly radially biased atlarger radii. vp shape parameters are presented for a family of models in whichthe luminous mass density has an r^{-gamma} power-law cusp at small radii andan r^{-4} power-law fall-off at large radii. self-consistent models and modelsin which the luminous matter is embedded in a dark halo are discussed. theeffects of changes in the cusp slope gamma and in the anisotropy radius r_a aredocumented, and the area in the (gamma,r_a)-plane that contains physical modelsis delineated. the shapes of the vps of the models show a considerable (andobservable) variation with projected galactocentric radius. these models willbe useful for interpreting the data on the vp shapes of elliptical galaxiesthat are now becoming available.

astro-ph;9509113	three-integral oblate galaxy models	a simple numerical scheme is presented for the construction of three-integralphase-space distribution functions for oblate galaxy models with agravitational potential of st\"{a}ckel form, and an arbitrary axisymmetricluminous density distribution. the intrinsic velocity moments can be obtainedsimultaneously with little extra effort. the distribution of the inner andouter turning points of the short-axis tube orbits that are populated can bespecified freely, and is chosen in advance. the entire distribution function isthen derived from the density by an iterative scheme that starts from theexplicitly known distribution function of the thin-orbit (maximum streaming)model, in which only the tubes with equal inner and outer turning points arepopulated. the versatility and limitations of this scheme are illustrated bythe construction of a number of self-consistent three-integral flattenedisochrone models of kuzmin--kutuzov type, and by investigation of special caseswhere the scheme is tractable analytically. this includes the behaviour of thedistribution functions in the outer regions of the models. the scheme convergesrapidly for models containing orbits with ratios of the outer to inner turningpoint as large as ten, and is particularly suited for the construction oftangentially anisotropic flattened models, self-consistent as well asnon-consistent. the algorithm simplifies in the disk and spherical limit, andcan be generalized to triaxial models.

astro-ph;9512082	jeans and boltzmann solutions for oblate galaxies with flat rotation  curves	a general solution of the jeans equations for oblate scale-free logarithmicpotentials is given. this provides all possible second velocity moments thatcan hold up a stellar population of flattened scale-free density against thegravity field. a two-parameter subset of second moments for the self-consistentdensity of binney's model is examined in detail. these solutions have thedesirable property that the observable dispersions in the radial and propermotions can be given explicitly. in the spherical limit, the potential of thesemodels reduces to that of the singular isothermal sphere. the jeans solutionsfor scale-free densities of arbitrary flattening that can correspond tophysical three-integral distribution functions are identified. the problem offinding distribution functions associated with the jeans solutions in flattenedscale-free logarithmic potentials is then investigated for binney's model. anapproximate solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation is found whichprovides a third (partial) integral of good accuracy for thin and near-thintube orbits. it is a modification of the total angular momentum. this enablesthe construction of many simple three-integral distribution functions. thekinematic properties of these approximate dfs are shown to agree with a subsetof the jeans solutions --- which are thereby confirmed as good approximationsto physical solutions.

astro-ph;9611162	simple three-integral scale-free galaxy models	the jeans equations give the second moments or stresses required to support astellar population against the gravity field. a general solution of the jeansequations for arbitrary axisymmetric scale-free densities in flattenedscale-free potentials is given. a two-parameter subset of the solution for thesecond moments for the self-consistent density of the power-law models, whichhave exactly spheroidal equipotentials, is examined in detail. in the sphericallimit, the potential of these models reduces to that of the singular power-lawspheres. we build the physical three-integral distribution functions thatcorrespond to the flattened stellar components. next, we attack the problem offinding distribution functions associated with the jeans solutions in flattenedscale-free potentials. the third or partial integral introduced by de zeeuw,evans and schwarzschild for binney's model is generalised to thin and near-thinorbits moving in arbitrary axisymmetric scale-free potentials. the partialintegral is a modification of the total angular momentum. for theself-consistent power-law models, we show how this enables the construction ofsimple three-integral distribution functions. the connexion between theseapproximate distribution functions and the jeans solutions is discussed in somedetail.

astro-ph;9702106	new evidence for a massive black hole at the centre of the quiescent  galaxy m32	massive black holes are thought to reside at the centres of many galaxies,where they power quasars and active galactic nuclei. but most galaxies arequiescent, indicating that any central massive black hole present will bestarved of fuel and therefore detectable only through its gravitationalinfluence on the motions of the surrounding stars. m32 is a nearby, quiescentelliptical galaxy in which the presence of a black hole has been suspected;however, the limited resolution of the observational data and the restrictedclasses of models used to interpret this data have made it difficult to ruleout alternative explanations, such as models with an anisotropic stellarvelocity distribution and no dark mass or models with a central concentrationof dark objects (for example, stellar remnants or brown dwarfs). here wepresent high-resolution optical hst spectra of m32, which show that the stellarvelocities near the centre of this galaxy exceed those inferred from previousground-based observations. we use a range of general dynamical models todetermine a central dark mass concentration of (3.4 +/- 1.6) x 10^6 solarmasses, contained within a region only 0.3 pc across. this leaves a massiveblack hole as the most plausible explanation of the data, thereby strengtheningthe view that such black holes exist even in quiescent galaxies.

astro-ph;9702147	improved evidence for a black hole in m32 from hst/fos spectra - i.  observations	we have obtained spectra through small apertures centered on the nuclearregion and major axis of m32, with the hst/fos. a detailed analysis andreduction of the data is presented, including: (i) new calibrations andmodeling of the fos aperture sizes, psf and line-spread-functions; (ii)determination of the aperture positioning for each observation; and (iii)accurate wavelength calibration, template matching, and kinematical analysis ofthe spectra. this yields measurements of the stellar rotation velocities andvelocity dispersions with five times higher spatial resolution than the bestavailable ground-based data. the inferred velocities provide the highestangular resolution stellar kinematical data obtained to date for any stellarsystem.  the observations show a steeper rotation curve and higher central velocitydispersion than ground-based data. the rotation velocity is observed to be 30km/s at 0.1" from the nucleus; roughly twice the value measured from the groundat this distance. the nuclear dispersion measured through the smallest fosaperture (0.068" square) is 156 +/- 10 km/s. the average of four independentdispersion measurements at various positions inside the central 0.1" is 126km/s, with a rms scatter of 21 km/s. the nuclear dispersion measured from theground is only 85-95 km/s, whereas the dispersion outside the central arcsec isonly 45-55 km/s. these results significantly strengthen previous arguments forthe presence of a massive nuclear black hole in m32. detailed dynamical modelsare presented in a series of companion papers.

astro-ph;9705081	improved evidence for a black hole in m32 from hst/fos spectra - ii.  axisymmetric dynamical models	axisymmetric dynamical models are constructed for the e3 galaxy m32 tointerpret high spatial resolution stellar kinematical hst data. models arestudied with two-integral phase-space distribution functions, and with fullygeneral three- integral distribution functions. the latter are built using anew extension of schwarzschild's orbit superposition approach. models areconstructed for inclinations of 90 and 55 degrees. no model without a nucleardark object can fit the combined ground-based and hst data, independent of thedynamical structure of m32. models with a nuclear dark object of 3.4 x 10^6solar masses do provide an excellent fit. the inclined models provide the bestfit, but the inferred dark mass does not depend sensitively on the assumedinclination. the models that best fit the data are not two-integral models, butlike two-integral models they are azimuthally anisotropic. an extended darkobject can fit the data only if its half-mass radius is r_h &lt; 0.08 arcsec(=0.26 pc), implying a central dark matter density exceeding 1 x 10^8 solarmasses / pc^3. this density is high enough to rule out most plausiblealternatives to a massive black hole. the dynamically inferred dark mass isidentical to that suggested by existing adiabatic black hole growth models forhst photometry of m32. the low activity of m32 implies either that only a verysmall fraction of the gas that is shed by evolving stars is accreted onto theblack hole, or that accretion proceeds at very low efficiency, e.g. in anadvection-dominated mode.

astro-ph;9707332	measuring non-axisymmetry in spiral galaxies	we present a method for measuring small deviations from axisymmetry of thepotential of a filled gas disk. the method is based on a higher order harmonicexpansion of the full velocity field of the disk. this expansion is made byfirst fitting a tilted-ring model to the velocity field of the gas disk andsubsequently expanding the velocity field along each ring into its harmonicterms. we use epicycle theory to derive equations for the harmonic terms in adistorted potential. the phase of each component of the distortion can varywith radius. we show that if the potential has a distortion of harmonic numberm, the velocity field as seen on the sky exhibits an m-1 and m+1 distortion. asis to be expected, the effects of a global elongation of the halo are similarto an m=2 spiral arm. the main difference is that the phase of the spiral armcan vary with radius. our method allows a measurement of epsilon_pot sin(2phi_2), where epsilon_pot is the elongation of the potential and phi_2 is oneof the viewing angles. using \hi data, one can probe the potential at radiibeyond the stellar disk, into the regime where dark matter is thought to be thedominant dynamical component. the method is applied the spiral galaxies ngc2403 and ngc 3198 and the harmonic terms are measured up to ninth order. wefind epsilon_pot sin(2 phi_2) to be 0.064 +/- 0.003 for ngc 2403 and 0.019 +/-0.003 for ngc 3198. more galaxies should be examined to separate viewing anglefrom elongation in a statistical way.

astro-ph;9809227	a hipparcos census of the nearby ob associations	a comprehensive census of the stellar content of the nearby ob associationsis presented, based on hipparcos positions, proper motions, and parallaxes.moving groups are identified by combining de bruijne's refurbished convergentpoint method with the `spaghetti method' of hoogerwerf &amp; aguilar. monte carlosimulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars.  astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distanceof ~650 pc. these are the 3 subgroups upper scorpius, upper centaurus lupus andlower centaurus crux of sco ob2, as well as vel ob2, tr 10, col 121, per ob2,alpha persei (per ob3), cas-tau, lac ob1, cep ob2, and a new group designatedas cep ob6. the selection procedure corrects the list of previously knownastrometric and photometric b- and a-type members, and identifies many newmembers, including a significant number of f stars, as well as evolved stars,e.g., the wolf-rayet stars gamma^2 vel (vel ob2) and ez cma (col 121), and theclassical cepheid delta cep in cep ob6. in the nearest associations thelater-type members include t tauri objects and other pre-main sequence stars.  astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of r cra, cma ob1, monob1, ori ob1, cam ob1, cep ob3, cep ob4, cyg ob4, cyg ob7, and sct ob2, isinconclusive, due to their large distance or unfavorable kinematics.  the mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smallerthan previous estimates. the mean motions display a systematic pattern, whichis discussed in relation to the gould belt. six of the 12 detected movinggroups do not appear in the classical list of nearby ob associations. thenumber of unbound young stellar groups in the solar neighbourhood may besignificantly larger than thought previously.

astro-ph;9909256	hst observations of nearby radio-loud early-type galaxies	we present and analyse hst/wfpc2 broad- and narrow-band observations of thecentral regions of 19 nearby radio-loud early-type galaxies. together with twomore galaxies they form a complete sample of fanaroff &amp; riley type i galaxies.we obtained v- and i-band images and narrow-band images centered on the\halphanii emission lines. we use archival data for six galaxies.  we describe the data reduction, give isophotal fits and analyse the centralemission-line gas and dust distributions. our main conclusions are thefollowing. although obscuration by dust inhibits a direct determination ofcentral cusp slopes, the data suggest most but not all galaxies have shallowcores. dust is detected in all but two galaxies. there is a wide variety ofcentral dust morphologies, ranging from central disks to lanes and irregulardistributions. the analysis suggests the difference between disks and lanes isintrinsic and not due to different viewing angles. central emission-line gas isdetected in all galaxies. extended low-surface-brightness emission is alwaysassociated with the dust features. in a subsequent paper we will present adetailed analysis of the relation between these central properties and thenuclear activity.

astro-ph;9912255	probing a regular orbit with spectral dynamics	we have extended the spectral dynamics formalism introduced by binney &amp;spergel, and have implemented a semi-analytic method to represent regularorbits in any potential, making full use of their regularity. we use thespectral analysis code of carpintero &amp; aguilar to determine the nature of anorbit (irregular, regular, resonant, periodic) from a short-time numericalintegration. if the orbit is regular, we approximate it by a truncated fouriertime series of a few tens of terms per coordinate. switching to a descriptionin action-angle variables, this corresponds to a reconstruction of theunderlying invariant torus. we then relate the uniform distribution of aregular orbit on its torus to the non-uniform distribution in the space ofobservables by a simple jacobian transformation between the two sets ofcoordinates. this allows us to compute, in a cell-independent way, all thephysical quantities needed in the study of the orbit, including the density andin the line-of-sight velocity distribution, with much increased accuracy. theresulting flexibility in the determination of the orbital properties, and thedrastic reduction of storage space for the orbit library, provide a significantimprovement in the practical application of schwarzschild's orbit superpositionmethod for constructing galaxy models. we test and apply our method totwo-dimensional orbits in elongated discs, and to the meridional motion inaxisymmetric potentials, and show that for a given accuracy, the spectraldynamics formalism requires an order of magnitude fewer computations than themore traditional approaches.

0812.1000	the mass of the black hole in centaurus a from sinfoni ao-assisted  integral-field observations of stellar kinematics	we present a determination of the mass of the supermassive black hole (bh)and the nuclear stellar orbital distribution of the elliptical galaxy centaurusa (ngc5128) using high-resolution integral-field observations of the stellarkinematics. the observations were obtained with sinfoni at the eso very largetelescope in the near-infrared (k-band), using adaptive optics to correct forthe blurring effect of the earth atmosphere. the data have a spatial resolutionof 0.17" fwhm and high s/n&gt;80 per spectral pixel so that the shape of thestellar line-of-sight velocity-distribution can be reliably extracted. wedetect clear low-level stellar rotation, which is counter-rotating with respectto the gas. we fit axisymmetric three-integral dynamical models to the data todetermine the best fitting values for the bh mass m_bh=(5.5+/-3.0)*10^7 msun(3sigma errors) and (m/l)_k=(0.65+/-0.15) in solar units. these values are inexcellent agreement with previous determinations from the gas kinematics, andin particular with our own published values, extracted from the same data. thisprovides one of the cleanest gas versus stars comparisons of bh determination,due to the use of integral-field data for both dynamical tracers and due to avery well resolved bh sphere of influence r_bh~0.70". we derive an accurateprofile of the orbital anisotropy and we carefully test its reliability usingspherical jeans models with radially varying anisotropy. we find an increase inthe tangential anisotropy close to the bh, but the spatial extent of thiseffect seems restricted to the size of r_bh instead of that r_b~3.9" of thecore in the surface brightness profile, contrary to detailed predictions ofcurrent simulations of the binary bh scouring mechanism. more realisticsimulations would be required to draw conclusions from this observation.
