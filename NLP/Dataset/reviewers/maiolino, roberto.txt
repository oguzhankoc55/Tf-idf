0905.1581	chemical evolution of high-redshift radio galaxies	we present new deep optical spectra of 9 high-z radio galaxies (hzrgs) at z &gt;2.7 obtained with fors2 on vlt. these rest-frame ultraviolet spectra are usedto infer the metallicity of the narrow-line regions (nlrs) in order toinvestigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in high-z universe. we focusmainly on the civ/heii and ciii]/civ flux ratios that are sensitive to gasmetallicity and ionization parameter. although the nv emission has been widelyused to infer the gas metallicity, it is often too weak to be measuredaccurately for nlrs. by combining our new spectra with data from theliterature, we examine the possible redshift evolution of the nlr metallicityfor 57 hzrgs at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4. based on the comparison between the observedemission-line flux ratios and the results of our photoionization modelcalculations, we find no significant metallicity evolution in nlrs of hzrgs, upto z ~ 4. our results imply that massive galaxies had almost completed theirchemical evolution at much higher redshift (z &gt; 5). finally, although we detectstrong nv emission lines in 5 hzrgs at z &gt; 2.7, we point out that high nv/heiiratios are not indicative of high metallicities but correspond to highionization parameters of gas clouds in nlrs.

0912.2748	spitzer infrared low-resolution spectroscopic study of buried agns in a  complete sample of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present the results of spitzer irs low-resolution infrared 5-35 micronspectroscopy of 17 nearby ulirgs at z &lt; 0.2, optically classified asnon-seyferts. the presence of optically elusive, but intrinsically luminous,buried agns is investigated, based on the strengths of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission and silicate dust absorption features detected in thespectra. the signatures of luminous buried agns, whose intrinsic luminositiesrange up to ~10^12 lsun, are found in eight sources. we combine these resultswith those of our previous research to investigate the energy function ofburied agns in a complete sample of optically non-seyfert ulirgs in the localuniverse at z &lt; 0.3 (85 sources). we confirm a trend that we previouslydiscovered: that buried agns are more common in galaxies with higher infraredluminosities. because optical seyferts also show a similar trend, we argue moregenerally that the energetic importance of agns is intrinsically higher in moreluminous galaxies, suggesting that the agn-starburst connections areluminosity-dependent. this may be related to the stronger agn feedback scenarioin currently more massive galaxy systems, as a possible origin of the galaxydownsizing phenomenon.

1001.3692	confirmation of x-ray absorption by whim in the sculptor wall	in a previous paper we reported a 3-sigma detection of an absorption linefrom the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) using the chandra and xmm x-raygrating spectra of the blazar h2356-309, the sight-line of which intercepts thesculptor wall, a large-scale superstructure of galaxies at z ~ 0.03. to verifyour initial detection, we obtained a deep (500 ks), follow-up exposure ofh2356-309 as part of the cycle-10 chandra large project program. from a jointanalysis of the cycle-10 and previous (cycle-8) chandra grating data we detectthe redshifted ovii whim line at a significance level of 3.4-sigma, asubstantial improvement over the 1.7-sigma level reported previously when usingonly the cycle-8 data. the significance increases to 4.0-sigma when theexisting xmm grating data are included in the analysis, thus confirming athigher significance the existence of the line at the redshift of the sculptorwall with an equivalent width of 28.5+/-10.5 ma (90% confidence). we obtain a90% lower limit on the ovii column density of 0.8 10^16 cm^-2 and a 90% upperlimit on the doppler-b parameter of 460 km/s. assuming the absorber isuniformly distributed throughout the ~ 15 mpc portion of the blazar'ssight-line that intercepts the sculptor wall, that the ovii column density is ~2 10^16 cm^-2 (corresponding to b &gt; 150 km/s where the inferred column densityis only weakly dependent on b), and that the oxygen abundance is 0.1 solar, weestimate a baryon over-density of ~ 30 for the whim, which is consistent withthe peak of the whim mass fraction predicted by cosmological simulations. theclear detection of ovii absorption in the sculptor wall demonstrates theviability of using current observatories to study whim in the x-ray absorptionspectra of blazars behind known large-scale structures.

1001.5407	the building up of the black hole mass - stellar mass relation	we derive the growth of smbhs relative to the stellar content of their hostgalaxy predicted under the assumption of bh accretion triggered by galaxyencounters occurring during their merging histories. we show that, within thisframework, the ratio gamma=(m_bh/m_*)(z)/(m_bh/m_*)(z=0) between the black holemass and the galactic stellar mass (normalized to the local value) depends onboth bh mass and redshift. while the average value and the spread of gamma(z)increase with z, such an effect is larger for massive bhs, reaching valuesgamma=5 for massive black holes (m&gt;10^9 m_{\odot}) at z&gt;4, in agreement withrecent observations of high-redshift qsos; this is due to the effectiveness ofinteractions in triggering bh accretion in high-density environments at highredshifts. to test such a model against observations, we worked out specificpredictions for sub-samples of the simulated galaxies corresponding to thedifferent observational samples for which measurements of gamma have beenobtained. we found that for broad line agns at 1&lt;z&lt;2 values of gamma=2 areexpected, with a mild trend toward larger value for increasing bh mass.instead, when we select from our monte carlo simulations only extremely gasrich, rapidly star forming galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, we find low values 0.3&lt;gamma&lt;1.5,consistent with recent observational findings on samples of sub-mm galaxies; inthe framework of our model, these objects end up at z=0 in low-to-intermediatemass bhs (m&lt;10^9 m_{\odot}), and they do not represent typical paths leading tolocal massive galaxies. the latter have formed preferentially through pathspassing above the local m_*-m_bh relation. we discuss how the global pictureemerging from the model is consistent with a downsizing scenario, where massivebhs accrete a larger fraction of their final mass at high redshifts z&gt;4.

1006.1655	quasar feedback revealed by giant molecular outflows	in the standard scenario for galaxy evolution young star-forming galaxiestransform into red bulge-dominated spheroids, where star formation has beenquenched. to explain such a transformation, a strong negative feedbackgenerated by accretion onto a super-massive black hole is often invoked. thedepletion of gas resulting from quasar-driven outflows should eventually stopstar-formation in the host galaxy and lead the black hole to "suicide" forstarvation. direct observational evidence for a major quasar feedback onto thehost galaxy is still missing, since outflows previously observed in quasars aregenerally associated with the ionized component of the gas, which only accountsfor a minor fraction of the total gas content, and typically occurring in thecentral regions. we used the iram pdb interferometer to observe co(1-0) in mrk231, the closest qso known. thanks to the wide band we detect broad wings ofthe co line, with velocities up to 750 km/s and spatially resolved on the kpcscale. such broad co wings trace a giant molecular outflow of about 700msun/yr, far larger than the ongoing star-formation rate (~200 msun/yr)observed in the host galaxy. this wind will totally expel the cold gasreservoir in mrk 231 in about 1e7 yrs, therefore halting the star-formationactivity on the same timescale. the inferred kinetic energy in the molecularoutflow is ~1.2e44 erg/s, corresponding to a few percent of the agn bolometricluminosity, very close to the fraction expected by models ascribing quasarfeedback to highly supersonic shocks generated by radiatively acceleratednuclear winds. the direct observational evidence for quasar feedback reportedhere provides solid support to the scenarios ascribing the observed propertiesof local massive galaxies to quasar-induced large scale winds.

1008.4158	the origin and evolution of the mass-metallicity relation using galics	the galics (galaxies in cosmological simulations) semi-analytical model ofhierar- chical galaxy formation is used to investigate the effects of differentgalactic properties, including star formation rate (sfr) and outflows, on theshape of the mass metallic- ity relation and to predict the relation forgalaxies at redshift z=2.27 and z=3.54. our version of galics has the chemicalevolution implemented in great detail and is less heavily reliant onapproximations such as instantaneous recycling. we vary the model parameterscontrolling both the efficiency and redshift dependence of the sfr as well asthe efficiency of supernova feedback. we find that the factors controlling thesfr influence the relation significantly at all redshifts and require a strongredshift dependence, proportional to 1+z, in order to reproduce the observedrelation at the low mass end. indeed, at any redshift, the predicted relationflattens out at the high mass end resulting in a poorer agreement withobservations in this regime. we also find that variation of the parametersassociated with outflows has a minimal effect on the relation at high redshiftbut does serve to alter its shape in the more recent past. we thus concludethat the relation is one between sfr and mass and that outflows are onlyimportant in shaping the relation at late times. when the relation isstratified by sfr it is apparent that the predicted galaxies with increasingstellar masses have higher sfrs, supporting the view that galaxy downsizing isthe origin of the relation. attempting to reproduce the observed relation, wevary the parameters controlling the efficiency of star formation and itsredshift dependence and compare the predicted relations with erb et al. (2006)at z=2.27 and maiolino et al. (2008) at z=3.54 in order to find thebest-fitting parameters. (abridged)

1011.5811	the mass-metallicity relation of sdss quasars	active galactic nuclei (agns) are characterized by a clear correlationbetween luminosity and metallicity (l_agn-z_agn relation). the origin of thiscorrelation is not clear. it may result from a relation between the black holemass (m_bh) and metallicity, or from a relation between the accretion rate(l/l_edd) and metallicity. to investigate the origin of the l_agn-z_agnrelation, we use optical spectra of 2383 quasars at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 from thesloan digital sky survey. by using this data set, we have constructed compositespectra of 33 subsamples in intervals of both m_bh and l/l_edd. from thesecomposite spectra we measure emission-line flux ratios that are sensitive tothe metallicity of the broad line region (blr); specifically, nv/civ, nv/heii,(siiv+oiv])/civ, and aliii/civ. we find that there is a significant correlationbetween m_bh and z_blr as inferred from all four metallicity-sensitiveemission-line flux ratios. this result strongly suggests that the observedl_agn-z_agn relation is mostly a consequence of the m_bh-z_agn relation. therelation between m_bh and z_blr is likely a consequence of both the m_bh-m_bulrelation and of the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxy. we also findthat l/l_edd correlates with the emission line flux ratios involving nv (morespecifically, nv/civ and nv/heii), while it does not correlate with the othertwo metallicity sensitive emission line flux ratios, i.e., (siiv+oiv])/civ andaliii/civ. these correlations indicate that the emission-line flux ratiosinvolving nv depend on both metallicity and relative abundance of nitrogen. wesuggest that the relation between l/l_edd and those line ratios involvingnitrogen, is caused by a delay of the black hole accretion rate relative to theonset of nuclear star formation of about 10^8 years, which is the timescalerequired for the nitrogen enrichment.

1012.2471	metallicity diagnostics with infrared fine-structure lines	although measuring the gas metallicity in galaxies at various redshifts iscrucial to constrain galaxy evolutionary scenarios, only rest-frame opticalemission lines have been generally used to measure the metallicity. this hasprevented us to accurately measure the metallicity of dust-obscured galaxies,and accordingly to understand the chemical evolution of dusty populations, suchas ultraluminous infrared galaxies. here we propose diagnostics of the gasmetallicity based on infrared fine structure emission lines, which are nearlyunaffected by dust extinction even the most obscured systems. specifically, wefocus on fine-structure lines arising mostly from hii regions, not inphoto-dissociation regions, to minimize the dependence and uncertainties of themetallicity diagnostics from various physical parameters. based onphotoionization models, we show that the emission-line flux ratio of([oiii]51.80+[oiii]88.33)/[niii]57.21 is an excellent tracer of the gasmetallicity. the individual line ratios [oiii]51.80/[niii]57.21 or[oiii]88.33/[niii]57.21 can also be used as diagnostics of the metallicity, butthey suffer a stronger dependence on the gas density. the line ratios[oiii]88.33/[oiii]51.80 and [nii]121.7/[niii]57.21 can be used to measure and,therefore, account for the dependences on the of the gas density and ionizationparameter, respectively. we show that these diagnostic fine-structure lines aredetectable with herschel in luminous infrared galaxies out z=0.4. metallicitymeasurements with these fine-structure lines will be feasible at relativelyhigh redshift (z=1 or more) with spica, the future infrared space observatory.

1105.1149	sub-millimeter detected z~2 radio-quiet qsos: accurate redshifts, black  hole masses, and inflow/outflow velocities	we present near-ir spectroscopy of a sample of luminous (lbol &gt;10^14 lsun),sub-millimeter-detected, dusty (m_dust~10^9 msun), radio-quiet qsos at z~2. wemeasure the redshift, width, and luminosity of the halpha line, and thecontinuum luminosity near ha.  the halpha emission line was strongly detected in all sources. two components-- a very broad (&gt;~5000 km/s) gaussian and an intermediate-width (&gt;~1500 km/s)gaussian, were required to fit the halpha profile of all observed qsos. narrow(&lt;~1000 km/s) lines were not detected in the sample qsos.  relative to the halpha-derived qso redshift, the rest-frame uv emission linesin these sub-mm bright qsos show larger than average blue-shifted velocities,potentially tracing strong -- up to 3000 km/s -- outflows in the broad lineregion.  with the exception of the one qso which shows exceptionally broad halphalines, the black hole masses of the qso sample are in the range log mbh =9.0--9.7 and the eddington fractions are between 0.5 and ~1. in black hole massand accretion rate, this sub-mm bright qso sample is indistinguishable from theshemmer et al. (2004) optically-bright qso sample at z~2; the latter is likelydominated by sub-mm dim qsos. previous authors have demonstrated a correlation,over six orders of magnitude, between sfr and accretion rate in activegalaxies: the sub-mm bright qsos lie at the upper extremes of both quantitiesand their sfr is an order of magnitude higher than that predicted from thecorrelation

1106.5502	on star formation rates and star formation histories of galaxies out to  z ~ 3	we compare multi-wavelength sfr indicators out to z~3 in goods-south. ouranalysis uniquely combines u-to-8um photometry from fireworks, mips 24um andpacs 70, 100, and 160um photometry from the pep survey, and ha spectroscopyfrom the sins survey. we describe a set of conversions that lead to acontinuity across sfr indicators. a luminosity-independent conversion from 24umto total infrared luminosity yields estimates of lir that are in the medianconsistent with the lir derived from pacs photometry, albeit with significantscatter. dust correction methods perform well at low to intermediate levels ofstar formation. they fail to recover the total amount of star formation insystems with large sfr_ir/sfr_uv ratios, typically occuring at the highest sfrs(sfr_uv+ir \gtrsim 100 msun/yr) and redshifts (z \gtrsim 2.5) probed. finally,we confirm that ha-based sfrs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 are consistent with sfr_sed andsfr_uv+ir provided extra attenuation towards hii regions is taken into account(av,neb = av,continuum / 0.44). with the cross-calibrated sfr indicators inhand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferredfrom sed modeling. we compare the observed sfr-m relations and mass functionsat a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lowerredshift galaxies backwards in time. we find evidence for underestimatedstellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied. wedemonstrate how resolved sed modeling, or alternatively deep uv data, may helpto overcome this bias. the age bias is most severe for galaxies with youngstellar populations, and reduces towards older systems. finally, our analysissuggests that sfhs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several100 myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.

1112.2403	stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 3	the stellar metallicity is a direct measure of the amount of metals presentin a galaxy, as a large part of the metals lie in its stars. in this paper weinvestigate new stellar metallicity indicators suitable for high-z galaxiesstudying the stellar photospheric absorption lines in the rest frameultraviolet, hence sampling predominantly young hot stars. we defined these newindicators based on the equivalent widths (ew) of selected features usingtheoretical spectra created with the evolutionary population synthesis codestarburts99. we used them to compute the stellar metallicity for a sample ofuv-selected galaxies at z &gt; 3 from the amaze survey using very deep (37h perobject) vlt/fors spectra. moreover, we applied the new metallicity indicatorsto eight additional high redshift galaxies found in literature. we thencompared stellar and gas-phase metallicities measured from the emission linesfor all these galaxies, finding that within the errors the two estimates are ingood agreement, with possible tendency to have stellar metallicities lower thanthe gas phase ones. for the first time, we are able to study the stellarmass-metallicity relation at z &gt; 3. we find that the metallicity of young, hotstars in galaxies at z \sim 3 have similar values of the aged stars in localsdss galaxies, contrary to what observed for the gas phase metallicity.

1205.3488	quasar feedback in the early universe: the case of sdss j1148+5251	galaxy-scale gas outflows triggered by active galactic nuclei have beenproposed as a key physical process to regulate the co-evolution of nuclearblack holes and their host galaxies. the recent detection of a massive gasoutflow in one of the most distant quasar, sdss j1148+5251 at z = 6.4,presented by maiolino et al. (2012) strongly supports this idea and suggeststhat strong quasar feedback is already at work at very early times. in aprevious work, valiante et al. (2011), we have presented a hierarchicalsemi-analytical model, gamete/ qsodust, for the formation and evolution ofhigh-redshift quasars, and we have applied it to the quasar sdss j1148+5251,with the aim of investigating the star formation history, the nature of thedominant stellar populations and the origin and properties of the large dustmass observed in the host galaxy. a robust prediction of the model is that theevolution of the nuclear black hole and of the host galaxy are tightly coupledby quasar feedback in the form of strong galaxy-scale winds. in the presentletter, we show that the gas outflow rate predicted by gamete/qsodust is ingood agreement with the lower limit of 3500 msun/yr inferred by theobservations. according to the model, the observed outflow at z = 6.4 isdominated by quasar feedback, as the outflow rate has already considerablydepleted the gas content of the host galaxy, leading to a down-turn in the starformation rate at z &lt; 7 - 8. hence, supernova explosions give a negligiblecontribution to the observed winds at z = 6.4.

1205.4834	alma reveals a chemically evolved submillimeter galaxy at z=4.76	the chemical properties of high-z galaxies provide important information toconstrain galaxy evolutionary scenarios. however, widely-used metallicitydiagnostics based on rest-frame optical emission lines are not usable forheavily dust-enshrouded galaxies (such as sub-millimeter galaxies; smgs),especially at z&gt;3. here we focus on the flux ratio of the far-infraredfine-structure emission lines [nii]205um and [cii]158um to assess themetallicity of high-z smgs. through alma cycle 0 observations, we have detectedthe [nii]205um emission in a strongly [cii]-emitting smg, less j033229.4-275619at z=4.76. the velocity-integrated [nii]/[cii] flux ratio is 0.043 +/- 0.008.this is the first measurement of the [nii]/[cii] flux ratio in high-z galaxies,and the inferred flux ratio is similar to the ratio observed in the nearbyuniverse (~0.02-0.07). the velocity-integrated flux ratio and photoionizationmodels suggest that the metallicity in this smg is consistent with solar,implying the chemical evolution has progressed very rapidly in this system atz=4.76. we also obtain a tight upper limit on the co(12-11) transition, whichtranslates into co(12-11)/co(2-1) &lt;3.8 (3 sigma). this suggests that themolecular gas clouds in less j033229.4-275619 are not affected significantly bythe radiation field emitted by the agn in this system.

1209.1100	scaling relations of metallicity, stellar mass, and star formation rate  in metal-poor starbursts: i. a fundamental plane	most galaxies follow well-defined scaling relations of metallicity (o/h),star formation rate (sfr), and stellar mass. however, low-metallicitystarbursts, rare in the local universe but more common at high redshift,deviate significantly from these scaling relations. on the "main sequence" ofstar formation, these galaxies have high sfr for a given m*; and on themass-metallicity relation, they have excess m* for their low metallicity. inthis paper, we characterize o/h, m*, and sfr for these deviant "low-metallicitystarbursts", selected from a sample of ~1100 galaxies, spanning almost twoorders of magnitude in metal abundance, a factor of ~10^6 in sfr, and of ~10^5in stellar mass. our sample includes quiescent star-forming galaxies and bluecompact dwarfs at redshift 0, luminous compact galaxies at redshift 0.3, andlyman break galaxies at redshifts 1-3.4. applying a principal componentanalysis (pca) to the galaxies in our sample with m*&lt;10^{10} msun gives afundamental plane (fp) of scaling relations; sfr and stellar mass define theplane itself, and o/h its thickness. the dispersion for our sample in theedge-on view of the plane is 0.17 dex, independently of redshift and includingthe metal-poor starbursts. the same fp is followed by 55100 galaxies selectedfrom the sloan digital sky survey, with a dispersion of 0.06dex. in a companionpaper, we develop multi-phase chemical evolution models that successfullypredict the observed scaling relations and the fp; the deviations from the mainscaling relations are caused by a different (starburst or "active") mode ofstar formation. these scaling relations do not truly evolve, but rather aredefined by the different galaxy populations dominant at different cosmologicalepochs.

1301.3155	empirical predictions for (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep  fields	[abridged] modern (sub-)millimeter/radio interferometers will enable us tomeasure the dust and molecular gas emission from galaxies that haveluminosities lower than the milky way, out to high redshifts and withunprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. this will provide newconstraints on the star formation properties and gas reservoir in galaxiesthroughout cosmic times through dedicated deep field campaigns targeting theco/[cii] lines and dust continuum emission. in this paper, we present empiricalpredictions for such (sub-)millimeter line and continuum deep fields. we basethese predictions on the deepest available optical/near-infrared acs and nicmosdata on the hubble ultra deep field. using a physically-motivated spectralenergy distribution model, we fit the observed optical/near-infrared emissionof 13,099 galaxies with redshifts up to z=5, and obtain median likelihoodestimates of their stellar mass, star formation rate, dust attenuation and dustluminosity. we derive statistical constraints on the dust emission in theinfrared and (sub-)millimeter which are consistent with the observedoptical/near-infrared emission in terms of energy balance. this allows us toestimate, for each galaxy, the (sub-)millimeter continuum flux densities inseveral alma, pdbi/noema and jvla bands. using empirical relations between theobserved co/[cii] line luminosities and the infrared luminosity, we infer theflux of the co(1-0) and [cii] lines from the estimated infrared luminosity ofeach galaxy in our sample. we then predict the fluxes of higher co transitionlines co(2-1) to co(7-6) bracketing two extreme gas excitation scenarios. weuse our predictions to discuss possible deep field strategies with alma. thepredictions presented in this study will serve as a direct benchmark for futuredeep field campaigns in the (sub-)millimeter regime.

1302.0844	on the effect of the cosmic microwave background in high-redshift  (sub-)millimeter observations	modern (sub-)millimeter interferometers enable the measurement of the coolgas and dust emission of high-redshift galaxies (z&gt;5). however, at theseredshifts the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature is higher,approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold dust and molecular gasobserved in the local universe. in this paper, we discuss the impact of thewarmer cmb on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. the cmbaffects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission(e.g. carbon monoxide, co) in two ways: (i) it provides an additional source of(both dust and gas) heating; and (ii) it is a non-negligible background againstwhich the line and continuum emission are measured. we show that these twocompeting processes affect the way we interpret the dust and gas properties ofhigh-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. we quantifythese effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of theintrinsic dust (and line) emission can be detected against the cmb as afunction of frequency, redshift and temperature. we discuss implications on thederived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-)millimeter data.specifically, the inferred dust and molecular gas masses can be severelyunderestimated for cold systems if the impact of the cmb is not properly takeninto account.

1304.7120	dust formation in the winds of agbs: the contribution at low  metallicities	we present new models for the evolution of stars with mass in the range 1msun&lt; m &lt; 7.5msun, followed from the pre-main-sequence through the asymptotic giantbranch phase. the metallicity adopted is $z=3*10^{-4} (which, with analpha-enhancement of +0.4, corresponds to [fe/h]=-2). dust formation isdescribed by following the growth of dust grains of various types as the windexpands from the stellar surface.  models with mass m&gt;3msun experience hot bottom burning, thus maintaining thesurface c/o below unity. unlike higher z models, the scarcity of siliconavailable in the envelope prevents the formation of silicates in meaningfulquantities, sufficient to trigger the acceleration of the wind via radiationpressure on the dust grains formed. no silicate formation occurs below athreshold metallicity of z=10^{-3}.  low--mass stars, with m&lt; 2.5msun become carbon stars, forming solid carbondust in their surroundings. the total dust mass formed depends on the uncertainextent of the inwards penetration of the convective envelope during the thirddredge--up episodes following the thermal pulses. carbon grains have sizes 0.08micron &lt; a_c &lt; 0.12 micron and the total amount of dust formed (increasing withthe mass of the star) is m_c=(2-6)*10^{-4}msun.  our results imply that agb stars with z=3*10^{-4} can only contribute tocarbon dust enrichment of the interstellar medium on relatively longtimescales, &gt; 300 myr, comparable to the evolutionary time of a 3msun star. atlower metallicities the scarcity of silicon available and the presence of hotbottom burning even in m&lt; 2msun, prevents the formation of silicate and carbongrains. we extrapolate our conclusion to more metal--poor environments, anddeduce that at z &lt; 10^{-4} dust enrichment is mostly due to metal condensationin supernova ejecta.

1306.2307	the hot and energetic universe: a white paper presenting the science  theme motivating the athena+ mission	this white paper, submitted to the recent esa call for science themes todefine its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformationalleap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how doesordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2)how do black holes grow and shape the universe? hot gas in clusters, groups andthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local universe.to understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation andassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physicalproperties and evolution. this requires spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopywith a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolvingpower compared to currently planned facilities. feedback from supermassiveblack holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxyevolution models, but it is not well understood. x-ray observations canuniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes anddetermine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. due tothe effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requiresknowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmictime, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. x-ray emission is themost reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed mustimprove by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census intothe early universe. the advanced telescope for high energy astrophysics(athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution,spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionizeour understanding of the hot and energetic universe. these capabilities willalso provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.

1309.7862	spica spectroscopic cosmological surveys to unravel galaxy evolution	the main energy-generating mechanisms in galaxies are black hole (bh)accretion and star formation (sf) and the interplay of these processes isdriving the evolution of galaxies. mir/fir spectroscopy are able to distinguishbetween bh accretion and sf, as it was shown in the past by infraredspectroscopy from the space by the infrared space observatory and spitzer.spitzer and herschel spectroscopy together can trace the agn and the sfcomponents in galaxies, with extinction free lines, almost only in the localuniverse, except for a few distant objects. one of the major goals of the studyof galaxy evolution is to understand the history of the luminosity source ofgalaxies along cosmic time. this goal can be achieved with far-ir spectroscopiccosmological surveys. spica in combination with ground based large single dishsubmillimeter telescopes, such as ccat, will offer a unique opportunity to dothis. we use galaxy evolution models linked to the observed mir-fir counts(including herschel) to predict the number of sources and their ir linesfluxes, as derived from observations of local galaxies. a shallow survey in anarea of 0.5 square degrees, with a typical integration time of 1 hour perpointing, will be able to detect thousands of galaxies in at least threeemission lines, using safari, the far-ir spectrometer onboard of spica.

1311.1816	the dependence of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation on environment  and the implied metallicity of the igm	we explore the dependence of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation onenvironment in sdss, in terms of both over-density and central/satellitedichotomy. we find that at a given stellar mass, there is a strong dependenceof metallicity on over-density for star-forming satellites. instead, forstar-forming centrals no correlation is found. star-forming satellites atdifferent stellar masses form a tight sequence in the average overdensity -metallicity plane, which covers the entire observed range of metallicities andstellar masses. this remarkable result appears to imply that there exists auniversal evolutionary path for all star-forming satellites, regardless oftheir stellar masses. the strong correlation between over-density andmetallicity for star-forming satellites indicates that the gas inflow ofsatellite galaxies is progressively metal-enriched in denser regions. weinterpret our results by employing the gas regulator model and find that themetallicity of the enriched inflow of star-forming satellite galaxies stronglyincreases with increasing over-density, largely independently of stellar mass.if the metallicity of the inflow of star-forming satellites can represent themetallicity of the igm, then the implied metallicity of the igm rises from ~0.01 solar metallicity in void-like environments to ~ 0.3 solar metallicity incluster-like environments, in broad agreement with observations. we show thatthe observed metallicity difference between star-forming centrals andstar-forming satellites becoming smaller towards high stellar masses can besimply explained by the mass-independent enriched inflow, without the need toinvolve any mass-dependent environmental effect on metallicity. since satellitegalaxies account for at least half of the galaxy population, our findingsprompt for a revision of many galaxy evolutionary models, which generallyassume pristine gas inflows.

0802.2021	the effect of radiation pressure on virial black hole mass estimates and  the case of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies	we consider the effect of radiation pressure from ionizing photons on blackhole (bh) mass estimates based on the application of the virial theorem tobroad emission lines in agn spectra. bh masses based only on the virial productv^2r and neglecting the effect of radiation pressure can be severelyunderestimated especially in objects close to the eddington limit. we providean empirical calibration of the correction for radiation pressure and we showthat it is consistent with a simple physical model in which blr clouds areoptically thick to ionizing radiation and have average column densities ofnh~10^23 cm^-2. this value is remarkably similar to what is required instandard blr photoionization models to explain observed spectra. with theinclusion of radiation pressure the discrepancy between virial bh masses basedon single epoch spectra and on reverberation mapping data drops from 0.4 to 0.2dex rms. the use of single epoch observations as surrogates of reverberationmapping campaigns can thus provide more accurate bh masses than previouslythought. finally, we show that narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies haveapparently low bh masses because they are radiating close to their eddingtonlimit. after the radiation pressure correction, nls1 galaxies have bh massessimilar to other broad line agns and follow the same mbh-sigma/l relations asother active and normal galaxies. radiation forces arising from ionizing photonmomentum deposition constitute an important physical effect which must be takeninto account when computing virial bh masses.

1402.5964	from haloes to galaxies - i. the dynamics of the gas regulator model and  the implied cosmic ssfr history	we explore the basic parameters that drive the evolution of the fundamentalproperties of star forming galaxies within the gas regulator model, orbathtub-model. we derive the general analytic form of the evolution of the keygalaxy properties, i.e. gas mass, star formation rate (sfr), stellar mass,specific sfr, gas fraction, gas phase metallicity and stellar metallicity,without assuming that galaxies live in the equilibrium state. we find that thetimescale required to reach equilibrium, tau_eq, which is determined by theproduct of star-formation efficiency and mass-loading factor, is the centralparameter that is essentially in control of the evolution of all key galaxyproperties. the scatters in most of the key scaling relations, such as themass-sfr relation and mass-metallicity relation, are primarily governed bytau_eq. most strikingly, the predicted ssfr evolution is controlled solely bytau_eq (apart from the cosmic time). although the precise evolution of the ssfrdepends on tau_eq, the ssfr history is largely insensitive to different valuesof tau_eq. the difference between the minimum and maximum ssfr at any epoch isless than a factor of four. the shape of the predicted ssfr history simplymimics that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos(smir_dm) with the typical value of the ssfr around 2*smir_dm, in goodagreement with the predictions from typical semi-analytic models (sams), butboth are fundamentally different from the observed ssfr history. this clearlyimplies that some key process is missing in both typical sams and gas regulatormodel, and we hint at some possible culprit. we emphasize the critical role oftau_eq in controlling the evolution of the galaxy population, especially forgas rich low mass galaxies that are very unlikely to live around theequilibrium state at any epoch and this has been largely ignored in manysimilar studies.

1403.7966	black hole accretion preferentially occurs in gas rich galaxies	we have investigated the gas content of a sample of several hundred agn hostgalaxies at z$&lt;$1 and compared it with a sample of inactive galaxies, matchedin bins of stellar mass and redshift. gas masses have been inferred from thedust masses, obtained by stacked herschel far-ir and sub-mm data in the goodsand cosmos fields, under reasonable assumptions and metallicity scalingrelations for the dust-to-gas ratio. we find that agns are on average hosted ingalaxies much more gas rich than inactive galaxies. in the vast majority ofstellar mass bins, the average gas content of agn hosts is higher than ininactive galaxies. the difference is up to a factor of ten higher in lowstellar mass galaxies, with a significance of 6.5$\sigma$. in almost half ofthe agn sample the gas content is three times higher than in the control sampleof inactive galaxies. our result strongly suggests that the probability ofhaving an agn activated is simply driven by the amount of gas in the hostgalaxy; this can be explained in simple terms of statistical probability ofhaving a gas cloud falling into the gravitational potential of the black hole.the increased probability of an agn being hosted by a star-forming galaxy,identified by previous works, may be a consequence of the relationship betweengas content and agn activity, found in this paper, combined with theschmidt-kennicutt law for star formation.

1503.08300	modern yields per stellar generation: the effect of the imf	gaseous and stellar metallicities in galaxies are nowadays routinely used toconstrain the evolutionary processes in galaxies. this requires the knowledgeof the average yield per stellar generation, $y_{\text{z}}$, i.e. the quantityof metals that a stellar population releases into the interstellar medium(ism), which is generally assumed to be a fixed fiducial value. deviations ofthe observed metallicity from the expected value of $y_{\text{z}}$ are used toquantify the effect of outflows or inflows of gas, or even as evidence forbiased metallicity calibrations or inaccurate metallicity diagnostics. here weshow that $\rm y_{\text{z}}$ depends significantly on the initial mass function(imf), varying by up to a factor larger than three, for the range of imfstypically adopted in various studies. varying the upper mass cutoff of the imfimplies a further variation of $y_{\text{z}}$ by an additional factor that canbe larger than two. these effects, along with the variation of the gas massfraction restored into the ism by supernovae ($r$, which also depends on theimf), may yield to deceiving results, if not properly taken into account. inparticular, metallicities that are often considered unusually high can actuallybe explained in terms of yield associated with commonly adopted imfs such asthe kroupa (2001) or chabrier (2003). we provide our results for two differentsets of stellar yields (both affected by specific limitations) finding that theuncertainty introduced by this assumption can be as large as $\sim0.2$ dex.finally, we show that $y_{\text{z}}$ is not substantially affected by theinitial stellar metallicity as long as $\text{z}&gt; 10^{-3}~\text{z}_{\odot}$.

1505.03143	strangulation as the primary mechanism for shutting down star formation  in galaxies	local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming(gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). the primary mechanismresponsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them intoquiescent and passive systems is still unclear. sudden removal of gas throughoutflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. an alternativemechanism is so-called "strangulation", in which the supply of cold gas to thegalaxy is halted. here we report that the difference between quiescent and starforming galaxies in terms of stellar metallicity (i.e. the fraction of metalsheavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) can be used to discriminateefficiently between the two mechanisms. the analysis of the stellar metallicityin local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, clearly reveals that strangulation isthe primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typicaltimescale of 4 billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar massless than 10^11 solar masses. this result is further supported independently bythe stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, whichindicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10^11 solar masses are onaverage observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.

astro-ph;0309298	the agn content of ultraluminous ir galaxies: high resolution vla  imaging of the iras 1jy ulirg sample	this paper presents the results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of83 of the 118 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) in the iras 1 jy ulirgsample. we have observed these ulirgs at 15ghz with the very large array (vla).we find that ~75% of seyferts (both type 1 and 2) and liners have radio nucleiwhich are compact at our 150mas resolution. the detection rate of hii nuclei issignificantly lower (32%); the detections among these are preferentially hii +liner/seyfert composite nuclei. among ulirgs with multiple optical or near-irnuclei our observations detected only one (or no) nucleus; in these the radiodetection is typically towards the brightest near-ir nucleus. the compactnessof the radio sources, the higher detection rates in agn-type nuclei than hiinuclei, the preferential detection of nuclei with unresolved point sources inthe near-ir, the low soft x-ray to nuclear radio luminosity ratio (arguingagainst thermal emission powering the radio nuclei), and the lack ofcorrelation between radio power and halpha luminosity, all support an origin ofthe detected radio nuclei in agn related activity. this result is especiallyinteresting for liner ulirgs for which signatures of agns have often beenambiguous in other wavebands. such a high incidence of agn would provide, forthe first time, a large sample in which to study the interplay between agn,starbursts, and galaxy mergers.

astro-ph;0403166	observational tests of the evolution of spheroidal galaxies and  predictions for sirtf/spitzer cosmological surveys	granato et al(2004) have elaborated a physically grounded model exploitingthe mutual feedback between star-forming spheroidal galaxies and the activenuclei growing in their cores to overcome, within the hierarchical clusteringscenario for galaxy formation, one of the main challenges facing such scenario,the fact that massive spheroidal galaxies appear to have formed earlier andfaster than predicted by previous models. adopting the choice by granato et alfor the parameters governing the history of the sf,of chemical abundances andof the gas and dust content of galaxies, we are left with only two parametersaffecting the time and mass dependent sed of spheroidal galaxies. aftercomplementing the model with a simple description of evolutionary properties ofstarburst, normal late-type galaxies and agns we have successfully compared themodel with a broad variety of observational data, deep k-band, iso, iras,scuba, radio counts, the corresponding redshift distributions, the irbackground spectrum, and also with data for eros. we also present detailedpredictions for the goods and swire surveys with the spitzer space telescope.we find that the goods deep survey at 24$\mu$m and the swire surveys at 70 and160$\mu$m are likely to be severely confusion limited. the goods surveys in theirac channels are expected to resolve most of the background, to explore thefull passive evolution phase of spheroidal galaxies and most of their activestar-forming phase, detecting galaxies up to z\simeq 4. a substantial number ofhigh z star-forming spheroidal galaxies should also be detected by the 24\mumswire and goods surveys, while the 70 and 160\mum will be particularly usefulto study the evolution of such galaxies in the range 1 \lsim z \lsim2.[abridged]

astro-ph;0403381	connecting the cosmic infrared background to the x-ray background	we estimate the contribution of agns and of their host galaxies to theinfrared background. we use the luminosity function and evolution of agnsrecently determined by the hard x-ray surveys, and new spectral energydistributions connecting the x-ray and the infrared emission, divided inintervals of absorption. these two ingredients allow us to determine thecontribution of agns to the infrared background by using mostly observedquantities, with only minor assumptions. we obtain that agn emissioncontributes little to the infrared background ($&lt;$5% over most of the infraredbands), implying that the latter is dominated by star formation. however, agnhost galaxies may contribute significantly to the infrared background, and morespecifically 10--20% in the 1--20$\mu$m range and $\sim$5% at $\lambda&lt;60\mum$. we also give the contribution of agns and of their host galaxies to thesource number counts in various infrared bands, focusing on those which will beobserved with spitzer. we also report a significant discrepancy between theexpected contribution of agn hosts to the submm background and bright submmnumber counts with the observational constraints. we discuss the causes andimplications of this discrepancy and the possible effects on the spitzer far-irbands.

astro-ph;0501188	the optical-to-radio spectral energy distributions of low-metallicity  blue compact dwarf galaxies	we present global spectral energy distributions (seds) from 0.3$\mu$m to 90cmfor a sample of seven low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies (bcds). inaddition to data compiled from the literature, we report new scuba data for thegalaxies in the sample, including the two most metal-poor star-forming galaxiesknown, izw18 and sbs0335-052. the standard starburst templates, m82 and arp220,do not give a good approximation to any of the bcd seds in our sample. severalseds are instead characterized by: (i) approximately flat radio spectrasuggesting dominant thermal processes; (ii) far-infrared (fir) spectra whichpeak at or shortward of 60 $\mu$m; (iii) a significant warm dust component andabsence of aromatic features in emission (or pahs) in the mid-infrared (mir).the seds of low-metallicity bcds do not follow ``canonical'' scaling relations,and the ``standard'' star-formation indicators based on radio continuum, fir,and mir luminosities can be discrepant by factors of $\simgt10$. we present newmodels of the dust seds from 5$\mu$m to 1cm, and derive infrared luminosities,dust distributions, temperatures, and masses. the observed seds and dust modelsare interpreted in terms of the active/passive regimes of star formation andtrends with metallicity. finally, we discuss the implications of our results onthe $z\simgt6$ starburst populations which will be detected by forthcomingsubmm and radio facilities.

astro-ph;0508652	gas metallicity in the narrow-line regions of high-redshift active  galactic nuclei	we analyze optical (uv rest-frame) spectra of x-ray selected narrow-line qsosat redshift 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.7 found in the chandra deep field south and ofnarrow-line radio galaxies at redshift 1.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.8 to investigate the gasmetallicity of the narrow-line regions and their evolution in this redshiftrange. such spectra are also compared with uv spectra of local seyfert 2galaxies. the observational data are inconsistent with the predictions of shockmodels, suggesting that the narrow-line regions are mainly photoionized. thephotoionization models with dust grains predict line flux ratios which are alsoin disagreement with most of the observed values, suggesting that thehigh-ionization part of the narrow-line regions (which is sampled by theavailable spectra) is dust-free. the photoionization dust-free models providetwo possible scenarios which are consistent with the observed data: low-densitygas clouds (n &lt; 10^3 cm^-3) with a sub-solar metallicity (0.2 &lt; z/z_sun &lt; 1.0),or high-density gas clouds (n ~ 10^5 cm^-3) with a wide range of gasmetallicity (0.2 &lt; z/z_sun &lt; 5.0). regardless of the specific interpretation,the observational data do not show any evidence for a significant evolution ofthe gas metallicity in the narrow-line regions within the redshift range 1.2 &lt;z &lt; 3.8. instead, we find a trend for more luminous active galactic nuclei tohave more metal-rich gas clouds (luminosity-metallicity relation), which is inagreement with the same finding in the studies of the broad-line regions. thelack of evolution for the gas metallicity of the narrow-line regions impliesthat the major epoch of star formation in the host galaxies of these activegalactic nuclei is at z &gt; 4.

astro-ph;0510385	the evolution of the broad-line region among sdss quasars	based on 5344 quasar spectra taken from the sdss data release 2, thedependences of various emission-line flux ratios on redshift and quasarluminosity are investigated in the ranges 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.5 and -24.5 &gt; m_b &gt;-29.5$. we show that the emission lines in the composite spectra are fittedbetter with power-law profiles than with double gaussian or modified lorentzianprofiles, and in particular we show that the power-law profiles are moreappropriate to measure broad emission-line fluxes than other methods. thecomposite spectra show that there are statistically significant correlationsbetween quasar luminosity and various emission-line flux ratios, such as nv/civand nv/heii, while there are only marginal correlations between quasar redshiftand emission-line flux ratios. we obtain detailed photoionization models tointerpret the observed line ratios. the correlation of line ratios withluminosity is interpreted in terms of higher gas metallicity in more luminousquasars. for a given quasar luminosity, there is no metallicity evolution forthe redshift range 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.5. the typical metallicity of blr gas clouds isestimated to be z ~ 5 z_sun, although the inferred metallicity depends on theassumed blr cloud properties, such as their density distribution function andtheir radial distribution. the absence of a metallicity evolution up to z ~ 4.5implies that the active star-formation epoch of quasar host galaxies occurredat z &gt; 7.

astro-ph;0603580	gas metallicity diagnostics in star-forming galaxies	generally the gas metallicity in distant galaxies can only be inferred byusing a few prominent emission lines. various theoretical models have been usedto predict the relationship between emission line fluxes and metallicity,suggesting that some line ratios can be used as diagnostics of the gasmetallicity in galaxies. however, accurate empirical calibrations of theseemission line flux ratios from real galaxy spectra spanning a wide metallicityrange are still lacking. in this paper we provide such empirical calibrationsby using the combination of two sets of spectroscopic data: one consisting oflow-metallicity galaxies with a measurement of [oiii]4363, and the other oneconsisting of galaxies in the sdss dr4 whose metallicity has been determinedfrom various strong emission lines in their spectra. this combined data setconstitutes the largest sample of galaxies with information on the gasmetallicity available so far and spanning the widest metallicity range. ourempirical diagrams show that the line ratio [oiii]/[oii] is a useful tool tobreak the degeneracy in the r_23 parameter when no information on the [nii]line is available. the line ratio [neiii]/[oii] also results to be a usefulmetallicity indicator for high-z galaxies. finally, we compare these empiricalrelations with photoionization models. we find that the empiricalr_23-metallicity sequence is strongly discrepant with respect to the trendexpected by models with constant ionization parameter, which is interpreted asa consequence of a strong metallicity dependence of the average ionizationparameter in galaxies. this result should warn about the use of theoreticalmodels with constant ionization parameter to infer metallicities from observedline ratios.

astro-ph;0702136	a spitzer irs low-resolution spectroscopic search for buried agns in  nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies - a constraint on geometry between  energy sources and dust -	we present the results of spitzer irs low-resolution infrared 5-35 micronspectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.15. wefocus on the search for the signatures of buried active galactic nuclei (agns)in the complete sample of ulirgs classified optically as non-seyferts (linersor hii-regions). in addition to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emissionfeatures at 6.2 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron, the conventional tool ofstarburst-agn separation, we use the optical depths of the 9.7 micron and 18micron silicate dust absorption features to infer the geometry of energysources and dust at the nuclei of these ulirgs, namely, whether the energysources are spatially well mixed with dust(a normal starburst) or are morecentrally concentrated than the dust (a buried agn). infrared spectra of atleast 30%, and possibly 50%, of the observed optical non-seyfert ulirgs arenaturally explained by emission consisting of (1) energetically insignificant,modestly obscured (av &lt; 20-30 mag) pah-emitting normal starbursts, and (2)energetically dominant, highly dust-obscured, centrally concentrated energysources with no pah emission. we interpret the latter component as a buriedagn. the fraction of ulirgs showing some buried agn signatures is higher inliner ulirgs than in hii-region ulirgs. most of the luminous buried agncandidates are found in ulirgs with cool far-infrared colors. where theabsorption-corrected intrinsic agn luminosities are derivable with littleuncertainty, they are found to be of the order of 10^12lsun, accounting for thebulk of the ulirgs' luminosities. the 5-35 micron spectroscopic starburst/agnclassifications are generally consistent with our previous classificationsbased on 3-4 micron spectra for the same sample.

astro-ph;0702377	high-redshift ly alpha emitters with a large equivalent width:  properties of i-dropout galaxies with an nb921-band depression in the subaru  deep field	we report new follow-up spectroscopy of i-dropout galaxies with an nb921-banddepression found in the subaru deep field. the nb921-depressed i-dropoutselection method is expected to select galaxies with large equivalent width lyalpha emission over a wide redshift range, 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5. two of four observedtargets show a strong emission line with a clear asymmetric profile, identifiedas ly alpha emitters at z=6.11 and 6.00. their rest-frame equivalent widths are153a and 114a, which are lower limits on the intrinsic equivalent widths.through our spectroscopic observations (including previous ones) ofnb921-depressed i-dropout galaxies, we identified 5 galaxies in total with arest-frame equivalent width larger than 100a at 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 out of 8 photometriccandidates, which suggests that the nb921-depressed i-dropout selection methodis possibly an efficient way to search for ly alpha emitters with a large lyalpha equivalent width, in a wider redshift range than usual narrow-band excesstechniques. by combining these findings with our previous observationalresults, we infer that the fraction of broad-band selected galaxies having arest-frame equivalent width larger than 100a is significantly higher at z~6(the cosmic age of ~1 gyr) than that at z~3 (~2 gyr), being consistent with theidea that the typical stellar population of galaxies is significantly youngerat z~6 than that at z~3. the nb921-depressed i-dropout galaxies may beinteresting candidates for hosts of massive, zero-metallicity population iiistars.
