math;0206067	minimal atomic complexes	hu, kriz and may recently reexamined ideas implicit in priddy's eleganthomotopy theoretic construction of the brown-peterson spectrum at a prime p.they discussed may's notions of nuclear complexes and of cores of spaces,spectra, and commutative s-algebras. their most striking conclusions, due to huand kriz, were negative: cores are not unique up to equivalence, and bp is nota core of mu considered as a commutative s-algebra, although it is a core of muconsidered as a p-local spectrum. we investigate these ideas further, obtainingmuch more positive conclusions. we show that nuclear complexes have severalnon-obviously equivalent characterizations. up to equivalence, they areprecisely the irreducible complexes, the minimal atomic complexes, and thehurewicz complexes with trivial mod p hurewicz homomorphism above the hurewiczdimension, which we call complexes with no mod p detectable homotopy. unlikethe notion of a nuclear complex, these other notions are all invariant underequivalence. this simple and conceptual criterion for a complex to be minimalatomic allows us to prove that many familiar spectra, such as ko, eo_2, and bopat the prime 2, all bp&lt;n&gt; at any prime p, and the indecomposable wedge summandsof the suspension spectra of $cp^\infty$ and $hp^\infty$ at any prime p areminimal atomic.

0903.3695	e/s0 galaxies on the blue color-stellar mass sequence at z=0: fading  mergers or future spirals?	we identify a population of morphologically defined e/s0 galaxies lying onthe blue sequence at the present epoch. using three samples, we analyzeblue-sequence e/s0s with stellar masses &gt;10^8 msun, arguing that individualobjects may be evolving either up toward the red sequence or down into the bluesequence. blue-sequence e/s0 galaxies become more common with decreasingstellar mass, comprising &lt;2% of e/s0s near the "shutdown mass" m_s ~ 1-2 x10^11 msun, increasing to &gt;5% near the "bimodality mass" m_b ~ 3 x 10^10 msun,and sharply rising to &gt;20-30% below the "threshold mass" m_t ~ 4-6 x 10^9 msun.the strong emergence of blue-sequence e/s0s below m_t coincides with apreviously reported global increase in mean atomic gas fractions below m_t forgalaxies of all types on both sequences, suggesting that the availability ofcold gas may be basic to blue-sequence e/s0s' existence. environmental analysisreveals that many sub-m_b blue-sequence e/s0s reside in low to intermediatedensity environments. in mass-radius and mass-sigma scaling relations,blue-sequence e/s0s are more similar to red-sequence e/s0s than to late-typegalaxies, but they represent a transitional class. while some of them,especially in the high-mass range from m_b to m_s, resemble major-mergerremnants that will likely fade onto the red sequence, most blue-sequence e/s0sbelow m_b show signs of disk and/or pseudobulge building, which may be enhancedby companion interactions. we argue that sub-m_b blue-sequence e/s0s occupy a"sweet spot" in stellar mass and concentration, with both abundant gas andoptimally efficient star formation, which may enable the formation of largespiral disks.

0905.1577	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest). iv. comparison of 1-jy  ultraluminous infrared galaxies with palomar-green quasars	we report the results from a comprehensive study of 74 ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) and 34 palomar-green (pg) quasars within z ~ 0.3$ observedwith the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the contribution of nuclearactivity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using sixindependent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent resultswithin ~ +/-10-15% on average. the average derived agn contribution in ulirgsis ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among "cool" (f_25/f_60 =&lt; 0.2) opticallyclassified hii-like and liner ulirgs to ~50 and ~75% among warm seyfert 2 andseyfert 1 ulirgs, respectively. this number exceeds ~80% in pg qsos. ulirgsfall in one of three distinct agn classes: (1) objects with small extinctionsand large pah equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systemswith large extinctions and modest pah equivalent widths have larger agncontributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ulirgs withboth small extinctions and small pah equivalent widths host agn that are atleast as powerful as the starbursts. the agn contributions in class 2 ulirgsare more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule outthe possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type ofulirgs. a morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), ingeneral agreement with the standard ulirg - qso evolution scenario andsuggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages ofmerger evolution. however, the scatter in this sequence, implies that blackhole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strongchaotic/random component, as in local agn.

0906.2493	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): xii. the head-on collision  in ngc1961	we present high-resolution co(1-0) and co(2-1) maps of the liner 2 galaxyngc1961. this galaxy is unusual among late-type (sc) disk galaxies in having avery large radial extent and inferred dynamical mass. we propose a head-oncollision scenario to explain the perturbed morphology of this galaxy- both theoff-centered rings and the inflated radius. this scenario is supported by thedetection of a steep velocity gradient in the co(1-0) map at the position of asouthwest peak in radio continuum and near-infrared emission. this peak wouldrepresent the remnant of the disrupting companion. we use numerical models todemonstrate the plausibility of the scenario. while ram pressure strippingcould in principle be important for shocking the atomic gas and produce thestriking head-tail morphology, the non detection of this small galaxy group inx-ray emission suggests that any hot intragroup medium has too low a density.the collision with the companion of mass ratio 1:4 produces a lopsided wave,which accounts for the sharp boundary observed in the atomic gas on thesouthern side. we argue that ngc1961 has a strongly warped disk, which givesthe false impression of a nearly face-on system; the main disk is actually moreedge-on, and this error in the true inclination has led to the surprisinglyhigh dynamical mass for a morphologically late-type galaxy. in addition, theoutward propagating ring artificially enlarges the disk. the collisionde-stabilizes the inner disk and can provide gas inflow to the active nucleus.

0910.3097	multi-wavelength properties of spitzer-selected starbursts at z~2	a complete sample of 33 sources believed to be starbursts("5.8micron-peakers") was selected in the (0.5 sq. deg.) j1046+56 field withselection criteria f_(24micron)&gt;400mujy, the presence of a redshifted stellaremission peak at 5.8um, and r'(vega)&gt;23. the field, part of the swire lockmanhole field, benefits from very deep vla/gmrt 20cm, 50cm, and 90cm radio data(all 33 sources are detected at 50cm), and deep 160micron and 70micron spitzerdata. the 33 sources, with photometric redshifts ~1.5-2.5, were observed at1.2mm with iram-30m/mambo to an rms ~0.7-0.8mjy in most cases. theirmillimeter, radio, 7-band spitzer, and near-ir properties were jointlyanalyzed. the entire sample of 33 sources has an average 1.2mm flux density of1.56+/-0.22mjy and a median of 1.61mjy, so the majority of the sources can beconsidered smgs. four sources have confirmed 4sigma detections, and nine weretentatively detected at the 3sigma level. because of its 24micron selection,our sample shows systematically lower f_(1.2mm)/f_(24micron) flux ratios thanclassical smgs, probably because of enhanced pah emission. a median fir sed wasbuilt by stacking images at the positions of 21 sources in the region ofdeepest spitzer coverage. its parameters are t_(dust)=37+/-8k,l_(fir)=2.5x10^{12}lo, and sfr=450mo/yr. the fir-radio correlation providesanother estimate of l_(fir) for each source, with an average value of4.1x10^{12}lo; however, this value may be overestimated because of some agncontribution. most of our targets are also luminous star-forming bzk galaxieswhich constitute a significant fraction of weak smgs at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.3.

0911.2248	gas mass fractions and star formation in blue-sequence e/s0 galaxies	recent work has identified a population of low-redshift e/s0 galaxies thatlie on the blue sequence in color vs. stellar mass parameter space, wherespiral galaxies typically reside. while high-mass blue-sequence e/s0s oftenresemble young merger or interaction remnants likely to fade to the redsequence, we focus on blue-sequence e/s0s with lower stellar masses (&lt; a few10^10 m_sun), which are characterized by fairly regular morphologies andlow-density field environments where fresh gas infall is possible. thispopulation may provide an evolutionary link between early-type galaxies andspirals through disk regrowth. focusing on atomic gas reservoirs, we presentnew gbt hi data for 27 e/s0s on both sequences as well as a complete tabulationof archival hi data for other galaxies in the nearby field galaxy survey.normalized to stellar mass, the atomic gas masses for 12 of the 14blue-sequence e/s0s range from 0.1 to &gt;1.0. these gas-to-stellar mass ratiosare comparable to those of spiral and irregular galaxies and have a similardependence on stellar mass. assuming that the hi is accessible for starformation, we find that many of our blue-sequence e/s0s can increase in stellarmass by 10-60% in 3 gyr in both of two limiting scenarios, exponentiallydeclining star formation and constant star formation. in a constant starformation scenario, about half of the blue-sequence e/s0s require fresh gasinfall on a timescale of &lt;3 gyr to avoid exhausting their atomic gas reservoirsand evolving to the red sequence. we present evidence that star formation inthese galaxies is bursty and likely involves externally triggered gas inflows.our analysis suggests that most blue-sequence e/s0s are indeed capable ofsubstantial stellar disk growth on relatively short timescales.

1006.3691	co j=1-0 spectroscopy of four submillimeter galaxies with the  zpectrometer on the green bank telescope	we report detections of three z ~ 2.5 submillimeter-selected galaxies (smgs;smm j14011+0252, smm j14009+0252, smm j04431+0210) in the lowest rotationaltransition of the carbon monoxide molecule (co j = 1-0) and one nondetection(smm j04433+0210). for the three galaxies we detected, we find aline-integrated brightness temperature ratio of the j = 3-2 and 1-0 lines of0.68 +/- 0.08; the 1-0 line is stronger than predicted by the frequentassumption of equal brightnesses in the two lines and by most single-componentmodels. the observed ratio suggests that mass estimates for smgs based on j =3-2 observations and j = 1-0 column density or mass conversion factors are lowby a factor of 1.5. comparison of the 1-0 line intensities with intensities ofhigher-j transitions indicates that single-component models for theinterstellar media in smgs are incomplete. the small dispersion in the ratio,along with published detections of co lines with j_upper &gt; 3 in most of thesources, indicates that the emission is from multi-component interstellar mediawith physical structures common to many classes of galaxies. this result tendsto rule out the lowest scaling factors between co luminosity and molecular gasmass, and further increases molecular mass estimates calibrated againstobservations of galaxies in the local universe. we also describe anddemonstrate a statistically sound method for finding weak lines in broadbandspectra that will find application in searches for molecular lines from sourcesat unknown redshifts.

1008.3183	the properties of the interstellar medium within a star-forming galaxy  at z=2.3	we present an analysis of the molecular and atomic gas emission in therest-frame far-infrared and sub-millimetre, from the lensed z=2.3sub-millimetre galaxy smm j2135-0102. we obtain very high signal-to-noisedetections of 11 transitions from 3 species and limits on a further 20transitions from 9 species. we use the 12co, [ci] and hcn line strengths toinvestigate the gas mass, kinematic structure and interstellar medium (ism)chemistry, and find strong evidence for a two-phase medium comprising a hot,dense, luminous component and an underlying extended cool, low-excitationmassive component. employing photo-dissociation region models we show that onaverage the molecular gas is exposed to a uv radiation field that is ~1000 xmore intense than the milky way, with star-forming regions having acharacteristic density of n~10^4 /cm^3. these conditions are similar to thosefound in local ulirgs and in the central regions of typical starburst galaxies,even though the star formation rate is far higher in this system. the 12cospectral line energy distribution and line profiles give strong evidence thatthe system comprises multiple kinematic components with different conditions,including temperature, and line ratios suggestive of high cosmic ray fluxwithin clouds. we show that, when integrated over the galaxy, the gas andstar-formation surface densities appear to follow the kennicutt-schmidtrelation, although when compared to high-resolution sub-mm imaging, our datasuggest that this relation breaks down on scales of &lt;100pc. by virtue of thelens amplification, these observations uncover a wealth of information on thestar formation and ism at z~2.3 at a level of detail that has only recentlybecome possible at z&lt;0.1, and show the potential physical properties that willbe studied in unlensed galaxies when alma is in full operation.

1102.5104	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) xv. molecular gas kinematics  in the inner 3kpc of ngc6951	within the nuclei of galaxies project we have obtained iram pdbi and 30m12co(1-0) and 12co(2-1) observations of the spiral galaxy ngc 6951. previouswork shows that there is indirect evidence of gas inflow from 3 kpc down tosmall radii: a large-scale stellar bar, a prominent starburst ring (r~580 pc)and a liner/seyfert 2 nucleus. in this paper we study the gas kinematics astraced by the co line emission in detail. we quantify the influence of thelarge-scale stellar bar by constructing an analytical model of the evolution ofgas particles in a barred potential. from this model gravitational torques andmass accumulation rates are computed. we compare our model-based gravitationaltorque results with previous observationally-based ones. the model also showsthat the large-scale stellar bar is indeed the dominant force for driving thegas inward, to the starburst ring. inside the ring itself a nuclear stellaroval might play an important role. detailed analysis of the co gas kinematicsthere shows that emission arises from two co-spatial, but kinematicallydistinct components at several locations. the main emission component canalways be related to the overall bar-driven gas kinematics. the secondcomponent exhibits velocities that are larger than expected for gas on stableorbits, has a molecular gas mass of 1.8x10^6msun, is very likely connected tothe nuclear stellar oval, and is consistent with inflowing motion towards thevery center. this may form the last link in the chain of gas inflow towards theactive galactic nucleus in ngc 6951.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1308.5681	h-atlas: estimating redshifts of herschel sources from sub-mm fluxes	upon its completion the herschel atlas (h-atlas) will be the largestsubmillimetre survey to date, detecting close to half-a-million sources. itwill only be possible to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a small fractionof these sources. however, if the rest-frame spectral energy distribution (sed)of a typical h-atlas source is known, this sed and the observed herschel fluxescan be used to estimate the redshifts of the h-atlas sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts. in this paper, we use a subset of 40 h-atlas sourceswith previously measured redshifts in the range 0.5&lt;z&lt;4.2 to derive a suitableaverage template for high redshift h-atlas sources. we find that a templatewith two dust components t_c = 23.9 k, t_h = 46.9 k and ratio of mass of colddust to mass of warm dust of 30.1) provides a good fit to the rest-frame fluxesof the sources in our calibration sample. we use a jackknife technique toestimate the accuracy of the redshifts estimated with this template, finding aroot mean square of delta z/(1+z) = 0.26. for sources for which there is priorinformation that they lie at z &gt; 1 we estimate that the rms of delta z/(1+z) =0.12. we have used this template to estimate the redshift distribution for thesources detected in the h-atlas equatorial fields, finding a bimodaldistribution with a mean redshift of 1.2, 1.9 and 2.5 for 250, 350 and 500 umselected sources respectively. \end{abstract}

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

0801.4637	extended silicate dust emission in pg qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the silicate emission observed in pg qsos,based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. scenarios based on theunified model suggest that silicate emission in agn arises mainly from theilluminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation.however, detections of silicate emission in type 2 qsos, and the estimated cooldust temperatures, argue for a more extended emission region.to investigatethis issue we present the mid-infrared spectra of 23 qsos. these spectra, andespecially the silicate emission features at ~10 and ~18 mu can be fitted usingdusty narrow line region (nlr) models and a combination of black bodies. thebolometric luminosities of the qsos allow us to derive the radial distances andcovering factors for the silicate-emitting dust. the inferred radii are 100-200times larger than the dust sublimation radius, much larger than the expecteddimensions of the inner torus. our qso mid-ir spectra are consistent with thebulk of the silicate dust emission arising from the dust in the innermost partsof the nlr.

1401.4120	alma reveals the feeding of the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 1566	we report alma observations of co(3-2) emission in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc1566, at a spatial resolution of 25 pc. our aim is to investigate themorphology and dynamics of the gas inside the central kpc, and to probe nuclearfueling and feedback phenomena. ngc 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1.7 kpc radiusand a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. the alma fieldof view, of diameter 0.9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals amolecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300~pc in size, which iscontributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative gravity torques.  the spiral starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds upin a pseudo-ring at the inner lindblad resonance (ilr) of the nuclear bar.  this is the first time that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seendriving the gas inwards inside the ilr ring of the nuclear bar. this phenomenonshows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influenceon the gas, triggering its fueling.  the gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen throughextinction in hst images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87mmcontinuum. this continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heatedby the interstellar radiation field. the hcn(4-3) and hco+(4-3) lines weresimultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. the hco+(4-3) line is3 times stronger than the hcn(4-3), as expected when star formation excitationdominates over active galactic nucleus (agn) heating. the co(3-2)/hco+(4-3)integrated intensity ratio is \sim 100.  the molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slightnon-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms. theseperturbations are quite small, and no outflow nor agn feedback is detected.

astro-ph;0306140	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga) i.the counter-rotating liner  ngc4826	we present new high-resolution observations of the nucleus of thecounter-rotating liner ngc4826, made in the j=1-0 and j=2-1 lines of 12co withthe iram plateau de bure mm-interferometer(pdbi).the co maps, which achieve0.8''(16pc) resolution in the 2-1 line, fully resolve an inner molecular gasdisk which is truncated at an outer radius of 700pc. the total molecular gasmass is distributed in a lopsided nuclear disk of 40pc radius and two one-armspirals, which develop at different radii in the disk. the distribution andkinematics of molecular gas in the inner 1kpc of ngc4826 show the prevalence ofdifferent types of m=1 perturbations in the gas. although dominated byrotation, the gas kinematics are perturbed by streaming motions related to them=1 instabilities. the non-circular motions associated with the inner m=1perturbations agree qualitatively with the pattern expected for a trailing wavedeveloped outside corotation ('fast' wave). in contrast, the streaming motionsin the outer m=1 spiral are better explained by a 'slow' wave. a paradoxicalconsequence is that the inner m=1 perturbations would not favour agn feeding.an independent confirmation that the agn is not being generously fueled atpresent is found in the low values of the gravitational torques exerted by thestellar potential for r&lt;530pc. the distribution of star formation in the diskof ngc4826 is also strongly asymmetrical. massive star formation is stillvigorous, fed by the significant molecular gas reservoir at r&lt;700pc. there issupporting evidence for a recent large mass inflow episode in ngc4826.  these observations have been made in the context of the nuclei of galaxies(nuga) project, aimed at the study of the different mechanisms for gas fuelingof agn.

astro-ph;0512055	probing for evolutionary links between local ulirgs and qsos from nir  spectroscopy	we present a study of the dynamical evolution of ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs), merging galaxies of infrared luminosity &gt;10^12 l_sun. duringour very large telescope large program, we have obtained isaac near-infrared,high-resolution spectra of 54 ulirgs (at several merger phases) and 12 localpalomar-green qsos to investigate whether ulirgs go through a qso phase duringtheir evolution. one possible evolutionary scenario is that after nuclearcoalescence, the black hole radiates close to eddington to produce qsoluminosities. the mean stellar velocity dispersion that we measure from ourspectra is similar (~160 km/s) for 30 post-coalescence ulirgs and 7 ir-brightqsos. the black holes in both populations have masses of order 10^7-10^8 m_sun(calculated from the relation to the host dispersion) and accrete at rates &gt;0.5eddington. placing ulirgs and ir-bright qsos on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies shows that they are located on a similar region (that ofmoderate-mass ellipticals), in contrast to giant ellipticals and radio-loudqsos. while this preliminary comparison of the ulirg and qso host kinematicalproperties indicates that (some) ulirgs may undergo a qso phase in theirevolutionary history before they settle down as ellipticals, further data onnon-ir excess qsos are necessary to test this scenario.

astro-ph;0606158	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest): i. the origin of the  far infrared continuum of qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the far-infrared (fir) continuum of qsos,based on the quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest) of nearby qsos and ulirgsusing observations with the spitzer space telescope. for 27 palomar-green qsosat z &lt;~ 0.3, we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([neii]12.8um,[nev]14.3um, [oiv]25.9um) and emission features (pah7.7um emission which isrelated to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range ofmid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60um. we detect star-formationrelated pah emission in 11/26 qsos and fine-structure line emission in all ofthem, often in multiple lines. the detection of pahs in the average spectrum ofsources which lack individual pah detections provides further evidence for thewidespread presence of pahs in qsos. similar pah/fir and [neii]/fir ratios arefound in qsos and in starburst-dominated ulirgs and lower luminositystarbursts. we conclude that the typical qso in our sample has at least 30% butlikely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)lsun) arising fromstar formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at thelargest fir luminosities. in the qso sample, we find correlations between mostof the quantities studied including combinations of agn tracers and starbursttracers. the common scaling of agn and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) isevidence for a starburst-agn connection in luminous agn. strong correlations offar-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (pah, low excitation[neii]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infraredemission.

astro-ph;0607468	dynamical properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. ii. traces of  dynamical evolution and end products of local ultraluminous mergers	we present results from our very large telescope large program to study thedynamical evolution of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos.this paper is the second in a series presenting the stellar kinematics of 54ulirgs, derived from high resolution, long-slit h- and k-band spectroscopy. thedata presented here, including observations of 17 new targets, are mainlyfocused on sources that have coalesced into a single nucleus. the stellarkinematics, extracted from the co ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,indicate that ulirg remnants are dynamically heated systems with a meandispersion of 161 km/s. the combination of kinematic, structural, andphotometric properties of the remnants indicate that they mostly originate frommajor mergers and that they result in the formation of systems supported byrandom motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. the peak of the velocitydispersion distribution and the locus of ulirgs on the fundamental plane ofearly-type galaxies indicate that the end products of ultraluminous mergers aretypically moderate-mass ellipticals (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 m_sun).converting the host dispersion into black hole mass with the aid of them_bh-sigma relation yields black hole mass estimates of the order 10^7 - 10^8m_sun and high accretion rates with eddington efficiencies often &gt;0.5.

astro-ph;0611769	intense star-formation and feedback at high redshift: spatially-resolved  properties of the z=2.6 submillimeter galaxy smmj14011+0252	we present a detailed analysis of the spatially-resolved properties of thelensed submillimeter galaxy smmj14011+0252 at z=2.56, combining deepnear-infrared integral-field data obtained with spiffi on the vlt with othermulti-wavelength data sets. the broad characteristics of smmj14011+0252 are inagreement with what is expected for the early evolution of local massivespheroidal galaxies. from continuum and line flux, velocity, and dispersionmaps, we measure the kinematics, star-formation rates, gas densities, andextinction for individual subcomponents. the star formation intensity issimilar to low-redshift ``maximal starbursts'', while the line fluxes and thedynamics of the emission line gas provide direct evidence for astarburst-driven wind with physical properties very similar to localsuperwinds. we also find circumstantial evidence for "self-regulated" starformation within j1. the relative velocity of the bluer companion j2 yields adynamical mass estimate for j1 within about 20 kpc, m_dyn \sim 1\times 10^{11}m_sun. the relative metallicity of j2 is 0.4 dex lower than in j1n/s,suggesting different star formation histories. sed fitting of the continuumpeak j1c confirms and substantiates previous suggestions that this component isa z=0.25 interloper. when removing j1c, the stellar continuum and h-alpha lineemission appear well aligned spatially in two individual components j1n andj1s, and coincide with two kinematically distinct regions in the velocity map,which might well indicate a merging system. this highlights the closesimilarity between smgs and ulirgs, which are often merger-driven maximalstarbursts, and suggests that the intrinsic mechanisms of star-formation andrelated feedback are similar to low-redshift strongly star-forming systems.

astro-ph;0701403	molecular gas in nuclei of galaxies (nuga): vi. detection of a molecular  gas disk/torus via hcn in the seyfert2 galaxy ngc6951?	several studies of nearby active galaxies indicate significantly higherhcn-to-co intensity ratios in agn than in starburst (sb) environments. hcnenhancement can be caused by many different effects, such as higher gasdensities/temperatures, uv/x-ray radiation, and non-collisional excitation. asactive galaxies often exhibit intense circumnuclear sb, high angularresolution/sensitivity observations are of paramount importance todisentangling the influence of sb from that of nuclear activity on thechemistry of the surrounding molecular gas. the tight relation of hcnenhancement and nuclear activity may qualify hcn as an ideal tracer ofmolecular gas close to the agn, providing complementary and additionalinformation to that gained via co. ngc6951 houses nuclear and sb activity,making it an ideal testbed in which to study the effects of differentexcitation conditions on the molecular gas. we used the new abcd configurationsof the iram pdbi to observe hcn(1-0) in ngc6951 at high angular resolution(1''). we detect very compact (&lt;50pc) hcn emission in its nucleus, supportingprevious hints of nuclear gas structure. our observations also reveal hcnemission in the sb ring and resolve it into several peaks, leading to a highercoincidence between the hcn and co distributions than previously reported. wefind a significantly higher hcn-to-co intensity ratio (&gt;0.4) in the nucleusthan in the sb ring (0.02-0.05). as for ngc1068, this might result from ahigher hcn abundance in the centre due to an x-ray dominated gas chemistry, buta higher gas density/temperature or additional non-collisional excitation ofhcn cannot be entirely ruled out, based on these observations. the compact hcnemission is associated with rotating gas in a circumnuclear disk/torus.

astro-ph;0701816	a mid-infrared spectroscopic study of submillimeter galaxies: luminous  starbursts at high redshift	we present rest frame mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 13submillimeter galaxies, obtained using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on boardthe spitzer space telescope. the sample includes exclusively bright objectsfrom blank fields and cluster lens assisted surveys that have accurateinterferometric positions. we find that the majority of spectra are well fittedby a starburst template or by the superposition of pah emission features and aweak mid-infrared continuum, the latter a tracer of active galactic nuclei(including compton-thick ones). we obtain mid-infrared spectroscopic redshiftsfor all nine sources detected with irs. for three of them the redshifts werepreviously unknown. the median value of the redshift distribution is z~2.8 ifwe assume that the four irs non-detections are at high redshift. the median forthe irs detections alone is z~2.7. placing the irs non-detections at similarredshift would require rest frame mid-ir obscuration larger than is seen inlocal ulirgs. the rest frame mid-infrared spectra and mid- to far-infraredspectral energy distributions are consistent with those of local ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, but scaled-up further in luminosity. the mid-infraredspectra support the scenario that submillimeter galaxies are sites of extremestar formation, rather than x-ray-obscured agn, and represent a critical phasein the formation of massive galaxies.
