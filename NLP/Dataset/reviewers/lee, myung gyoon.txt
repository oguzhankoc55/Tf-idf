0901.3256	north ecliptic pole wide field survey of akari: survey strategy and data  characteristics	we present the survey strategy and the data characteristics of the northecliptic pole (nep) wide survey of akari. the survey was carried out for aboutone year starting from may 2006 with 9 passbands from 2.5 to 24 micron and theareal coverage of about 5.8 sq. degrees centered on nep. the survey depthreaches to 21.8 ab magnitude near infrared (nir) bands, and ~ 18.6 abmaggnitude at the mid infrared (mir) bands such as 15 and 18 micron. the totalnumber of sources detected in this survey is about 104,000, with more sourcesin nir than in the mir. we have cross matched infrared sources with opticallyidentified sources in cfht imaging survey which covered about 2 sq. degreeswithin nep-wide survey region in order to characterize the nature of infraredsources. the majority of the mid infrared sources at 15 and 18 micron band arefound to be star forming disk galaxies, with smaller fraction of early typegalaxies and agns. we found that a large fraction (60~80 %) of bright sourcesin 9 and 11 micron stars while stellar fraction decreases toward faintersources. we present the histograms of the sources at mid infrared bands at 9,11, 15 and 18 micron. the number of sources per magnitude thus varies as m^0.6for longer wavelength sources while shorter wavelength sources show steepervariation with m, where m is the ab magnitude.

0704.1182	an optical source catalog of the north ecliptic pole region	we present a five (u*,g',r',i',z') band optical photometry catalog of thesources in the north ecliptic pole (nep) region based on deep observations madewith megacam at cfht. the source catalog covers about 2 square degree areacentered at the nep and reaches depths of about 26 mag for u*, g', r' bands,about 25 mag for i' band, and about 24 mag for z' band (4 sigma detection overan 1 arcsec aperture). the total number of cataloged sources brighter than r'=23 mag is about 56,000 including both point sources and extended sources. fromthe investigation of photometric properties using the color-magnitude diagramsand color-color diagrams, we have found that the colors of extended sources aremostly (u*-r') &lt; 3.0 and (g'-z') &gt; 0.5. this can be used to separate theextended sources from the point sources reliably, even for the faint sourcedomain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly workefficiently. we have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the redsequence galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey data. by applying thisrelation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities,we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.

0903.2922	the mid-infrared view of red sequence galaxies in abell 2218 with akari	we present the {\it akari} infrared camera (irc) imaging observation ofearly-type galaxies in a2218 at z $\simeq$ 0.175. mid-infrared (mir) emissionfrom early-type galaxies traces circumstellar dust emission from agb starsor/and residual star formation. including the unique imaging capability at 11and 15 $\mu$m, our {\it akari} data provide an effective way to investigate mirproperties of early-type galaxies in the cluster environment. among ourflux-limited sample of 22 red sequence early-type galaxies with precisedynamical and line strength measurements ($&lt;$ 18 mag at 3 $\mu m$), we findthat at least 41% have mir-excess emission. the $n3-s11$ versus $n3$ (3 and 11$\mu$m) color-magnitude relation shows the expected blue sequence, but themir-excess galaxies add a red wing to the relation especially at the fainterend. a sed analysis reveals that the dust emission from agb stars is the mostlikely cause for the mir-excess, with low level of star formation being thenext possible explanation. the mir-excess galaxies show a wide spread of$n3-s11$ colors, implying a significant spread (2--11 gyr) in the estimatedmean ages of stellar populations. we study the environmental dependence ofmir-excess early-type galaxies over an area out to a half virial radius($\sim$1 mpc). we find that the mir-excess early-type galaxies arepreferentially located in the outer region. from these evidences, we suggestthat the fainter, mir-excess early-type galaxies have just joined the redsequence, possibly due to the infall and subsequent morphological/spectraltransformation induced by the cluster environment.

0907.5102	star formation history and chemical evolution of the sextans dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	we present the star formation history and chemical evolution of the sextansdsph dwarf galaxy as a function of galactocentric distance. we derive thesefrom the $vi$ photometry of stars in the $42' \times 28'$ field using the smartmodel developed by yuk &amp; lee (2007, apj, 668, 876) and adopting a closed-boxmodel for chemical evolution. for the adopted age of sextans 15 gyr, we findthat $&gt;$84% of the stars formed prior to 11 gyr ago, significant star formationextends from 15 to 11 gyr ago ($\sim$ 65% of the stars formed 13 to 15 gyr agowhile $\sim$ 25% formed 11 to 13 gyr ago), detectable star formation continuedto at least 8 gyr ago, the star formation history is more extended in thecentral regions than the outskirts, and the difference in star formation ratesbetween the central and outer regions is most marked 11 to 13 gyr ago. whetherblue straggler stars are interpreted as intermediate age main sequence starsaffects conclusions regarding the star formation history for times 4 to 8 gyrago, but this is at most only a trace population. we find that the metallicityof the stars increased rapidly up to [fe/h]=--1.6 in the central region and to[fe/h]=--1.8 in the outer region within the first gyr, and has varied slowlysince then. the abundance ratios of several elements derived in this study arein good agreement with the observational data based on the high resolutionspectroscopy in the literature. we conclude that the primary driver for theradial gradient of the stellar population in this galaxy is the star formationhistory, which self-consistently drives the chemical enrichment history.

0909.3541	the nature of the sdss galaxies in various classes based on morphology,  colour and spectral features - ii. multi-wavelength properties	we present a multi-wavelength study of the nature of the sdss galaxiesdivided into fine classes based on their morphology, colour and spectralfeatures. the sdss galaxies are classified into early-type and late-type; redand blue; passive, hii, seyfert and liner, which returns a total of 16 fineclasses of galaxies. the properties of galaxies in each fine class areinvestigated from radio to x-ray, using 2mass, iras, first, nvss, galex androsat data. the uv - optical - nir colours of blue early-type galaxies (begs)seem to result from the combination of old stellar population and recent starformation (sf). non-passive red early-type galaxies (regs) have largermetallicity and younger age than passive regs, which implies that non-passiveregs have suffered recent sf adding young and metal-rich stars to them. theradio detection fraction of regs strongly depends on their optical absolutemagnitudes, while that of most late-type galaxies does not, implying thedifference in their radio sources: agn and sf. the uv - optical colours and theradio detection fraction of passive rlgs show that they have properties similarto regs rather than non-passive rlgs. dust extinction may not be a dominantfactor making rlgs red, because rlgs are detected in the mid- and far-infraredbands less efficiently than blue late-type galaxies (blgs). the passive blgshave very blue uv - optical - nir colours, implying either recent sf quenchingor current sf in their outskirts. including star formation rate, othermulti-wavelength properties in each fine class are investigated, and theirimplication on the identity of each fine class is discussed (abridged).

0911.4386	the nature of the sloan digital sky survey galaxies in various classes  based on morphology, colour and spectral features - iii. environments	we present a study on the environments of the sdss galaxies divided into fineclasses based on their morphology, colour and spectral features. the sdssgalaxies are classified into early-type and late-type; red and blue; passive,hii, seyfert and liner, which returns a total of 16 fine classes of galaxies.we estimate the local number density, target-excluded local luminosity density,local colour, close pair fraction and the luminosity and colour of thebrightest neighbour, which are compared between the fine classescomprehensively. the morphology-colour class of galaxies strongly depends onthe local density, with the approximate order of high-density preference: redearly-type galaxies (regs) -- red late-type galaxies (rlgs) -- blue early-typegalaxies (begs) -- blue late-type galaxies (blgs). we find that high-densityenvironments (like cluster environments) seem to suppress agn activity. thepair fraction of hii regs does not show statistically significant differencefrom that of passive regs, while the pair fraction of hii blgs is smaller thanthat of non-hii blgs. hii blgs show obvious double (red + blue) peaks in thedistribution of the brightest neighbour colour, while red galaxies show asingle red peak. the brightest neighbours of seyfert blgs tend to be blue,while those of liner blgs tend to be red, which implies that the differencebetween seyfert and liner may be related to the pair interaction. other variousenvironments of the fine classes are investigated, and their implication ongalaxy evolution is discussed.

0912.3540	a wide-field photometric survey for extratidal tails around five  metal-poor globular clusters in the galactic halo	wide-field deep gri images obtained with the megacam of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) are used to investigate the spatialconfiguration of stars around five metal-poor globular cluster m15, m30, m53,ngc 5053, and ngc 5466, in a field-of-view ~3 degree. applying a mask filteringalgorithm to the color-magnitude diagrams of the observed stars, we sortedcluster's member star candidates that are used to examine the characteristicsof the spatial stellar distribution surrounding the target clusters. thesmoothed surface density maps and the overlaid isodensity contours indicatethat all of the five metal-poor globular clusters exhibit strong evidence ofextratidal overdensity features over their tidal radii, in the form of extendedtidal tails around the clusters. the orientations of the observed extratidalfeatures show signatures of tidal tails tracing the clusters' orbits, inferredfrom their proper motions, and effects of dynamical interactions with thegalaxy. our findings include detections of a tidal bridge-like feature and anenvelope structure around the pair of globular clusters m53 and ngc 5053. theobserved radial surface density profiles of target clusters have a deviationfrom theoretical king models, for which the profiles show a break at0.5~0.7r_t, extending the overdensity features out to 1.5~2r_t. both radialsurface density profiles for different angular sections and azimuthal numberdensity profiles confirm the overdensity features of tidal tails around thefive metal-poor globular clusters. our results add further observationalevidence that the observed metal-poor halo globular clusters originate from anaccreted satellite system, indicative of the merging scenario of the formationof the galactic halo.

1006.2166	environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies	we study the environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) found in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data. the lirg and ulirg samples are constructed bycross-correlating spectroscopic catalogs of galaxies of the sdss data release 7and the infrared astronomical satellite faint source catalog. we examine theeffects of the large-scale background density (sigma_5), galaxy clusters, andthe nearest neighbor galaxy on the properties of infrared galaxies (irgs). wefind that the fraction of lirgs plus ulirgs among irgs (f_(u)lirgs) and theinfrared luminosity (l_ir) of irgs strongly depend on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy: the probability for an irg to be a(u)lirg (f_(u)lirgs) and its l_ir both increase as it approaches a late-typegalaxy, but decrease as it approaches an early-type galaxy (within half thevirial radius of its neighbor). we find no dependence of f_(u)lirgs on thebackground density (surface galaxy number density) at fixed stellar mass ofgalaxies. the dependence of f_(u)lirgs on the distance to galaxy clusters isalso found to be very weak, but in highest-density regions such as the centerof galaxy clusters, few (u)lirgs are found. these environmental dependence oflirgs and ulirgs and the evolution of star formation rate (sfr)-environmentrelation from high redshifts to low redshifts seem to support the idea thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions/merging play a critical role in triggering the starformation activity of lirgs and ulirgs.

1011.6408	merging galaxy cluster abell 2255 in mid-infrared	we present the mid-infrared (mir) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster,abell 2255 by the akari space telescope. using the akari's continuouswavelength coverage between 3-24 micron and the wide field of view, weinvestigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall ofthe galaxies, the cluster substructures, and the cluster-cluster mergerinfluence their evolution. we show that the excess of mir (11 micron) flux is agood indicator to discriminate galaxies at different evolutionary stages, anddivide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong mir-excess (n3-s11&gt;0.2)galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies, weakmir-excess (-2.0&lt;n3-s11&lt;-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (&gt;5 gyr)galaxies where the mir emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dustaround agb stars, and intermediate mir-excess (-1.2&lt;n3-s11&lt;0.2) galaxies inbetween the two classes that are less than a few gyrs old past the prime starformation activity. with the mir-excess diagnostics, we investigate how localand cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. we derive thetotal star formation rate of ~130 msun/yr for a2255 using the strong mir-excessgalaxies, which is consistent with other clusters of galaxies at similarredshifts and with similar masses. we find no strong evidence that supportsenhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructureregion. the intermediate mir-excess galaxies, representing galaxies intransition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are locatedpreferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures. ourfindings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxiesinto red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core,which can be well-explained by the ram-pressure stripping as previoussimulation suggests.

1101.5262	optical spectral classification of southern ultraluminous infrared  galaxies	we present a study of the optical spectral properties of 115 ultraluminousinfrared galaxies (ulirgs) in the southern sky. using the optical spectraobtained at ctio 4 m and provided by the 2df galaxy redshift survey and the 6dfgalaxy survey, we measure emission line widths and fluxes for spectralclassification. we determine the spectral types of ulirgs with h_alphameasurement using the standard diagnostic diagrams. for ulirgs without h_alphameasurement, we determine their spectral types using the plane of flux ratiobetween [oiii]_lambda5007 and h_beta versus [oiii] line width based on our newempirical criterion. this criterion is efficient to distinguish active galacticnuclei (agns) from non-agn galaxies with completeness and reliability of about90 per cent. the sample of 115 ulirgs is found to consist of 8 broad-line agns,49 narrow-line agns, and 58 non-agns. the agn fraction is on average 50 percent and increases with infrared luminosity and iras 25-60 micron colour,consistent with previous studies. the iras 25-60 micron colour distributionsare significantly different between agn and non-agn ulirgs, while their iras60-100 micron colour distributions are similar.

1104.3669	hii region luminosity function of the interacting galaxy m51	we present a study of hii regions in m51 using the hubble space telescope acsimages taken as part of the hubble heritage program. we have catalogued about19,600 hii regions in m51 with ha luminosity in the range of l = 10^{35.5}erg/s to 10^{39.0} erg/s. the ha luminosity function of hii regions (hii lf) inm51 is well represented by a double power law with its index alpha=-2.25\pm0.02for the bright part and alpha=-1.42\pm0.01 for the faint part, separated at abreak point l= 10^{37.1} erg/s. this break was not found in previous studies ofm51 hii regions. comparison with simulated hii lfs suggests that this break iscaused by the transition of hii region ionizing sources, from low mass clusters(with ~ 10^3 m_sun, including several ob stars) to more massive clusters(including several tens of ob stars). the hii lfs with l &lt; 10^{37.1} erg/s arefound to have different slopes for different parts in m51: the hii lf for theinterarm region is steeper than those for the arm and the nuclear regions. thisobserved difference in hii lfs can be explained by evolutionary effects thathii regions in the interarm region are relatively older than those in the otherparts of m51.

1110.1933	dependence of barred galaxy fraction on galaxy properties and  environment	we investigate the dependence of occurrence of bars in galaxies on galaxyproperties and environment. we use a volume-limited sample of 33,391 galaxiesbrighter than $m_{r}=-19.5+5$log$h$ at $0.02\le z\le0.05489$, drawn from thesdss dr 7. we classify the galaxies into early and late types, and identifybars by visual inspection. among 10,674 late-type galaxies with axis ratio$b/a&gt;0.60$, we find 3,240 barred galaxies ($f_{bar}=30.4%$) which divide into2,542 strong bars ($f_{sb1}=23.8%$) and 698 weak bars ($f_{sb2}=6.5%$). we findthat $f_{sb1}$ increases as $u-r$ color becomes redder, and that it has amaximum value at intermediate velocity dispersion ($\sigma\simeq$150 kms$^{-1}$). this trend suggests that strong bars are dominantly hosted byintermediate-mass systems. weak bars prefer bluer galaxies with lower mass andlower concentration. in the case of strong bars, their dependence on theconcentration index appears only for massive galaxies with $\sigma&gt;150$ kms$^{-1}$. we also find that $f_{bar}$ does not directly depend on thelarge-scale background density when other physical parameters ($u-r$ color or$\sigma$) are fixed. we discover that $f_{sb1}$ decreases as the separation tothe nearest neighbor galaxy becomes smaller than 0.1 times the virial radius ofthe neighbor regardless of neighbor's morphology. these results imply thatstrong bars are likely to be destroyed during strong tidal interactions, andthat the mechanism for this phenomenon is gravitational and not hydrodynamical.the fraction of weak bars has no correlation with environmental parameters. wedo not find any direct evidence for environmental stimulation of bar formation.

1111.6693	akari observation of the north ecliptic pole (nep) supercluster at z =  0.087: mid-infrared view of transition galaxies	we present the mid-infrared (mir) properties of galaxies within asupercluster in the north ecliptic pole region at z?0.087 observed with theakari satellite. we use data from the akari nep-wide (5.4 deg2) ir survey andthe clusters of galaxies evolution studies (clevl) mission program. we showthat near-ir (3 {\mu}m)-mid- ir (11 {\mu}m) color can be used as an indicatorof the specific star formation rate and the presence of intermediate agestellar populations. from the mir observations, we find that red-sequencegalaxies consist not only of passively evolving red early-type galaxies, butalso of 1) "weak-sfg" (disk-dominated star-forming galaxies which have starformation rates lower by \sim 4 \times than blue-cloud galaxies), and 2)"intermediate- mxg" (bulge-dominated galaxies showing stronger mir dustemission than normal red early-type galaxies). those two populations can be aset of transition galaxies from blue, star-forming, late-type galaxies evolvinginto red, quiescent, early-type ones. we find that the weak-sfg are predominantat intermediate masses (1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1010.5m\odot) and are typicallyfound in local densities similar to the outskirts of galaxy clusters. as muchas 40% of the supercluster member galaxies in this mass range can be classifiedas weak-sfgs, but their proportion decreases to &lt; 10% at larger masses (m\star&gt; 1010.5 m\odot) at any galaxy density. the fraction of the intermediate-mxgamong red- sequence galaxies at 1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1011m\odot also decreasesas the density and mass increase. in particular, \sim42% of the red-sequencegalaxies with early-type morphologies are classified as intermediate-mxg atintermediate densities. these results suggest that the star formation activityis strongly dependent on the stellar mass, but that the morphologicaltransformation is mainly controlled by the environment.

1203.1693	do bars trigger activity in galactic nuclei?	we investigate the connection between the presence of bars and agn activity,using a volume-limited sample of $\sim$9,000 late-type galaxies with axis ratio$b/a&gt;0.6$ and $m_{r} &lt; -19.5+5{\rm log}h$ at low redshift ($0.02\le z\lesssim0.055$), selected from sloan digital sky survey data release 7. we find thatthe bar fraction in agn-host galaxies (42.6%) is $\sim$2.5 times higher than innon-agn galaxies (15.6%), and that the agn fraction is a factor of two higherin strong-barred galaxies (34.5%) than in non-barred galaxies (15.0%). however,these trends are simply caused by the fact that agn-host galaxies are onaverage more massive and redder than non-agn galaxies because the fraction ofstrong-barred galaxies ($\bfrsbo$) increases with $u-r$ color and stellarvelocity dispersion. when $u-r$ color and velocity dispersion (or stellar mass)are fixed, both the excess of $\bfrsbo$ in agn-host galaxies and the enhancedagn fraction in strong-barred galaxies disappears. among agn-host galaxies wefind no strong difference of the eddington ratio distributions between barredand non-barred systems. these results indicate that agn activity is notdominated by the presence of bars, and that agn power is not enhanced by bars.in conclusion we do not find a clear evidence that bars trigger agn activity.

1204.3879	early type galaxies with tidal debris and their scaling relations in the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	tidal debris around galaxies can yield important clues on their evolution. wehave identified tidal debris in 11 early type galaxies (t \leq 0) from a sampleof 65 early types drawn from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s4g). the tidal debris includes features such as shells, ripples andtidal tails. a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional decompositionof galactic structures, was used to quantify the residual tidal features. thetidal debris contributes ~3 - 10% to the total 3.6 {\mu}m luminosity of thehost galaxy. structural parameters of the galaxies were estimated usingtwo-dimensional profile fitting. we investigate the locations of galaxies withtidal debris in the fundamental plane and kormendy relation. we find thatgalaxies with tidal debris lie within the scatter of early type galaxieswithout tidal features. assuming that the tidal debris is indicative of recentgravitational interaction or merger, this suggests that these galaxies haveeither undergone minor merging events so that the overall structural propertiesof the galaxies are not significantly altered, or they have undergone a majormerging events but already have experienced sufficient relaxation andphase-mixing so that their structural properties become similar to those of thenon-interacting early type galaxies.

1210.1644	the 3.3 micron pah emission as a star formation rate indicator	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features dominate themid-infrared spectra of star-forming galaxies and can be useful to calibratestar formation rates and diagnose ionized states of grains. however, the pah3.3 micron feature has not been studied as much as other pah features since itis weaker than others and resides outside of spitzer capability. in order todetect and calibrate the 3.3 micron pah emission and investigate its potentialas a star formation rate indicator, we carried out an akari mission program,akari mjy unbiased survey of extragalactic survey (amuses) and compare itssample with various literature samples. we obtained 2 ~5 micron low resolutionspectra of 20 flux-limited galaxies with mixed sed classes, which yields thedetection of the 3.3 micron pah emission from three out of 20 galaxies. for thecombined sample of amuses and literature samples, the 3.3 micron pahluminosities correlate with the infrared luminosities of star-forming galaxies,albeit with a large scatter (1.5 dex). the correlation appears to break down atthe domain of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), and the power of the3.3 micron pah luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity is hampered atlog[l(pah3.3)/(erg/sec)] &gt; -42.0. possible origins for this deviation in thecorrelation are discussed, including contribution from agn and stronglyobscured ysos, and the destruction of pah molecules in ulirgs.

0712.1420	a catalog of bright star clusters in the interacting galaxy m51	we present a catalog of star clusters with v_{f555w}&lt;23 mag detected in theinteracting spiral galaxy m51 system based on the mosaic images taken with hstacs by the hubble heritage team. we have selected about 3,600 clusters based ontheir morphological information through the visual inspection. the final starcluster catalog includes 2,224 clusters that are relatively well isolated andhave a circular shape. the star clusters in m51 are mostly distributed aroundthe spiral arms of ngc 5194. the color-magnitude diagrams show that most of thestar clusters in m51 are bluer than (b_{f435w}-v_{f555w}) = 0.5 and(v_{f555w}-i_{f814w}) = 0.8. there are also some red star clusters with(b_{f435w}-v_{f555w}) &gt; 0.7, uniformly distributed over the m51 field. some ofthese red clusters are suspected to be a part of the halo or old diskpopulation based on their old ages (t &gt;= 10^9 yrs) and their spatialdistribution. the luminosity function of the star clusters is fit well by asingle power law with \alpha = -2.59 \pm 0.03 for the range -10.0 &lt;m_v &lt; -8.0mag. we find that the size distribution of the star clusters can be fit withthree gaussian components with peaks at effective radii of 2.27, 4.80 and 7.51pc. some large star clusters with red color are faint fuzzy clusters, and theyare distributed not only around ngc 5195 but also around ngc 5194. these faintfuzzies are found to display an elongated spatial distribution, while thenormal compact red clusters show a relatively uniform distribution around ngc5194.

0712.2301	galaxy orbits for galaxy clusters in sloan digital sky survey and 2df  galaxy redshift survey	we present the results of a study for galaxy orbits in galaxy clusters usinga spectroscopic sample of galaxies in sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and 2dfgalaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). we have determined the member galaxies ofabell clusters covered by these surveys using the galaxies' redshift andpositional data. we have selected 10 clusters using three criteria: the numberof member galaxies is greater than or equal to 40, the spatial coverage iscomplete, and x-ray mass profile is available in the literature. we derive theradial profile of the galaxy number density and velocity dispersion using all,early-type, and late-type galaxies for each cluster. we have investigated thegalaxy orbits for our sample clusters with constant and variable velocityanisotropies over the clustercentric distance using jeans equation. using allmember galaxies, the galaxy orbits are found to be isotropic within theuncertainty for most of sample clusters, although it is difficult to concludestrongly for some clusters due the large errors and the variation as a functionof the clustercentric distance in the calculated velocity anisotropies. weinvestigated the orbital difference between early-type and late-type galaxiesfor four sample clusters, and found no significant difference between them.

1301.7149	the star cluster system in the nearby starburst galaxy m82	we present a photometric study of star clusters in the nearby starburstgalaxy m82 based on the ubvi, yj and h band hubble space telescope images. wefind 1105 star clusters with v&lt;23 mag. 1070 of them are located in the diskregion, while 35 star clusters are in the halo region. the star clusters in thedisk are composed of a dominant blue population with a color peak at (b-v)0 ~0.45, and a weaker red population. the luminosity function of the disk clustersshows a power-law distribution with a power law index alpha=-2.04+-0.03, andthe scale height of their distribution is h_z=9".64+-0".40 (164 +- 7 pc),similar to that of the stellar thin disk of m82. we have derived the ages of~630 star clusters using the spectral energy distribution fit method bycomparing ubvi(yj)h band photometric data with the simple stellar populationmodels. the age distribution of the disk clusters shows that the most dominantcluster population has ages ranging from 100 myr to 1 gyr, with a peak at about500 myr. this suggests that m82 has undergone a disk-wide star formation about500 myr ago, probably through the interaction with m81. the brightest starclusters in the nuclear region are much brighter than those in other regions,indicating that more massive star clusters are formed in the denserenvironments. on the other hand, the colors of the halo clusters are similar tothose of globular clusters in the milky way galaxy, and their ages areestimated to be older than 1 gyr. these are probably genuine old globularclusters in m82.

1305.4644	activity in galactic nuclei of compact group galaxies in the local  universe	we study the nuclear activity of galaxies in local compact groups. we use aspectroscopic sample of 238 galaxies in 58 compact groups from the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 to estimate the fraction of agn-host galaxiesin compact groups, and to compare it with those in cluster and field regions.we use emission-line ratio diagrams to identify agn-host galaxies, and findthat the agn fraction of compact group galaxies is 17-42% depending on the agnclassification method. the agn fraction in compact groups is not the highestamong the galaxy environments. this trend remains even if we use severalsubsamples segregated by galaxy morphology and optical luminosity. the agnfraction for early-type galaxies decreases with increasing galaxy numberdensity, but the fraction for late-type galaxies changes little. we find nomid-infrared detected agn-host galaxies in our sample of compact groups usingwide-field infrared survey explorer data. these results suggest that thenuclear activity of compact group galaxies (mostly early types) is not strongbecause of lack of gas supply even though they may experience frequentgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers that could trigger nuclear activity.

1307.5395	dual halos and formation of early-type galaxies	we present a determination of the two-dimensional shape parameters of theblue and red globular cluster systems (gcss) in a large number of ellipticalgalaxies and lenticular galaxies (early-type galaxies, called etgs). we use ahomogeneous data set of the globular clusters in 23 etgs obtained from thehst/acs virgo cluster survey. the position angles of both blue and red gcssshow a correlation with those of the stellar light distribution, showing thatthe major axes of the gcss are well aligned with those of their host galaxies.however, the shapes of the red gcss show a tight correlation with the stellarlight distribution as well as with the rotation property of their hostgalaxies, while the shapes of the blue gcss do much less. these provide cleargeometric evidence that the origins of the blue and red globular clusters aredistinct and that etgs may have dual halos: a blue (metal-poor) halo and a red(metal-rich) halo. these two halos show significant differences in metallicity,structure, and kinematics, indicating that they are formed in twodistinguishable ways. the red halos might have formed via dissipationalprocesses with rotation, while the blue halos are through accretion.

1308.5468	ks band luminosity evolution of the asymptotic giant branch population  based on star clusters in the large magellanic cloud	we present a study of ks band luminosity evolution of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) population in simple stellar systems using star clusters in thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc). we determine physical parameters of lmc starclusters including center coordinates, radii, and foreground reddenings. agesof 83 star clusters are derived from isochrone fitting with the padova models,and those of 19 star clusters are taken from the literature. the agb stars in102 star clusters with log(age) = 7.3 - 9.5 are selected using near-infraredcolor magnitude diagrams based on 2mass photometry. then we obtain the ks bandluminosity fraction of agb stars in these star clusters as a function of ages.the ks band luminosity fraction of agb stars increases, on average, as ageincreases from log(age) ~ 8.0, reaching a maximum at log(age) ~ 8.5, and itdecreases thereafter. there is a large scatter in the agb luminosity fractionfor given ages, which is mainly due to stochastic effects. we discuss thisresult in comparison with five simple stellar population models. the maximum ksband agb luminosity fraction for bright clusters is reproduced by the modelsthat expect the value of 0.7 - 0.8 at log(age) = 8.5 - 8.7. we discuss theimplication of our results with regard to the study of size and mass evolutionof galaxies.

1312.3384	unveiling the structure of barred galaxies at 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ with the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): i. disk breaks	we have performed two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 localbarred spiral galaxies using 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ images from the spitzer surveyof stellar structure in galaxies. our model fit includes up to four components(bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes intoaccount disk breaks. we find that ignoring the disk break and using a singledisk scale length in the model fit for type ii (down-bending) disk galaxies canlead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-totalluminosity ratio (b/t), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. we find thatfor galaxies with b/t $\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\rmbr}/r_{\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of b/t the ratioremains roughly constant. this suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies thedisk break is likely related to the outer lindblad resonance (olr) of the bar,and thus moves outwards as the bar grows. for galaxies with small bulges, b/t$&lt;$ 0.1, $r_{\rm br}/r_{\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. this suggeststhat the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be differentfrom that in galaxies with more massive bulges. consistent with previousstudies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges mayoriginate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, orbe related to star formation thresholds.

1407.2246	the tip of the red giant branch distance to the perfect spiral galaxy  m74 hosting three core-collapse supernovae	m74 (ngc 628) is a famous face-on spiral galaxy, hosting three core-collapsesupernovae (sne):sn ic 2002ap, sn ii-p 2003gd, and sn ii-p 2013ej. however itsdistance is not well known. we present a distance estimation for this galaxybased on the tip of the red giant branch (trgb) method. we obtain photometry ofthe resolved stars in the arm-free region of m74 from f555w and f814w images inthe hubble space telescope archive. the color-magnitude diagram of the resolvedstars shows a dominant red giant branch (rgb) as well as blue main sequencestars, red helium burning stars, and asymptotic giant branch stars. the i-bandluminosity function of the rgb stars shows the trgb to be at i_trgb = 26.13 pm0.03 mag, and t_rgb = 25.97 pm 0.03. from this we derive the distance modulusto m74 to be 30.04 pm 0.04 (random) pm 0.12 (systematic) (corresponding to alinear distance, 10.19 pm 0.14 pm 0.56 mpc). with this distance estimate, wecalibrate the standardized candle method for sne ii-p. from the absolutemagnitudes of sn 2003gd, we derive a value of the hubble constant, h_0 = 72 pm6 (random) pm 7 (systematic) km s^-1 mpc^-1. it is similar to recent estimatesbased on the luminosity calibration of type ia supernovae.

1411.4650	the mass profile and shape of bars in the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s4g): search for an age indicator for bars	we have measured the radial light profiles and global shapes of bars usingtwo-dimensional 3.6 $\mu m $ image decompositions for 144 face-on barredgalaxies from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). thebar surface brightness profile is correlated with the stellar mass andbulge-to-total (b/t) ratio of their host galaxies. bars in massive andbulge-dominated galaxies (b/t$&gt;$0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in lessmassive, disk-dominated galaxies (b/t$\sim$0) show an exponential, disk-likeprofile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominatedgalaxies. the global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, arerectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. we speculatethat because bars are formed out of disk, bars initially have an exponential(disk-like) profile which evolves over time, trapping more stars into the boxybar orbits. this leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. thenarrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that thesebars formed earlier (z$&gt;$1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spreadin the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradualevolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred fromobservational studies. therefore, we expect that the flatness of the barprofile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the timeelapsed since the bar formation. we argue that cosmic gas accretion is requiredto explain our results on bar profile and the presence of gas within the barregion.

[n ii]/h{\alpha} ratiosof the snrs show a strong correlation with [s ii]/h{\alpha} ratios. they show aclear radial gradient in [n ii]/h{\alpha} and [s ii]/h{\alpha} ratios: dlog ([nii]/h{\alpha})/dlog r = -0.018 {\pm} 0.008 dex/kpc and dlog ([sii]/h{\alpha})/dlog r = -0.016 {\pm} 0.008 dex/kpc where r is a deprojectedgalactocentric distance. we estimate the nitrogen and oxygen abundance of thesnrs from the comparison with shock-ionization models. we obtain a value forthe nitrogen radial gradient, dlog(n/h)/dlogr = -0.023 {\pm} 0.009 dex/kpc, andlittle evidence for the gradient in oxygen. this nitrogen abundance shows a fewtimes flatter gradient than those of the planetary nebulae and h ii regions. wefind that five snrs are matched with x-ray sources. their x-ray hardness colorsare consistent with thermal snrs.

1503.03372	the star cluster system in the local group starburst galaxy ic 10	we present a survey of star clusters in the halo of ic 10, a starburst galaxyin the local group based on subaru r band images and noao local group surveyubvri images. we find five new star clusters. all these star clusters arelocated far from the center of ic 10, while previously known star clusters aremostly in the main body. interestingly the distribution of these star clustersshows an asymmetrical structure elongated along the east and south-westdirection. we derive ubvri photometry of 66 star clusters including these newstar clusters as well as previously known star clusters. ages of the starclusters are estimated from the comparison of their ubvri spectral energydistribution with the simple stellar population models. we find that the starclusters in the halo are all older than 1 gyr, while those in the main bodyhave various ages from very young (several myr) to old (&gt;1 gyr). the youngclusters (&lt;10 myr) are mostly located in the h{\alpha} emission regions and areconcentrated on a small region at 2' in the south-east direction from thegalaxy center, while the old clusters are distributed in a wider area than thedisk. intermediate-age clusters (~100 myr) are found in two groups. one isclose to the location of the young clusters and the other is at ~4' from thelocation of the young clusters. the latter may be related with past merger ortidal interaction.

1503.04925	the akari 2.5-5.0 micron spectral atlas of type-1 active galactic  nuclei: black hole mass estimator, line ratio, and hot dust temperature	we present 2.5-5.0 $\mu$m spectra of 83 nearby ($0.002\,&lt;\,z\,&lt;\,0.48$) andbright ($k&lt;14$mag) type-1 active galactic nuclei (agns) taken with the infraredcamera (irc) on board $\it{akari}$. the 2.5-5.0 $\mu$m spectral region containsemission lines such as br$\beta$ (2.63 $\mu$m), br$\alpha$ (4.05 $\mu$m), andpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah; 3.3 $\mu$m), which can be used forstudying the black hole (bh) masses and star formation activities in the hostgalaxies of agns. the spectral region also suffers less dust extinction than inthe ultra violet (uv) or optical wavelengths, which may provide an unobscuredview of dusty agns. our sample is selected from bright quasar surveys ofpalomar-green (pg) and snuqso, and agns with reverberation-mapped bh massesfrom peterson et al. (2004). using 11 agns with reliable detection of brackettlines, we derive the brackett-line-based bh mass estimators. we also find thatthe observed brackett line ratios can be explained with the commonly adoptedphysical conditions of the broad line region (blr). moreover, we fit the hotand warm dust components of the dust torus by adding photometric data of sdss,2mass, $\it{wise}$, and $\it{iso}$ to the $\it{akari}$ spectra, finding hot andwarm dust temperatures of $\sim1100\,\rm{k}$ and $\sim220\,\rm{k}$,respectively, rather than the commonly cited hot dust temperature of 1500 k.

1504.00058	rest-frame optical spectra and black hole masses of 3&lt;z&lt;6 quasars	we present the rest-frame optical spectral properties of 155 luminous quasarsat 3.3&lt;z&lt;6.4 taken with the akari space telescope, including the firstdetection of h$\alpha$ emission line as far out as z~6. we extend the scalingrelation between the rest-frame optical continuum and line luminosity of activegalactic nuclei (agns) to the high luminosity, high redshift regime that hasrarely been probed before. remarkably, we find that a single log-linearrelation can be applied to the 5100${\rm \aa}$ and h$\alpha$ agn luminositiesover a wide range of luminosity (10$^{42}$&lt;$l_{5100}$&lt;10$^{47}$ergs/s) orredshift (0&lt;z&lt;6), suggesting that the physical mechanism governing thisrelation is unchanged from z=0 to 6, over five decades in luminosity. similarscaling relations are found between the optical and the uv continuumluminosities or line widths. applying the scaling relations to the h$\beta$black hole mass ($m_{\rm bh}$) estimator of local agns, we derive the $m_{\rmbh}$ estimators based on h$\alpha$, mgii, and civ lines, finding that theuv-line based masses are overall consistent with the balmer-line based, butwith a large intrinsic scatter of 0.40dex for the civ estimates. our 43 $m_{\rmbh}$ estimates from h$\alpha$ confirm the existence of bhs as massive as~10$^{10}m_{\odot}$ out to z~5, and provide a secure footing for previousmgii-line based studies that a rapid $m_{\rm bh}$ growth has occurred in theearly universe.

0805.0061	reddening behaviors of galaxies in the sdss photometric system	we analyze the behaviors of reddening vectors in the sdss photometric systemfor galaxies of different morphologies, ages, and redshifts. as seen in otherphotometric systems, the dependence of reddening on the spectral energydistribution (sed) and the nonlinearity of reddening are likewisenon-negligible for the sdss system if extinction is significant (~&gt; 1 mag).these behaviors are most significant for the g filter, which has the largestbandwidth-to-central wavelength ratio among sdss filters. the sdss colorsinvolving adjacent filters show greater sed-dependence and nonlinearity. aprocedure for calculating the correct amount of extinction from an observedcolor excess is provided. the relative extinctions between (i.e., theextinction law for) sdss filters given by schlegel et al., which werecalculated with an older version of filter response functions, wouldunderestimate the amount of extinction in most cases by ~5 to 10 % (maximum ~20%). we recommend a/a_{5500} values of 1.574, 1.191, 0.876, 0.671 &amp; 0.486 forthe u, g, r, i, &amp; z filters, respectively, as a representative extinction lawfor the sdss galaxies with a small extinction (i.e., for cases where thenonlinearity and sed-dependence of the reddening is not important). thedependence of reddening on redshift at low extinction is the largest for colorsinvolving the g filter as well, which is due to the balmer break.

1504.05681	akari observation of the sub-degree scale fluctuation of the  near-infrared background	we report spatial fluctuation analysis of the sky brightness in near-infraredfrom observations toward the north ecliptic pole (nep) by the akari at 2.4 and3.2 micron. as a follow up study of our previous work on the monitor field ofakari, we used nep deep survey data, which covered a circular area of about 0.4square degrees, in order to extend fluctuation analysis at angular scales up to1000". we found residual fluctuation over the estimated shot noise at largerangles than the angular scale of the monitor field. the excess fluctuation ofthe nep deep field smoothly connects with that of the monitor field at angularscales with a few hundreds arcseconds and extends without any significantvariation to larger angular scales up to 1000". by comparing excessfluctuations at two wavelengths, we confirm a blue spectrum feature similar tothe result of the monitor field. we find that the result of this study isconsistent with spitzer space telescope observations at 3.6 micron. the originof the excess fluctuation in the near-infrared background remains to beanswered, but we could exclude zodiacal light, diffuse galactic light, andunresolved faint galaxies at low-redshift based on the comparison with mid- andfar-infrared brightness, ground based near-infrared images.

1512.08797	monitoring observations of the jupiter-family comet 17p/holmes during  2014 perihelion passage	we performed a monitoring observation of a jupiter-family comet, 17p/holmes,during its 2014 perihelion passage to investigate its secular change inactivity. the comet has drawn the attention of astronomers since its historicoutburst in 2007, and this occasion was its first perihelion passage sincethen. we analyzed the obtained data using aperture photometry package andderived the afrho parameter, a proxy for the dust production rate. we foundthat afrho showed asymmetric properties with respect to the perihelion passage:it increased moderately from 100 cm at the heliocentric distance r_h=2.6-3.1 auto a maximal value of 185 cm at r_h = 2.2 au (near the perihelion) during theinbound orbit, while dropping rapidly to 35 cm at r_h = 3.2 au during theoutbound orbit. we applied a model for characterizing dust production rates asa function of r_h and found that the fractional active area of the cometarynucleus had dropped from 20%-40% in 2008-2011 (around the aphelion) to0.1%-0.3% in 2014-2015 (around the perihelion). this result suggests that adust mantle would have developed rapidly in only one orbital revolution aroundthe sun. although a minor eruption was observed on ut 2015 january 26 at r_h =3.0 au, the areas excavated by the 2007 outburst would be covered with a layerof dust (&lt;~ 10 cm depth) which would be enough to insulate the subsurface iceand to keep the nucleus in a state of low activity.

astro-ph;0308270	on the formation of giant elliptical galaxies and globular clusters	i review the current status of understanding when, how long, and how giantelliptical galaxies formed, focusing on the globular clusters. severalobservational evidences show that massive elliptical galaxies formed at $z&gt;2$($&gt;10$ gyr ago). giant elliptical galaxies show mostly a bimodal colordistribution of globular clusters, indicating a factor of $\approx 20$metallicity difference between the two peaks. the red globular clusters (rgcs)are closely related with the stellar halo in color and spatial distribution,while the blue globular clusters (bgcs) are not. the ratio of the number of thergcs and that of the bgcs varies depending on galaxies. it is concluded thatthe bgcs might have formed 12--13 gyr ago, while the rgcs and giant ellipticalgalaxies might have formed similarly 10-11 gyr ago. it remains now to explainthe existence of a gap between the rgc formation epoch and the bgc formationepoch, and the rapid metallicity increase during the gap ($\delta t \approx 2$gyr). if hierarchical merging can form a significant number of giant ellipticalgalaxies $&gt;10$ gyr ago, several observational constraints from stars andglobular clusters in elliptical galaxies can be explained.

astro-ph;0505089	theoretical isochrones with extinction in the k band	we calculate theoretical isochrones in a consistent way for five filters (k,k', ks, f205w, and f222m) in the atmospheric window between 1.9 and 2.5 micronusing the padova stellar evolutionary models by girardi et al. even whendisplayed in the same vega magnitude system, the near-infrared colors of thesame isochrone can differ by up to 0.18 mag at its bright end, depending on thefilter. we present magnitude transformations between k-band filters as afunction of color from h and k band filters. isochrones with extinction at k ofup to 6 mag are also presented. we find that care is needed when comparingextinction values that are estimated using different filter sets in the k band,in particular when comparing those of atmospheric and space filter sets:extinction values for space filters can be in error by up to 0.3 mag. to reducethis error, we introduce an "effective extinction slope" for each filter setand isochrone model, which describes the extinction behavior of isochrones inthe color-magnitude diagram more correctly than the actual extinction law. ourcalculation also suggests that the extinction law implied by the observationsof rieke et al. for wavelengths between the h and k bands is better describedby a power-law function with an exponent of 1.61 instead of 1.55, which iscommonly used with an assumption that the transmission functions of h and kfilters are dirac delta functions.

astro-ph;9910481	stellar populations of the sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy	we present deep bvri ccd photometry of the stars in the dwarf irregulargalaxy sagdig. the color-magnitude diagrams of the measured stars in sagdigshow a blue plume which consists mostly of young stellar populations, and awell-defined red giant branch (rgb). the foreground reddening of sagdig isestimated to be e(b-v)=0.06. the tip of the rgb is found to be ati_(trgb)=21.55 +/- 0.10 mag. from this the distance to this galaxy is estimatedto be d = 1.18 +/- 0.10 mpc. this result, combined with its velocityinformation, shows that it is a member of the local group. the mean metallicityof the red giant branch is estimated to be [fe/h] &lt; -2.2 dex. this shows thatsagdig is one of the most metal-poor galaxies. total magnitudes of sagdig (&lt;r_h (= 107 arcsec)) are derived to be b^t=13.99 mag, v^t=13.58 mag, r^t=13.19mag, and i^t=12.88 mag, and the corresponding absolute magnitudes arem_b=-11.62 mag, m_v=-11.97 mag, m_r=-12.33 mag, and m_i=-12.60 mag. surfacebrightness profiles of the central part of sagdig are approximately fit by aking model with a core concentration parameter c = log (r_t / r_c) ~ 0.6, andthose of the outer part follow an exponential law with a scale length of 37arcsec. the central surface brightness is measured to be mu_b (0) = 24.21 magarcsec^(-2) and mu_v (0) =23.91 mag arcsec^(-2). the magnitudes and colors ofthe brightest blue and red stars in sagdig (bsg and rsg) are measured to be,respectively, &lt;v(3)&gt;_bsg = 19.89 +/- 0.13 mag, &lt;(b-v)(3)&gt;_bsg = 0.08 +/- 0.07mag, &lt;v(3)&gt;_rsg = 20.39 +/- 0.10 mag, and &lt;(b-v)(3)&gt;_rsg = 1.29 +/- 0.12 mag.the corresponding absolute magnitudes are derived to be &lt;m_v(3)&gt;_bsg = -5.66mag and &lt;m_v(3)&gt;_rsg = -5.16 mag, which are about one magnitude fainter thanthose expected from conventional correlations with galaxy luminosity.

0811.1403	supernova remnants in the akari irc survey of the large magellanic cloud	we present the near- to mid-infared study of supernova remnants (snrs) usingthe akari irc survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the lmc surveyobserved about a 10 square degree area of the lmc in five bands centered at 3,7, 11, 15, and 24 \micron using the infrared camera (irc) aboard akari. thenumber of snrs in the survey area is 21, which is about a half of the known lmcsnrs. we systematically examined the akari images and identified eight snrswith distinguishable infrared emission. all of them were detected at $\gtrsim10$ \micron and some at 3 and 7 \micron, too. we present their akari images andfluxes. in the 11/15 \micron versus 15/24 \micron color-color diagram, the snrsappear to be aligned along a modified blackbody curve, representing thermalemission from dust at temperatures between 90 and 190 k. there is a goodcorrelation between the 24 \micron and x-ray fluxes of the snrs. it was alsofound that there is a good correlation between the 24 \micron and radio fluxeseven if there is no direct physical connection between them. we considered theorigin of the detected mid-infrared emission in individual snrs. we concludethat the mid-infrared emissions in five snrs that show morphologies similar tothe x-rays are dominated by thermal emission from hot dust heated by x-rayemitting plasma. their 15/24 \micron color temperatures are generally higherthan the spitzer 24/70 \micron color temperatures, which suggests that asingle-temperature dust model cannot describe the full spectral energydistribution (sed) of the snrs. it also implies that our understanding of thefull sed is essential for estimating the dust destruction rate of grains by snrshocks.
