0706.3274	an asteroseismic study of the beta cephei star theta ophiuchi:  constraints on global stellar parameters and core overshooting	we present a seismic study of the beta cephei star theta ophiuchi. ouranalysis is based on the observation of one radial mode, one rotationally splitl = 1 triplet and three components of a rotationally split l = 2 quintuplet forwhich the m-values were well identified by spectroscopy. we identify the radialmode as fundamental, the triplet as p_1 and the quintuplet as g_1. our nlteabundance analysis results in a metallicity and cno abundances in fullagreement with the most recent updated solar values. with x \in [0.71,0.7211]and z \in [0.009,0.015], and using the asplund et al. (2005) mixture but with ane abundance about 0.3 dex larger (cunha et al. 2006), the matching of thethree independent modes, enables us to deduce constrained ranges for the mass(m = 8.2 +/- 0.3 msun) and central hydrogen abundance (x_c = 0.38 +/- 0.02) oftheta oph and to prove the occurrence of core overshooting (alpha_ov = 0.44 +/-0.07). we also derive an equatorial rotation velocity of 29 +/- 7 km/s.moreover, we show that the observed non-equidistance of the l=1 triplet can bereproduced by second order effects of rotation. finally, we show that theobserved rotational splitting of two modes cannot rule out a rigid rotationmodel.

0906.3626	ground-based observations of the beta cephei corot main target hd  180642: abundance analysis and mode identification	the known beta cephei star hd 180642 was observed by the corot satellite in2007. from the very high-precision light curve, its pulsation frequencyspectrum could be derived for the first time (degroote and collaborators). inthis paper, we obtain additional constraints for forthcoming asteroseismicmodeling of the target. our results are based on both extensive ground-basedmulticolour photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. we determine t_eff =24 500+-1000 k and log g = 3.45+-0.15 dex from spectroscopy. the derivedchemical abundances are consistent with those for b stars in the solarneighbourhood, except for a mild nitrogen excess. a metallicity z =0.0099+-0.0016 is obtained. three modes are detected in photometry. the degreel is unambiguously identified for two of them: l = 0 and l = 3 for thefrequencies 5.48694 1/d and 0.30818 1/d, respectively. the radial mode isnon-linear and highly dominant with an amplitude in the u-filter about 15 timeslarger than the strongest of the other modes. for the third frequency of7.36673 1/d found in photometry, two possibilities remain: l = 0 or 3. in theradial velocities, the dominant radial mode presents a so-called stillstand butno clear evidence of the existence of shocks is observed. four low-amplitudemodes are found in spectroscopy and one of them, with frequency 8.4079 1/d, isidentified as (l,m)=(3,2). based on this mode identification, we finally deducean equatorial rotational velocity of 38+-15 km/s.

0906.4934	abundance analysis of prime b-type targets for asteroseismology ii.  b6--b9.5 stars in the field of view of the corot	the corot satellite is collecting precise time-resolved photometry for tensof asteroseismology targets. to ensure a correct interpretation of the corotdata, the atmospheric parameters, chemical compositions, and rotationalvelocities of the stars must be determined. the main goal of the ground-basedseismology support program for the corot mission was to obtain photometric andspectroscopic data for stars in the fields monitored by the satellite. theseground-based observations were collected in the gaudi archive. high-resolutionspectra of more than 200 b-type stars are available in this database, and about45% of them is analysed here. to derive the effective temperature of the stars,we used photometric indices. surface gravities were obtained by comparingobserved and theoretical balmer line profiles. to determine the chemicalabundances and rotational velocities, we used a spectrum synthesis method,which consisted of comparing the observed spectrum with theoretical ones basedon the assumption of lte. atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, androtational velocities were determined for 89 late-b stars. the dominant speciesin their spectra are iron-peak elements. the average fe abundance is7.24+/-0.45 dex. the average rotational velocity is 126 km/sec, but there are13 and 20 stars with low and moderate vsin i values, respectively. the analysisof this sample of 89 late b-type stars reveals many chemically peculiar (cp)stars. some of them were previously known, but at least 9 new cp candidates,among which at least two hgmn stars, are identified in our study. these cpstars as a group exhibit vsin i values lower than the stars with normal surfacechemical composition.

0908.4185	the enigma of b-type pulsators in the smc	since the early nineties it is accepted that the excitation mechanism ofb-type pulsators on the main sequence is due to the opacity peak in theiron-group elements at $t\approx 200,000$ k. the fe content plays then a majorrole in the excitation of $\beta$ cep and spb pulsations. while theoreticalnon-adiabatic computations predict no $\beta$ cep pulsators and only a smallnumber of spbs for low metallicity environments such as that of the magellanicclouds (mcs), recent variability surveys of b stars in the smc have reportedthe detection of a significant number of spb and $\beta$ cep candidates. sincethe smc is the metal poorest (z$\approx$0.001-0.004) of the mcs, it constitutesan interesting object for investigating the disagreement between theory andobservations. we approach the problem by calling into question some of thehypotheses made in previous studies: given the different chemical evolution ofthe smc compared with our local galactic environment, is it appropriate todescribe the chemical composition of smc b stars by scaling the solar mixtureto lower $z$? is that composition uniform in space and time? in this paper wepresent the results of a stability analysis of b-type stellar models computedwith a revised chemical composition and metallicity specific to the smc.

0910.3513	hd 174884: a strongly eccentric, short-period early-type binary system  discovered by corot	accurate photometric corot space observations of a secondary seismologicaltarget, hd 174884, led to the discovery that this star is an astrophysicallyimportant double-lined eclipsing spectroscopic binary in an eccentric orbit (eof about 0.3), unusual for its short (3.65705d) orbital period. the higheccentricity, coupled with the orientation of the binary orbit in space,explains the very unusual observed light curve with strongly unequal primaryand secondary eclipses having the depth ratio of 1-to-100 in the corot 'seismo'passband. without the high accuracy of the corot photometry, the secondaryeclipse, 1.5 mmag deep, would have gone unnoticed. a spectroscopic follow-upprogram provided 45 high dispersion spectra. the analysis of the corot lightcurve was performed with an adapted version of phoebe that supports corotpassbands. the final solution was obtained by simultaneous fitting of the lightand the radial velocity curves. individual star spectra were derived byspectrum disentangling. the uncertainties of the fit were derived by bootstrapresampling and the solution uniqueness was tested by heuristic scanning. theresults provide a consistent picture of the system composed of two late bstars. the fourier analysis of the light curve fit residuals yields twocomponents, with orbital frequency multiples and an amplitude of about 0.1mmag, which are tentatively interpreted as tidally induced pulsations. anextensive comparison with theoretical models is carried out by means of thelevenberg-marquardt minimization technique and the discrepancy between modelsand the derived parameters is discussed. the best fitting models yield a youngsystem age of 125 million years which is consistent with the eccentric orbitand synchronous component rotation at periastron.

1006.4284	oscillation mode lifetimes of red giants observed during the initial and  first anticentre long run of corot	long timeseries of data increase the frequency resolution in the powerspectrum. this allows for resolving stochastically excited modes with long modelifetimes, as well as features that are close together in frequency. the corotfields observed during the initial run and second long run partly overlap, andstars in this overlapping field observed in both runs are used to createtimeseries with a longer timespan than available from the individual runs. weaim to measure the mode lifetimes of red giants and compare them withtheoretical predictions. we also investigate the dependence of the modelifetimes on frequency and the degree of the oscillation modes. we performsimulations to investigate the influence of the gap in the data between theinitial and second long run, the total length of the run and thesignal-to-noise ratio on the measured mode lifetime. this provides us with acorrection factor to apply to the mode lifetimes measured from a maximumlikelihood fit to the oscillation frequencies. we find that the length of thetimeseries, the signal-to-noise ratio and possible gaps do have anon-negligible effect on the measurements of the mode lifetime ofstochastically excited oscillation modes, but that we can correct for it. forthe four stars for which we can perform a fit of the oscillation frequencies,we find that the mode lifetimes depend on frequency and on degree of the mode,which is in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions.

1007.3088	can an underestimation of opacity explain b-type pulsators in the smc?	slowly pulsating b and $\beta$ cephei are $\kappa$ mechanism driven pulsatingb stars. that $\kappa$ mechanism works since a peak in the opacity due to ahigh number of atomic transitions from iron-group elements occurs in the areaof $\log t \approx 5.3$. theoretical results predict very few spbs and no$\beta$ cep to be encountered in low metallicity environments such as the smallmagellanic cloud. however recent variability surveys of b stars in the smcreported the detection of a significant number of spb and $\beta$ cepcandidates. though the iron content plays a major role in the excitation of$\beta$ cep and spb pulsations, the chemical mixture representative of the smcb stars such as recently derived does not leave room for a significant increaseof the iron abundance in these stars. whilst abundance of iron-group elementsseems reliable, is the opacity in the iron-group elements bump underestimated?we determine how the opacity profile in b-type stars should change to excitespb and $\beta$ cep pulsations in early-type stars of the smc.

1211.0146	galactic archaeology: mapping and dating stellar populations with  asteroseismology of red-giant stars	our understanding of how the galaxy was formed and evolves is severelyhampered by the lack of precise constraints on basic stellar properties such asdistances, masses, and ages. here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giantsrepresent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning alarge age range, which can be used to map and date the galactic disc in theregions probed by observations made by the corot and kepler space telescopes.when combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of suchevolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but alsoprovide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxiesfor the ages of the stars. as a first application we consider red giantsobserved by corot in two different parts of the milky way, and determineprecise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of thegalactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solarneighbourhood. we find significant differences in the mass distributions ofthese two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models ofthe milky way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in thedistribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. in the future, theavailability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will notonly improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints onage-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different galactocentric radiiand heights from the plane.

1302.3172	abundance study of the two solar-analogue corot targets hd 42618 and hd  43587 from harps spectroscopy	we present a detailed abundance study based on spectroscopic data obtainedwith harps of two solar-analogue main targets for the asteroseismologyprogramme of the corot satellite: hd 42618 and hd 43587. the atmosphericparameters and chemical composition are accurately determined through a fullydifferential analysis with respect to the sun observed with the sameinstrumental set-up. several sources of systematic errors largely cancel outwith this approach, which allows us to narrow down the 1-sigma error bars totypically 20 k in effective temperature, 0.04 dex in surface gravity, and lessthan 0.05 dex in the elemental abundances. although hd 42618 fulfils manyrequirements for being classified as a solar twin, its slight deficiency inmetals and its possibly younger age indicate that, strictly speaking, it doesnot belong to this class of objects. on the other hand, hd 43587 is slightlymore massive and evolved. in addition, marked differences are found in theamount of lithium present in the photospheres of these two stars, which mightreveal different mixing properties in their interiors. these results will puttight constraints on the forthcoming theoretical modelling of their solar-likeoscillations and contribute to increase our knowledge of the fundamentalparameters and internal structure of stars similar to our sun.

1311.4370	a search for pulsations in the hgmn star hd 45975 with corot photometry  and ground-based spectroscopy	the existence of pulsations in hgmn stars is still being debated. to providethe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class ofchemically peculiar objects, the bright star hd 45975 was monitored for nearlytwo months by the corot satellite. independent analyses of the light curveprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d anda peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. multisite, ground-based spectroscopicobservations overlapping the corot observations show the star to be along-period, single-lined binary. furthermore, with the notable exception ofmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line momentsof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., mn and y). incontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. as foundin other hgmn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bumpmoving redwards across the line profiles. we argue that the photometric andspectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms ofrotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. in this framework, theexistence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppmlevel is unlikely in hd 45975. this provides strong constraints on theexcitation/damping of pulsation modes in this hgmn star.

1403.0491	b fields in ob stars (bob): the discovery of a magnetic field in a  multiple system in the trifid nebula, one of the youngest star forming  regions	recent magnetic field surveys in o- and b-type stars revealed that about 10%of the core-hydrogen-burning massive stars host large-scale magnetic fields.the physical origin of these fields is highly debated. to identify and modelthe physical processes responsible for the generation of magnetic fields inmassive stars, it is important to establish whether magnetic massive stars arefound in very young star-forming regions or whether they are formed in closeinteracting binary systems.  in the framework of our eso large program, we carried out low-resolutionspectropolarimetric observations with fors2 in 2013 april of the three mostmassive central stars in the trifid nebula, hd164492a, hd164492c, andhd164492d. these observations indicated a strong longitudinal magnetic field ofabout 500-600g in the poorly studied component hd164492c. to confirm thisdetection, we used harps in spectropolarimetric mode on two consecutive nightsin 2013 june.  our harps observations confirmed the longitudinal magnetic field inhd164492c. furthermore, the harps observations revealed that hd164492c cannotbe considered as a single star as it possesses one or two companions. thespectral appearance indicates that the primary is most likely of spectral typeb1-b1.5v. since in both observing nights most spectral lines appear blended, itis currently unclear which components are magnetic. long-term monitoring usinghigh-resolution spectropolarimetry is necessary to separate the contribution ofeach component to the magnetic signal. given the location of the systemhd164492c in one of the youngest star formation regions, this system can beconsidered as a rosetta stone for our understanding of the origin of magneticfields in massive stars.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1501.01377	spectroscopic variability of two oe stars	the oe stars hd45314 and hd60848 have recently been found to exhibit verydifferent x-ray properties: whilst hd60848 has an x-ray spectrum and emissionlevel typical of most ob stars, hd45314 features a much harder and brighterx-ray emission, making it a so-called gamma cas analogue. monitoring theoptical spectra could provide hints towards the origin of these very differentbehaviours. we analyse a large set of spectroscopic observations of hd45314 andhd60848, extending over 20 years. we further attempt to fit the h-alpha lineprofiles of both stars with a simple model of emission line formation in akeplerian disk. strong variations in the strengths of the h-alpha, h-beta, andhe i 5876 emission lines are observed for both stars. in the case of hd60848,we find a time lag between the variations in the equivalent widths of theselines. the emission lines are double peaked with nearly identical strengths ofthe violet and red peaks. the h-alpha profile of this star can be successfullyreproduced by our model of a disk seen under an inclination of 30 degrees. inthe case of hd45314, the emission lines are highly asymmetric and displaystrong line profile variations. we find a major change in behaviour between the2002 outburst and the one observed in 2013. this concerns both the relationshipbetween the equivalent widths of the various lines and their morphologies atmaximum strength (double-peaked in 2002 versus single-peaked in 2013). oursimple disk model fails to reproduce the observed h-alpha line profiles ofhd45314. our results further support the interpretation that oe stars do havedecretion disks similar to those of be stars. whilst the emission lines ofhd60848 are explained by a disk with a keplerian velocity field, the disk ofhd45314 seems to have a significantly more complex velocity field that could berelated to the phenomenon that produces its peculiar x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0309535	the photospheric abundances of active binaries ii. atmospheric  parameters and abundance patterns for 6 single-lined rs cvn systems	photospheric parameters and abundances are presented for a sample ofsingle-lined chromospherically active binaries from a differential lte analysisof high-resolution spectra. abundances have been derived for 13 chemicalspecies, including several key elements such as li, mg, and ca. two methodshave been used. the effective temperatures, surface gravities andmicroturbulent velocities were first derived from a fully self-consistentanalysis of the spectra, whereby the temperature is determined from theexcitation equilibrium of the fe i lines. the second approach relies ontemperatures derived from the (b-v) colour index. these two methods givebroadly consistent results for the stars in our sample, suggesting that theneutral iron lines are formed under conditions close to lte. we discuss thereliability in the context of chromospherically active stars of various colourindices used as temperature indicators, and conclude that the (v-r) and (v-i)colours are likely to be significantly affected by activity processes.irrespective of the method used, our results indicate that the x-ray activebinaries studied are not as metal poor as previously claimed, but are at mostmildly iron-depleted relative to the sun (-0.41&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.11). a significantoverabundance of several chemical species is observed (e.g., thealpha-synthezised elements). these abundance patterns are discussed in relationto stellar activity.

astro-ph;0403155	large-scale wind structures in ob supergiants: a search for rotationally  modulated h\alpha variability	we present the results of a long-term monitoring campaign of the h\alpha linein a sample of bright ob-supergiants (o7.5-b9) that aims at detectingrotationally modulated changes potentially related to the existence oflarge-scale wind structures. a total of 22 objects were monitor ed during 36nights spread over 6 months in 2001-2002. coordinated broad-band photometricobservations were also obtained for some targets. conspicuous evidence forvariability in h\alpha is found for the stars displaying a feature contaminatedby wind emission. most changes take place on a daily time-scale, althoughhourly variations are also occasionally detected. convincing evidence for acyclical pattern of variability in h\alpha has been found in 2 stars: hd 14134and hd 42087 (periodic signals are also detected in other stars, butindependent confirmation is required). rotational modulation is suggested fromthe similarity between the observed recurrence time-scales (in the range 13-25days) and estimated periods of stellar rotation. we call attention to theatypical case of hd 14134 which exhibits a clear 12.8-d periodicity both in thephotometric and in the spectroscopic data sets. this places this object among ahandful of early-type stars where one may observe a clear link between extendedwind structures and photospheric disturbances. further modelling may test thehypothesis that azimuthally-extended wind streams are responsible for thepatterns of spectral variability in our target stars.

astro-ph;0406348	the photospheric abundances of active binaries iii. abundance  peculiarities at high activity level	we report the determination from high-resolution spectra of the atmosphericparameters and abundances of 13 chemical species (among which lithium) in 8single-lined active binaries. these data are combined with our previous resultsfor 6 other rs cvn systems to examine a possible relationship between thephotospheric abundance patterns and the stellar activity level. the starsanalyzed are generally found to exhibit peculiar abundance ratios compared toinactive, galactic disk stars of similar metallicities. we argue that thisbehaviour is unlikely an artefact of errors in the determination of theatmospheric parameters or non-standard mixing processes along the red giantbranch, but diagnoses instead the combined action of various physical processesrelated to activity. the most promising candidates are cool spot groupscovering a very substantial fraction of the stellar photosphere or nlte effectsarising from nonthermal excitation. however, we cannot exclude the possibilitythat more general shortcomings in our understanding of k-type stars (e.g.inadequacies in the atmospheric models) also play a significant role. lastly,we call attention to the unreliability of the (v-r) and (v-i) colour indices astemperature indicators in chromospherically active stars.

astro-ph;0410379	the european large area iso survey viii: 90-micron final analysis and  source counts	we present a re--analysis of the european large area iso survey (elais) 90mumobservations carried out with isophot, an instrument on board the esa'sinfrared space observatory (iso). with more than 12 sq. deg., the elais surveyis the largest area covered by iso in a single program and is about one orderof magnitude deeper than the iras 100mum survey. the data analysis is presentedand was mainly performed with the phot interactive analysis software but usingthe pairwise method of stickel et al. (2003) for signal processing from erd(edited raw data) to scp (signal per chopper plateau). the elais 90mumcatalogue contains 229 reliable sources with fluxes larger than 70 mjy and isavailable at www.blackwell-synergy.com. number counts are presented and show anexcess above the no-evolution model prediction. this confirms the strongevolution detected at shorter(15mum) and longer (170mum) wavelengths in otheriso surveys. the elais counts are in agreement with previous works at 90mum andin particular with the deeper counts extracted from the lockman holeobservations. comparison with recent evolutionary models show that the modelsof franceschini et al. and guiderdoni et al. which includes aheavily-extinguished population of galaxies give the best fit to the data.deeper observations are nevertheless required to better discriminate betweenthe model predictions in the far-infrared and are scheduled with the spitzerspace telescope which already started operating and will also be performed byastro-f.

astro-ph;0607264	abundance analysis of prime b-type targets for asteroseismology i.  nitrogen excess in slowly-rotating beta cephei stars	we present the results of a detailed nlte abundance study of nine beta cepheistars, all of them being prime targets for theoretical modelling: gamma peg,delta cet, nu eri, beta cma, xi1 cma, v836 cen, v2052 oph, beta cep and dd (12)lac. the following chemical elements are considered: he, c, n, o, mg, al, si, sand fe. our abundance analysis is based on a large number of time-resolved,high-resolution optical spectra covering in most cases the entire oscillationcycle of the stars. nitrogen is found to be enhanced by up to 0.6 dex in fourstars, three of which have severe constraints on their equatorial rotationalvelocity, \omega r, from seismic or line-profile variation studies: beta cep(\omega r~26 km/s), v2052 oph (\omega r~56 km/s), delta cet (\omega r &lt; 28km/s) and xi1 cma (\omega r sin i &lt; 10 km/s). the existence of core-processedmaterial at the surface of such largely unevolved, slowly-rotating objects isnot predicted by current evolutionary models including rotation. we drawattention to the fact that three stars in this subsample have a detectedmagnetic field and briefly discuss recent theoretical work pointing to theoccurrence of diffusion effects in beta cephei stars possibly capable ofaltering the nitrogen surface abundance. on the other hand, the abundances ofall the other chemical elements considered are, within the errors,indistinguishable from the values found for ob dwarfs in the solarneighbourhood. despite the mild nitrogen excess observed in some objects, wethus find no evidence for a significantly higher photospheric metal content inthe studied beta cephei stars compared to non-pulsating b-type stars of similarcharacteristics.

astro-ph;9901269	a 2.3-day periodic variability in the apparently single wolf-rayet star  wr 134: collapsed companion or rotational modulation?	we present the results of an intensive campaign of spectroscopic andphotometric monitoring of the peculiar wolf-rayet star wr 134 from 1989 to1997.  this unprecedentedly large data set allows us to confirm unambiguously theexistence of a coherent 2.25 +/- 0.05 day periodicity in the line-profilechanges of he ii 4686, although the global pattern of variability is differentfrom one epoch to another. this period is only marginally detected in thephotometric data set. assuming the 2.25 day periodic variability to be inducedby orbital motion of a collapsed companion, we develop a simple model aiming atinvestigating (i) the effect of this strongly ionizing, accreting companion onthe wolf-rayet wind structure, and (ii) the expected emergent x-ray luminosity.we argue that the predicted and observed x-ray fluxes can only be matched ifthe accretion on the collapsed star is significantly inhibited. additionally,we performed simulations of line-profile variations caused by the orbitalrevolution of a localized, strongly ionized wind cavity surrounding the x-raysource. a reasonable fit is achieved between the observed and modeledphase-dependent line profiles of he ii 4686. however, the derived size of thephotoionized zone substantially exceeds our expectations, given the observedlow-level x-ray flux. alternatively, we explore rotational modulation of apersistent, largely anisotropic outflow as the origin of the observed cyclicalvariability. although qualitative, this hypothesis leads to greater consistencywith the observations.

astro-ph;9907356	an investigation of the large-scale variability of the apparently single  wolf-rayet star wr 1	in recent years, much studies have focused on determining the origin of thelarge-scale line-profile and/or photometric patterns of variability displayedby some apparently single wolf-rayet stars, with the existence of an unseen(collapsed?) companion or of spatially extended wind structures as potentialcandidates. we present observations of wr 1 which highlight the unusualcharacter of the variations in this object. our narrowband photometricobservations reveal a gradual increase of the stellar continuum flux amountingto delta v = 0.09 mag followed by a decline on about the same timescale (3-4days). only marginal evidence for variability is found during the 11 followingnights.  strong, daily line-profile variations are also observed but they cannot beeasily linked to the photometric variations.  similarly to the continuum flux variations, coherent time-dependent changesare observed in 1996 in the centroid, equivalent width, and skewness of he ii4686. despite the generally coherent nature of the variations, we do not findevidence in our data for the periods claimed in previous studies. while theissue of a cyclical pattern of variability in wr 1 is still controversial, itis clear that this object might constitute in the future a cornerstone for ourunderstanding of the mechanisms leading to the formation of largely anisotropicoutflows in wolf-rayet stars.
