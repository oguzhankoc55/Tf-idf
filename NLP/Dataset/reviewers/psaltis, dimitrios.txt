0905.1959	reconstructing the neutron-star equation of state from astrophysical  measurements	the properties of matter at ultra-high densities, low temperatures, and witha significant asymmetry between protons and neutrons can be studied exclusivelythrough astrophysical observations of neutron stars. we show that measurementsof the masses and radii of neutron stars can lead to tight constraints on thepressure of matter at three fiducial densities, from 1.85 to 7.4 times thedensity of nuclear saturation, in a manner that is largely model-independentand that captures the key characteristics of the equation of state. wedemonstrate that observations with 10% uncertainties of at least three neutronstars can lead to measurements of the pressure at these fiducial densities withan accuracy of 0.11 dex or ~ 30%. observations of three neutron stars with 5%uncertainties are sufficient to distinguish at a better than 3-sigma confidencelevel between currently proposed equations of state. in the electromagneticspectrum, such accurate measurements will become possible for weakly-magneticneutron stars during thermonuclear flashes and in quiescence with futuremissions such as the international x-ray observatory (ixo).

0912.2736	constraining parity violation in gravity with measurements of  neutron-star moments of inertia	neutron stars are sensitive laboratories for testing general relativity,especially when considering deviations where velocities are relativistic andgravitational fields are strong. one such deviation is described by dynamical,chern-simons modified gravity, where the einstein-hilbert action is modifiedthrough the addition of the gravitational parity-violating pontryagin densitycoupled to a field. this four-dimensional effective theory arises naturallyboth in perturbative and non-perturbative string theory, loop quantum gravity,and generic effective field theory expansions. we calculate here chern-simonsmodifications to the properties and gravitational fields of slowly spinningneutron stars. we find that the chern-simons correction affects only thegravitomagnetic sector of the metric to leading order, thus introducingmodifications to the moment of inertia but not to the mass-radius relation. weshow that an observational determination of the moment of inertia to anaccuracy of 10%, as is expected from near-future observations of the doublepulsar, will place a constraint on the chern-simons coupling constant of\xi^{1/4} &lt; 5 km, which is at least three-orders of magnitude stronger than theprevious strongest bound.

1003.3415	testing the no-hair theorem with observations in the electromagnetic  spectrum: i. properties of a quasi-kerr spacetime	according to the no-hair theorem, an astrophysical black hole is uniquelydescribed by only two quantities, the mass and the spin. in this series ofpapers, we investigate a framework for testing the no-hair theorem withobservations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum. we formulate ourapproach in terms of a parametric spacetime which contains a quadrupole momentthat is independent of both mass and spin. if the no-hair theorem is correct,then any deviation of the black-hole quadrupole moment from its kerr value hasto be zero. we analyze in detail the properties of this quasi-kerr spacetimethat are critical to interpreting observations of black holes and demonstratetheir dependence on the spin and quadrupole moment. in particular, we show thatthe location of the innermost stable circular orbit and the gravitationallensing experienced by photons are affected significantly at even modestdeviations of the quadrupole moment from the value predicted by the no-hairtheorem. we argue that observations of black-hole images, of relativisticallybroadened iron lines, as well as of thermal x-ray spectra from accreting blackholes will lead in the near future to an experimental test of the no-hairtheorem.

1005.1931	testing the no-hair theorem with observations in the electromagnetic  spectrum: ii. black-hole images	according to the no-hair theorem, all astrophysical black holes are fullydescribed by their masses and spins. this theorem can be tested observationallyby measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes ofblack holes. in this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a frameworkthat allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as afunction of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of ablack hole. we show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expectedkerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblatedepending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. in addition, there is aring-like structure around the black-hole shadow with a diameter of about 10black-hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of theunderlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical detailsof accretion flow models. we show that the shape of this ring depends directlyon the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used foran independent measurement of all three parameters. in particular, wedemonstrate that this ring is highly circular for a kerr black hole with a spina&lt;0.9m, independent of the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical andasymmetric if the no-hair theorem is violated. near-future very-long baselineinterferometric observations of sgr a* will image this ring and may allow foran observational test of the no-hair theorem.

1006.2834	the black hole mass distribution in the galaxy	we use dynamical mass measurements of 16 black holes in transient low-massx-ray binaries to infer the stellar black hole mass distribution in the parentpopulation. we find that the observations are best described by a narrow massdistribution at 7.8 +/- 1.2 msolar. we identify a selection effect related tothe choice of targets for optical follow-ups that results in a flux-limitedsample. we demonstrate, however, that this selection effect does not introducea bias in the observed distribution and cannot explain the absence of blackholes in the 2-5 solar mass range. on the high mass end, we argue that therapid decline in the inferred distribution may be the result of the particularevolutionary channel followed by low-mass x-ray binaries. this is consistentwith the presence of high-mass black holes in the persistent, high-mass x-raybinary sources. if the paucity of low-mass black holes is caused by a suddendecrease of the supernova explosion energy with increasing progenitor mass,this would have observable implications for ongoing transient surveys thattarget core-collapse supernovae. our results also have significant implicationsfor the calculation of event rates from the coalescence of black hole binariesfor gravitational wave detectors.

0704.2426	testing general metric theories of gravity with bursting neutron stars	i show that several observable properties of bursting neutron stars in metrictheories of gravity can be calculated using only conservation laws, killingsymmetries, and the einstein equivalence principle, without requiring thevalidity of the general relativistic field equations. i calculate, inparticular, the gravitational redshift of a surface atomic line, the touchdownluminosity of a radius-expansion burst, which is believed to be equal to theeddington critical luminosity, and the apparent surface area of a neutron staras measured during the cooling tails of bursts. i show that, for a generalmetric theory of gravity, the apparent surface area of a neutron star dependson the coordinate radius of the stellar surface and on its gravitationalredshift in the exact same way as in general relativity. on the other hand, theeddington critical luminosity depends also on an additional parameter thatmeasures the degree to which the general relativistic field equations aresatisfied. these results can be used in conjunction with current and futurehigh-energy observations of bursting neutron stars to test general relativityin the strong-field regime.

1103.5767	systematic uncertainties in the spectroscopic measurements of  neutron-star masses and radii from thermonuclear x-ray bursts. i. apparent  radii	the masses and radii of low-magnetic field neutron stars can be measured bycombining different observable quantities obtained from their x-ray spectraduring thermonuclear x-ray bursts. one of these quantities is the apparentradius of each neutron star as inferred from the x-ray flux and spectraltemperature measured during the cooling tails of bursts, when the thermonuclearflash is believed to have engulfed the entire star. in this paper, we analyze13,095 x-ray spectra of 446 x-ray bursts observed from 12 sources in order toassess possible systematic effects in the measurements of the apparent radii ofneutron stars. we first show that the vast majority of the observed x-rayspectra are consistent with blackbody functions to within a few percent. wefind that most x-ray bursts follow a very well determined correlation betweenx-ray flux and temperature, which is consistent with the whole neutron-starsurface emitting uniformly during the cooling tails. we develop a bayesiangaussian mixture algorithm to measure the apparent radii of the neutron starsin these sources, while detecting and excluding a small number of x-ray burststhat show irregular cooling behavior. this algorithm also provides us with aquantitative measure of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements. wefind that those errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron-star radiithat are introduced by systematic effects in the cooling tails of x-ray burstsare in the range $\simeq 3-8$%. such small errors are adequate to distinguishbetween different equations of state provided that uncertainties in thedistance to each source and the absolute calibration of x-ray detectors do notdominate the error budget.

1105.3191	a metric for rapidly spinning black holes suitable for strong-field  tests of the no-hair theorem	according to the no-hair theorem, astrophysical black holes are uniquelycharacterized by their masses and spins and are described by the kerr metric.several parametric deviations from the kerr metric have been suggested to studyobservational signatures in both the electromagnetic and gravitational-wavespectra that differ from the expected kerr signals. due to the no-hair theorem,however, such spacetimes cannot be regular everywhere outside the eventhorizons, if they are solutions to the einstein field equations; they are oftencharacterized by naked singularities or closed time-like loops in the regionsof the spacetime that are accessible to an external observer. for observationaltests of the no-hair theorem that involve phenomena in the vicinity of thecircular photon orbit or the innermost stable circular orbit around a blackhole, these pathologies limit the applicability of the metrics only to compactobjects that do not spin rapidly. in this paper, we construct a kerr-likemetric which depends on a set of free parameters in addition to its mass andspin and which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon. we deriveexpressions for the energy and angular momentum of a particle on a circularequatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the locations of theinnermost stable circular orbit and the circular photon orbit. we demonstratethat these orbits change significantly for even moderate deviations from thekerr metric. the properties of our metric make it an ideally suited spacetimeto carry out strong-field tests of the no-hair theorem in the electromagneticspectrum using the properties of accretion flows around astrophysical blackholes of arbitrary spin.

1110.4389	a ray-tracing algorithm for spinning compact object spacetimes with  arbitrary quadrupole moments. ii. neutron stars	a moderately spinning neutron star acquires an oblate shape and a spacetimewith a significant quadrupole moment. these two properties affect its apparentsurface area for an observer at infinity, as well as the lightcurve arisingfrom a hot spot on its surface. in this paper, we develop a ray-tracingalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinningneutron stars making use of the hartle-thorne metric. this analytic metricallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way thatdepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of itsequation of state. we use this algorithm to calculate the changes in theapparent surface area, which could play a role in measurements of neutron starradii and, therefore, in constraining their equation of state. we show thatwhether the spinning neutron star appears larger or smaller than itsnon-rotating counterpart depends primarily on its equatorial radius. forneutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the schwarzschild spacetimecause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. in contrast,for neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates thespacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease withincreasing spin frequency. in all cases, the change in the apparent geometricsurface area for the range of observed spin frequencies is &lt; 5% and hence onlya small source of error in the measurement of neutron star radii.

0803.1835	constraints on the size of extra dimensions from the orbital evolution  of black-hole x-ray binaries	one of the plausible unification schemes in physics considers the observableuniverse to be a 4-dimensional surface (the "brane") embedded in ahigher-dimensional curved spacetime (the "bulk"). in such braneworld gravitymodels with infinitely large extra dimensions, black holes evaporate fastthrough the emission of the additional gravitational degrees of freedom,resulting in lifetimes of stellar-mass black holes that are significantlysmaller than the hubble time. we show that the predicted evaporation rate leadsto a change in the orbital period of x-ray binaries harboring black holes thatis observable with current instruments. we obtain an upper limit on the rate ofchange of the orbital period of the binary a0620-00 and use it to constrain theasymptotic curvature radius of the extra dimension to a value comparable to theone obtained by table-top experiments. furthermore we argue that anymeasurement of a period increase for low-mass x-ray binaries with a high massratio is evidence for new physics beyond general relativity and the standardmodel.

1407.3277	rotational corrections to neutron-star radius measurements from thermal  spectra	we calculate the rotational broadening in the observed thermal spectra ofneutron stars spinning at moderate rates in the hartle-thorne approximation.these calculations accurately account for the effects of the second-orderdoppler boosts as well as for the oblate shapes and the quadrupole moments ofthe neutron stars. we find that fitting the spectra and inferring thebolometric fluxes under the assumption that a star is not rotating causes anunderestimate of the inferred fluxes and, thus, radii. the correction dependson the stellar spin, radius, and observer's inclination. for a 10 km neutronstar spinning at 600 hz, the rotational correction to the flux is ~1-4%, whilefor a 15 km neutron star with the same spin period, the correction ranges from2% for pole-on sources to 12% for edge-on sources. we calculate theinclination-averaged corrections to inferred radii as a function of theneutron-star radius and mass and provide an empirical formula for thecorrections. for realistic neutron star parameters (1.4 m$_\odot$, 12 km, 600hz), the stellar radius is on the order of 4% larger than the radius inferredunder the assumption that the star is not spinning.

1410.3492	the power of imaging: constraining the plasma properties of grmhd  simulations using eht observations of sgr a*	recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations haveexpanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretiondisks. however, current simulations do not capture the thermodynamics ofelectrons in the low density accreting plasma. this poses a significantchallenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from firstprinciples. because of this, simplified emission models have often been used,with widely different configurations (e.g., disk- versus jet-dominatedemission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties ofaccreting black-holes. exploring the large parameter space introduced by suchmodels, however, requires significant computational power that exceedsconventional computational facilities. in this paper, we use gray, a fastgpu-based ray-tracing algorithm, on the gpu cluster el gato, to compute imagesand spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamicsimulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins.we also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics ineach of the simulations. we show that, if only the spectral properties of sgra* are used, all twelve models tested here can fit the spectra equally well.however, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emissionusing the event horizon telescope, current observations rule out all modelswith strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended.our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolutionoffer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black-holes andtheir thermodynamic properties.

1505.05155	the dense matter equation of state from neutron star radius and mass  measurements	we present a comprehensive study of spectroscopic radius measurements oftwelve neutron stars obtained during thermonuclear bursts or in quiescence. weincorporate, for the first time, a large number of systematic uncertainties inthe measurement of the apparent angular sizes, eddington fluxes, and distances,in the composition of the interstellar medium, and in the flux calibration ofx-ray detectors. we also take into account the results of recent theoreticalcalculations of rotational effects on neutron star radii, of atmosphericeffects on surface spectra, and of relativistic corrections to the eddingtoncritical flux. we employ bayesian statistical frameworks to obtain neutron starradii from the spectroscopic measurements as well as to infer the equation ofstate from the radius measurements. combining these with the results ofexperiments in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density and the observationsof ~2 msun neutron stars, we place strong and quantitative constraints on theproperties of the equation of state between approximately 2-8 times the nuclearsaturation density. we find that around m=1.5 msun, the preferred equation ofstate predicts radii between 10.1 - 11.1 km. when interpreting the pressureconstraints in the context of high density equations of state based oninteracting nucleons, our results suggest a relatively weak contribution of thethree-body interaction potential.

1505.05156	statistics of measuring neutron star radii: assessing a frequentist and  a bayesian approach	measuring neutron star radii with spectroscopic and timing techniques relieson the combination of multiple observables to break the degeneracies betweenthe mass and radius introduced by general relativistic effects. here, weexplore a previously used frequentist and a newly proposed bayesian frameworkto obtain the most likely value and the uncertainty in such a measurement. wefind that, for the expected range of masses and radii and for realisticmeasurement errors, the frequentist approach suffers from biases that arelarger than the accuracy in the radius measurement required to distinguishbetween the different equations of state. in contrast, in the bayesianframework, the inferred uncertainties are larger, but the most likely values donot suffer from such biases. we also investigate ways of quantifying the degreeof consistency between different spectroscopic measurements from a singlesource. we show that a careful assessment of the systematic uncertainties inthe measurements eliminates the need for introducing ad hoc biases, which leadto artificially large inferred radii.

1509.02924	data selection criteria for spectroscopic measurements of neutron star  radii with x-ray bursts	data selection and the determination of systematic uncertainties in thespectroscopic measurements of neutron star radii from thermonuclear x-raybursts have been the subject of numerous recent studies. in one approach, theuncertainties and outliers were determined by a data-driven bayesian mixturemodel, whereas in a second approach, data selection was performed by requiringthat the observations follow theoretical expectations. we show here that, dueto inherent limitations in the data, the theoretically expected trends are notdiscernible in the majority of x-ray bursts even if they are present.therefore, the proposed theoretical selection criteria are not practical withthe current data for distinguishing clean data sets from outliers. furthermore,when the data limitations are not taken into account, the theoreticallymotivated approach selects a small subset of bursts with properties that are infact inconsistent with the underlying assumptions of the method. we concludethat the data-driven selection methods do not suffer from the limitations ofthis theoretically motivated one.

1510.04208	heroic: 3d general relativistic radiative postprocessor with  comptonization for black hole accretion discs	we describe heroic, an upgraded version of the relativistic radiativepost-processor code hero described in a previous paper, but which now includescomptonization. heroic models comptonization via the kompaneets equation, usinga quadratic approximation for the source function in the short characteristicsradiation solver. it employs a simple form of accelerated lambda iteration tohandle regions of high scattering opacity. in addition to solving for theradiation field, heroic also solves for the gas temperature by applying thecondition of radiative equilibrium. we present benchmarks and tests of thecomptonization module in heroic with simple 1d and 3d scattering problems. wealso test the ability of the code to handle various relativistic effects usingmodel atmospheres and accretion flows in a black hole space-time. we presenttwo applications of heroic to general relativistic mhd simulations of accretiondiscs. one application is to a thin accretion disc around a black hole. we findthat the gas below the photosphere in the multi-dimensional heroic solution isnearly isothermal, quite different from previous solutions based on 1d planeparallel atmospheres. the second application is to a geometrically thickradiation-dominated accretion disc accreting at 11 times the eddington rate.the multi-dimensional heroic solution shows that, for observers who are on axisand look down the polar funnel, the isotropic equivalent luminosity could bemore than ten times the eddington limit, even though the spectrum might stilllook thermal and show no signs of relativistic beaming.

1512.03067	measuring neutron star radii via pulse profile modeling with nicer	the neutron-star interior composition explorer (nicer) is an x-rayastrophysics payload that will be placed on the international space station.its primary science goal is to measure with high accuracy the pulse profilesthat arise from the non-uniform thermal surface emission of rotation-poweredpulsars. modeling general relativistic effects on the profiles will lead tomeasuring the radii of these neutron stars and to constraining their equationof state. achieving this goal will depend, among other things, on accurateknowledge of the source, sky, and instrument backgrounds. we use here simpleanalytic estimates to quantify the level at which these backgrounds need to beknown in order for the upcoming measurements to provide significant constraintson the properties of neutron stars. we show that, even in theminimal-information scenario, knowledge of the background at a few percentlevel for a background-to-source countrate ratio of 0.2 allows for ameasurement of the neutron star compactness to better than 10% uncertainty formost of the parameter space. these constraints improve further when morerealistic assumptions are made about the neutron star emission and spin, andwhen additional information about the source itself, such as its mass ordistance, are incorporated.

0807.0730	quasi-periodic oscillations as global hydrodynamic modes in the boundary  layers of viscous accretion disks	the observational characteristics of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) fromaccreting neutron stars strongly indicate the oscillatory modes in theinnermost regions of accretion disks as a likely source of the qpos. the innerregions of accretion disks around neutron stars can harbor very high frequencymodes related to the radial epicyclic frequency $\kappa $. the degeneracy of$\kappa $ with the orbital frequency $\omega $ is removed in a non-keplerianboundary or transition zone near the magnetopause between the disk and thecompact object. we show, by analyzing the global hydrodynamic modes of longwavelength in the boundary layers of viscous accretion disks, that the fastestgrowing mode frequencies are associated with frequency bands around $\kappa $and $\kappa \pm \omega $. the maximum growth rates are achieved near the radiuswhere the orbital frequency $\omega $ is maximum. the global hydrodynamicparameters such as the surface density profile and the radial drift velocitydetermine which modes of free oscillations will grow at a given particularradius in the boundary layer. in accordance with the peak separation betweenkhz qpos observed in neutron-star sources, the difference frequency between twoconsecutive bands of the fastest growing modes is always related to the spinfrequency of the neutron star. this is a natural outcome of the boundarycondition imposed by the rotating magnetosphere on the boundary region of theinner disk.

astro-ph;0001391	on the origin of quasi-periodic oscillations and broad-band noise in  accreting neutron stars and black holes	accreting neutron stars and black holes share a number of rapid variabilitycharacteristics, such as quasi-periodic oscillations and broad-band noise. thefrequencies of these features were recently shown to be comparable tofundamental general relativistic frequencies of perturbed test-particle orbitsnear the compact objects. in this paper we propose a dynamical model forproducing modulations in the inner disk properties at these characteristicfrequencies. we postulate that a transition radius exists in the accretion diskclose to the compact object and investigate its response to a broad spectrum ofdensity fluctuations. we find that the transition radius acts as a lowband-pass filter with a broadband response that is constant at frequencieslower than the inverse radial drift timescale and decreases above it as theinverse of the frequency. moreover, the response shows strong resonances atfrequencies nearly equal to the orbital, periastron-precession, andnodal-precession frequencies, thereby accounting for the observed power-densityspectra of accreting compact objects and the correlations between theircharacteristic frequencies.

astro-ph;0004387	photon propagation around compact objects and the inferred properties of  thermally emitting neutron stars	anomalous x-ray pulsars, compact non-pulsing x-ray sources in supernovaremnants, and x-ray bursters are three distinct types of sources for whichthere are viable models that attribute their x-ray emission to thermal emissionfrom the surface of a neutron star. inferring the surface area of the emittingregions in such systems is crucial in assessing the viability of differentmodels and in providing bounds on the radii of neutron stars. we show that theinferred areas of the emitting regions may be over- or under-estimated by afactor of &lt;=2, because of the geometry of the system and general relativisticlight deflection, combined with the effects of phase averaging. such effectsmake the determination of neutron-star radii uncertain, especially whencompared to the ~5% level required for constraining the equation of state ofneutron-star matter. we also note that, for a given spectral shape, theinferred source luminosities and pulse fractions are anticorrelated becausethey depend on the same properties of the emitting regions, namely their sizesand orientations, i.e., brighter sources have on average weaker pulsationamplitudes than fainter sources. we argue that this property can be used as adiagnostic tool in distinguishing between different spectral models. as anexample, we show that the high inferred pulse fraction and brightness of thepulsar rxs j1708-40 are inconsistent with isotropic thermal emission from aneutron-star surface. finally, we discuss the implication of our results forsurveys in the soft x-rays for young, cooling neutron stars in supernovaremnants and show that the absence of detectable pulsations from the compactsource at the center of cas a (at a level of &gt;=30%) is not a strong argumentagaints its identification with a spinning neutron star.

astro-ph;0105372	constraints on thermal emission models of anomalous x-ray pulsars	thermal emission from the surface of an ultramagnetic neutron star isbelieved to contribute significantly to the soft x-ray flux of the anomalousx-ray pulsars. we compare the detailed predictions of models of the surfaceemission from a magnetar to the observed properties of axps. in particular, wefocus on the combination of their luminosities and energy-dependent pulsedfractions. we use the results of recent calculations for strongly magnetizedatmospheres to obtain the angle- and energy-dependence of the surface emission.we include in our calculations the effects of general relativistic photontransport and interstellar extinction. we find that the combination of thelarge pulsed fractions and the high luminosities of axps cannot be accountedfor by surface emission from a magnetar with two antipodal hot regions or atemperature distribution characteristic of a magnetic dipole. this result isrobust for reasonable neutron star radii, for the range of magnetic fieldstrengths inferred from the observed spin down rates, and for surfacetemperatures consistent with the spectral properties of axps. models with asingle hot emitting region can reproduce the observations, provided that thedistance to one of the sources is ~30% less than the current best estimate, andallowing for systematic uncertainties in the spectral fit of a second source.finally, the thermal emission models with antipodal emission geometry predict acharacteristic strong increase of the pulsed fraction with photon energy, whichis apparently inconsistent with the current data. the energy-dependence of thepulsed fraction in the models with one hot region shows a wider range ofbehavior and can be consistent with the existing data. upcoming high-resolutionobservations with chandra and xmm-newton will provide a conclusive test.

astro-ph;0406071	the stability of magnetized rotating plasmas with superthermal fields	during the last decade it has become evident that the magnetorotationalinstability is at the heart of the enhanced angular momentum transport inweakly magnetized accretion disks around neutron stars and black holes. in thispaper, we investigate the local linear stability of differentially rotating,magnetized flows and the evolution of the magnetorotational instability beyondthe weak-field limit. we show that, when superthermal toroidal fields areconsidered, the effects of both compressibility and magnetic tension forces,which are related to the curvature of toroidal field lines, should be takenfully into account. we demonstrate that the presence of a strong toroidalcomponent in the magnetic field plays a non-trivial role. when strong fieldsare considered, the strength of the toroidal magnetic field not only modifiesthe growth rates of the unstable modes but also determines which modes aresubject to instabilities. we find that, for rotating configurations withkeplerian laws, the magnetorotational instability is stabilized at lowwavenumbers for toroidal alfven speeds exceeding the geometric mean of thesound speed and the rotational speed. we discuss the significance of ourfindings for the stability of cold, magnetically dominated, rotating fluids andargue that, for these systems, the curvature of toroidal field lines cannot beneglected even when short wavelength perturbations are considered. we alsocomment on the implications of our results for the validity of shearing boxsimulations in which superthermal toroidal fields are generated.

astro-ph;0511380	eddington-limited x-ray bursts as distance indicators. ii. possible  compositional effects in bursts from 4u 1636-536	we analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-i) x-ray bursts observed by the rossix-ray timing explorer from the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1636-536. all but twoof the 40 radius-exansion bursts in this sample reached peak fluxes which werenormally distributed about a mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standarddeviation of 7.6%. the remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peakfluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a consequence,the overall variation in the peak flux of the radius-expansion bursts was afactor of ~2. this variation is comparable to the range of the eddington limitbetween material with solar h-fraction (x=0.7) and pure he. such a variationmay arise if, for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the accreted h iseliminated either by steady hot cno burning or expelled in a radiatively-drivenwind. however, steady burning cannot exhaust the accreted h for solarcomposition material within the typical ~2 hr burst recurrence time, nor can itresult in sufficient elemental stratification to allow selective ejection ofthe h only. an additional stratification mechanism appears to be required toseparate the accreted elements and thus allow preferential ejection of thehydrogen. we found no evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution betweenthe radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts, previously observed insmaller samples. assuming that the faint radius-expansion bursts reached theeddington limit for h-rich material (x~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limitfor pure he (x=0), we estimate the distance to 4u 1636-536 (for a canonicalneutron star with m_ns=1.4m_sun, r_ns=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5 kpc, or form_ns=2m_sun at most 7.1 kpc.

astro-ph;0512448	spectral methods for time-dependent studies of accretion flows. ii.  two-dimensional hydrodynamic disks with self-gravity	spectral methods are well suited for solving hydrodynamic problems in whichthe self-gravity of the flow needs to be considered. because poisson's equationis linear, the numerical solution for the gravitational potential for eachindividual mode of the density can be pre-computed, thus reducing substantiallythe computational cost of the method. in this second paper, we describe twodifferent approaches to computing the gravitational field of a two-dimensionalflow with pseudo-spectral methods. for situations in which the density profileis independent of the third coordinate (i.e., an infinite cylinder), we use astandard poisson solver in spectral space. on the other hand, for situations inwhich the density profile is a delta function along the third coordinate (i.e.,an infinitesimally thin disk), or any other function known a priori, we performa direct integration of poisson's equation using a green's functions approach.we devise a number of test problems to verify the implementations of these twomethods. finally, we use our method to study the stability of polytropic,self-gravitating disks. we find that, when the polytropic index gamma is &lt;=4/3, toomre's criterion correctly describes the stability of the disk. however,when gamma &gt; 4/3 and for large values of the polytropic constant k, thenumerical solutions are always stable, even when the linear criterion predictsthe contrary. we show that, in the latter case, the minimum wavelength of theunstable modes is larger than the extent of the unstable region and hence thelocal linear analysis is inapplicable.

astro-ph;0603178	the signature of the magnetorotational instability in the reynolds and  maxwell stress tensors in accretion discs	the magnetorotational instability is thought to be responsible for thegeneration of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that leads to enhanced outwardangular momentum transport in accretion discs. here, we present the firstformal analytical proof showing that, during the exponential growth of theinstability, the mean (averaged over the disc scale-height) reynolds stress isalways positive, the mean maxwell stress is always negative, and hence the meantotal stress is positive and leads to a net outward flux of angular momentum.more importantly, we show that the ratio of the maxwell to the reynoldsstresses during the late times of the exponential growth of the instability isdetermined only by the local shear and does not depend on the initial spectrumof perturbations or the strength of the seed magnetic. even though we derivedthese properties of the stress tensors for the exponential growth of theinstability in incompressible flows, numerical simulations of shearing boxesshow that this characteristic is qualitatively preserved under more generalconditions, even during the saturated turbulent state generated by theinstability.

astro-ph;0608259	thermonuclear (type-i) x-ray bursts observed by the rossi x-ray timing  explorer	we have assembled a sample of 1187 thermonuclear (type-i) x-ray bursts from48 accreting neutron stars by the rossi x-ray timing explorer, spanning morethan ten years. the sample contains examples of two of the three theoreticalignition regimes and likely examples of the third. we present a detailedanalysis of the variation of the burst profiles, energetics, recurrence times,presence of photospheric radius expansion, and presence of burst oscillations,as a function of accretion rate.  we estimated the distance for 35 sources exhibiting radius-expansion bursts,and found that the peak flux of such bursts varies typically by 13%. weclassified sources into two main groups based on the burst properties: bothlong and short bursts (indicating mixed h/he accretion), and consistently shortbursts (primarily he accretion). the decrease in burst rate observed for bothgroups at &gt;0.06 mdot_edd (&gt;~2e37 erg/s) is associated with a transition in thepersistent spectral state and (as has been suggested previously) may be relatedto the increasing role of steady he-burning. we found examples of burstsseparated by &lt;30 min, including burst triplets and even quadruplets.  we describe the oscillation amplitudes for 13 of the 16 burst oscillationsources, as well as the stages and properties of the bursts in which theoscillations are detected. the burst properties are correlated with the burstoscillation frequency; sources at &lt;400 hz generally have consistently shortbursts, while the more rapidly-spinning systems have both long and shortbursts. this correlation suggests either that shear-mediated mixing dominatesthe burst properties, or that the nature of the mass donor (and hence theevolutionary history) has an influence on the long-term spin evolution.

astro-ph;0612742	spectral methods for time-dependent studies of accretion flows. iii.  three-dimensional, self-gravitating, magnetohydrodynamic disks	accretion disks are three-dimensional, turbulent, often self-gravitating,magnetohydrodynamic flows, which can be modeled in detail with numericalsimulations. in this paper, we present a new algorithm that is based on aspectral decomposition method to simulate such flows. because of the high orderof the method, we can solve the induction equation in terms of the magneticpotential and, therefore, ensure trivially that the magnetic fields in thenumerical solution are divergence free. the spectral method also suffersminimally from numerical dissipation and allows for an easy implementation ofmodels for sub-grid physics. both properties make our method ideal for studyingmhd turbulent flows such as those found in accretion disks around compactobjects. we verify our algorithm with a series of standard tests and use it toshow the development of mhd turbulnce in a simulation of an accretion disk.finally, we study the evolution and saturation of the power spectrum of mhdturbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability.

astro-ph;9609157	sonic-point model of kilohertz quasi-periodic brightness oscillations in  low-mass x-ray binaries	strong, coherent, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations (qpos) withfrequencies ranging from about 300 hz to 1200 hz have been discovered with therossi x-ray timing explorer in the x-ray emission from some fifteen neutronstars in low-mass binary systems. two simultaneous kilohertz qpos differing infrequency by 250 to 350 hertz have been detected in twelve of the fifteensources. here we propose a model for these qpos. in this model the x-ray sourceis a neutron star with a surface magnetic field of 10^7 to 10^10 g and a spinfrequency of a few hundred hertz, accreting gas via a keplerian disk. thefrequency of the higher-frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair is the keplerianfrequency at a radius near the sonic point at the inner edge of the keplerianflow whereas the frequency of the lower-frequency qpo is approximately thedifference between the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point andthe stellar spin frequency. this model explains naturally many properties ofthe kilohertz qpos, including their frequencies, amplitudes, and coherence. weshow that if the frequency of the higher-frequency qpo in a pair is an orbitalfrequency, as in the sonic-point model, the frequencies of these qpos placeinteresting upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in thekilohertz qpo sources and provide new constraints on the equation of state ofmatter at high densities. further observations of these qpos may providecompelling evidence for the existence of a marginally stable orbit, confirminga key prediction of general relativity in the strong-field regime.

0809.2790	the redshift evolution of the tully-fisher relation as a test of  modified gravity	the redshift evolution of the tully-fisher relation probes gravitationaldynamics that must be consistent with any modified gravity theory seeking toexplain the galactic rotation curves without the need for dark matter. withinthe context of non-relativistic modified newtonian dynamics (mond), thecharacteristic acceleration scale of the theory appears to be related to thecurrent value of either the hubble constant, i.e., alpha ~ ch_0, or the darkenergy density, i.e., alpha (8 pi g rho_lambda/3)^{1/2}. if these relations arethe manifestation of a fundamental coupling of a_0 to either of the twocosmological parameters, the cosmological evolution would then dictate aparticular dependence of the mond acceleration scale with redshift that can betested with tully-fisher relations of high-redshift galaxies. we compare thisprediction to two sets of tully-fisher data with redshifts up to z=1.2. we findthat both couplings are excluded within the formal uncertainties. however, whenwe take into account the potential systematic uncertainties in the data, wefind that they marginally favor the coupling of the mond acceleration scale tothe density of dark energy.

astro-ph;9706017	compton scattering by static and moving media i. the transfer equation  and its moments	compton scattering of photons by nonrelativistic particles is thought to playan important role in forming the radiation spectrum of many astrophysicalsystems. here we derive the time-dependent photon kinetic equation thatdescribes spontaneous and induced compton scattering as well as absorption andemission by static and moving media, the corresponding radiative transferequation, and their zeroth and first moments, in both the system frame and inthe frame comoving with the medium. we show that it is necessary to use thecorrect relativistic differential scattering cross section in order to obtain aphoton kinetic equation that is correct to first order in epsilon/m_e, t_e/m_e,and v, where epsilon is the photon energy, t_e and m_e are the electrontemperature and rest mass, and v is the electron bulk velocity in units of thespeed of light. we also demonstrate that the terms in the radiative transferequation that are second-order in v usually should be retained, because if theradiation energy density is sufficiently large compared to the radiation flux,the effects of bulk comptonization described by the terms that are second-orderin v are at least as important as the effects described by the terms that arefirst-order in v, even when v is small. our equations are valid for systems ofarbitrary optical depth and can therefore be used in both the free-streamingand the diffusion regimes. we demonstrate that comptonization by the electronbulk motion occurs whether or not the radiation field is isotropic or the bulkflow converges and that it is more important than thermal comptonization if v^2&gt; 3 t_e/m_e.

astro-ph;9801140	constraints on the equation of state of neutron star matter from  observations of kilohertz qpos	the frequencies of the highest-frequency kilohertz qpos recently discoveredin some sixteen neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binary systems are most likelythe orbital frequencies of gas in keplerian orbit around these neutron stars.if so, these qpos provide tight upper bounds on the masses and radii of theseneutron stars and important new constraints on the equation of state of neutronstar matter. if the frequency of a kilohertz qpo can be established as theorbital frequency of gas at the innermost stable circular orbit, this wouldconfirm one of the key predictions of general relativity in the strong-gravityregime. if the spin frequency of the neutron star can also be determined, thefrequency of the qpo would fix the mass of the neutron star for each assumedequation of state. here we show how to derive mass and radius bounds, using thekilohertz qpos, for nonrotating and slowly rotating stars, and discuss howthese bounds are affected by rapid stellar rotation and radial radiationforces. we also describe observational results that would be strong evidencefor the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit. no such strong evidenceis present in current data, but future prospects are excellent.

astro-ph;9802089	rapid x-ray variability of neutron stars in low-mass binary systems	the dramatic discovery with the rossi x-ray timing explorer satellite ofremarkably coherent $\sim$300--1200 hz oscillations in the x-ray brightness ofsome sixteen neutron stars in low-mass binary systems has spurred theoreticalmodeling of these oscillations and investigation of their implications for theneutron stars and accretion flows in these systems. high-frequency oscillationsare observed both during thermonuclear x-ray bursts and during intervals ofaccretion-powered emission and appear to be a characteristic feature ofdisk-accreting neutron stars with weak magnetic fields. in this review we focuson the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) seen in theaccretion-powered emission. we first summarize the key properties of thesekilohertz qpos and then describe briefly the models that have been proposed toexplain them. the existing evidence strongly favors beat-frequency models. wemention several of the difficulties encountered in applying the magnetosphericbeat-frequency model to the kilohertz qpos. the most fully developed andsuccessful model is the sonic-point beat-frequency model. we describe the workon this model in some detail. we then discuss observations that could help todistinguish between models. we conclude by noting some of the ways in whichstudy of the kilohertz qpos may advance our understanding of dense matter andstrong gravitational fields.

astro-ph;9809335	the disk-magnetosphere interaction in the accretion-powered millisecond  pulsar sax j1808.4-3658	the recent discovery of the first known accretion-powered millisecond pulsarwith the rossi x-ray timing explorer provides the first direct probe of theinteraction of an accretion disk with the magnetic field of a weakly magnetic(b&lt;10^10 g) neutron star. we demonstrate that the presence of coherentpulsations from a weakly magnetic neutron star over a wide range of accretionrates places strong constraints on models of the disk-magnetosphereinteraction. we argue that the simple mdot^(3/7) scaling law for the keplerianfrequency at the magnetic interaction radius, widely used to model diskaccretion onto magnetic stars, is not consistent with observations of saxj1808.4-3658 for most proposed equations of state for stable neutron stars. weshow that the usually neglected effects of multipole magnetic moments,radiation drag forces, and general relativity must be considered when modelingsuch weakly magnetic systems. using only very general assumptions, we obtain arobust estimate of mu~(1-10)x10^26 g cm^3 for the dipole magnetic moment of saxj1808.4-3658, implying a surface dipole field of ~10^8-10^9 g at the stellarequator. we therefore infer that after the end of its accretion phase, thissource will become a normal millisecond radio pulsar. finally, we compare thephysical properties of this pulsar to those of the non-pulsing, weakly magneticneutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries and argue that the absence of coherentpulsations from the latter does not necessarily imply that these neutron starshave significantly different magnetic field strengths from sax j1808.4-3658.

astro-ph;9903105	on the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring interpretations  of the horizontal branch oscillation in the z sources	we study the horizontal branch oscillations (hbo) and the two simultaneouskilohertz qpos comparing their properties in five z sources with thepredictions of the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring precessionmodels. we find that the variation of the hbo frequency with accretion ratepredicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolarstellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion diskagrees well with the observed variation. this model implies that the neutronstars in the z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magneticfield strengths are ~10^9-10^10 g, and that the critical fastness parameter forthese sources is &gt;0.8. if the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is anorbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequencymodel requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couplestrongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead driftsslowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers ofthe neutron star surface. the lense-thirring precession model is consistentwith the observed magnitudes of the hbo frequencies only if the moments ofinertia of the neutron stars in the z sources are 4-5 times larger than thelargest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. thetrend of the correlation between the hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies is notconsistent with this model. we argue that the change in the slope of thecorrelation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and thefrequency of the upper kilohertz qpo, when the latter is greater than 850 hz,is directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos.

astro-ph;9903415	bounds on neutron-star moments of inertia and the evidence for general  relativistic frame dragging	recent x-ray variability observations of accreting neutron stars may providethe first evidence for frame dragging effects around spinning relativisticobjects. motivated by this possibility and its implications for neutron-starstructural properties, we calculate new optimal bounds on the masses, radii,and moments of inertia of slowly rotating neutron stars that show kilohertzquasi-periodic oscillations (qpos). these bounds are derived under minimalassumptions about the properties of matter at high densities and therefore arelargely independent of the unknown equation of state. we further derive asemi-analytical upper bound on the neutron-star moment of inertia withoutmaking any assumptions about the equation of state of matter at any density. weuse this upper bound to show that the maximum possible nodal precessionfrequency of an inclined circular orbit around a slowly spinning neutron staris nu_{np}~45.2 (nu_s/300hz) hz, where nu_s is the spin frequency of theneutron star. we conclude that the nodal-precession interpretation oflow-frequency qpos in accreting neutron stars is inconsistent with theirinferred spin frequencies or the identification of the highest-frequency qpowith that of a circular keplerian orbit in the accretion disk.
