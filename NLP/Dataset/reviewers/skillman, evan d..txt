0901.2361	the true durations of starbursts: hst observations of three nearby dwarf  starburst galaxies	the duration of a starburst is a fundamental parameter affecting theevolution of galaxies yet, to date, observational constraints on the durationsof starbursts are not well established. here we study the recent star formationhistories (sfhs) of three nearby dwarf galaxies to rigorously quantify theduration of their starburst events using a uniform and consistent approach. wefind that the bursts range from ~200 - ~400 myr in duration resolving thetension between the shorter timescales often derived observationally with thelonger timescales derived from dynamical arguments. if these three starburstsare typical of starbursts in dwarf galaxies, then the short timescales (3 - 10myr) associated with starbursts in previous studies are best understood as"flickering" events which are simply small components of the larger starburst.in this sample of three nearby dwarfs, the bursts are not localized events. allthree systems show bursting levels of star formation in regions of both highand low stellar density. the enhanced star formation moves around the galaxyduring the bursts and covers a large fraction of the area of the galaxy. thesemassive, long duration bursts can significantly affect the structure, dynamics,and chemical evolution of the host galaxy and can be the progenitors of"superwinds" that drive much of the recently chemically enriched material fromthe galaxy into the intergalactic medium.

0903.3871	a spitzer study of asymptotic giant branch stars. iii. dust production  and gas return in local group dwarf irregular galaxies	we present the third and final part of a census of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars in local group dwarf irregular galaxies. papers i and ii presentedthe results for wlm and ic 1613. included here are phoenix, lgs 3, ddo 210, leoa, pegasus dirr, and sextans a. spitzer photometry at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 arepresented, along with a more thorough treatment of background galaxycontamination than was presented in papers i and ii. we find that at least asmall population of completely optically obscured agb stars exists in eachgalaxy, regardless of the galaxy's metallicity, but that higher-metallicitygalaxies tend to harbor more stars with slight ir excesses. the opticalincompleteness increases for the redder agb stars, in line with the expectationthat some agb stars are not detected in the optical due to large amounts ofextinction associated with in situ dust production. overall, there is anunderrepresentation of 30% - 40% in the optical agb within the 1 sigma errorsfor all of the galaxies in our sample. this undetected population is largeenough to affect star formation histories derived from optical color-magnitudediagrams. as measured from the [3.6] - [4.5] color excesses, we find averagestellar mass-loss rates ranging from 3.1e-7 - 6.6e-6 solar masses per year, andintegrated galaxy mass-loss rates ranging from 4.4e-5 - 1.4e-3 solar masses peryear. the integrated mass-loss rate is sufficient to sustain the current starformation rate in only lgs 3 and ddo 210, requiring either significantnon-dusty mass loss or gas accretion in phoenix, leo a, pegasus dirr, sextansa, wlm, and ic 1613 if they are to maintain their status as gas-rich galaxies.

0706.3213	a spitzer irac census of the asymptotic giant branch populations in  local group dwarfs. ii. ic 1613	we present spitzer space telescope irac photometry of the local group dwarfirregular galaxy ic 1613. we compare our 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micronphotometry with broadband optical photometry and find that the optical data donot detect 43% and misidentify an additional 11% of the total agb population,likely because of extinction caused by circumstellar material. further, we findthat a narrowband optical carbon star study of ic 1613 detects 50% of the totalagb population and only considers 18% of this population in calculating thecarbon to m-type agb ratio. we derive an integrated mass-loss rate from the agbstars of 0.2-1.0 x 10^(-3) solar masses per year and find that the distributionof bolometric luminosities and mass-loss rates are consistent with those forother nearby metal-poor galaxies. both the optical completeness fractions andmass-loss rates in ic 1613 are very similar to those in the local group dwarfirregular, wlm, which is expected given their similar characteristics andevolutionary histories.

0909.3025	does stellar feedback create hi holes? an hst/vla study of holmberg ii	we use deep hst/acs f555w and f814w photometry of resolved stars in the m81group dwarf irregular galaxy ho ii to study the hypothesis that the holesidentified in the neutral ism (hi) are created by stellar feedback. from thedeep photometry, we construct color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) and measure thestar formation histories (sfhs) for stars contained in hi holes from twoindependent holes catalogs, as well as select control fields, i.e., similarsized regions that span a range of hi column densities. converting the recentsfhs into stellar feedback energies, we find that enough energy has beengenerated to have created all holes. however, the required energy is not alwaysproduced over a time scale that is less than the estimated kinematic age of thehole. the combination of the cmds, recent sfhs, and locations of young starsshows that the stellar populations inside hi holes are not coherent,single-aged, stellar clusters, as previously suggested, but rather multi-agepopulations distributed across each hole. from a comparison of the modeled andobserved integrated magnitudes, and the locations and energetics of starsinside of hi holes, we propose a potential new model: a viable mechanism forcreating the observed hi holes in ho ii is stellar feedback from multiplegenerations of sf spread out over tens or hundreds of myr, and thus, theconcept of an age for an hi hole is intrinsically ambiguous. we further findthat \halpha and 24 micron emission, tracers of the most recent star formation,do not correlate well with the positions of the hi holes. however, uv emission,which traces star formation over roughly the last 100 myr, shows a much bettercorrelation with the locations of the hi holes.

0910.3162	chemical abundances of seven irregular and three tidal dwarf galaxies in  the m81 group	we have derived nebular abundances for 10 dwarf galaxies belonging to the m81group, including several galaxies which do not have abundances previouslyreported in the literature. for each galaxy, multiple h \ii regions wereobserved with gmos-n at the gemini observatory in order to determine abundancesof several elements (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, neon, and argon). for sevengalaxies, at least one h \ii region had a detection of the temperaturesensitive [oiii] $\lambda$4363 line, allowing a "direct" determination of theoxygen abundance. no abundance gradients were detected in the targeted galaxiesand the observed oxygen abundances are typically in agreement with the wellknown metallicity-luminosity relation. however, three candidate "tidal dwarf"galaxies lie well off this relation, ugc 5336, garland, and kdg 61. the natureof these systems suggests that ugc 5336 and garland are indeed recently formedsystems, whereas kdg 61 is most likely a dwarf spheroidal galaxy which liesalong the same line of sight as the m81 tidal debris field. we propose thatthese h \ii regions formed from previously enriched gas which was stripped fromnearby massive galaxies (e.g., ngc 3077 and m81) during a recent tidalinteraction.

0911.3879	star formation in dwarf galaxies of the nearby centaurus a group	we present halpha narrow-band imaging of 17 dwarf irregular galaxies (dis) inthe nearby centaurus a group. although all large galaxies of the group have acurrent or recent enhanced star formation episode, the dis have normal starformation rates and do not contain a larger fraction of dwarf starbursts thanother nearby groups. relative distances between dis and larger galaxies of thegroup can be computed in 3d since most of them have now fairly accurately knowndistances. we find that the di star formation rates do not depend on localenvironment, and in particular they do not show any correlation with thedistance of the di to the nearest large galaxy of the group. there is a clearmorphology-density relation in the centaurus a group, similarly to the sculptorand local groups, in the sense that des/dsphs tend to be at small distancesfrom the more massive galaxies of the group, while dis are on average at largerdistances. we find four transition dwarfs in the group, dwarfs that showcharacteristics of both de/dsphs and dis, and which contain cold gas but nocurrent star formation. interestingly the transition dwarfs have an averagedistance to the more massive galaxies which is intermediate between those ofthe des/dsphs and dis, and which is quite large: 0.54 +- 0.31 mpc. this largedistance poses some difficulty for the most popular scenarios proposed fortransforming a di into a de/dsph (ram-pressure with tidal stripping or galaxyharassment). if the observed transition dwarfs are indeed missing links betweendis and de/dsphs, their relative isolation makes it less likely to have beenproduced by these mechanisms. we propose that an inhomogeneous igm containinghigher density clumps would be able to ram-pressure stripped the dis at suchlarge distances.

1001.5218	a new approach to systematic uncertainties and self-consistency in  helium abundance determinations	tests of big bang nucleosynthesis and early universe cosmology requireprecision measurements for helium abundance determinations. however, efforts todetermine the primordial helium abundance via observations of metal poor h iiregions have been limited by significant uncertainties. this work builds uponprevious work by providing an updated and extended program in evaluating theseuncertainties. procedural consistency is achieved by integrating the hydrogenbased reddening correction with the helium based abundance calculation, i.e.,all physical parameters are solved for simultaneously. we include new atomicdata for helium recombination and collisional emission based upon recent workby porter et al. and wavelength dependent corrections to underlying absorptionare investigated. the set of physical parameters has been expanded here toinclude the effects of neutral hydrogen collisional emission. because of adegeneracy between the solutions for density and temperature, the precision ofthe helium abundance determinations is limited. also, at lower temperatures (t\lesssim 13,000 k) the neutral hydrogen fraction is poorly constrainedresulting in a larger uncertainty in the helium abundances. thus the derivederrors on the helium abundances for individual objects are larger than thosetypical of previous studies. the updated emissivities and neutral hydrogencorrection generally raise the abundance. from a regression to zerometallicity, we find y_p as 0.2561 \pm 0.0108, in broad agreement with the wmapresult. tests with synthetic data show a potential for distinct improvement,via removal of underlying absorption, using higher resolution spectra. a smallbias in the abundance determination can be reduced significantly and thecalculated helium abundance error can be reduced by \sim 25%.

1008.1589	the nature of starbursts: i. the star formation histories of eighteen  nearby starburst dwarf galaxies	we use archival hst observations of resolved stellar populations to derivethe star formation histories (sfhs) of 18 nearby starburst dwarf galaxies. inthis first paper we present the observations, color-magnitude diagrams, and thesfhs of the 18 starburst galaxies, based on a homogeneous approach to the datareduction, differential extinction, and treatment of photometric completeness.we adopt a star formation rate (sfr) threshold normalized to the average sfr ofthe individual system as a metric for classifying starbursts in sfhs derivedfrom resolved stellar populations. this choice facilitates finding not onlycurrently bursting galaxies but also "fossil" bursts increasing the sample sizeof starburst galaxies in the nearby (d&lt;8 mpc) universe. thirteen of theeighteen galaxies are experiencing ongoing bursts and five galaxies show fossilbursts. from our reconstructed sfhs, it is evident that the elevated sfrs of aburst are sustained for hundreds of myr with variations on small timescales. along &gt;100 myr temporal baseline is thus fundamental to any starburst definitionor identification method. the longer lived bursts rule out rapid"self-quenching" of starbursts on global scales. the bursting galaxies' gasconsumption timescales are shorter than the hubble time for all but one galaxyconfirming the short-lived nature of starbursts based on fuel limitations.additionally, we find the strength of the h{\alpha} emission usually correlateswith the cmd based sfr during the last 4-10 myr. however, in four cases, theh{\alpha} emission is significantly less than what is expected for models ofstarbursts; the discrepancy is due to the sfr changing on timescales of a fewmyr. the inherently short timescale of the h{\alpha} emission limitsidentifying galaxies as starbursts based on the current characteristics whichmay or may not be representative of the recent sfh of a galaxy.

1009.2940	the nature of starbursts : ii. the duration of starbursts in dwarf  galaxies	the starburst phenomenon can shape the evolution of the host galaxy and thesurrounding intergalactic medium. the extent of the evolutionary impact ispartly determined by the duration of the starburst, which has a directcorrelation with both the amount of stellar feedback and the development ofgalactic winds, particularly for smaller mass dwarf systems. we measure theduration of starbursts in twenty nearby, ongoing, and "fossil" starbursts indwarf galaxies based on the recent star formation histories derived fromresolved stellar population data obtained with the hubble space telescope.contrary to the shorter times of 3-10 myr often cited, the starburst durationswe measure range from 450 - 650 myr in fifteen of the dwarf galaxies and up to1.3 gyr in four galaxies; these longer durations are comparable to or longerthan the dynamical timescales for each system. the same feedback from massivestars that may quench the flickering sf does not disrupt the overall burstevent in our sample of galaxies. while five galaxies present fossil bursts,fifteen galaxies show ongoing bursts and thus the final durations may be longerthan we report here for these systems. one galaxy shows a burst that has beenongoing for only 20 myr; we are likely seeing the beginning of a burst event inthis system. using the duration of the starbursts, we calculate that the burstsdeposited 10^(53.9)-10^(57.2) ergs of energy into the interstellar mediumthrough stellar winds and supernovae and produced 3%-26% of the host galaxy'smass.

1104.0981	a deep chandra view of the ngc 404 central engine	we present the results of a 100 ks {\it chandra} observation of the ngc 404nuclear region. the long exposure and excellent spatial resolution of {\itchandra} has enabled us to critically examine the nuclear environment of ngc404, which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially anintermediate-mass black hole (on the order of a few times $10^5$ \msun). wefind two distinct x-ray sources: a hard, central point source coincident withthe optical and radio centers of the galaxy, and a soft extended region that iscoincident with areas of high h$\alpha$ emission and likely recent starformation. when we fit the 0.3-8 kev spectra of each region separately, we findthe hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law (\pl = 1.88),while the soft off-nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ($kt$ =0.67 kev). we therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hotgas in the nuclear region of ngc 404. we estimate the 2-10 kev luminosity to be1.3$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. a low-level of diffuse x-rayemission is detected out to $\sim$15\as ($\sim$0.2 kpc) from the nucleus. wecompare our results to the observed relationships between power law photonindex and eddington ratio for both x-ray binaries and low luminosity activegalaxies and find ngc 404 to be consistent with other low luminosity activegalaxies. we therefore favor the conclusion that ngc 404 harbors anintermediate-mass black hole accreting at a very low level.

1105.4117	the formation of kiloparsec-scale hi holes in dwarf galaxies	the origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (h i) distributions ofsome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. starformation histories (sfhs) derived from resolved stars give us the uniqueopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape thecurrently visible h i distribution. our sample of five nearby dwarf irregulargalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total h i mass and absoluteb-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. weuse very large array h i line data to estimate the energy required to createthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. we compare this energy estimate tothe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed fromsfhs derived from data taken with the hubble space telescope. the inferredintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds ourenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expectedefficiencies. therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficientenergy to produce the observed holes. however, we find no obvious signature ofsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures whencomparing the global sfhs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or tothose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. we also fail tofind evidence of a central star cluster in fuv or halpha imaging. we concludethat large h i holes are likely formed from multiple generations of starformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

1105.4556	re-examining high abundance sdss mass-metallicity outliers: high n/o,  evolved wolf-rayet galaxies?	we present new mmt spectroscopic observations of four dwarf galaxiesrepresentative of a larger sample observed by the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and identified by peeples et al. (2008) as low-mass, high oxygenabundance outliers from the mass-metallicity relation. peeples et al. (2008)showed that these four objects (with metallicity estimates of 8.5 =&lt; 12 +log(o/h) =&lt; 8.8) have oxygen abundance offsets of 0.4-0.6 dex from the m_bluminosity-metallicity relation. our new observations extend the wavelengthcoverage to include the [oii] 3726,3729 doublet, which adds leverage in oxygenabundance estimates and allows measurements of n/o ratios. all four spectra arelow excitation, with relatively high n/o ratios (n/o &gt;~ 0.10), each of whichtend to bias estimates based on strong emission lines toward high oxygenabundances. these spectra all fall in a regime where the "standard" strong linemethods for metallicity determinations are not well calibrated eitherempirically or by photoionization modeling. by comparing our spectra directlyto photoionization models, we estimate oxygen abundances in the range of 7.9 =&lt;12 + log(o/h) =&lt; 8.4, consistent with the scatter of the mass-metallicityrelation. we discuss the physical nature of these galaxies that leads to theirunusual spectra (and previous classification as outliers), finding their lowexcitation, elevated n/o, and strong balmer absorption are consistent with theproperties expected from galaxies evolving past the "wolf-rayet galaxy" phase.we compare our results to the "main" sample of peeples et al. (2008) andconclude that they are outliers primarily due to enrichment of nitrogenrelative to oxygen, and not due to unusually high oxygen abundances for theirmasses or luminosities.

1108.1405	observational constraints on red and blue helium burning sequences	we derive the optical luminosity, colors, and ratios of the blue and redhelium burning (heb) stellar populations from archival hubble space telescopeobservations of nineteen starburst dwarf galaxies and compare them withtheoretical isochrones from padova stellar evolution models acrossmetallicities from z=0.001 to 0.009. we find that the observational data andthe theoretical isochrones for both blue and red heb populations overlap inoptical luminosities and colors and the observed and predicted blue to red hebratios agree for stars older than 50 myr over the time bins studied. thesefindings confirm the usefulness of applying isochrones to interpretobservations of heb populations. however, there are significant differences,especially for the red heb population. specifically we find: (1) offsets incolor between the observations and theoretical isochrones of order 0.15 mag(0.5 mag) for the blue (red) heb populations brighter than m_v ~ -4 mag, whichcannot be solely due to differential extinction; (2) blue heb stars fainterthan m_v ~ -3 mag are bluer than predicted; (3) the slope of the red hebsequence is shallower than predicted by a factor of ~3; and (4) the modelsoverpredict the ratio of the most luminous blue to red heb stars correspondingto ages &lt;50 myr. additionally, we find that for the more metal-rich galaxies inour sample (z&gt; 0.5 zsolar) the red heb stars overlap with the red giant branchstars in the color magnitude diagrams, thus reducing their usefulness asindicators of star formation for ages &gt;100 myr.

1109.2905	modeling the effects of star formation histories on halpha and  ultra-violet fluxes in nearby dwarf galaxies	we consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (sfhs) onhalpha and galex far ultra-violet (fuv) star formation rate (sfr) indicators.under the assumption of a fully populated chabrier imf, we compare thedistribution of halpha-to-fuv flux ratios from ~ 1500 simple, periodic modelsfhs with observations of 185 galaxies from the spitzer local volume legacysurvey. we find a set of sfh models that are well matched to the data, suchthat more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant sfhs,while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increasein the sfr by a factor of 30 over the sfr during the inter-burst period), burstdurations of tens of myr, and periods of ~ 250 myr; these sfhs are broadlyconsistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systemswith lower sfrs. we analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellarmass, r-band surface brightness, halpha-derived sfr, and blue luminosity, andfind that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. wefind that our model sfhs are generally able to reproduce both the observedsystematic decline and increased scatter in halpha-to-fuv ratios toward lowmass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. we also compare ourpredictions with those from the integrated galactic imf theory with a constantsfr. we find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observedratios, only the time variable sfh models are capable of producing the observedpopulation of low mass galaxies ($m_{*}$ &lt; 10$^{7}$ msun) with normalhalpha-to-fuv ratios. these results demonstrate that a variable imf alone hasdifficulty explaining the observed scatter in the halpha-to-fuv ratios. weconclude by considering the limitations of the model sfhs, and discuss the useof additional empirical constraints to improve future sfh modeling efforts.

1112.3713	an mcmc determination of the primordial helium abundance	spectroscopic observations of the chemical abundances in metal-poor h iiregions provide an independent method for estimating the primordial heliumabundance. h ii regions are described by several physical parameters such aselectron density, electron temperature, and reddening, in addition to y, theratio of helium to hydrogen. it had been customary to estimate or determineself-consistently these parameters to calculate y. frequentist analyses of theparameter space have been shown to be successful in these determinations, andmarkov chain monte carlo (mcmc) techniques have proven to be very efficient insampling this parameter space. nevertheless, accurate determination of theprimordial helium abundance from observations of h ii regions is constrained byboth systematic and statistical uncertainties. in an attempt to better reducethe latter, and better characterize the former, we apply mcmc methods to thelarge dataset recently compiled by izotov, thuan, &amp; stasinska (2007). toimprove the reliability of the determination, a high quality dataset is needed.in pursuit of this, a variety of cuts are explored. the efficacy of the he i4026 emission line as a constraint on the solutions is first examined,revealing the introduction of systematic bias through its absence. as a clearmeasure of the quality of the physical solution, a \chi^2 analysis provesinstrumental in the selection of data compatible with the theoretical model. inaddition, the method also allows us to exclude systems for which parameterestimations are statistical outliers. as a result, the final selected datasetgains in reliability and exhibits improved consistency. regression to zerometallicity yields y_p = 0.2534 \pm 0.0083, in broad agreement with the wmapresult. the inclusion of more observations shows promise for further reducingthe uncertainty, but more high quality spectra are required.

1205.2732	observational constraints on the molecular gas content in nearby  starburst dwarf galaxies	using star formation histories derived from optically resolved stellarpopulations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with thehubble space telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of starsnewly formed in the bursts. by assuming a star formation efficiency (sfe), wethen calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of thestarbursts. assuming a sfe of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forminggalaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very highhi surface densities (~10^2-10^3 msun pc^-2), which are much higher than havebeen observed in dwarf galaxies. this implies either higher values of sfe inthese dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of h_2 indwarfs (or both). raising the assumed sfes to 10% or greater (in line withobservations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies),still results in hi surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies.thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of thegas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onsetof the bursts. our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range10^19-10^21 cm^-2 for the sample. in those galaxies where co observations havebeen made, these densities correspond to values of the co-h_2 conversion factor(x_co) in the range &gt;3-80x10^20 cm^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1, or up to 40x greater thangalactic x_co values.

1205.6782	direct oxygen abundances for low luminosity lvl galaxies	we present mmt spectroscopic observations of hii regions in 42 low luminositygalaxies in the lvl. for 31 galaxies, we measured the temperature sensitive [oiii] line at a strength of 4 sigma or greater, and thus determine direct oxygenabundances. our results provide the first direct estimates of oxygen abundancefor 19 galaxies. oxygen abundances were compared to b-band and 4.5 micronluminosities and stellar masses in order to characterize theluminosity-metallicity (l-z) and mass-metallicity (m-z) relationships atlow-luminosity.  we present and analyze a "combined select" sample composed of 38 objects(drawn from our parent sample and the literature) with direct oxygen abundancesand reliable distance determinations (trgb or ceph). consistent with previousstudies, the b-band and 4.5 micron l-z relationships were found to be12+log(o/h)=(6.27+/-0.21)+(-0.11+/-0.01)m_b and12+log(o/h)=(6.10+/-0.21)+(-0.10+/-0.01)m_[4.5] (sigma=0.15 and 0.14). for thissample, we derive a m-z relationship of12+log(o/h)=(5.61+/-0.24)+(0.29+/-0.03)log(m*), which agrees with previousstudies; however, the dispersion (sigma=0.15) is not significantly lower thanthat of the l-z relationships. because of the low dispersions in theserelationships, if an accurate distance is available, the luminosity of alow-luminosity galaxy is often a better indicator of metallicity than thatderived using certain strong-line methods, so significant departures from thel-z relationships may indicate that caution is prudent in such cases. we alsorevisit the 70/160 micron color metallicity relationship.  additionally, we examine n/o abundance trends with respect to oxygenabundance and b-v color. we find a positive correlation between n/o ratio andb-v color for 0.05\lesssimb-v\lesssim0.75:log(n/o)=(1.18+/-0.9)x(b-v)+(-1.92+/-0.08), with a dispersion of sigma=0.14,that is in agreement with previous studies.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

1209.5395	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iii. measuring ages and  masses of partially resolved stellar clusters	the apparent age and mass of a stellar cluster can be strongly affected bystochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, when inferred fromthe integrated color of low mass clusters (less than ~10^4 solar masses). weuse simulated star clusters to show that these effects are minimized when thebrightest, rapidly evolving stars in a cluster can be resolved, and the lightof the fainter, more numerous unresolved stars can be analyzed separately. whencomparing the light from the less luminous cluster members to models ofunresolved light, more accurate age estimates can be obtained than whenanalyzing the integrated light from the entire cluster under the assumptionthat the initial mass function is fully populated. we show the success of thistechnique first using simulated clusters, and then with a stellar cluster inm31. this method represents one way of accounting for the discrete, stochasticsampling of the stellar initial mass function in less massive clusters and canbe leveraged in studies of clusters throughout the local group and other nearbygalaxies.

1305.0272	alfalfa discovery of the nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy leo p. i. hi  observations	the discovery of a previously unknown 21cm hi line source identified as anultra-compact high velocity cloud in the alfalfa survey is reported. the hidetection is barely resolved by the arecibo 305m telescope ~4' beam and has anarrow hi linewidth (hpfw of 24 km/s). further hi observations at arecibo andwith the vla corroborate the alfalfa hi detection, provide an estimate of thehi radius, ~1' at the 5 x 10^19 cm^-2 isophote, and show the cloud to exhibitrotation with an amplitude of ~9.0 +/- 1.5 km/s. in other papers, rhode et al.(2013) show the hi source to have a resolved stellar counterpart and ongoingstar forming activity, while skillman et al. (2013) reveal it as havingextremely low metallicity: 12 + log(o/h) = 7.16 +/- 0.04. the hi mass tostellar mass ratio of the object is found to be 2.6. we use the tully-fishertemplate relation in its baryonic form (mcgaugh 2012) to obtain a distanceestimate d = 1.3 (+0.9,-0.5) mpc. additional constraints on the distance arealso provided by the optical data of rhode et al. (2013) and mcquinn et al.(private communication), both indicating a distance in the range of 1.5 to 2.0mpc. the three estimates are compatible within their errors. the object appearsto be located beyond the dynamical boundaries of, but still in close proximityto the local group. its pristine properties are consistent with the sedateenvironment of its location. at a nominal distance of 1.75 mpc, it would havean hi mass of ~1.0 x 10^6 msun, a stellar mass of ~3.6 x 10^5 msun, and adynamical mass within the hi radius of ~1.5 x 10^7 msun. this discoverysupports the idea that optically faint - or altogether dark - low mass halosmay be detectable through their non-stellar baryons.

1305.0277	alfalfa discovery of the nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy leo~p. iii. an  extremely metal deficient galaxy	we present kpno 4-m and lbt/mods spectroscopic observations of an hii regionin the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy leo p discovered recently in the areciboalfalfa survey. in both observations, we are able to accurately measure thetemperature sensitive [o iii] 4363 angstrom line and determine a "direct"oxygen abundance of 12 + log(o/h) = 7.17 +/- 0.04. thus, leo p is an extremelymetal deficient (xmd) galaxy, and, indeed, one of the most metal deficientstar-forming galaxies ever observed. for its estimated luminosity, leo p isconsistent with the relationship between luminosity and oxygen abundance seenin nearby dwarf galaxies. leo p shows normal alpha element abundance ratios(ne/o, s/o, and ar/o) when compared to other xmd galaxies, but elevated n/o,consistent with the "delayed release" hypothesis for n/o abundances. we derivea helium mass fraction of 0.2509 +0.0184 -0.0123 which compares well with thewmap + bbn prediction of 0.2483 +/- 0.0002 for the primordial helium abundance.we suggest that surveys of very low mass galaxies compete well with emissionline galaxy surveys for finding xmd galaxies. it is possible that xmd galaxiesmay be divided into two classes: the relatively rare xmd emission line galaxieswhich are associated with starbursts triggered by infall of low-metallicity gasand the more common, relatively quiescent xmd galaxies like leo p, with verylow chemical abundances due to their intrinsically small masses.

1305.7243	measuring galaxy star formation rates from integrated photometry:  insights from color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stars	we use empirical star formation histories (sfhs), measured from hst-basedresolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesiscodes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (seds) of ~50 nearbydwarf galaxies (6.5 &lt; log m/m_* &lt; 8.5, with metallicities ~10% solar). in thepresence of realistic sfhs, we compare the modeled and observed seds from theultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared (nir) and assess the reliability ofwidely used uv-based star formation rate (sfr) indicators. in the fuv through ibands, we find that the observed and modeled seds are in excellent agreement.in the spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled sedssystematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, dependingon treatment of the tp-agb stars in the synthesis models. we assess thereliability of uv luminosity as a sfr indicator, in light of independentlyconstrained sfhs. we find that fluctuations in the sfhs alone can cause factorof ~2 variations in the uv luminosities relative to the assumption of aconstant sfh over the past 100 myr. these variations are not stronglycorrelated with uv-optical colors, implying that correcting uv-based sfrs forthe effects of realistic sfhs is difficult using only the broadband sed.additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars olderthan 100 myr can contribute from &lt;5% to100% of the present day uv luminosity,highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formationtimescale associated with uv emission. we do find a relationship between uvemission timescale and broadband uv-optical color, though it is different thanpredictions based on exponentially declining sfh models. our findings havesignificant implications for the comparison of uv-based sfrs acrosslow-metallicity populations with diverse sfhs.

1306.2321	drivers of hi turbulence in dwarf galaxies	neutral hydrogen (hi) velocity dispersions are believed to be set byturbulence in the interstellar medium (ism). although turbulence is widelybelieved to be driven by star formation (sf), recent studies have shown thatthis driving mechanism may not be dominant in regions of low sf rate surfacedensity (sfrsd), such as found in dwarf galaxies or the outer regions ofspirals. we have generated average hi line profiles in a number of nearbydwarfs and low-mass spirals by co-adding hi spectra in regions with either acommon radius or sfrsd. we find that the spatially-resolved superprofiles arecomposed of a central narrow peak (5-15 km/s) with higher velocity wings toeither side. with the assumption that the central peak reflects the turbulentvelocity dispersion, we compare hi kinematics to local ism properties,including surface mass densities and measures of sf. the hi velocity dispersionis correlated most strongly with surface mass density, which points at agravitational origin for turbulence, but it is unclear which instabilities canoperate efficiently in these systems. sf energy is produced at a levelsufficient to drive hi turbulent motions where sfrsd &gt; 10^-4 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.at low sf intensities, sf does not supply enough energy for turbulence, nordoes it uniquely determine the velocity dispersion. nevertheless, sf appears toprovide a lower threshold for hi velocity dispersions. we find that couplingefficiency decreases with increasing sfrsd, consistent with a picture where sfcouples to the ism with constant efficiency, but that less of that energy isfound in hi at higher sfrsd. we examine a number of potential drivers of hiturbulence, including sf, gravitational instabilities, the magnetorotationalinstability, and accretion, and find that no single mechanism can drive theobserved levels of turbulence at low sfrsd. we discuss possible solutions tothis conundrum.

1309.0047	the primordial helium abundance from updated emissivities	observations of metal-poor extragalactic h ii regions allow the determinationof the primordial helium abundance, y_p. the he i emissivities are thefoundation of the model of the h ii region's emission. porter, ferland, storey,&amp; detisch (2012) have recently published updated he i emissivities based onimproved photoionization cross-sections. we incorporate these new atomic dataand update our recent markov chain monte carlo analysis of the datasetpublished by izotov, thuan, &amp; stasinska (2007). as before, cuts are made topromote quality and reliability, and only solutions which fit the data within95% confidence level are used to determine the primordial he abundance. thepreviously qualifying dataset is almost entirely retained and with strongconcordance between the physical parameters. overall, an upward bias from thenew emissivities leads to a decrease in y_p. in addition, we find a generaltrend to larger uncertainties in individual objects (due to changes in theemissivities) and an increased variance (due to additional objects included).from a regression to zero metallicity, we determine y_p = 0.2465 +/- 0.0097, ingood agreement with the planck result of y_p = 0.2485 +/- 0.0002. in thefuture, a better understanding of why a large fraction of spectra are not wellfit by the model will be crucial to achieving an increase in the precision ofthe primordial helium abundance determination.

1309.0584	new radial abundance gradients for ngc 628 and ngc 2403	motived by recent ism studies, we present high quality mmt and geminispectroscopic observations of h ii regions in the nearby spiral galaxies ngc628 and ngc 2403 in order to measure their chemical abundance gradients. usinglong-slit and multi-object mask optical spectroscopy, we obtained measurementsof the temperature sensitive auroral lines [o iii] {\lambda}4363 and/or [n ii]{\lambda}5755 at a strength of 4{\sigma} or greater in 11 h ii regions in ngc628 and 7 regions in ngc 2403. these observations allow us, for the first time,to derive an oxygen abundance gradient in ngc 628 based solely on "direct"oxygen abundances of h ii regions: 12 + log(o/h) = (8.43+/-0.03) +(-0.017+/-0.002) x rg (dex/kpc), with a dispersion in log(o/h) of {\sigma} =0.10 dex, from 14 regions with a radial coverage of ~2-19 kpc. this is asignificantly shallower slope than found by previous "strong-line" abundancestudies. in ngc 2403, we derive an oxygen abundance gradient of 12 + log(o/h) =(8.48+/-0.04) + (-0.032+/-0.007) x rg (dex/kpc), with a dispersion in log(o/h)of {\sigma} = 0.07 dex, from 7 h ii with a radial coverage of ~1-10 kpc.  additionally, we measure the n, s, ne, and ar abundances. we find the n/oratio decreases with increasing radius for the inner disk, but reaches aplateau past r25 in ngc 628. ngc 2403 also has a negative n/o gradient withradius, but we do not sample the outer disk of the galaxy past r25 and so donot see evidence for a plateau. this bi-modal pattern measured for ngc 628indicates dominant contributions from secondary nitrogen inside of the r25transition and dominantly primary nitrogen farther out. as expected for{\alpha}-process elements, s/o, ne/o, and ar/o are consistent with constantvalues over a range in oxygen abundance.

1309.6130	the acs lcid project. ix. imprints of the early universe in the radial  variation of the star formation history of dwarf galaxies	based on hubble space telescope observations from the local cosmology fromisolated dwarfs project, we present the star formation histories, as a functionof galactocentric radius, of four isolated local group dwarf galaxies: two dsphgalaxies, cetus and tucana, and two transition galaxies (dtrs), lgs-3 andphoenix. the oldest stellar populations of the dsphs and dtrs are, within theuncertainties, coeval ($\sim 13 gyr$) at all galactocentric radii. we find thatthere are no significative differences between the four galaxies in thefundamental properties (such as the normalized star formation rate orage-metallicity relation) of their outer regions (radii greater than fourexponential scale lengths); at large radii, these galaxies consist exclusivelyof old ($\geq 10.5 gyr$) metal-poor stars. the duration of star formation inthe inner regions vary from galaxy to galaxy, and the extended central starformation in the dtrs produces the dichotomy between dsph and dtr galaxy types.the dtr galaxies show prominent radial stellar population gradients: thecenters of these galaxies host young ($\leq 1 gyr$) populations while the ageof the last formation event increases smoothly with increasing radius. thiscontrasts with the two dsph galaxies. tucana shows a similar, but milder,gradient, but no gradient in age is detected cetus. for the three galaxies withsignificant stellar population gradients, the exponential scale lengthdecreases with time. these results are in agreement with outside-in scenariosof dwarf galaxy evolution, in which a quenching of the star formation towardthe center occurs as the galaxy runs out of gas in the outskirts.

1310.0044	alfalfa discovery of the nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy leo p. iv.  distance measurement from lbt optical imaging	leo p is a low-luminosity dwarf galaxy discovered through the blind hiarecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. the hi and follow-up opticalobservations have shown that leo p is a gas-rich dwarf galaxy with both activestar formation and an underlying older population, as well as an extremely lowoxygen abundance. here, we measure the distance to leo p by applying the tip ofthe red giant branch (trgb) distance method to photometry of the resolvedstellar population from new large binocular telescope (lbt) v and i bandimaging. we measure a distance modulus of 26.19 (+0.17/-0.50) mag correspondingto a distance of 1.72 (+0.14/-0.40) mpc. although our photometry reaches 3magnitudes below the trgb, the sparseness of the red giant branch (rgb) yieldshigher uncertainties on the lower limit of the distance. leo p is outside thelocal group with a distance and velocity consistent with the local hubble flow.while located in a very low-density environment, leo p lies within ~0.5 mpc ofa loose association of dwarf galaxies which include ngc 3109, antlia, sextansa, and sextans b, and 1.1 mpc away from its next nearest neighbor, leo a. leo pis one of the lowest metallicity star-forming galaxies known in the nearbyuniverse, comparable in metallicity to i zw 18 and ddo 68, but with stellarcharacteristics similar to dwarf spheriodals (dsphs) in the local volume suchas carina, sextans, and leo ii. given its physical properties and isolation,leo p may provide an evolutionary link between gas-rich dwarf irregulargalaxies and dsphs that have fallen into a local group environment and beenstripped of their gas.

1310.4179	a new approach to detailed structural decomposition from the splash and  phat surveys: kicked-up disk stars in the andromeda galaxy?	we characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the andromedagalaxy (m31) over the radial range 4 &lt; r_proj &lt; 225 kpc. the cospatial natureof these subcomponents renders them difficult to disentangle using surfacebrightness (sb) information alone, especially interior to ~20 kpc. our newdecomposition technique combines information from the luminosity function (lf)of over 1.5 million bright (20 &lt; m_814w &lt; 22) stars from the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 redgiant branch stars in the same magnitude range from the spectroscopic andphotometric landscape of andromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey, andintegrated i-band sb profiles from various sources. we use an affine-invariantmarkov chain monte carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to thesethree data sets. the bulge, disk, and halo sb profiles are modeled as a sersic,exponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the lfs are modeled asbroken power-laws. we present probability distributions for each of 32parameters describing the sb profiles and lfs of the three subcomponents. wefind that the number of stars with a disk-like lf is ~5% larger than the thenumber with disk-like (dynamically cold) kinematics, suggesting that some starsborn in the disk have been dynamically heated to the point that they arekinematically indistinguishable from halo members. this is the firstkinematical evidence for a "kicked-up disk" halo population in m31. thefraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations.we also find evidence for a radially varying disk lf, consistent with anegative metallicity gradient in the stellar disk.

1402.3723	distance determinations to shield galaxies from hst imaging	the survey of hi in extremely low-mass dwarf galaxies (shield) is an on-goingmulti-wavelength program to characterize the gas, star formation, and evolutionin gas-rich, very low-mass galaxies. the galaxies were selected from the first~10% of the hi alfalfa survey based on their inferred low hi mass and lowbaryonic mass, and all systems have recent star formation. thus, the shieldsample probes the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function for star-forminggalaxies. here, we measure the distances to the 12 shield galaxies to bebetween 5-12 mpc by applying the tip of the red giant method to the resolvedstellar populations imaged by the hubble space telescope. based on thesedistances, the hi masses in the sample range from $4\times10^6$ to$6\times10^7$ m$_{\odot}$, with a median hi mass of $1\times10^7$ m$_{\odot}$.the trgb distances are up to 73% farther than flow-model estimates in thealfalfa catalog. because of the relatively large uncertainties of flow modeldistances, we are biased towards selecting galaxies from the alfalfa catalogwhere the flow model underestimates the true distances. the measured distancesallow for an assessment of the native environments around the sample members.five of the galaxies are part of the ngc 672 and ngc 784 groups, which togetherconstitute a single structure. one galaxy is part of a larger linear ensembleof 9 systems that stretches 1.6 mpc from end to end. two galaxies reside inregions with 1-4 neighbors, and four galaxies are truly isolated with no knownsystem identified within a radius of 1 mpc.

1402.7264	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury v: ages and masses of the  year 1 stellar clusters	we present ages and masses for 601 star clusters in m31 from the analysis ofthe six filter integrated light measurements from near ultraviolet to nearinfrared wavelengths, made as part of the panchromatic hubble andromedatreasury (phat). we derive the ages and masses using a probabilistic technique,which accounts for the effects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initialmass function. tests on synthetic data show that this method, in conjunctionwith the exquisite sensitivity of the phat observations and their broadwavelength baseline, provides robust age and mass recovery for clusters rangingfrom $\sim 10^2 - 2 \times 10^6 m_\odot$. we find that the cluster agedistribution is consistent with being uniform over the past $100$ myr, whichsuggests a weak effect of cluster disruption within m31. the age distributionof older ($&gt;100$ myr) clusters fall towards old ages, consistent with apower-law decline of index $-1$, likely from a combination of fading anddisruption of the clusters. we find that the mass distribution of the wholesample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of$-1.9 \pm 0.1$ over the range of $10^3-3 \times 10^5 m_\odot$. however, if wesubdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we find that the agedistributions remain unchanged. however, the mass spectral index variessignificantly, showing best fit values between $-2.2$ and $-1.8$, with theshallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. we explore therobustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the clustermass function may vary with respect to environment.

1404.3540	discovery of a gas-rich companion to the extremely metal-poor galaxy ddo  68	we present hi spectral-line imaging of the extremely metal-poor galaxy ddo68. this system has a nebular oxygen abundance of only 3% z$_{\odot}$, makingit one of the most metal-deficient galaxies known in the local volume.surprisingly, ddo 68 is a relatively massive and luminous galaxy for its metalcontent, making it a significant outlier in the mass-metallicity andluminosity-metallicity relationships. the origin of such a low oxygen abundancein ddo 68 presents a challenge for models of the chemical evolution ofgalaxies. one possible solution to this problem is the infall of pristineneutral gas, potentially initiated during a gravitational interaction. usingarchival hi spectral-line imaging obtained with the karl g. jansky very largearray, we have discovered a previously unknown companion of ddo 68. thislow-mass (m$_{\rm hi}$ $=$ 2.8$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$), recentlystar-forming (sfr$_{\rm fuv}$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{-3}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,sfr$_{\rm h\alpha}$ $&lt;$ 7$\times$10$^{-5}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) companion hasthe same systemic velocity as ddo 68 (v$_{\rm sys}$ $=$ 506 km s$^{-1}$; d $=$12.74$\pm$0.27 mpc) and is located at a projected distance of 42 kpc. new himaps obtained with the 100m robert c. byrd green bank telescope provideevidence that ddo 68 and this companion are gravitationally interacting at thepresent time. low surface brightness hi gas forms a bridge between theseobjects.

1409.1630	delayed star formation in isolated dwarf galaxies: hst star formation  history of the aquarius dwarf irregular	we have obtained deep images of the highly isolated (d = 1 mpc) aquariusdwarf irregular galaxy (ddo 210) with the hubble space telescope (hst) advancedcamera for surveys (acs). the resulting color-magnitude diagram (cmd) reachesmore than a magnitude below the oldest main-sequence turnoff, allowing us toderive the star formation history (sfh) over the entire lifetime of the galaxywith a timing precision of ~10% of the lookback time. using a maximumlikelihood fit to the cmd we find that only ~10% of all star formation inaquarius took place more than 10 gyr ago (lookback time equivalent to redshiftz ~2). the star formation rate increased dramatically ~6-8 gyr ago (z ~0.7-1.1) and then declined until the present time. the only known galaxy with amore extreme confirmed delay in star formation is leo a, a galaxy of similarm(hi)/m(stellar), dynamical mass, mean metallicity, and degree of isolation.the delayed stellar mass growth in these galaxies does not track the mean darkmatter accretion rate from cdm simulations. the similarities between leo a andaquarius suggest that if gas is not removed from dwarf galaxies by interactionsor feedback, it can linger for several gigayears without cooling in sufficientquantity to form stars efficiently. we discuss possible causes for the delay instar formation including suppression by reionization and late-time mergers. wefind reasonable agreement between our measured sfhs and select cosmologicalsimulations of isolated dwarfs. because star formation and merger processes areboth stochastic in nature, delayed star formation in various degees ispredicted to be a characteristic (but not a universal) feature of isolatedsmall galaxies.

1501.02270	chaos i: direct chemical abundances for hii regions in ngc 628	the chemical abundances of spirals (chaos) project leverages the combinedpower of the large binocular telescope (lbt) with the broad spectral range andsensitivity of the multi object double spectrograph (mods) to measure "direct"abundances in large samples of hii regions in spiral galaxies. we present lbtmods observations of 62 hii regions in the nearby ngc628. we measure one ormore auroral lines ([oiii] 4363, [nii] 5755, [siii] 6312, or [oii] 7320,7330)in a large number of hii regions (40). comparing derived temperatures frommultiple auroral line measurements, we find: a strong correlation betweentemperatures based on [siii] and [nii]; and large discrepancies for sometemperatures based on [oii] and [oiii]. these trends are consistent with otherobservations in the literature, yet, given the widespread use and acceptance of[oiii] as a temperature determinant, the magnitude of the t[oiii] discrepanciesstill came as a surprise. based on these results, we conduct a uniformabundance analysis using the temperatures derived from [siii] and [nii], andreport the gas-phase abundance gradients for ngc628. relative abundances ofs/o, ne/o, and ar/o are constant across the galaxy, consistent with nosystematic change in the upper imf over the sampled range in metallicity. thesealpha-element ratios, along with n/o, all show small dispersions consistentwith no intrinsic dispersion (0.05) over 70% of the azimuthally averagedradius. we interpret these results as an indication that, at a given radius,the interstellar medium in ngc628 is chemically well-mixed. unlike the nearlytemperature-independent gradients, o/h abundances have a larger intrinsicdispersion of ~0.13 dex. we posit that this dispersion represents an upperlimit to the true dispersion in o/h at a given radius and that some of thatdispersion is due to systematic uncertainties arising from temperaturemeasurements.

[oiii] 4363 is only detected in two hii regions both of which show indications ofexcitation by shocks. we compare our data to previous direct abundancesmeasured in ngc5194 and find excellent agreement for all but one region(delta[log(o/h)] ~ 0.04). we find no evidence of trends in ar/o, ne/o, or s/owithin ngc5194 or compared to other galaxies. we find modest negative gradientsin both o/h and n/o with very little scatter (sigma &lt; 0.08 dex), most of whichcan be attributed to random error and not to intrinsic dispersion. thegas-phase abundance gradient is consistent with the gradients observed in otherinteracting galaxies, which tend to be shallower than gradients measured inisolated galaxies. the n/o ratio (&lt;log(n/o)&gt; = -0.62) suggests secondarynitrogen production is responsible for a significantly larger fraction ofnitrogen (e.g., factor of 8-10) relative to primary production mechanisms thanpredicted by theoretical models.

1501.07313	characterizing the star formation of the low-mass shield galaxies from  hubble space telescope imaging	the survey of hi in extremely low-mass dwarfs (shield) is an on-goingmulti-wavelength program to characterize the gas, star formation, and evolutionin gas-rich, very low-mass galaxies that populate the faint end of the galaxyluminosity function. the galaxies were selected from the first ~10% of the hialfalfa survey based on their low hi mass and low baryonic mass. here, wemeasure the star-formation properties from optically resolved stellarpopulations for 12 galaxies using a color-magnitude diagram fitting technique.we derive lifetime average star-formation rates (sfrs), recent sfrs, stellarmasses, and gas fractions. overall, the recent sfrs are comparable to thelifetime sfrs with mean birthrate parameter of 1.4, with a surprisingly narrowstandard deviation of 0.7. two galaxies are classified as dwarf transitiongalaxies (dtrans). these dtrans systems have star-formation and gas propertiesconsistent with the rest of the sample, in agreement with previous results thatsome dtrans galaxies may simply be low-luminosity dirrs. we do not find acorrelation between the recent star-formation activity and the distance to thenearest neighboring galaxy, suggesting that the star-formation process is notdriven by gravitational interactions, but regulated internally. further, wefind a broadening in the star-formation and gas properties (i.e., specificsfrs, stellar masses, and gas fractions) compared to the generally tightcorrelation found in more massive galaxies. overall, the star-formation and gasproperties indicate these very low-mass galaxies host a fluctuating,non-deterministic, and inefficient star-formation process.

1502.03820	a clear age-velocity dispersion correlation in andromeda's stellar disk	the stellar kinematics of galactic disks are key to constraining diskformation and evolution processes. in this paper, for the first time, wemeasure the stellar age-velocity dispersion correlation in the inner 20 kpc(3.5 disk scale lengths) of m31 and show that it is dramatically different fromthat in the milky way. we use optical hubble space telescope/advanced camerafor surveys photometry of 5800 individual stars from the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) survey and keck/deimos radial velocity measurementsof the same stars from the spectroscopic and photometric landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey. we show that the averageline-of-sight velocity dispersion is a steadily increasing function of stellarage exterior to r=10 kpc, increasing from 30 km/s for the young upper mainsequence stars to 90 km/s for the old red giant branch stars. this monotonicincrease implies that a continuous or recurring process contributed to theevolution of the disk. both the slope and normalization of the dispersion vs.age relation are significantly larger than in the milky way, allowing for thepossibility that the disk of m31 has had a more violent history than the diskof the milky way, more in line with cosmological predictions. we also findevidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of stars from a second kinematicalcomponent in addition to the dominant disk component. one of the largest andhottest high-dispersion patches is present in all age bins, and may be thesignature of the end of the long bar.

1502.06621	the high-mass stellar initial mass function in m31 clusters	we have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellarinitial mass function (imf) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) of 85 resolved, young (4 myr &lt; t &lt; 25 myr), intermediate mass starclusters (10^3-10^4 msun), observed as part of the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) program. we fit each cluster's cmd to measure itsmass function (mf) slope for stars &gt;2 msun. for the ensemble of clusters, thedistribution of stellar mf slopes is best described by$\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. the dataalso imply no significant dependencies of the mf slope on cluster age, mass,and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured mfrepresents the imf. this analysis implies that the high-mass imf slope in m31clusters is universal with a slope ($\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that issteeper than the canonical kroupa (+1.30) and salpeter (+1.35) values. usingour inference model on select milky way (mw) and lmc high-mass imf studies fromthe literature, we find $\gamma_{\rm mw} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\gamma_{\rm lmc}\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. thus, while thehigh-mass imf in the local group may be universal, systematics in literatureimf studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations ofthe high-mass imf in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of thehigh-mass imf slope to date. we have grafted the m31 high-mass imf slope ontowidely used sub-solar mass kroupa and chabrier imfs and show that commonly useduv- and halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses &gt;8 msun are ~25% fewer thanexpected for a salpeter/kroupa imf.

1503.05195	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies iii.  characterizing quenching in low-mass galaxies	we explore the quenching of low-mass galaxies (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^8 msun) as afunction of lookback time using the star formation histories (sfhs) of 38 localgroup dwarf galaxies. the sfhs were derived from analyzing color-magnitudediagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival hubble spacetelescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. we find: (1) lower massgalaxies quench earlier than higher mass galaxies; (2) inside of virial radiusthere is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massivehost and its quenching epoch; (3) there are hints of systematic differences inquenching times of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites, although the samplesample size and uncertainties in the sfhs of m31 dwarfs prohibit definitiveconclusions. combined with literature results, we qualitatively consider theredshift evolution (z=0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ~7 dex instellar mass (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^11.5 msun). the quenched fraction of allgalaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest andhighest mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at allredshifts. in contrast, galaxies between mstar ~ 10^8-10^10 msun have thelowest quenched fractions. we suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies arethe least efficient at quenching. finally, we compare our quenching times withpredictions for infall times of low-mass galaxies associated with the mw. wefind that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., cvn ii, leo iv) may havebeen quenched before infall while higher mass satellites (e.g., leo i, fornax)typically quench ~1-4 gyr after infall.

1503.08146	the effects of he i 10830 on helium abundance determinations	observations of helium and hydrogen emission lines from metal-poorextragalactic h ii regions provide an independent method for determining theprimordial helium abundance, y_p. traditionally, the emission lines employedare in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines islimited. furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties inhelium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physicalparameters, such as temperature and density. recently, izotov, thuan, &amp; guseva(2014) have pioneered adding the he 10830 infrared emission line in heliumabundance determinations. the strong electron density dependence of he 10830makes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking thedegeneracy with temperature. we revisit our analysis of the dataset publishedby izotov, thuan, &amp; stasinska (2007) and incorporate the newly availableobservations of he 10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoreticalpaschen-gamma ratio. the solutions are better constrained, in particular forelectron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving themodel fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening forquality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut.furthermore, the addition of he 10830 decreases the uncertainty on the heliumabundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from10-80%. overall, we find a reduction in the uncertainty on y_p by over 50%.from a regression to zero metallicity, we determine y_p = 0.2449 +/- 0.0040,consistent with the bbn result, y_p = 0.2470 +/- 0.0002, based on the planckdetermination of the baryon density. the dramatic improvement in theuncertainty from incorporating he 10830 strongly supports the case forsimultaneous (thus not requiring scaling) observations of visible and infraredhelium emission line spectra.

1504.03338	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xi: the spatially-resolved  recent star formation history of m31	we measure the recent star formation history (sfh) across m31 using opticalimages taken with the \texit{hubble space telescope} as part of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat). we fit the color-magnitudediagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the nequadrant of m31. we show that the sfhs vary significantly on these smallspatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in thesfh back to ~500 myr, most notably in m31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. we findthat the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 myr old, showing ongoing star formationover the past ~500 myr. this indicates the presence of molecular gas in thering over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. we also find that thering's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at thelevel of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due todiffusion of stars into the disk. based on existing models of m31's ringfeatures, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purelycollisional ring origin highly unlikely. we find that the global sfr has beenfairly constant over the last ~500 myr, though it does show a small increase at50 myr that is 1.3 times the average sfr over the past 100 myr. during the last~500 myr, ~60% of all sf occurs in the 10-kpc ring. finally, we find that inthe past 100 myr, the average sfr over the phat survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total sfr of ~0.7m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of m31's disk. thissfr is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates.

1505.00791	calibrating uv star formation rates for dwarf galaxies from starbirds	integrating our knowledge of star formation traced by observations atdifferent wavelengths is essential for correctly interpreting and comparingstar formation activity in a variety of systems and environments. this studycompares extinction corrected integrated ultraviolet (uv) emission fromresolved galaxies with color-magnitude diagram (cmd) based star formation rates(sfrs) derived from resolved stellar populations and cmd fitting techniques in19 nearby starburst and post-starburst dwarf galaxies. the datasets are fromthe panchromatic starburst irregular dwarf survey (starbirds) and include deeplegacy galex uv imaging, hst optical imaging, and spitzer mips imaging. for themajority of the sample, the integrated near uv fluxes predicted from thecmd-based sfrs - using four different models - agree with the measured,extinction corrected, integrated near uv fluxes from galex images, but the faruv predicted fluxes do not. further, we find a systematic deviation between thesfrs based on integrated far uv luminosities and existing scaling relations,and the sfrs based on the resolved stellar populations. this offset is notdriven by different star formation timescales, variations in sfrs, uvattenuation, nor stochastic effects. this first comparison between cmd-basedsfrs and an integrated fuv emission sfr indicator suggests that the most likelycause of the discrepancy is the theoretical fuv-sfr calibration from stellarevolutionary libraries and/or stellar atmospheric models. we present anempirical calibration of the fuv-based sfr relation for dwarf galaxies, withuncertainties, which is ~53% larger than previous relations.

0805.1058	delving deeper into the tumultuous lives of galactic dwarfs: modeling  star formation histories	the paucity of observed dwarf galaxies in the local group relative to theabundance of predicted dark matter halos remains one of the greatest puzzles ofthe lcdm paradigm. solving this puzzle now requires not only matching thenumbers of objects but also understanding the details of their star formationhistories. we present a summary of such histories derived from the hst datausing the color-magnitude diagram fitting method. to reduce observationaluncertainties, we condense the data into five cumulative parameters -- thefractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1, 2, 5, and 10 gyr, and the meanstellar age. we interpret the new data with a phenomenological model based onthe mass assembly histories of dark matter halos and the schmidt law of starformation. the model correctly predicts the radial distribution of the dwarfsand the fractions of stars formed in the last 5 and 10 gyr. however, in orderto be consistent with the observations, the model requires a significant amountof recent star formation in the last 2 gyr. within the framework of our model,this prolonged star formation can be achieved by adding a stochastic variationin the density threshold of the star formation law. the model results are notsensitive to late gas accretion, the slope of the schmidt law, or the detailsof cosmic reionization. a few discrepancies still remain: our model typicallypredicts too large stellar masses, only a modest population of ultra-faintdwarfs, and a small number of dwarfs with anomalously young stellarpopulations. nevertheless, the observed star formation histories of local groupdwarfs are generally consistent the expected star formation in cold dark matterhalos.

(2014). the discrepancy we identify is consistent with similarfindings in the milky way by the planck collaboration (2015), but has a morecomplex dependence on parameters from the draine &amp; li (2007) dust models. wealso show that the discrepancy with the draine et al.

astro-ph;0211172	ism abundances in sculptor group dwarf irregular galaxies	using the ctio 4-m telescope, we have obtained optical spectra of hii regionsin five sculptor group dwarf irregular galaxies. we derive oxygen, nitrogen,and sulfur abundances from the hii region spectra. oxygen abundances arederived via three different methods (the ``direct'' method, the empiricalmethod guided by photoionization modeling of mcgaugh (1991), and the purelyempirical method of pilyugin (2000)) and are compared. significant systematicdifferences are found between the three methods, and we suggest that arecalibration of the empirical abundance scale is required. the n/o ratio forthe metal-poor di eso 473-g24 of log (n/o) = -1.43 +/- 0.03 lies well above theplateau of log (n/o) = -1.60 +/- 0.02 found by izotov &amp; thuan (1999) for acollection of metal-poor blue compact galaxies. this shows that not allgalaxies with 12 + log (o/h) &lt; 7.6 have identical elemental abundance ratios,and this implies that the izotov &amp; thuan scenario for low metallicity galaxiesis not universal. measurements of the hii regions in ngc 625 yield log (n/o) =-1.25. assuming n production by intermediate mass stars, this relatively highn/o ratio may be indicative of a long quiescent period prior to the recentactive burst of star formation. the oxygen abundances in the sculptor group disare in good agreement with the relationship between metallicity and luminosityobserved in the local group dis. the sculptor group dis, in general, lie closerto the simple closed box model evolutionary path than the local group dis. thehigher gas contents, lower average star formation rates, and closer resemblanceto closed box evolution could all be indicative of evolution in a relativelylow density environment.

astro-ph;0211486	deep hst imaging of sextans a. ii. cepheids and distance	we have identified 82 short-period variable stars in sextans a from deepwfpc2 observations. all of the periodic variables appear to be short-periodcepheids, with periods as small as 0.8 days for fundamental-mode cepheids and0.5 days for first-overtone cepheids. these objects have been used, along withmeasurements of the rgb tip and red clump, to measure a true distance modulusto sextans a of (m-m)_0 = 25.61 +/- 0.07, corresponding to a distance of d =1.32 +/- 0.04 mpc. comparing distances calculated by these techniques, we findthat short-period cepheids (p &lt; 2 days) are accurate distance indicators forobjects at or below the metallicity of the smc. as these objects are quitenumerous in low-metallicity star-forming galaxies, they have the potential forproviding extremely precise distances throughout the local group. we have alsocompared the relative distances produced by other distance indicators. weconclude that calibrations of rr lyraes, the rgb tip, and the red clump areself-consistent, but that there appears to be a small dependence of long-periodcepheid distances on metallicity. finally, we present relative distances ofsextans a, leo a, ic 1613, and the magellanic clouds.

astro-ph;0306457	deep hubble space telescope imaging of ic 1613 ii. the star formation  history	we present deep hst wfpc2 imaging of the local group dwarf irregular galaxyic 1613. the photometry is the deepest to date for an isolated dwarf irregulargalaxy. the resulting color-magnitude diagram (cmd) is analyzed using threedifferent methods to derive a star formation history (sfh). all three find anenhanced star formation rate (sfr), from 3 to 6 gyr ago, and similarage-metallicity relationships (amr). a comparison of the newly observed outerfield with an earlier studied central field of ic 1613 shows that the sfr inthe outer field has been significantly depressed during the last gyr. thisimplies that the optical scale length of the galaxy has been decreasing withtime and that comparison of galaxies at intermediate redshift with present daygalaxies should take this effect into account. we find strong similaritiesbetween ic 1613 and the more distant milky way dsph companions in that all aredominated by star formation at intermediate ages. in particular, the sfh andamr for ic 1613 and leo i are indistinguishable. this implies that dirrgalaxies cannot be distinguished from dsphs by their intermediate age stellarpopulations. this type of a sfh may also be evidence for slower or suppressedearly star formation in dwarf galaxies due to photoionization after thereionization of the universe by background radiation. assuming that ic 1613 istypical of a dirr evolving in isolation, since most of the star formationoccurs at intermediate ages, these dwarf systems cannot be responsible for thefast chemical enrichment of the igm which is seen at high redshift. there is noevidence for any large amplitude bursts of star formation in ic 1613, and wefind it highly unlikely that analogs of ic 1613 have contributed to the excessof faint blue galaxies in existing galaxy redshift surveys.

astro-ph;0309542	the recent evolution of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 625 from hubble  space telescope imaging	new hst/wfpc2 imaging of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 625 is presented.these data, 80% complete to v and i magnitudes of 26.0 and 25.3, respectively,allow us to study the recent star formation history of ngc 625. we derive a tipof the red giant branch (trgb) distance modulus of 27.95+/-0.07, correspondingto a distance of 3.89+/-0.22 mpc, and a location on the far side of thesculptor group. ngc 625 has a well-defined radial stellar population gradient,evidenced by a central concentration of young ms stars and an rgb/agb ratiothat increases with galactocentric distance. the prominent agb is very red, andrgb stars are detected far from the central star forming regions. using h alphaand h beta narrow band imaging and previous optical spectroscopy we identifysubstantial and varying internal extinction (a_v = 0.0 to 0.6 mag) associatedwith the central active star formation regions. to better understand theeffects of internal extinction on the analysis of young stellar populations,synthetic models are presented which, for the first time, examine and accountfor this effect. using the luminous blue helium burning stars, we construct asimple model of the recent (&lt; 100 myr) star formation in which an elevated butdeclining star formation rate has been present over this entire period. this isat odds with the presence of spectroscopic w-r features in the major starformation region which imply a short duration (&lt;= 5 myr) for the recentstarburst. this suggests that starbursts displaying w-r features are notnecessarily all of a short duration. finally, we speculate on the possiblecauses of the present burst of star formation in this apparently isolatedgalaxy, and compare it to other nearby, well-studied dwarf starburst systems.

astro-ph;0405002	the nature of radio continuum emission in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc  625	we present new multi-frequency radio continuum imaging of the dwarf starburstgalaxy ngc 625 obtained with the very large array. data at 20, 6, and 3.6 cmreveal global continuum emission dominated by free-free emission, with onlymild synchrotron components. each of the major hii regions is detected; theindividual spectral indices are thermal for the youngest regions (showingstrongest h alpha emission) and nonthermal for the oldest. we do not detect anysources that appear to be associated with deeply embedded, dense, youngclusters, though we have discovered one low-luminosity, obscured source thathas no luminous optical counterpart and which resides in the region of highestoptical extinction. since ngc 625 is a wolf-rayet galaxy with strong recentstar formation, these radio properties suggest that the youngest star formationcomplexes have not yet evolved to the point where their thermal spectra aresignificantly contaminated by synchrotron emission. the nonthermal componentsare associated with regions of older star formation that have smaller ionizedgas components. these results imply a range of ages of the hii regions andradio components that agrees with our previous resolved stellar populationanalysis, where an extended burst of star formation has pervaded the disk ofngc 625 over the last ~ 50 myr. we compare the nature of radio continuumemission in selected nearby dwarf starburst and wolf-rayet galaxies,demonstrating that thermal radio continuum emission appears to be more commonin these systems than in typical hii galaxies with less recent star formationand more evolved stellar clusters.

astro-ph;0405588	a realistic determination of the error on the primordial helium  abundance: steps toward non-parametric nebular helium abundances	currently there are two significantly different observational determinationsof the primordial helium abundance, and, if only statistical errors in he4abundance determinations are considered, the discrepancies between theobservational determinations and the value favored by the wmap results aresignificant. here we examine in detail some likely sources of systematicuncertainties which may resolve the differences between the two determinations.we conclude that the observational determination of the primordial heliumabundance is completely limited by systematic errors and that these systematicerrors have not been fully accounted for in any published observationaldetermination of the primordial helium abundance. in principle, the observedmetal-poor hii region spectra should be analyzed in a non-parametric way, suchthat the hii region physical conditions and the helium abundance are derivedsolely from the relative flux ratios of the helium and hydrogen emission lines.in practice, there are very few hii region spectra with the quality that allowthis, so that most analyses depend on assumed ranges or relationships betweenphysical parameters, resulting in parametric solutions with underestimatederror bars. a representative result of our analysis yields y_p = 0.249 \pm0.009. however, given that most of the spectra analyzed to date do notsignificantly constrain the primordial helium abundance, we argue in favor arange of allowed values of 0.232 le y_p le 0.258.

astro-ph;0502059	the nature of radio continuum emission at very low metallicity: very  large array observations of i zw 18	we present the first resolved study of the radio continuum properties of i zw18, the dwarf galaxy with the lowest known nebular metal abundance in the localuniverse. new very large array radio continuum images at 20 and 3.6 cm arecompared to various hubble space telescope images, and we find a strikingmorphological similarity between high-resolution h alpha and short wavelengthradio continuum emission, especially in the h alpha shell in the northwestregion. we separate thermal and nonthermal components of the emission, and finda large synchrotron halo surrounding the galaxy. comparison between h alpha andx-band fluxes suggests that the emission at 3.6 cm is dominated by thermalprocesses; an additional synchrotron component dominates the flux at 20 cm andproduces a modest fraction of the detected flux at 3.6 cm. the fluxes of threeof the four major emission peaks show a mix of thermal and nonthermalprocesses, while one shows a nearly flat spectral index. the strong synchrotroncomponent argues for active star formation throughout the disk for at least thelast ~ 30 myr. these sensitive observations provide a new, detailed view of thenature of radio continuum emission in the very low metallicity interstellarmedium. comparing with the literature, the role of metallicity in the evolutionof radio continuum emission seems to be secondary to other factors such as therecent star formation history and the presence or absence of outflows from starformation regions.

astro-ph;0612766	the aptly named phoenix dwarf galaxy	the local group galaxy phoenix has the properties of a dwarf spheroidalgalaxy, but an adjacent hi cloud has been found to be at the same radialvelocity as the stars. the proximity suggests that this cloud is associatedwith the most recent ($\le 100$ myr) star formation in phoenix. we haveobtained relatively high sensitivity and high resolution hi imaging with thevla with the goal of distinguishing between different processes for displacingthe gas from the galaxy. due to the outer curvature of the hi cloud, it appearsthat expulsion from the galaxy by winds from supernovae is more likely thanram-pressure stripping. the isolation of the galaxy makes tidal strippinghighly unlikely. using a star formation history constructed from hst imaging,we construct a simple kinematic model which implies that the hi cloud is stillgravitationally bound to the galaxy. gas which is expelled from the centers ofdwarf galaxies but which remains gravitationally bound may explain the episodicstar formation observed in several dwarfs. in the specific case of phoenix,there may be future star formation in this currently dsph-like galaxy.

astro-ph;9709280	testing cno enrichment scenarios in metal-poor galaxies with hst  spectroscopy	using hubble space telescope ultraviolet and ground-based opticalspectroscopy, we measure the c/o and n/o ratios of three metal-poor galaxieswith similar metallicity but differing n/o. the c/o ratios estimated from ciii] lambda1909 and [o iii] lambda5007 lines are consistent with those measuredfrom c ii] lambda2326 and [o ii] lambda3727 lines. we develop the use of thec^+/o^+ ratio as a reasonable substitute diagnostic of the carbon abundance inhii regions. the proximity of the c ii] lambda2326 multiplet to the [o ii]lambda3726,3729 lines makes these transitions a potential tool for measuringthe carbon abundance in high-redshift objects. derived chemical properties areconsistent with a significant correlation between n and c abundances inmetal-poor extragalactic hii regions. this result is unexpected if thedispersion in n/o among galaxies of similar metallicity is caused by localized,temporary chemical enrichments from massive stars. the presence of acorrelation suggests that the majority of n and c production is coupled, asexpected from chemical evolution models where c is produced predominantly bylow mass stars and n is produced predominantly by intermediate mass stars.since the occurance of localized chemical "pollution" in star-forming galaxiesappears to be low, the relative overabundance of n in some galaxies compared toothers at similar metallicity is most plausibly interpreted as an indicator ofthe global, secular chemical enrichment history. the n/o and perhaps the c/oratios can be used as a ``clock'' to estimate the time since the last majorepisode of star formation.

astro-ph;9808210	co emission in low luminosity, hi rich galaxies	we present 12co 1-0 observations of eleven low luminosity m_b &gt; -18),hi--rich dwarf galaxies. only the three most metal-rich galaxies, with12+log(o/h) ~ 8.2, are detected. very deep co spectra of six extremelymetal-poor systems (12+log(o/h) &lt; 7.5) yield only low upper limits on the cosurface brightness, i_co &lt; 0.1 k km/s. three of these six have never beforebeen observed in a co line, while the others now have much more stringent upperlimits. for the very low metallicity galaxy leo a, we do not confirm apreviously reported detection in co, and the limits are consistent with anotherrecent nondetection. we combine these new observations with data from theliterature to form a sample of dwarf galaxies which all have co observationsand measured oxygen abundances. no known galaxies with 12+log(o/h) &lt; 7.9 (z &lt;0.1 solar) have been detected in co. most of the star-forming galaxies withhigher (12+log(o/h) &gt; 8.1) metallicities are detected at similar or higher i_cosurface brightnesses. the data are consistent with a strong dependence of thei_co/m_h_2 = x_co conversion factor on ambient metallicity. the strikingly lowupper limits on some metal-poor galaxies lead us to predict that the conversionfactor is non-linear, increasing sharply below approximately 1/10 of the solarmetallicity (12+log(o/h) &lt; 7.9).

0809.5059	the recent star formation histories of m81 group dwarf irregular  galaxies	we present observations and analysis of nine dwarf irregular galaxies (dis)in the m81 group taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope. the nine galaxy sample (the garland, m81 dwarf a, ddo 53, hoix, ho i, ddo 165, ngc 2366, ho ii, and ic 2574) spans 6 magnitudes inluminosity, a factor of 1000 in current star formation rate, and 0.5 dex inmetallicity. here we use color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stellarpopulations to study the star formation histories (sfhs) of these galaxies. wedivide the sample into faint and bright galaxies, with a dividing line ofm_${b}$ = -15, and then analyze the similarities and differences in the sfhs,birthrate parameters, fraction of stars formed per time interval, and spatialdistribution of stellar components. comparing these parameters as a function ofluminosity, we find only minor differences in sf characteristics. we extend ourcomparison to select dis in the local group (lg), and find only minordifferences in sf parameters. the fraction of stars formed per time intervalfor an average m81 group and lg di is consistent with a constant sfh. however,individual galaxies can show significant departures from a constant sfh. thus,we find this result underlines the importance of stochastic sf in dis. we alsocompare possible formation scenarios of the less luminous and candidate tidaldwarfs in the m81 group. the sfhs and the lack of an overdensity of associatedred stars suggest that the garland and ho ix are not dis and are potentiallytidal dwarf galaxies. interestingly, a noteworthy difference between the lg andthe m81 group is the lack of tidal dwarf candidates in the lg.

0812.2036	triggered star formation and the creation of the supergiant hi shell in  ic 2574	based on deep imaging from the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope, we present new evidence that stellar feedback created a ~ 1kpc supergiant hi shell (sgs) and triggered star formation (sf) around its rimin the m81 group dwarf irregular galaxy ic 2574. using photometry of theresolved stars from the hst images, we measure the star formation history of aregion including the sgs, focusing on the past 500 myr, and employ the uniqueproperties of blue helium burning stars to create a movie of sf in the sgs. wefind two significant episodes of sf inside the sgs from 200 - 300 myr and ~ 25myr ago. comparing the timing of the sf events to the dynamic age of the sgsand the energetics from the hi and sf, we find compelling evidence that stellarfeedback is responsible for creating the sgs and triggering secondary sf aroundits rim.
