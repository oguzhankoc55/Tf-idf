0902.1542	near-infrared transit photometry of the exoplanet hd 149026b	the transiting exoplanet hd 149026b is an important case for theories ofplanet formation and planetary structure, because the planet's relatively smallsize has been interpreted as evidence for a highly metal-enriched composition.we present observations of 4 transits with the near infrared camera andmulti-object spectrometer on the hubble space telescope, within a wavelengthrange of 1.1--2.0 $\mu$m. analysis of the light curve gives the most preciseestimate yet of the stellar mean density, $\rho_\star =0.497^{+0.042}_{-0.057}$ g cm$^{-3}$. by requiring agreement between theobserved stellar properties (including $\rho_\star$) and stellar evolutionarymodels, we refine the estimate of the stellar radius: $r_\star =1.541^{+0.046}_{-0.042}$ $r_\sun$. we also find a deeper transit than has beenmeasured at optical and mid-infrared wavelengths. taken together, thesefindings imply a planetary radius of $r_p = 0.813^{+0.027}_{-0.025}$ $r_{\rmjup}$, which is larger than earlier estimates. models of the planetary interiorstill require a metal-enriched composition, although the required degree ofmetal enrichment is reduced. it is also possible that the deeper nicmos transitis caused by wavelength-dependent absorption by constituents in the planet'satmosphere, although simple model atmospheres do not predict this effect to bestrong enough to account for the discrepancy. we use the 4 newly-measuredtransit times to compute a refined transit ephemeris.

0902.3461	on the spin-orbit misalignment of the xo-3 exoplanetary system	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 2009 feb. 2transit of the exoplanet xo-3b. the new data show that the planetary orbitalaxis and stellar rotation axis are misaligned, as reported earlier by hebrardand coworkers. we find the angle between the sky projections of the two axes tobe 37.3 +/- 3.7 deg, as compared to the previously reported value of 70 +/- 15deg. the significance of this discrepancy is unclear because there areindications of systematic effects. xo-3b is the first exoplanet known to have ahighly inclined orbit relative to the equatorial plane of its parent star, andas such it may fulfill the predictions of some scenarios for the migration ofmassive planets into close-in orbits. we revisit the statistical analysis ofspin-orbit alignment in hot-jupiter systems. assuming the stellar obliquitiesto be drawn from a single rayleigh distribution, we find the mode of thedistribution to be 13^{+5}_{-2} deg. however, it remains the case that a modelrepresenting two different migration channels--in which some planets are drawnfrom a perfectly-aligned distribution and the rest are drawn from an isotropicdistribution--is favored over a single rayleigh distribution.

0912.2132	studying the atmosphere of the exoplanet hat-p-7b via secondary eclipse  measurements with epoxi, spitzer and kepler	the highly irradiated transiting exoplanet, hat-p-7b, currently provides oneof the best opportunities for studying planetary emission in the optical andinfrared wavelengths. we observe six near-consecutive secondary eclipses ofhat-p-7b at optical wavelengths with the epoxi spacecraft. we place an upperlimit on the relative eclipse depth of 0.055% (95% confidence). we also analyzespitzer observations of the same target in the infrared, obtaining secondaryeclipse depths of 0.098+/-0.017%, 0.159+/-0.022%, 0.245+/-0.031% and0.225+/-0.052% in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron irac bands respectively. wecombine these measurements with the recently published kepler secondary eclipsemeasurement, and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planetthat are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements. the dataare best fit by models with a temperature inversion, as expected from the highincident flux. the models predict a low optical albedo of ~&lt; 0.13, withsubsolar abundances of na, k, tio and vo. we also find that the best fittingmodels predict that 10% of the absorbed stellar flux is redistributed to thenight side of the planet, which is qualitatively consistent with theinefficient day-night redistribution apparent in the kepler phase curve. modelswithout thermal inversions fit the data only at the 1.25 sigma level, and alsorequire an overabundance of methane, which is not expected in the very hotatmosphere of hat-p-7b. we also analyze the eight transits of hat-p-7b presentin the epoxi dataset and improve the constraints on the system parameters,finding a period of p = 2.2047308+/-0.0000025 days, a stellar radius of r* =1.824+/-0.089rsun, a planetary radius of rp = 1.342+/-0.068rjup and aninclination of i = 85.7+3.5-2.2 deg.

0912.3229	a super-earth transiting a nearby low-mass star	a decade ago, the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planetprovided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door tospectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. as suchcharacterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are bothnearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large,nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. doppler studies andmicrolensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of1.9-10 times the earth's mass (m_earth), called super-earths. the firstconstraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was affordedby corot-7b, but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studiesin the foreseeable future. here we report observations of the transiting planetgj 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55 m_earth and a radius 2.68 times earth'sradius (r_earth), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between earthand the ice giants of the solar system. we find that the planetary mass andradius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by ahydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. theatmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it hasundergone significant evolution during its history. as the star is small andonly 13 parsecs away, the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study withcurrent observatories.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1006.3727	the value of systems with multiple transiting planets	among other things, studies of the formation and evolution of planetarysystems currently draw on two important observational resources: the precisecharacterization available for planets that transit their parent stars and thefrequency and nature of systems with multiple planets. thus far, the study oftransiting exoplanets has focused almost exclusively on systems with only oneplanet, except for considering the influence of additional planets on thetransit light curve, mostly through transit timing variations (ttvs). this workconsiders systems where multiple planets are seen to transit the same star andconcludes that such "multi-transiting" systems will be the mostinformation-rich planetary systems besides our own solar system. five newcandidate multi-transiting systems from \emph{kepler} have been announced insteffen et al. 2010, though these candidates have not yet been fully confirmedas planets. in anticipation of the likely confirmation of multi-transitingsystems, we discuss the value of these systems in detail. for example, properinterpretation of transit timing variations is significantly improved inmulti-transiting systems. the true mutual inclination, a valuable probe ofplanetary formation, can also be well determined in certain systems, especiallythrough rossiter-mclaughlin measurements of each planet. in addition, suchsystems may undergo predictable and observable mutual events, where one planetcrosses over the other, which allow for unique constraints on various physicaland orbital parameters, particularly the mutual inclination.

1008.3803	the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of the transiting exoplanet xo-4b	we report photometric and radial velocity observations of the xo-4 transitingplanetary system, conducted with the flwo 1.2m telescope and the 8.2m subarutelescope. based on the new light curves, the refined transit ephemeris ofxo-4b is $p = 4.1250828 \pm 0.0000040$ days and $t_c [bjd_tdb] = 2454485.93323\pm 0.00039$. we measured the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of xo-4b and estimatedthe sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbitalaxis to be $\lambda = -46.7^{\circ} ^{+8.1^{\circ}}_{-6.1^{\circ}}$. thismeasurement of $\lambda$ is less robust than in some other cases because theimpact parameter of the transit is small, causing a strong degeneracy between$\lambda$ and the projected stellar rotational velocity. nevertheless, ourfinding of a spin-orbit misalignment suggests that the migration process forxo-4b involved few-body dynamics rather than interaction with a gaseous disk.in addition, our result conforms with the pattern reported by winn et al.(2010, apjl, 718, l145) that high obliquities are preferentially found forstars with effective temperatures hotter than 6250~k.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

(2009) provides a consistent butsignificantly refined measurement of the stellar mean density. we comparestellar isochrones to this density estimate and find m_s = 1.275 +/- 0.018m_sun and a stellar age of $3.37 +0.20/-0.47 gyr. using this estimate of m_sand incorporating the density constraint from asteroseismology, we model boththe photometry and published radial velocities to estimate the planet radiusr_p= 1.0870 +/- 0.0066 jupiter radii and the stellar radius r_s = 1.5007 +/-0.0076 r_sun. the planet radius is larger than that found in previous studiesand consistent with theoretical models of a solar-composition gas giant of thesame mass and equilibrium temperature. for the three transits, we determine thetimes of mid-transit to a precision of 6.2 s, 7.6 s, and 6.9 s, and the transittimes for hd 17156 do not show any significant departures from a constantperiod. the joint analysis of transit photometry and asteroseismology presagessimilar studies that will be enabled by the nasa kepler mission.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1103.4859	starspots and spin-orbit alignment in the wasp-4 exoplanetary system	we present photometry of 4 transits of the exoplanet wasp-4b, each with aprecision of approximately 500 ppm and a time sampling of 40-60s. we have usedthe data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides.during two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomalythat we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. we also findevidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry.the recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis isnearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the star spot would not haveremained on the transit chord. by analyzing the timings of the anomalies wefind the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be -1_{-12}^{+14} degrees. thisresult is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation ofthe rossiter-mclaughlin effect. it suggests that the planet migration mechanismpreserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution hasrealigned the system. future applications of this method using data from thecorot and kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for manyother exoplanets.

1104.5230	a super-earth transiting a naked-eye star	we have detected transits of the innermost planet "e" orbiting 55 cnc(v=6.0), based on two weeks of nearly continuous photometric monitoring withthe most space telescope. the transits occur with the period (0.74 d) and phasethat had been predicted by dawson &amp; fabrycky, and with the expected durationand depth for the crossing of a sun-like star by a hot super-earth. assumingthe star's mass and radius to be 0.963_{-0.029}^{+0.051} m_sun and 0.943 +/-0.010 r_sun, the planet's mass, radius, and mean density are 8.63 +/- 0.35mearth, 2.00 +/- 0.14 rearth, and 5.9_{-1.1}^{+1.5} g/cm^3. the mean density iscomparable to that of earth, despite the greater mass and consequently greatercompression of the interior of 55 cnc e. this suggests a rock-iron compositionsupplemented by a significant mass of water, gas, or other light elements.outside of transits, we detected a sinusoidal signal resembling the expectedsignal due to the changing illuminated phase of the planet, but with a fullrange (168 +/- 70 ppm) too large to be reflected light or thermal emission.this signal has no straightforward interpretation and should be checked withfurther observations. the host star of 55 cnc e is brighter than that of anyother known transiting planet, which will facilitate future investigations.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1107.2596	the first kepler mission planet confirmed with the hobby-eberly  telescope: kepler-15b, a hot jupiter enriched in heavy elements	we report the discovery of kepler-15b, a new transiting exoplanet detected bynasa's kepler mission. the transit signal with a period of 4.94 days wasdetected in the quarter 1 (q1) kepler photometry. for the first time, we haveused the high-resolution-spectrograph (hrs) at the hobby-eberly telescope (het)to determine the mass of a kepler planet via precise radial velocity (rv)measurements. the 24 het/hrs radial velocities (rv) and 6 additionalmeasurements from the fies spectrograph at the nordic optical telescope (not)reveal a doppler signal with the same period and phase as the transitephemeris. we used one het/hrs spectrum of kepler-15 taken without the iodinecell to determine accurate stellar parameters. the host star is a metal-rich([fe/h]=0.36+/-0.07) g-type main sequence star with t_eff=5515+/-124 k. theamplitude of the rv-orbit yields a mass of the planet of 0.66+/-0.1 m_jup. theplanet has a radius of 0.96+/-0.06 r_jup and a mean bulk density of 0.9+/-0.2g/cm^3. the planetary radius resides on the lower envelope for transitingplanets with similar mass and irradiation level. this suggests significantenrichment of the planet with heavy elements. we estimate a heavy element massof 30-40 m_earth within kepler-15b.

1109.1561	the kepler-19 system: a transiting 2.2 r_earth planet and a second  planet detected via transit timing variations	we present the discovery of the kepler-19 planetary system, which we firstidentified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the kepler photometry.from high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effectivetemperature teff=5541 \pm 60 k, a metallicity [fe/h]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and asurface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. we combine the estimate of teff and[fe/h] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometriclight curve to deduce a stellar mass of m_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 m_sun and astellar radius of r_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 r_sun. we rule out the possibilitythat the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by firstidentifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape ofthe light curve. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more than threeorders of magnitude more likely than a blend. the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure atransit depth with spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent withthe depth measured in the kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. we determinea physical radius of the planet kepler-19b of r_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 r_earth.from radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on theplanet mass of 20.3 m_earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 gcm^-3. we report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from apredicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additionalperturbing body in the system. we cannot uniquely determine the orbitalparameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match theamplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the hoststar's radial velocity limits. however, the perturber in these mechanisms hasperiod &lt;160 days and mass &lt;6 m_jup, confirming its planetary nature askepler-19c.

1110.0820	kepler 18-b, c, and d: a system of three planets confirmed by transit  timing variations, lightcurve validation, spitzer photometry and radial  velocity measurements	we report the detection of three transiting planets around a sunlike star,which we designate kepler-18. the transit signals were detected in photometricdata from the kepler satellite, and were confirmed to arise from planets usinga combination of large transit-timing variations, radial-velocity variations,warm-spitzer observations, and statistical analysis of false-positiveprobabilities. the kepler-18 star has a mass of 0.97m_sun, radius 1.1r_sun,effective temperature 5345k, and iron abundance [fe/h]= +0.19. the planets haveorbital periods of approximately 3.5, 7.6 and 14.9 days. the innermost planet"b" is a "super-earth" with mass 6.9 \pm 3.4m_earth, radius 2.00 \pm0.10r_earth, and mean density 4.9 \pm 2.4 g cm^-3. the two outer planets "c"and "d" are both low-density neptune-mass planets. kepler-18c has a mass of17.3 \pm 1.9m_earth, radius 5.49 \pm 0.26r_earth, and mean density 0.59 \pm0.07 g cm^-3, while kepler-18d has a mass of 16.4 \pm 1.4m_earth, radius 6.98\pm 0.33r_earth, and mean density 0.27 \pm 0.03 g cm^-3. kepler-18c andkepler-18d have orbital periods near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance, leading tolarge and readily detected transit timing variations.

1112.1640	kepler-22b: a 2.4 earth-radius planet in the habitable zone of a  sun-like star	a search of the time-series photometry from nasa's kepler spacecraft revealsa transiting planet candidate orbiting the 11th magnitude g5 dwarf kic 10593626with a period of 290 days. the characteristics of the host star are wellconstrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismicanalysis of the kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of0.970 +/- 0.060 msun and 0.979 +/- 0.020 rsun. the depth of 492 +/- 10ppm forthe three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 +/- 0.13 rearth for theplanet. the system passes a battery of tests for false positives, includingreconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. afull blender analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretationby showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarelymimic the observed shape of the transits. the final validation of the planet isprovided by 16 radial velocities obtained with hires on keck 1 over a one yearspan. although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and massdetermination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\sigma} upper limitof 124 mearth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning thedesignation kepler-22b. the radiative equilibrium temperature is 262k for aplanet in kepler-22b's orbit. although there is no evidence that kepler-22b isa rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius toorbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the sun.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.1892	transit timing observations from kepler: vi. transit timing variation  candidates in the first seventeen months from polynomial models	transit timing variations provide a powerful tool for confirming andcharacterizing transiting planets, as well as detecting non-transiting planets.we report the results an updated ttv analysis for 1481 planet candidates(borucki et al. 2011; batalha et al. 2012) based on transit times measuredduring the first sixteen months of kepler observations. we present 39 strongttv candidates based on long-term trends (2.8% of suitable data sets). wepresent another 136 weaker ttv candidates (9.8% of suitable data sets) based onexcess scatter of ttv measurements about a linear ephemeris. we anticipate thatseveral of these planet candidates could be confirmed and perhaps characterizedwith more detailed ttv analyses using publicly available kepler observations.for many others, kepler has observed a long-term ttv trend, but an extendedkepler mission will be required to characterize the system via ttvs. we findthat the occurrence rate of planet candidates that show ttvs is significantlyincreased (~68%) for planet candidates transiting stars with multipletransiting planet candidate when compared to planet candidates transiting starswith a single transiting planet candidate.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1206.1888	long-term stability of horseshoe orbits	unlike trojans, horseshoe coorbitals are not generally considered to belong-term stable (dermott and murray, 1981; murray and dermott, 1999). as thelifetime of earth's and venus's horseshoe coorbitals is expected to be about agyr, we investigated the possible contribution of late-escaping inner planetcoorbitals to the lunar late heavy bombardment. contrary to analyticalestimates, we do not find many horseshoe objects escaping after first 100 myr.in order to understand this behaviour, we ran a second set of simulationsfeaturing idealized planets on circular orbits with a range of masses. we findthat horseshoe coorbitals are generally long lived (and potentially stable) forsystems with primary-to-secondary mass ratios larger than about 1200. this isconsistent with results of laughlin and chambers (2002) for equal-mass pairs orcoorbital planets and the instability of jupiter's horseshoe companions (staceyand connors, 2008). horseshoe orbits at smaller mass ratios are unstablebecause they must approach within 5 hill radii of the secondary. in contrast,tadpole orbits are more robust and can remain stable even when approachingwithin 4 hill radii of the secondary.

1206.4695	rapid dynamical chaos in an exoplanetary system	we report on the long-term dynamical evolution of the two-planet kepler-36system, which we studied through numerical integrations of initial conditionsthat are consistent with observations of the system. the orbits are chaoticwith a lyapunov time of only ~10 years. the chaos is a consequence of aparticular set of orbital resonances, with the inner planet orbiting 34 timesfor every 29 orbits of the outer planet. the rapidity of the chaos is due tothe interaction of the 29:34 resonance with the nearby first order 6:7resonance, in contrast to the usual case in which secular terms in thehamiltonian play a dominant role. only one contiguous region of phase space,accounting for ~4.5% of the sample of initial conditions studied, correspondsto planetary orbits that do not show large scale orbital instabilities on thetimescale of our integrations (~200 million years). the long-lived subset ofthe allowed initial conditions are those that satisfy the hill stabilitycriterion by the largest margin. any successful theory for the formation ofthis system will need to account for why its current state is so close tounstable regions of phase space.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

1208.1268	improved spectroscopic parameters for transiting planet hosts	we report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effectivetemperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host starsof 56 transiting planets. our analysis is based primarily on the stellarparameter classification (spc) technique. we investigate systematic errors byexamining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been usedin previous studies (sme and moog). the spc and sme results, both based oncomparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strongcorrelations between temperature, [fe/h], and log g when solving for all threequantities simultaneously. in contrast the moog results, based on a moretraditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. to combat thecorrelations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, werepeat the spc analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellardensity that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves.previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have beensubject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and10%, respectively, which can be larger than other observational uncertainties,and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

1208.3712	the neptune-sized circumbinary planet kepler-38b	we discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planetkepler-38b. the stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, andconsists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (m_a = 0.949 +/- 0.059solar masses and r_a = 1.757 +/- 0.034 solar radii) paired with a low-mass star(m_b = 0.249 +/- 0.010 solar masses and r_b = 0.2724 +/- 0.0053 solar radii) ina mildly eccentric (e=0.103) orbit. a total of eight transits due to acircumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the keplerlight curve (using kepler quarters 1 through 11), from which a planetary periodof 105.595 +/- 0.053 days can be established. a photometric dynamical model fitto the radial velocity curve and kepler light curve yields a planetary radiusof 4.35 +/- 0.11 earth radii, or 1.12 +/- 0.03 neptune radii. since the planetis not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary fromkeplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of122 earth masses (7.11 neptune masses or 0.384 jupiter masses) at 95%confidence. this upper limit should decrease as more kepler data becomeavailable.

1209.6106	improved asteroid astrometry and photometry with trail fitting	asteroid detections in astronomical images may appear as trails due to acombination of their apparent rate of motion and exposure duration. nearbyasteroids in particular typically have high apparent rates of motion andacceleration. their recovery, especially on their discovery apparition, dependsupon obtaining good astrometry from the trailed detections. we present ananalytic function describing a trailed detection under the assumption of agaussian point spread function (psf) and constant rate of motion. we have fitthe function to both synthetic and real trailed asteroid detections from thepan-starrs1 survey telescope to obtain accurate astrometry and photometry. forshort trails our trailing function yields the same astrometric and photometryaccuracy as a functionally simpler 2-d gaussian but the latter underestimatesthe length of the trail - a parameter that can be important for measuring theobject's rate of motion and assessing its cometary activity. for trails longerthan about 10 pixels (&gt; 3xpsf) our trail fitting provides 3-times betterastrometric accuracy and up to 2 magnitudes improvement in the photometry. thetrail fitting algorithm can be implemented at the source detection level forall detections to provide trail length and position angle that can be used toreduce the false tracklet rate.

1305.3281	relative photometry of hat-p-1b occultations	we present hst stis observations of two occultations of the transitingexoplanet hat-p-1b. by measuring the planet to star flux ratio near opposition,we constrain the geometric albedo of the planet, which is strongly linked toits atmospheric temperature gradient. an advantage of hat-p-1 as a target isits binary companion ads 16402 a, which provides an excellent photometricreference, simplifying the usual steps in removing instrumental artifacts fromhst time-series photometry. we find that without this reference star, we wouldneed to detrend the lightcurve with the time of the exposures as well as thefirst three powers of hst orbital phase, and this would introduce a strong biasin the results for the albedo. however, with this reference star, we only needto detrend the data with the time of the exposures to achieve the sameper-point scatter, therefore we can avoid most of the bias associated withdetrending. our final result is a 2 sigma upper limit of 0.64 for the geometricalbedo of hat-p-1b between 577 and 947 nm.

1307.8119	first order resonance overlap and the stability of close two planet  systems	motivated by the population of multi-planet systems with orbital periodratios 1&lt;p2/p1&lt;2, we study the long-term stability of packed two planetsystems. the hamiltonian for two massive planets on nearly circular and nearlycoplanar orbits near a first order mean motion resonance can be reduced to aone degree of freedom problem (sessin &amp; ferraz mello (1984), wisdom (1986),henrard et al. (1986)). using this analytically tractable hamiltonian, we applythe resonance overlap criterion to predict the onset of large scale chaoticmotion in close two planet systems. the reduced hamiltonian has only a weakdependence on the planetary mass ratio, and hence the overlap criterion isindependent of the planetary mass ratio at lowest order. numerical integrationsconfirm that the planetary mass ratio has little effect on the structure of thechaotic phase space for close orbits in the low eccentricity (e &lt;~0.1) regime.we show numerically that orbits in the chaotic web produced primarily by firstorder resonance overlap eventually experience large scale erratic variation insemimajor axes and are lagrange unstable. this is also true of the orbits inthis overlap region which are hill stable. as a result, we can use the firstorder resonance overlap criterion as an effective stability criterion for pairsof observed planets. we show that for low mass (&lt;~10 m_earth) planetary systemswith initially circular orbits the period ratio at which complete overlapoccurs and widespread chaos results lies in a region of parameter space whichis hill stable. our work indicates that a resonance overlap criterion whichwould apply for initially eccentric orbits needs to take into account secondorder resonances. finally, we address the connection found in previous workbetween the hill stability criterion and numerically determined lagrangeinstability boundaries in the context of resonance overlap.

1308.4402	stability of satellites in closely packed planetary systems	we perform numerical integrations of four-body (star, planet, planet,satellite) systems to investigate the stability of satellites in planetarysystems with tightly-packed inner planets (stips). we find that the majority ofclosely-spaced stable two-planet systems can stably support satellites across arange of parameter-space which is only slightly decreased compared to that seenfor the single-planet case. in particular, circular prograde satellites remainstable out to $\sim 0.4 r_h$ (where $r_h$ is the hill radius) as opposed to$\sim 0.5 r_h$ in the single-planet case. a similarly small restriction in thestable parameter-space for retrograde satellites is observed, where planetaryclose approaches in the range 2.5 to 4.5 mutual hill radii destabilize mostsatellites orbits only if $a\sim 0.65 r_h$. in very close planetary pairs (e.g.the 12:11 resonance) the addition of a satellite frequently destabilizes theentire system, causing extreme close-approaches and the loss of satellites overa range of circumplanetary semi-major axes. the majority of systemsinvestigated stably harbored satellites over a wide parameter-space, suggestingthat stips can generally offer a dynamically stable home for satellites, albeitwith a slightly smaller stable parameter-space than the single-planet case. aswe demonstrate that multi-planet systems are not a priori poor candidates forhosting satellites, future measurements of satellite occurrence rates inmulti-planet systems versus single-planet systems could be used to constraineither satellite formation or past periods of strong dynamical interactionbetween planets.

1403.1895	ttvfast: an efficient and accurate code for transit timing inversion  problems	transit timing variations (ttvs) have proven to be a powerful technique forconfirming kepler planet candidates, for detecting non-transiting planets, andfor constraining the masses and orbital elements of multi-planet systems. thesettv applications often require the numerical integration of orbits forcomputation of transit times (as well as impact parameters and durations);frequently tens of millions to billions of simulations are required whenrunning statistical analyses of the planetary system properties. we havecreated a fast code for transit timing computation, ttvfast, which uses asymplectic integrator with a keplerian interpolator for the calculation oftransit times (nesvorny et al. 2013). the speed comes at the expense ofaccuracy in the calculated times, but the accuracy lost is largely unnecessary,as transit times do not need to be calculated to accuracies significantlysmaller than the measurement uncertainties on the times. the time step can betuned to give sufficient precision for any particular system. we find aspeed-up of at least an order of magnitude relative to dynamical integrationswith high precision using a bulirsch-stoer integrator.

1504.00051	dynamical evolution of multi-resonant systems: the case of gj876	the gj876 system was among the earliest multi-planetary detections outside ofthe solar system, and has long been known to harbor a resonant pair of giantplanets. subsequent characterization of the system revealed the presence of anadditional neptune mass object on an external orbit, locked in a three bodylaplace mean motion resonance with the previously known planets. while thissystem is currently the only known extrasolar example of a laplace resonance,it differs from the galilean satellites in that the orbital motion of theplanets is known to be chaotic. in this work, we present a simple perturbativemodel that illuminates the origins of stochasticity inherent to this system andderive analytic estimates of the lyapunov time as well as the chaotic diffusioncoefficient. we then address the formation of the multi-resonant structurewithin a protoplanetary disk and show that modest turbulent forcing in additionto dissipative effects is required to reproduce the observed chaoticconfiguration. accordingly, this work places important constraints on thetypical formation environments of planetary systems and informs the attributesof representative orbital architectures that arise from extended disk-drivenevolution.
