0901.0419	modeling and reproducibility of suzaku hxd pin/gso background	suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) achieved the lowest background level thanany other previously or currently operational missions sensitive in the energyrange of 10--600 kev, by utilizing pin photodiodes and gso scintillatorsmounted in the bgo active shields to reject particle background andcompton-scattered events as much as possible. because it does not have imagingcapability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity islimited by the reproducibility of the non x-ray background (nxb) model. wemodeled the hxd nxb, which varies with time as well as other satellites with alow-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitorcounts and satellite orbital/attitude information. the model background issupplied as an event file in which the background events are generated byrandom numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. thereproducibility of the nxb model depends on the event selection criteria (suchas cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigmasystematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (pin 15--40 kev) and 1% (gso50--100 kev) for more than 10 ksec exposure.

0901.4626	a galaxy merger scenario for the ngc 1550 galaxy from metal  distributions in the x-ray emitting plasma	the elliptical galaxy ngc 1550 at a redshift of $z=0.01239$, identified withan extended x-ray source rx j0419+0225, was observed with {\it xmm-newton} for31 ks. from the x-ray data and archival near infra-red data of two micron allsky survay, we derive the profiles of components constituting the ngc 1550system; the gas mass, total mass, metal mass, and galaxy luminosity. the metals(oxygen, silicon, and iron) are extended to $\sim 200$ kpc from the center,wherein $\sim$ 70% of the $k$-band luminosity is carried by ngc 1550 itself. asfirst revealed with {\it asca}, the data reconfirms the presence of a darkhalo, of which the mass ($1.6 \times 10^{13} m_{\odot}$) is typical of a galaxygroup rather than of a single galaxy. within 210 kpc, the $k$-bandmass-to-light ratio reaches $75 m_{\odot}/l_{\odot}$, which is comparable tothose of clusters of galaxies. the iron-mass-to-light ratio profile (silicon-and oxygen mass-to-light ratio profiles as well) exhibits about two orders ofmagnitude decrease toward the center. further studies comparing mass densitiesof metals with those of the other cluster components reveal that the iron (aswell as silicon) in the icm traces very well the total gravitating mass,whereas the stellar component is significantly more concentrated to withinseveral tens kpc of the ngc 1550 nucleus. thus, in the central region, theamount of metals is significantly depleted for the luminous galaxy light. amonga few possible explanations of this effect, the most likely scenario is thatgalaxies in this system were initially much more extended than today, andgradually fell to the center and merged into ngc 1550.

0902.3446	an antarctic ice core recording both supernovae and solar cycles	ice cores are known to be rich in information regarding past climates, andthe possibility that they record astronomical phenomena has also beendiscussed. rood et al. were the first to suggest, in 1979, that nitrate ion(no3-) concentration spikes observed in the depth profile of a south pole icecore might correlate with the known historical supernovae (sne), tycho (ad1572), kepler (ad 1604), and sn 1181 (ad 1181). their findings, however, werenot supported by subsequent examinations by different groups using differentice cores, and the results have remained controversial and confusing. here wepresent a precision analysis of an ice core drilled in 2001 at dome fujistation in antarctica. it revealed highly significant three no3- spikes datingfrom the 10th to the 11th century. two of them are coincident with sn 1006 (ad1006) and the crab nebula sn (ad 1054), within the uncertainty of our absolutedating based on known volcanic signals. moreover, by applying time-seriesanalyses to the measured no3- concentration variations, we discovered veryclear evidence of an 11-year periodicity that can be explained by solarmodulation. this is one of the first times that a distinct 11-year solar cyclehas been observed for a period before the landmark studies of sunspots bygalileo galilei with his telescope. these findings have significantconsequences for the dating of ice cores and galactic sn and solar activityhistories.

0707.2425	wide-band spectroscopy of the compton thick seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3 with  suzaku	we obtained a wide-band spectrum of the compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3with suzaku. the observed spectrum was clearly resolved into weak, softpower-law emission, a heavily absorbed power-law component, cold reflection,and many emission lines. the heavily absorbed component, absorbed by gas with acolumn density of 1.1x10^24 cm^-2, has an intrinsic 2--10 kev luminosity of~1.6x10^43 erg s^-1, and is considered to be direct emission from the mrk 3nucleus. the reflection component was interpreted as reflection of the directlight off cold, thick material; the reflection fraction $r$ was 1.36+/-0.20.the cold material is inferred to be located &gt; 1 pc from the central black holeof mrk 3 due to the low ionization parameter of iron (xi &lt; 1 erg cm s^-1) andthe narrow iron line width (s &lt; 22 ev). a compton shoulder to the iron line wasdetected, but the intensity of the shoulder component was less than thatexpected from spherically distributed compton-thick material. the weak, softpower-law emission is considered to be scattered light by ionized gas. theexistence of many highly-ionized lines from o, ne, mg, si, s, and fe in theobserved spectrum indicates that the ionized gas has a broad ionized structure,with xi=10--1000. the scattering fraction with respect to the direct light wasestimated to be 0.9+/-0.2%, which indicates that the column density of thescattering region is about 3.6x10^22 cm^-2. this high-quality spectrum obtainedby suzaku can be considered a template for studies of seyfert 2 galaxies.

0911.5205	suzaku constraints on the soft and hard excess emissions from abell 2199	the nearby ($z=0.03015$) cluster of galaxies abell~2199 was observed bysuzaku in x-rays, with five pointings for $\sim 20$ ks each. from the xis data,the temperature and metal abundance profiles were derived out to $\sim 700$ kpc(0.4 times virial radius). both these quantities decrease gradually from thecenter to peripheries by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the oxygen abundance tendsto be flat. the temperature within 12' ($\sim 430$ kpc) is $\sim 4$ kev, andthe 0.5--10 kev x-ray luminosity integrated up to 30' is $(2.9 \pm 0.1) \times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous xmm-newton measurements.above this thermal emission, no significant excess was found either in the xisrange below $\sim 1$ kev, or in the hxd-pin range above $\sim 15$ kev. the90%-confidence upper limit on the emission measure of an assumed 0.2 kev warmgas is (3.7--7.5) $\times 10^{62}$ cm$^{-3}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, which is 3.7--7.6times tighter than the detection reported with xmm-newton. the 90%-confidenceupper limit on the 20--80 kev luminosity of any power law component is $1.8\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, assuming a photon index of 2.0. although thisupper limit does not reject the possible 2.1$\sigma$ detection by the bepposaxpds, it is a factor of 2.1 tighter than that of the pds if both are consideredupper limits. the non-detection of the hard excess can be reconciled with theupper limit on diffuse radio emission, without invoking the very low magneticfields ($&lt; 0.073 \mu$g) which were suggested previously.

1001.2989	suzaku and optical spectroscopic observations of ss 433 in the 2006  april multiwavelength campaign	we report results of the 2006 april multi-wavelengths campaign of ss 433,focusing on x-ray data observed with suzaku at two orbital phases (in- andout-of- eclipse) and simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations. byanalyzing the fe25 k_alpha lines originating from the jets, we detect rapidvariability of the doppler shifts, dz/dt ~ 0.019/0.33 day^-1, which is largerthan those expected from the precession and/or nodding motion. this phenomenonprobably corresponding to "jitter" motions observed for the first time inx-rays, for which significant variability both in the jet angle and intrinsicspeed is required. from the time lag of optical doppler curves from those ofx-rays, we estimate the distance of the optical jets from the base to be ~(3-4)\times 10^14 cm. based on the radiatively cooling jet model, we determine theinnermost temperature of the jets to be t_0 = 13 +/- 2 kev and 16 +/- 3 kev(the average of the blue and red jets) for the out-of-eclipse and in-eclipsephase, respectively, from the line intensity ratio of fe25 k_alpha and fe26k_alpha. while the broad band continuum spectra over the 5--40 kev band ineclipse is consistent with a multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission expectedfrom the jets, and its reflection component from cold matter, theout-of-eclipse spectrum is harder than the jet emission with the basetemperature determined above, implying the presence of an additional hardcomponent.

0707.3867	low/hard state spectra of gro j1655-40 observed with suzaku	the galactic black-hole binary gro j1655$-$40 was observed with suzaku on2005 september 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) and 20 ks with the hard x-ray detector (hxd). the source wasdetected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 kev, with anintensity of $\sim$50 mcrab at 20 kev. at a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300kev luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of theeddington luminosity for a 6 $m_{\odot}$ black hole). the source was in atypical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photonindex of $\sim 1.6$. during the observation, the source intensity graduallydecreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ kev, and by 35% below 2 kev. this,together with the soft x-ray spectra taken with the xis, suggests the presenceof an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from acool ($\sim 0.2$ kev) disk. the hard x-ray spectra obtained with the hxd reveala high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ kev.since the spectral photon index above 10 kev is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than thatobserved in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher thanthose of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 kev spectrum cannot bereproduced by a single thermal comptonization model, even consideringreflection effects. instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can besuccessfully explained by invoking two thermal-comptonization components withdifferent $y$-parameters. in contrast to the high/soft state spectra of thisobject in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalentwidths of 60--100 ev, the present xis spectra bear no such features beyond anupper-limit equivalent width of 25 ev.

0708.0057	effects of compton scattering on the gamma ray spectra of solar flares	using fully relativistic geant4 simulation tool kit, the transport ofenergetic electrons generated in solar flares was monte-carlo simulated, andresultant bremsstrahlung gamma-ray spectra were calculated. the solaratmosphere was approximated by 10 vertically-stacked zones. the simulation tookinto account two important physical processes,that the bremsstrahlung photonsemitted by precipitating relativistic electrons are strongly forward beamedtoward the photosphere, and that the majority of these gamma-rays must becompton back-scattered by the solar atmosphere in order to reach the observer.then, the compton degradation was found to make the observable gamma-rayspectra much softer than is predicted by simple analytic calculations. thegamma-ray signals were found to be enhanced by several conditions, including abroad pitch-angle distribution of the electrons, a near-limb flare longitude,and a significant tilt in the magnetic field lines if the flare longitude israther small. these results successfully explain several important flareproperties observed in the hard x-ray to gamma-ray range, including inparticular those obtained with yohkoh. a comparison of the yohkoh spectrum froma goes x3.7 class limb flare on 1998 november 22, with a simulation assuming abroad electron pitch-angle distribution, suggests that gamma-rays from thisparticular solar flare were a mixture of direct bremsstrahlung photons andtheir comptonization.

0708.1201	suzaku wide-band x-ray spectroscopy of the seyfert 2 agn in ngc 4945	suzaku observed a nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4945, which hosts one of thebrightest active galactic nuclei above 20 kev. combining data from the x-rayccd camera (xis) and the hard x-ray detector (hxd), the agn intrinsic nuclearemission and its reprocessed signals were observed simultaneously. theintrinsic emission is highly obscured with an absorbing column of $\sim 5\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and was detectable only above $\sim 10$ kev. thespectrum below 10 kev is dominated by reflection continuum and emission linesfrom neutral/ionized material. along with a neutral iron k$\alpha$ line, aneutral iron k$\beta$ and a neutral nickel k$\alpha$ line were detected for thefirst time from this source. the neutral lines and the cold reflectioncontinuum are consistent with both originating in the same location. thecompton down-scattered shoulder in the neutral fe-k$\alpha$ line is $\sim 10%$in flux of the narrow core, which confirms that the line originates fromreflection rather than transmission. the weakness of the compton shoulder alsoindicates that the reflector is probably seen nearly edge-on. flux of theintrinsic emission varied by a factor of $\sim 2$ within $\sim 20$ ks, whichrequires the obscuring material to be geometrically thin. broadband spectralmodeling showed that the solid angle of the neutral reflector is less than afew $\times 10^{-2} \times 2\pi$. all this evidence regarding the reprocessedsignals suggests that a disk-like absorber/reflector is viewed from a nearedge-on angle.

0708.1804	discovery of a bright transient ultraluminous x-ray source suzaku  j1305-4931 in ngc 4945	this paper reports the discovery of a bright x-ray transient source, suzakuj1305-4913, in the south-west arm of the nearby seyfert ii galaxy ngc 4945. itwas detected at a 0.5 -- 10 kev flux of $2.2 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ during the suzaku observation conducted on 2006 january 15 -- 17, butwas undetectable in a shorter observation on 2005 august 22 --23, with an upperlimit of $1.7 \times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (90% confidence level).at a distance of 3.7 mpc, the bolometric luminosity of the source becomes$l_{\rm bol} = 4.4 \times 10^{39} \alpha$ erg s$^{-1}$, where $\alpha = (\cos60^\circ / \cos i)$ and $i$ is the disk inclination. therefore, the source isclassified into so-called ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). the time-averagedx-ray spectrum of the source is described by a multi-color disk model, with theinnermost accretion disk temperature of $t_{\rm in} = 1.69_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$kev. during the 2006 january observation, it varied by a factor of 2 inintensity, following a clear correlation of $l_{\rm bol} \propto t_{\rm in}^4$.it is inferred that the innermost disk radius $r_{\rm in}$ stayed constant at$r_{\rm in} = 79_{-3.9}^{+4.0} \alpha^{1/2}$ km, suggesting the presence of astandard accretion disk. relating $r_{\rm in}$ with the last stable orbitaround a non-rotating black hole yields a rather low black hole mass, $\sim 9\alpha^{1/2}$ solar masses, which would imply that the source is shining at aluminosity of $\sim3 \alpha^{1/2} $ times the eddington limit. these resultscan be better interpreted by invoking sub-eddington emission from a rapidlyspinning black hole with a mass of 20 -- 130 solar masses.

1009.6031	expansion velocity of ejecta in tycho's supernova remnant measured by  doppler broadened x-ray line emission	we show that the expansion of ejecta in tycho's supernova remnant (snr) isconsistent with a spherically symmetric shell, based on suzaku measurements ofthe doppler broadened x-ray emission lines. all the strong k_alpha lineemission show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroidenergies are constant across the remnant (except for ca). this is the patternexpected for doppler broadening due to expansion of the snr ejecta in aspherical shell. to determine the expansion velocities of the ejecta, weapplied a model for each emission line feature having two gaussian componentsseparately representing red- and blue-shifted gas, and inferred the dopplervelocity difference between these two components directly from the fittedcentroid energy difference. taking into account the effect of projecting athree-dimensional shell to the plane of the detector, we derived averagespherical expansion velocities independently for the k_alpha emission of si, s,ar, and fe, and k_beta of si. we found that the expansion velocities of si, s,and ar ejecta of 4700+/-100 km/s are distinctly higher than that obtained fromfe k_alpha emission, 4000+/-300 km/s, which is consistent with segregation ofthe fe in the inner ejecta. combining the observed ejecta velocities with theejecta proper-motion measurements by chandra, we derived a distance to thetycho's snr of 4+/-1 kpc.

1106.5872	suzaku discovery of a hard component varying independently of the  power-law emission in mcg-6-30-15	focusing on hard x-ray variability, we reanalyzed suzaku data of type iseyfert galaxy mcg-6-30-15 obtained in 2006. intensity-sorted spectroscopy anda principal component analysis consistently revealed a very hard component thatvaries independently of the dominant power-law emission. although the exactnature of this hard component is not yet identified, it can be modeled as apower-law with a photon index ~2 affected by a partial covering absorption, oras a thermal comptonization emission with a relatively large optical depth.when this component is included in the fitting model, the time-averaged 2.5-55kev spectrum of mcg-6-30-15 can be reproduced successfully by invoking a mildlybroadened iron line with its emission region located at &gt; 8 times thegravitational radii from the central black hole, and a moderate reflection witha covering fraction of ~3.4. this result implies that the solution of a highlyspinning black hole in mcg-6-30-15, obtained by miniutti et al.

1107.3590	spectral and timing studies of cyg x-1 in the low/hard state with suzaku	from 2005 to 2009, 25 observations of cyg x-1 were performed with suzaku,achieving a total exposure of 446 ks. in all observations, the source was foundin the low/hard state, while the 1.5--12.0 kev count rate of the all-skymonitor onboard rxte varied by a factor of ~ 3. in each observation, the 10--60kev hxd-pin spectrum and the 60--400 kev hxd-gso spectrum were fittedsuccessfully by a thermal comptonization model plus reflection by a thickneutral material. as the soft x-ray intensity increased, the comptony-parameter was found to decrease from 1.0 to 0.6, while the solid angle ofreflection to increase by ~ 30%. also conducted was timing analysis over afrequency range of 0.001--10 hz. as the source became brighter in soft x-rays,the characteristic frequency of hard x-ray variation increased from 0.03 to 0.3hz, while the fractional hard x-ray variation integrated over 0.001--0.01 hzdecreased by a factor of ~ 5. the signals in the 60--200 kev band weregenerally found to vary on shorter time scales than those in the 10--60 kevband. these spectral and timing results can be consistently interpreted bypresuming that increases in the mass accretion rate cause the comptonizing hotcorona to shrink, while the optically-thick disk to intrude deeper therein.

1107.3603	rxte observations of the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1608-522 in  upper-banana state	to investigate the physics of mass accretion onto weakly-magnetized neutronstars, 95 archival rxte datasets of an atoll source 4u 1608-522, acquired over1996-2004 in so-called upper-banana state, were analyzed. the object meantimeexhibited 3-30 kev luminosity in the range of &lt;~ 10^35 - 4 x 10^37 erg s^-1,assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc. the 3-30 kev pca spectra, produced one fromeach dataset, were represented successfully with a combination of a soft and ahard component, of which the presence was revealed in a model-independentmanner by studying spectral variations among the observations. the softcomponent is expressed by so-called multi-color disk model with a temperatureof ~1.8 kev, and is attributed to the emission from an optically-thick standardaccretion disk. the hard component is a blackbody emission with a temperatureof ~2.7 kev, thought to be emitted from the neutron-star surface. as the totalluminosity increases, a continuous decrease was observed in the ratio of theblackbody luminosity to that of the disk component. this property suggests thatthe matter flowing through the accretion disk gradually becomes difficult toreach the neutron-star surface, presumably forming outflows driven by theincreased radiation pressure. on time scales of hours to days, the overallsource variability was found to be controlled by two independent variables; themass accretion rate, and the innermost disk radius which changes bothphysically and artificially.

1107.4857	improvements in calibration of gso scintillators in the suzaku hard  x-ray detector	improvements of in-orbit calibration of gso scintillators in the hard x-raydetector on board suzaku are reported. to resolve an apparent change of theenergy scale of gso which appeared across the launch for unknown reasons,consistent and thorough re-analyses of both pre-launch and in-orbit data havebeen performed. with laboratory experiments using spare hardware, the pulseheight offset, corresponding to zero energy input, was found to change by ~0.5of the full analog voltage scale, depending on the power supply. furthermore,by carefully calculating all the light outputs of secondaries from activationlines used in the in-orbit gain determination, their energy deposits in gsowere found to be effectively lower, by several percent, than their nominalenergies. taking both these effects into account, the in-orbit data agrees withthe on-ground measurements within ~5%, without employing the artificialcorrection introduced in the previous work (kokubun et al. 2007). with thisknowledge, we updated the data processing, the response, and the auxiliaryfiles of gso, and reproduced the hxd-pin and hxd-gso spectra of the crab nebulaover 12-300 kev by a broken powerlaw with a break energy of ~110 kev.

1109.0457	suzaku studies of wide-band spectral variability of the bright type i  seyfert galaxy markarian 509	the type i seyfert galaxy markarian 509 was observed with suzaku in 2010november, for a gross time span of 2.2 days. timing and spectral properties ofthe 0.5-45 kev x-rays, detected with the xis and hxd, consistently revealed thepresence of a soft spectral component that remained constant while the total x-ray intensity varied by \pm10%. this stable soft component, found in the0.5-3.0 kev range, was interpreted as a result of thermal comptonization in acorona with a temperature of ~ 0.5 kev and an optical depth of ~ 18. thetime-avearged 0.5-45 kev suzaku spectrum was reproduced successfully, as acombination of this thermal comptonization component, a harder power-law ofphoton index ~ 1.8, moderate reflection, and an iron k-emission line. byanalyzing four archival suzaku datasets of the same object obtained in 2006,the thermal comptonization component, which was stable during the 2.2 daypointing in 2010, was found to vary on time scales of a few weeks,independently of the power-law component. implications of these results arediscussed in terms of the "multi-zone comptonization" view, obtained withsuzaku from the black hole binary cygnus x-1.

1109.1378	a spectral study of the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 in the  high/soft state with maxi, suzaku and swift	we report on the x-ray spectral analysis of the black hole candidate xte\j1752--223 in the 2009--2010 outburst, utilizing data obtained with themaxi/gas slit camera (gsc), the swift/xrt, and suzaku, which workcomplementarily. as already reported by nakahira et al. (2010) maxi monitoredthe source continuously throughout the entire outburst for about eight months.all the maxi/gsc energy spectra in the high/soft state lasting for 2 months arewell represented by a multi-color disk plus power-law model. the innermost disktemperature changed from $\sim$0.7 kev to $\sim$0.4 kev and the disk fluxdecreased by an order of magnitude. nevertheless, the innermost radius isconstant at $\sim$41 $d_{3.5}(\cos{\it i})^{-1/2}$ km, where $d_{3.5}$ is thesource distance in units of 3.5 kpc and $i$ the inclination. the multi-colordisk parameters obtained with the maxi/gsc are consistent with those with theswift/xrt and suzaku. the suzaku data also suggests a possibility that the diskemission is slightly comptonized, which could account for broad iron-k featuresreported previously. assuming that the obtained innermost radius represents theinnermost stable circular orbit for a non-rotating black hole, we estimate themass of the black hole to be 5.51$\pm$0.28 $m_{\odot}$ $d_{3.5}(\cos{\iti})^{-1/2}$, where the correction for the stress-free inner boundary conditionand color hardening factor of 1.7 are taken into account. if the inclination isless than 49$^{\circ}$ as suggested from the radio monitoring of transient jetsand the soft-to-hard transition in 2010 april occurred at 1--4% of eddigntonluminosity, the fitting of the suzaku spectra with a relativisticaccretion-disk model derives constraints on the mass and the distance to be3.1--55 $m_{\odot}$ and 2.3--22 {\rm kpc}, respectively. this confirms that thecompact object in xte j1752--223 is a black hole.

1201.5891	accretion geometry of the low-mass x-ray binary aquila x-1 in the soft  and hard states	the neutron-star low-mass x-ray binary aquila x-1 was observed seven times intotal with the suzaku x-ray observatory from september 28 to october 30 in2007, in the decaying phase of an outburst. in order to constrain theflux-dependent accretion geometry of this source over wider energy bands thanemployed in most of previous works, the present study utilized two out of theseven data sets. the 0.8-31 kev spectrum on september 28, taken with the xisand hxd-pin for an exposure of 13.8 ks, shows an absorbed 0.8-31 kev flux of$3.6\times 10^{-9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, together with typicalcharacteristics of the soft state of this type of objects. the spectrum wassuccessfully explained by an optically-thick disk emission plus a comptonizedblackbody component. although these results are in general agreement withprevious studies, the significance of a hard tail recently reported using thesame data was inconclusive in our analysis. the spectrum acquired on october 9for an exposure of 19.7 ks was detected over a 0.8-100 kev band with the xis,hxd-pin, and hxd-gso, at an absorbed flux of $8.5\times 10^{-10}$ erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ (in 0.8-100 kev). it shows characteristics of the hard state, and wassuccessfully explained by the same two continuum components but with ratherdifferent parameters including much stronger thermal comptonization, of whichthe seed photon source was identified with blackbody emission from theneutron-star surface. as a result, the accretion flow in the hard state isinferred to take a form of an optically-thick and geometrically-thin disk downto a radius of $21\pm 4$ km from the neutron star, and then turn into anoptically-thin nearly-spherical hot flow.

1205.1574	broad-band spectral analysis of the galactic ridge x-ray emission	detailed spectral analysis of the galactic x-ray background emission, or thegalactic ridge x-ray emission (grxe), is presented. to study the origin of theemission, broad-band and high-quality grxe spectra were produced from 18pointing observations with suzaku in the galactic bulge region, with the totalexposure of 1 ms. the spectra were successfully fitted by a sum of two majorspectral components; a spectral model of magnetic accreting white dwarfs with amass of 0.66 (0.59-0.75) solar, and a softer optically-thin thermal emissionwith a plasma temperature of 1.2-1.5 kev which is attributable to coronal x-raysources.  when combined with previous studies which employed high spatial resolution ofthe chandra satellite (e.g. revnivtsev et al. 2009, nature), the presentspectroscopic result gives another strong support to a scenario that the grxeis essentially an assembly of numerous discrete faint x-ray stars.  the detected grxe flux in the hard x-ray band was used to estimate the numberdensity of the unresolved hard x-ray sources. when integrated over a luminosityrange of ~10^30-10^34 erg/s, the result is consistent with a value which wasreported previously by directly resolving faint point sources.

0711.2716	suzaku discovery of hard x-ray pulsations from the rotating magnetized  white dwarf, ae aquarii	the fast rotating magnetized white dwarf, ae aquarii, was observed withsuzaku, in october 2005 and october 2006 with exposures of 53.1 and 42.4 ks,respectively. in addition to clear spin modulation in the 0.5--10 kev band ofthe xis data at the barycentric period of 33.0769 \pm 0.0001 s, the 10--30 kevhxd data in the second half of the 2005 observation also showed statisticallysignificant periodic signals at a consistent period. on that occasion, thespin-folded hxd light curve exhibited two sharp spikes separated by about 0.2cycles in phase, in contrast to approximately sinusoidal profiles observed inenergies below about 4 kev. the folded 4--10 kev xis light curves areunderstood as a superposition of those two types of pulse profiles. the phaseaveraged 1.5--10 kev spectra can be reproduced by two thermal components withtemperatures of $2.90_{-0.16}^{+0.20}$ kev and $0.53_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ kev, butthe 12-25 kev hxd data show a significant excess above the extrapolated model.this excess can be explained by either a power-law model with photon index of$1.12_{-0.62}^{+0.63}$ or a third thermal component with a temperature of$54_{-47}^{+26}$ kev. at a distance of 102 pc, the 4--30 kev luminosities ofthe thermal and the additional components become $1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.3}$ and$5.3_{-0.3}^{+15.3} \times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively. the lattercorresponds to 0.09% of the spin down energy of the object. possible emissionmechanisms of the hard pulsations are discussed, including in particularnon-thermal ones.

1208.3536	the nature of the stable soft x-ray emissions in several types of active  galactic nuclei observed by suzaku	to constrain the origin of the soft x-ray excess phenomenon seen in manyactive galactic nuclei, the intensity-correlated spectral analysis, developedby noda et al. (2011b) for markarian 509, was applied to wide-band (0.5-45 kev)suzaku data of five representative objects with relatively weak reflectionsignature. they are the typical bare-nucleus type 1 seyfert fairall 9, thebright and typical type 1.5 seyfert mcg-2-58-22, 3c382 which is one of thex-ray brightest broad line radio galaxies, the typical seyfert-like radio loudquasar 4c+74.26, and the x-ray brightest radio quiet quasar mr2251-178. in allof them, soft x-ray intensities in energies below 3 kev were tightly correlatedwith that in 3-10 kev, but with significant positive offsets. these offsets,when calculated in finer energy bands, define a stable soft component in 0.5-3kev. in each object, this component successfully explained the soft excessabove a power-law fit. these components were interpreted in several alternativeways, including a thermal comptonization component which is independent of thedominant power-law emission. this interpretation, considered physically mostreasonable, is discussed from a viewpoint of multi-zone comptonization, whichwas proposed for the black hole binary cygnus x-1 (makishima et al. 2008).

1303.7109	spectral variation of the hard x-ray emission from the crab nebula with  the suzaku hard x-ray detector	the crab nebula is one of the brightest and most stable sources in the x-raysky. year-scale flux variation from the object was recently revealed in thehard x-ray band by four satellites. this marked the first detection ofyear-scale variability from pulsar wind nebulae in the hard x-ray band. thecrab nebula has been observed at least once a year for calibration purposeswith the suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) since its launch in 2005. in order toinvestigate possible spectral changes as well as flux variation, the archivaldata of the hxd were analyzed. the flux variation reported by other instrumentswas confirmed in the 25 -- 100 kev band by the hxd in a few percent level, butflux above 100 kev did not follow the trend in variation below 100 kev. thehardness ratios produced utilizing the pin and gso sensors installed in the hxdexhibit significant scattering, thereby indicating spectral variations in thehard x-ray. the spectral changes are quantified by spectral fitting with abroken power-law model. the difference between the two photon indexes of thebroken power-law model in harder and softer energy bands is in the range of &lt;2.54. taking into account flux variation of 6.3% and spectral variationtime-scale of a few days, multi components of the broken power-law-shapedsynchrotron emission with different cooling times are suggested.

1304.1968	evidence for a cool disk and inhomogeneous coronae from wide-band  temporal spectroscopy of cygnus x-1 with suzaku	unified x-ray spectral and timing studies of cygnus x-1 in the low/hard andhard intermediate state were conducted in a model-independent manner, usingbroadband suzaku data acquired on 25 occasions from 2005 to 2009 with a totalexposure of ~ 450 ks. the unabsorbed 0.1--500 kev source luminosity changedover 0.8--2.8% of the eddington limit for 14.8 solar masses. variations onshort (1--2 seconds) and long (days to months) time scales require at leastthree separate components: a constant component localized below ~2 kev, a broadsoft one dominating in the 2--10 kev range, and a hard one mostly seen in10--300 kev range. in view of the truncated disk/hot inner flow picture, theseare respectively interpreted as emission from the truncated cool disk, a softcompton component, and a hard compton component. long-term spectral evolutioncan be produced by the constant disk increasing in temperature and luminosityas the truncation radius decreases. the soft compton component likewiseincreases, but the hard compton does not, so that the spectrum in the hardintermediate state is dominated by the soft compton component; on the otherhand, the hard compton component dominates the spectrum in the dim low/hardstate, probably associated with a variable soft emission providing seed photonsfor the comptonization.

1304.5838	short-term variability of x-rays from accreting neutron star vela x-1:  i. suzaku observations	we have analyzed the time variability of the wide-band x-ray spectrum of velax-1, the brightest wind-fed accreting neutron star, on a short timescale of 2ks by using {\it suzaku} observations with an exposure of 100 ks. during theobservation, the object showed strong variability including several flares andso-called "low states", in which the x-ray luminosity decreases by an order ofmagnitude. although the spectral hardness increases with the x-ray luminosity,the majority of the recorded flares do not show any significant changes ofcircumstellar absorption. however, a sign of heavy absorption was registeredimmediately before one short flare that showed a significant spectralhardening. in the low states, the flux level is modulated with the pulsar spinperiod, indicating that even at this state the accretion flow reaches the closeproximity of the neutron star. phenomenologically, the broad-band x-rayspectra, which are integrated over the entire spin phase, are well representedby the "npex" function (a combination of negative and positive power laws withan exponential cutoff by a common folding energy) with a cyclotron resonancescattering feature at 50 kev. fitting of the data allowed us to infer acorrelation between the photon index and x-ray luminosity. finally, thecircumstellar absorption shows a gradual increase in the orbital phase interval0.25--0.3, which can be interpreted as an impact of a bow shock imposed by themotion of the compact object in the supersonic stellar wind.

1308.5760	multi-wavelength studies of spectacular ram pressure stripping of a  galaxy: discovery of an x-ray absorption feature	we report the detection of an x-ray absorption feature near the galaxy m86 inthe virgo cluster. the absorber has a column density of 2-3 e20 /cm^2, and itsposition coincides with the peak of an intracluster hi cloud which was removedfrom the galaxy ngc 4388 presumably by ram pressure. these results indicatethat the hi cloud is located in front of m86 along the line-of-sight, andsuggest that the stripping was primarily created by an interaction between ngc4388 and the hot plasmas of the virgo cluster, not the m86 halo. by calculatingan x-ray temperature map, we further detected an x-ray counterpart of the hicloud up to about 3' south of m86. it has a temperature of 0.89 kev and a massof ~4.5 e8 solar mass, exceeding the estimated hi gas mass. the highhot-to-cold gas ratio in the cloud indicates a significant evaporation of thehi gas, probably by thermal conduction from the hotter cluster plasma with asub-spitzer rate.

1311.4618	suzaku view of the neutron star in the dipping source 4u 1822$-$37	the dipping x-ray source 4u 1822$-$37 was observed by suzaku on 2006 octrober20 for a net exposure of 37 ks. the source was detected with the xis at a 1-10kev flux of 5.5$\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and with the hxd(hxd-pin) at a 10-50 kev flux of 8.9$\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.with hxd-pin, the pulsation was detected at a barycentric period of 0.592437 s,and its change rate was reconfirmed as $-2.43\times$10$^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. the1-50 kev spectra of 4u 1822-37 were found to be very similar to those of herx-1 in the slopes, cutoff and iron lines. three iron lines (fe k$\alpha$, fexxv, and fe xxvi) were detected, on top of a 1-50 kev continuum that isdescribed by an npex model plus a soft blackbody. in addition, a cyclotronresonance scattering feature was detected significantly ($&gt;99\%$ confidence),at an energy of 33$\pm$2 kev with a depth of 0.4$^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$. therefore,the neutron star in this source is concluded to have a strong magnetic field of2.8$\times10^{12}$ g. further assuming that the source has a relatively highintrinsic luminosity of several times 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, its spectral andtiming properties are consistently explained.

1401.5138	cyclotron line variability	we systematically analyzed the spectra of x-ray binary pulsars observed withginga (mihara 1995). a new model npex (negative and positive power-lawsexponential) was introduced t o represent the pulsar continuum. combining thenpex continuum with the cyab factor (cyclotron resonance scattering model), wesuccessfully fit the whole-band spectra of all the pulsars. a possible physicalmeaning of the npex model is the comptonized spectra.  by using the smooth and concave npex model, the cyclotron structures weredetected from 12 pulsars, about a half of the 23 sources, including newdiscoveries from lmc x-4 and gs 1843+00. the magnetic fields were scattered inthe range of $3\times10^{11}$ - $5\times10^{12}$ g. the distribution was shownfor the first time, which is remarkably similar to that of radio pulsars with apeak at $2 \times 10^{12}$ g.  the double harmonic cyclotron structures of 4u 0115+63 in 1990 changed to asin gle structure in 1991. the resonance energy also increased by 40 % as theluminosity decreased to 1/6. if we attribute this change to the height of thescattering region in a dipole m agnetic field, the height change is $\sim$ 1.1km. such changes of the resonance energies with luminosities are observed from5 pulsars and can be explained by the accretion column height model.

1404.0134	spectral and timing nature of the symbiotic x-ray binary 4u 1954+319:  the slowest rotating neutron star in an x-ray binary system	the symbiotic x-ray binary 4u 1954+319 is a rare system hosting a peculiarneutron star (ns) and an m-type optical companion. its ~5.4h ns spin period isthe longest among all known accretion-powered pulsars and exhibited large (~7%)fluctuations over 8 years. a spin trend transition was detected with swift/bataround an x-ray brightening in 2012. the source was in quiescent and brightstates before and after this outburst based on 60 ks suzaku observations in2011 and 2012. the observed continuum is well described by a comptonized modelwith the addition of a narrow 6.4 kev fe kalpha line during the outburst.spectral similarities to slowly rotating pulsars in high-mass x-ray binaries,its high pulsed fraction (~60-80%), and the location in the corbet diagramfavor high b-field (&gt;~1e+12 g) over a weak field as in low-mass x-ray binaries.the observed low x-ray luminosity (1e+33-1e+35 erg/s), probable wide orbit, anda slow stellar wind of this syxb make quasi-spherical accretion in the subsonicsettling regime a plausible model. assuming a ~1e+13 g ns, this scheme canexplain the ~5.4 h equilibrium rotation without employing the magnetar-likefield (~1e+16 g) required in the disk accretion case. the time-scales ofmultiple irregular flares (~50 s) can also be attributed to the free-fall timefrom the alfven shell for a ~1e+13 g field. a physical interpretation of syxbsbeyond the canonical binary classifications is discussed.

1406.4977	suzaku discovery of a slowly varying hard x-ray continuum from the type  i seyfert galaxy ngc 3516	the bright type i seyfert galaxy ngc 3516 was observed by {\it suzaku} twice,in 2005 october 12--15 and 2009 october 28--november 2, for a gross timecoverage of 242 and 544 ksec and a net exposure of 134 and 255 ksec,respectively. the 2--10 kev luminosity was $2.8 \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in2005, and $1.6 \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in 2009. the 1.4--1.7 kev and 2--10kev count rates both exhibited peak-to-peak variations by a factor of $\sim2$in 2005, while $\sim 4$ in 2009. in either observation, the 15--45 kev countrate was less variable. the 2--10 kev spectrum in 2005 was significantly moreconvex than that in 2009. through a count-count-plot technique, the 2--45 kevsignals in both data were successfully decomposed in a model-independent wayinto two distinct broadband components. one is a variable emission with afeatureless spectral shape, and the other is a non-varying hard componentaccompanied by a prominent fe-k emission line at 6.33 kev (6.40 kev in the restframe). the former was fitted successfully by an absorbed power-law model,while the latter requires a new hard continuum in addition to a reflectioncomponent from distant materials. the spectral and variability differencesbetween the two observations are mainly attributed to long-term changes of thisnew hard continuum, which was stable on time scales of several hundreds ksec.

1406.5131	suzaku studies of the central engine in the typical type i seyfert ngc  3227: detection of multiple primary x-ray continua with distinct properties	the type i seyfert galaxy ngc 3227 was observed by suzaku six times in 2008,with intervals of $\sim1$ week and net exposures of $\sim50$ ksec each. amongthe six observations, the source varied by nearly an order of magnitude, beingbrightest in the 1st observation with a 2-10 kev luminosity of$1.2\times10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, while faintest in the 4th with$2.9\times10^{41}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. as it became fainter, the continuum in a 2-45kev band became harder, while a narrow fe-k$\alpha$ emission line, detected onall occasions at 6.4 kev of the source rest frame, remained approximatelyconstant in the photon flux. through a method of variability-assistedbroad-band spectroscopy (e.g., noda et al. 2013), the 2-45 kev spectrum of ngc3227 was decomposed into three distinct components. one is a relatively softpower-law continuum with a photon index of $\sim 2.3$, weakly absorbed andhighly variable on time scales of $\sim5$ ksec; it was observed only when thesource was above a threshold luminosity of $\sim6.6 \times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$(in 2-10 kev), and was responsible for further source brightening beyond.another is a harder and more absorbed continuum with a photon index of $\sim1.6$, which persisted through the six observations and varied slowly on timescales of a few weeks by a factor of $\sim2$. this component, carrying a majorfraction of the broad-band emission when the source is below the thresholdluminosity, is considered as an additional primary emission. the last one is areflection component with the narrow iron line, produced at large distancesfrom the central black hole.

1409.2091	probing the accretion scheme of the dipping x-ray binary 4u 1915-05 with  suzaku	the dipping low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1915-05 was observed by suzaku on 2007november 8 for a net exposure of 39 ksec. it was detected by the xis with a0.8-10 kev signal rate of 9.84+\-0.01 cts/s per camera, and hxd-pin with a12-45 kev signal rate of 0.29+/-0.01 cts/s. after removing the periodic dipsand an x-ray burst, the 0.8 - 45 kev continuum was successfully described by anoptically thick disk emission with an inner-disk temperature ~ 0.7 kev and aneutron-star blackbody emission with a temperature ~ 1.3 kev, on condition thatthe blackbody component, or possibly the disk emission too, is significantlycomptonized. this successful modeling is consistent with 4u 1915-05 being in ahigh-soft state in this observation, and implies that its broadband spectrumcan be interpreted in the same scheme as for many non-dipping low-mass x-raybinaries in the soft state. its bolometric luminosity (~ 0.02 times theeddington limit) is relatively low for the soft state, but within a tolerance,if considering the distance and inclination uncertainties. as ahigh-inclination binary, this source exhibited stronger comptonization effect,with a larger comptonizing y-parameter, compared to low and medium inclinationbinaries. this suggests that the comptonizing coronae of these objects in thesoft state is in an oblate (rather than spherical) shape, extending along theaccretion disk plane, because the y-parameter would not depend on theinclination if the corona were spherical.

1504.02708	discovery of a nearby early-phase major cluster merger ciza j1358.9-4750	ciza j1358.9-4750 is a nearby (z = 0.074) pair of clusters of galaxieslocated close to the galactic plane. it consists of two x-ray extended humps atnorth-west and south-east separated by 14 arcmin (~ 1.2 mpc), and an x-raybright bridge-like structure in between. with suzaku, the south-east hump wasshown to have a temperature of 5.6 kev and the north-west one 4.6 kev. neitherhumps exhibit significant central cool component. the bridge region has atemperature higher than 9 kev at the maximum, and this hot region isdistributed almost orthogonal to the bridge axis in agreement with the shockheating seen in numerical simulations at an early phase of a head-on majormerger. this resemblance is supported by good positional coincidence betweenthe x-ray peaks and cd galaxies associated with each cluster. in a shortexposure xmm-newton image, a significant intensity jump was found at a positionwhere the suzaku-measured temperature exhibits a steep gradient. theseproperties indicate the presence of a shock discontinuity. the mach number isestimated to be 1.32 from the temperature difference across the identifiedshock front, which gives the colliding velocity of approximately 1800 km/s.from optical redshifts of the member galaxies, the two clusters are indicatedto be merging nearly on the sky plane. thus, ciza j1358.9-4750 is considered asa valuable nearby example of early-phase merger with a clear shock feature.

astro-ph;0001009	the nature of ultra-luminous compact x-ray sources in nearby spiral  galaxies	studies were made of asca spectra of seven ultra-luminous compact x-raysources (ulxs) in nearby spiral galaxies; m33 x-8 (takano et al. 1994), m81 x-6(fabbiano 1988b; kohmura et al. 1994; uno 1997), ic 342 source 1 (okada et al.1998), dwingeloo 1 x-1 (reynolds et al. 1997), ngc 1313 source b (fabbiano &amp;trinchieri 1987; petre et al. 1994), and two sources in ngc 4565 (mizuno et al.1999). with the 0.5--10 kev luminosities in the range 10^{39-40} ergs/s, theyare thought to represent a class of enigmatic x-ray sources often found inspiral galaxies. for some of them, the asca data are newly processed, or thepublished spectra are reanalyzed. for others, the published results are quoted.the asca spectra of all these seven sources have been described successfullywith so called multi-color disk blackbody (mcd) emission arising fromoptically-thick standard accretion disks around black holes. except the case ofm33 x-8, the spectra do not exhibit hard tails. for the source luminosities notto exceed the eddington limits, the black holes are inferred to have ratherhigh masses, up to ~100 solar masses. however, the observed innermost disktemperatures of these objects, tin = 1.1--1.8 kev, are too high to becompatible with the required high black-hole masses, as long as the standardaccretion disks around schwarzschild black holes are assumed. similarly highdisk temperatures are also observed from two galactic transients withsuperluminal motions, gro 1655-40 and grs 1915+105. the issue of unusually highdisk temperature may be explained by the black hole rotation, which makes thedisk get closer to the black hole, and hence hotter.

astro-ph;0104079	x-ray probing of the central regions of clusters of galaxies	results of asca x-ray study of central regions of medium-richness clusters ofgalaxies are summarized, emphasizing differences between cd and non-cdclusters. the intra-cluster medium (icm) is likely to consist of two (hot andcool) phases within $\sim 100$ kpc of a cd galaxy, where the icm metallicity isalso enhanced. in contrast, the icm in non-cd clusters appears to be isothermalwith little metallicity gradient right to the center. the gravitationalpotential exhibits a hierarchical nesting around cd galaxies, while a totalmass-density profile with a central cusp is indicated for a non-cd clusterabell~1060. the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the icm decreases toward the centerin both types of clusters, although it is radially constant in peripheralregions. the silicon-to-iron abundance ratio in the icm increases with thecluster richness, but remains close to the solar ratio around cd galaxies.these overall results are interpreted without appealing to the popularcooling-flow hypothesis. instead, an emphasis is put on the halo-in-halostructure formed around cd galaxies.

astro-ph;0105426	observational evidence for strong disk comptonization in gro j1655-40	analysis was made of the multiple xte/pca data on the promised black holecandidate with superluminal jet, gro j1655-40, acquired during its 1996--1997outburst. the x-ray spectra can be adequately described by the sum of anoptically thick disk spectrum and a power-law. when the estimated 1--100 kevpower-law luminosity exceeds 1e37 erg/s (assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc), theinner disk radius and the maximum color temperature derived from a simpleaccretion disk model (a multi-color disk model) vary significantly with time.these results reconfirm the previous report by sobczak et al. (1999). in thisstrong power-law state (once called ``very high state''), the disk luminositydecreases with temperature, in contradiction to the prediction of the standardshakura-sunyaev model. in the same state, the intensity of the power-lawcomponent correlates negatively with that of the disk component, and positivelywith the power-law photon index, suggesting that the strong power-law is simplythe missing optically thick disk emission. one possible explanation for thisbehavior is inverse-compton scattering in the disk. by re-fitting the same dataincorporating a disk comptonization, the inner radius and temperature of theunderlying disk are found to become more constant. these results provide one ofthe first observational confirmations of the scenario of disk comptonization inthe strong power-law state. this strong power-law state seems to appear whencolor temperature of the disk exceeds the certain threshold, 1.2 -- 1.3 kev.

astro-ph;0105510	excess hard x-ray emission from the obscured low luminosity agn in the  nearby galaxy m 51 (ngc 5194)	we observed the nearby galaxy m~51 (ngc 5194) with bepposax. the x-rayproperties of the nucleus below 10 kev are almost the same as the asca resultsregarding the hard component and the neutral fe k$\alpha$ line, but theintensity is about half of the asca 1993 data. beyond this, in the bepposax pdsdata, we detected a bright hard x-ray emission component which dominates above10 kev. the 10 -- 100 kev flux and luminosity of this component arerespectively $2\times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $2\times10^{41}$ ergs$^{-1}$. these are about 10 times higher than the extrapolation from the softx-ray band, and similar to the flux observed with ginga, which found a brightpower law component in 2 -- 20 kev band. considering other wavelengthproperties and the x-ray luminosity, together with strong neutral fe k line,the hard x-ray emission most likely arises from a low luminosity activenucleus, which is obscured with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$.this suggests that hidden low luminosity agns may well be present in othernearby galaxies. we interpret the discrepancy between ginga and other x-raysatellites to be due to a large variability of absorption column density towardthe line of sight over several years, suggesting that the compton thickabsorption material may be present on a spatial scale of a parsec. apart fromthe nucleus, several ultra-luminous off-nuclear x-ray sources detected in m~51exhibit long-term time variability, suggesting the state transition similar tothat observed in galactic black hole candidates.

astro-ph;0209113	another interpretation of the power-law type spectrum of an  ultraluminous compact x-ray source in ic 342	the ultraluminous compact x-ray sources (ulxs) generally show a curvingspectrum in the 0.7--10 kev asca bandpass, which looks like a high temperatureanalogue of the disk dominated high/soft state spectra seen in galactic blackhole binaries (bhbs) at high mass accretion rates. several ulxs have been seento vary, and to make a transition at their lowest luminosity to a spectrumwhich looks more like a power law. these have been previously interpreted asthe analogue of the power law dominated low/hard state in galactic bhbs.however, the ulx luminosity at which the transition occurs must be at least10--50 per cent of the eddington limit assuming that their highest luminosityphase corresponds to the eddington limit, while for the galactic bhbs thehigh/soft--low/hard transition occurs at a few per cent of the eddington limit.here we show that the apparently power law spectrum in a ulx in ic342 can beequally well fit over the asca bandpass by a strongly comptonised opticallythick accretion disk with the maximum temperature of ~1 kev. recent work on thegalactic bhbs has increasingly shown that such components are common at highmass accretion rates, and that this often characterises the very high (oranomalous) state. thus we propose that the power law type ulx spectra are notto be identified with the low/hard state, but rather represent thecomptonisation dominated very high/anomalous state in the galactic bhbs.

astro-ph;0310085	the three spectral regimes found in the stellar black hole xte  j1550--564 in its high/soft state	the present paper describes the analysis of multiple rxte/pca data of theblack hole binary with superluminal jet, xte j1550-564, acquired during its1999--2000 outburst. the x-ray spectra show features typical of the high/softspectral state, and can approximately be described by an optically thick diskspectrum plus a power-law tail. three distinct spectral regimes, named standardregime, anomalous regime, and apparently standard regime, have been found fromthe entire set of the observed spectra. when the x-ray luminosity is well below6e38 erg/s (assuming a distance of 5 kpc), xte j1550-564 resides in thestandard regime, where the soft spectral component dominates the power-lawcomponent and the observed disk inner radius is kept constant. when theluminosity exceeds the critical luminosity, the apparently standard regime isrealized, where luminosity of the optically thick disk rises less steeply withthe temperature, and the spectral shape is moderately distorted from that ofthe standard accretion disk. in this regime, radial temperature gradient of thedisk has been found to be flatter than that of the standard accretion disk. theresults of the apparently standard regime are suggestive of a slim disk (e.g.,abramowicz et al. 1988, watarai et al. 2000) which is a solution predictedunder high mass accretion rate. in the intermediate anomalous regime, thespectrum becomes much harder, and the disk inner radius derived using a simpledisk model spectrum apparently varies significantly with time. these propertiescan be explained as a result of significant thermal inverse comptonization ofthe disk photons, as was found from gro j1655-40 in its anomalous regime bykubota, makishima and ebisawa (2001).

astro-ph;0408305	xmm-newton and chandra observations of the central region of m31	the archival xmm-newton data of the central region of m31 were analyzed fordiffuse x-ray emission. point sources with the 0.5--10 kev luminosity exceeding$\sim 4 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ were detected. their summed spectra arewell reproduced by a combination of a disk black-body component and ablack-body component, implying that the emission mainly comes from an assemblyof luminous low-mass x-ray binaries. after excluding these point sources,spectra were accumulated over a circular region of $6\arcmin$ (1.2 kpc)centered on the nucleus. in the energy range above 2 kev, these residualspectra are understood mainly as contributions of unresolved faint sources andspill-over of photons from the excluded point sources. there is in addition ahint of a $\sim 6.6$ kev line emission, which can be produced by a hot(temperature several kev) thin-thermal plasma. below 2 kev, the spectra involvethree additional softer components expressed by thin-thermal plasma emissionmodels, of which the temperatures are $\sim 0.6$, $\sim 0.3$, and $\sim 0.1$kev. their 0.5--10 kev luminosities within 6$\arcmin$ are measured to be $\sim1.2 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and$\sim 4 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the order of decreasing temperature.the archival chandra data of the central region of m31 yielded consistentresults. by incorporating different annular regions, all the three softerthermal components were confirmed to be significantly extended. these resultsare compared with reports from previous studies. a discussion is presented onthe origin of each thermal emission component.

astro-ph;0411745	asca compilation of x-ray properties of hot gas in elliptical galaxies  and galaxy clusters: two breaks in the temperature dependences	utilizing asca archival data of about 300 objects of elliptical galaxies,groups, and clusters of galaxies, we performed systematic measurements of thex-ray properties of hot gas in their systems, and compiled them in this paper.the steepness of the luminosity--temperature (lt) relation, $l_{\rmx}\propto(kt)^{\alpha}$, in the range of $kt=$1.5--15 kev is$\alpha=3.17\pm0.15$, consistent with previous measurements. in the relation,we find two breaks at around icm temperatures of 1 kev and 4 kev:$\alpha=2.34\pm0.29$ above 4 kev, $3.74\pm0.32$ in 1.5--5 kev, and$4.03\pm1.07$ below 1.5 kev. such two breaks are also evident in thetemperature and size relation. the steepness in the lt relation at $kt&gt;4$ kevis consistent with the scale-relation derived from the cdm model, indicatingthat the gravitational effect is dominant in richer clusters, while poorerclusters suffer non-gravity effects. the steep lt relation below 1 kev isalmost attributed to x-ray faint systems of elliptical galaxies and galaxygroups. we found that the icm mass within the scaling radius $r_{1500}$ followsthe relation of $m_{\rm gas}\propto t^{2.33\pm0.07}$ from x-ray faint galaxiesto rich clusters. therefore, we speculate that even such x-ray faint systemscontain a large-scale hot gas, which is too faint to detect.

astro-ph;0502557	canonical particle acceleration in fri radio galaxies	matched resolution multi-frequency vla observations of four radio galaxiesare used to derive the asymptotic low energy slope of the relativistic electrondistribution. where available, low energy slopes are also determined for othersources in the literature. they provide information on the acceleration physicsindependent of radiative and other losses, which confuse measurements of thesynchrotron spectra in most radio, optical and x-ray studies. we find a narrowrange of inferred low energy electron energy slopes, n(e)=const*e^-2.1 for thecurrently small sample of lower luminosity sources classified as fri (notclassical doubles). this distribution is close to, but apparently inconsistentwith, the test particle limit of n(e)=const*e^-2.0 expected from strongdiffusive shock acceleration in the non-relativistic limit. relativistic shocksor those modified by the back-pressure of efficiently accelerated cosmic raysare two alternatives to produce somewhat steeper spectra. we note for furtherstudy the possiblity of acceleration through shocks, turbulence or shear in theflaring/brightening regions in fri jets as they move away from the nucleus.jets on pc scales and the collimated jets and hot spots of frii (classicaldouble) sources would be governed by different acceleration sites andmechanisms; they appear to show a much wider range of spectra than for frisources.

astro-ph;0506632	spectral evolution of a luminous compact x-ray source in ngc 253 with  chandra and xmm-newton	spectral studies of a luminous x-ray source, ngc 253 x21, are presented basedon archival chandra and xmm-newton data. the chandra observation on 1999december 16 detected the source at a bolometric luminosity of 0.3 x 10^39 erg/s(assuming isotropic emission), while an xmm-newton observation on 2000 june 3revealed a short-term source variation in the range of (0.6--1.3) x 10^39erg/s. all spectra from these observations were successfully modeled byemission from an optically thick accretion disk. the average inner disk radiuswas kept constant at 63 x (cos 60/cos i)^(1/2) km, where i is the diskinclination, and did not vary significantly, while the disk inner temperaturechanged in the range of 0.9--1.4 kev. assuming that this object is an accretingschwarzschild black hole, and that the disk inner radius coincides with itslast stable orbit, the mass of the black hole is estimated to be ~ 7 m_sun. thedisk luminosity corresponds to (30--120) x (cos 60/cos i) % of the eddingtonlimit of this black hole. therefore, this luminous x-ray source, ngc 253 x21,is understood consistently to be an accreting stellar mass black hole in thestandard disk state.

astro-ph;0507271	observational studies of stellar black hole binaries and ulxs	we outline a framework for understanding the x-ray spectra of high massaccretion rate stellar black holes based on x-ray data from rxte and asca.three spectral regimes can be separated out by the behaviour of the observeddisk luminosity and temperature. the well established "standard regime" is seenwhen the disk dominates the spectrum, where only a small fraction of theluminosity is emitted in the power law tail. these spectra generally satisfythe standard relation expected for thermal emission from a constant area,namely that the disk bolometric luminosity, ldisk, is proportional to itsmaximum temperature, tin^4. however, at higher luminosities this starts tochange to tin^2. this "apparently standard regime" is still dominated by thedisk emission, but this difference luminosity-temperature relation and subtlechanges in spectral shape may show that another cooling process is required inaddition to radiative cooling. at intermediate luminosities there is ananomalous regime (or weak very high state) where the disk temperature andluminosity are less clearly related. these spectra are characterized by thepresence of a much stronger comptonized tail indicating high energy electrons.when observed disk emission is corrected for the the effects of comptonisationthen these points lie back on the standard relation. the growth of thiscomptonising corona is also clearly linked to the quasi-periodic oscillations,as these are observed preferentially in the anomalous regime. this presentedpicture was found to explain the spectral behavior of both black hole binariesin our galaxy and lmc. spectral evolution of several bright ulxs observed withasca were also successfully explained in the same picture.

astro-ph;0509520	three spectral states of the disk x-ray emission of the black-hole  candidate 4u 1630-47	we studied a time history of x-ray spectral states of a black-hole candidate,4u 1630-47, utilizing data from a number of monitoring observations with therossi x-ray timing explorer over 1996--2004. these observations covered fiveoutbursts of 4u 1630-47, and most of the data recorded typical features of thehigh/soft states. we found that the spectra in the high/soft states can befurther classified into three states. the first spectral state is explained bya concept of the standard accretion disk picture. the second state appears inthe so-called very high state, where a dominant hard component is seen and thedisk radius apparently becomes too small. these phenomena are explained by theeffect of inverse compton scattering of disk photons, as shown by kubota,makishima, &amp; ebisawa (2001, apj, 560, l147) for gro j1655-40. the third stateis characterized in such a way that the disk luminosity varies in proportion to$t_{\rm in}^2$, rather than $t_{\rm in}^4$, where $t_{\rm in}$ is theinner-disk temperature. this state is suggested to be an optically-thick andadvection-dominated slim disk, as suggested by kubota &amp; makishima (2004, apj,601, 428) for xte j1550-564. the second and third states appear, with goodreproducibility, when $t_{\rm in}$ and the total x-ray luminosity are higherthan 1.2 kev and $\sim2.5\times10^{38}(d/10\quad{\rm kpc})^2\left[\cos{\theta}/(1/\sqrt{3})]^{-1}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively, where $d$ isthe distance to the object and $\theta$ is the inclination angle to the disk.the present results suggest that these three spectral states commonly appearamong black-hole binaries under high accretion rates.

(2004) using ginga,who observed a single absorption at ~16 kev in a minor (~10^{37} erg s^{-1})outburst of this object. the luminosity-dependent cyclotron resonance energymay be understood as a result of a decrease in the accretion column height, inresponse to a decrease in the mass accretion rate.

astro-ph;9905194	two-phased intra-cluster medium in the centaurus cluster of galaxies	asca and rosat data of the centaurus cluster were analyzed. a central excessin the radial brightness profile is found in the hard energy band up to 10kev.this requires a deeper central potential than a king-type one. a double-betabrightness distribution gives a good account of the data. a deprojected energyspectrum within a spherical region of radius 30 kpc at the cluster centerindicates that the icm cannot be isothermal there. simultaneous fitting of thethree (pspc, gis, and sis) energy spectra extracted from the central 3' regionshowed that a two-temperature model that has temperatures of 1.4kev and 4.4kevand a common metallicity of 1.0 solar with the galactic absorption gives thebest description to the spectra. a cooling-flow spectral model did not givesatisfactory fit. a 3-dimensional cluster model incorporating the two-phasepicture, the double-beta brightness distribution, and the central metallicityincrease reproduced the overall asca and rosat data successfully. the derivedspatial distribution of the dark matter deviates from a king-type profileexhibiting a central excess, which is consistent with the navvaro-frenk-whitemodel. the iron is revealed to be more widely spread than stars, which may havebeen caused by energetic supernovae and the motion of the cd galaxy. since thederived characteristics of the cool phase including the temperature, angularextent, gas mass, and metallicity, are on a smooth extension of those ofinter-stellar medium (ism) of elliptical galaxies, the cool phase can beregarded as the ism associated with the cd galaxy. the cool-phase x-rayemission is presumably sustained by energies dissipated by infalling mass tothe cd galaxy in the course of cluster evolution.

astro-ph;9905277	asca observations of two ultra-luminous compact x-ray sources in the  edge-on spiral galaxy ngc 4565	the edge-on spiral galaxy ngc 4565 was observed for $\sim$ 35 ks with asca inthe 0.5-10 kev energy band. the x-ray emission was dominated by two brightsources, which can be identified with two point-like x-ray sources seen in therosat hri image. the observed 0.5-10 kev fluxes of these sources, $1.7 \times10^{-12} erg/s cm^{-2}$ and $0.7 \times 10^{-12}erg/s cm^{-2}$, %$1.66 \times10^{-12} erg/s cm^{-2}$ %$0.66 \times 10^{-12} erg/s cm^{-2}$ imply bolometricluminosities of $1.0\times 10^{40} erg/s$ and $4 \times 10^{39} erg/s$,respectively. they exhibit similar spectra, which can be explained by emissionfrom optically thick accretion disks with the inner disk temperature of 1.4-1.6kev. one of them, coincident in position with the nucleus, shows too lowabsorption to be the active nucleus seen through the galaxy disk. their spectraand high luminosities suggest that they are both mass accreting black holebinaries. however the black-hole mass required by the eddington limit is ratherhigh ($\geq 50 m_{\odot}$), and the observed disk temperature is too high to becompatible with the high black-hole mass. several attempts are made to solvethese problesms.

astro-ph;9908128	the asca medium sensitivity survey (the gis catalog project): source  counts and evidence for emerging population of hard sources	we present first results from the asca medium sensitivity survey (amss; orthe gis catalog project). from the serendipitous fields amounting to 106dege-2, we determined the log n - log s relations in the 0.7-7 kev and 2-10 kevbands with the best statistical accuracy obtained so far, over the flux rangefrom 1 x 10e-11 to 5 x 10e-14 and 7 x 10e-14 erg se-1 cme-2, respectively. whenthe sources detected in the 0.7-7 kev band are divided into two subsamples withhigher and lower spectral hardness, the former exhibits a significantly steeperslope than the latter at fluxes below ~10e-12 erg se-1 cme-2 (0.7-7 kev). theaverage spectrum of sources becomes continuously harder toward fainter fluxes,from a photon index of 2.1 in the 0.7-10 kev range at the flux of ~10e-11 to1.6 at ~10e-13 erg se-1 cme-2 (0.7-7 kev). this is consistent with thecomparison of source counts between the 2-10 kev and the 0.7-2 kev band, andsolves the puzzle of their discrepancy reported previously. our resultsdemonstrate rapid emergence of hard x-ray sources with a decreasing flux from\~10e-12 to ~10e-13 erg se-1 cme-2 (2-10 kev).

0810.5188	spectral transitions of an ultraluminous x-ray source, ngc 2403 source 3	suzaku observation of an ultraluminous x-ray source, ngc 2403 source 3,performed on 2006 march 16--17, is reported. the suzaku xis spectrum of source3 was described with a multi-color black-body-like emission from an opticallythick accretion disk. the innermost temperature and radius of the accretiondisk was measured to be $t_{\rm in} = 1.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} $ kev and $r_{\rmin} = 122.1_{-6.8}^{+7.7} \alpha^{1/2}$ km, respectively, where $\alpha = (\cos60^\circ /\cos i)$ with $i$ being the disk inclination. the bolometricluminosity of the source was estimated to be $l_{\rm bol} = 1.82 \times 10^{39}\alpha $ ergs s$^{-1}$. archival chandra and xmm-newton data of the source wereanalyzed for long-term spectral variations. in almost all observations, thesource showed multi-color black-body-like x-ray spectra with parameters similarto those in the suzaku observation. in only one chandra observation, however,source 3 was found to exhibit a power-law-like spectrum, with a photon index of$\gamma = 2.37 \pm 0.08$, when it was fainter by about $\sim 15 %$ than in thesuzaku observation. the spectral behavior is naturally explained in terms of atransition between the slim disk state and the "very high" states, both foundin galactic black hole binaries when their luminosity approach the eddingtonlimit. these results are utilized to argue that ultraluminous x-ray sourcesgenerally have significantly higher black-hole masses than ordinarystellar-mass black holes.

0706.0561	a multi band study of the optically dark grb 051028	observations were made of the optical afterglow of grb 051028 with the lulinobservatory's 1.0 m telescope and the widget robotic telescope system. r bandphotometric data points were obtained on 2005 october 28 (ut), or 0.095-0.180days after the burst. there is a possible plateau in the optical light curvearound 0.1 days after the burst; the light curve resembles optically brightafterglows (e.g. grb 041006, grb 050319, grb060605) in shape of the light curvebut not in brightness. the brightness of the grb 051028 afterglow is 3magnitudes fainter than that of one of the dark events, grb 020124. opticallydark grbs have been attributed to dust extinction within the host galaxy orhigh redshift. however, the spectrum analysis of the x-rays implies that thereis no significant absorption by the host galaxy. furthermore, according to themodel theoretical calculation of the ly$\alpha$ absorption to find the limit ofgrb 051028's redshift, the expected $r$ band absorption is not high enough toexplain the darkness of the afterglow. while the present results disfavoreither the high-redshift hypothesis or the high extinction scenario foroptically dark bursts, they are consistent with the possibility that thebrightness of the optical afterglow, intrinsically dark.

0812.0145	suzaku results on the obscured low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in  ngc 4258	in 2006 june, the obscured low luminosity active galactic nucleus in thenearby seyfert 1.9 galaxy ngc 4258 was observed with suzaku for ~ 100 ks.utilizing the xis and the hxd, the nucleus emission was detected over 2 to 40kev range, with an unabsorbed 2--10 kev luminosity of 8 x 10 40 erg / s, andvaried by a factor of ~ 2 during the observation. its 2--40 kev spectrum isreproduced by a single power law with photon index of ~ 2.0, absorbed by anequivalent hydrogen column of ~ 1.0 x 10 23 cm2. the spectrum within 4' of thenucleus required also a softer thin-thermal emission, as well as anintermediate hardness component attributable to integrated point sources. aweak neutral fe-kalpha florescence line was detected at an equivalent width of~ 40 ev. the cold reflection component was not required by the data, with thereflector solid angle omega seen from the nucleus constrained as omega / 2 pi &lt;0.3 assuming a general case of 60 deg inclination. the results suggest that thecold reflecting material around the nucleus is localized along our line ofsight, rather than forming a thick torus.

0812.1438	hard x-ray properties of the merging cluster abell 3667 as observed with  suzaku	wide-band suzaku data on the merging cluster abell 3667 were examined forhard x-ray emission in excess to the known thermal component. suzaku detectedx-ray signals in the wide energy band from 0.5 to 40 kev. the hard x-ray (&gt; 10kev) flux observed by the hxd around the cluster center cannot be explained bya simple extension of the thermal emission with average temperature of ~7 kev.the emission is most likely an emission from a very hot (kt &gt; 13.2 kev) thermalcomponent around the cluster center, produced via a strong heating process inthe merger. in the north-west radio relic, no signature of non-thermal emissionwas observed. using the hxd, the overall upper-limit flux within a 34'x34'field-of-view around the relic is derived to be 5.3e-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the10-40 kev band, after subtracting the icm contribution estimated using the xisor the xmm-newton spectra. directly on the relic region, the upper limit isfurther tightened by the xis data to be less than 7.3e-13 erg s-1 cm-2, whenconverted into the 10--40 kev band. the latter value suggest that the averagemagnetic field within the relic is higher than 1.6 ug. the non-thermal pressuredue to magnetic fields and relativistic electrons may be as large as ~20% ofthe thermal pressure in the region.
