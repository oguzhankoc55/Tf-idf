0901.3750	the xmm-newton long look of ngc 1365: lack of a high/soft state in its  ultraluminous x-ray sources	based on our long (~ 300 ks) 2007 xmm-newton observation of the seyfertgalaxy ngc 1365, we report here on the spectral and timing behaviour of twoultraluminous x-ray sources, which had previously reached isotropic x-rayluminosities l_x ~ 4 x 10^{40} erg/s (0.3-10 kev band). in 2007, they were in alower state (l_x ~ 5 x 10^{39} erg/s, and l_x ~ 1.5 x 10^{39} erg/s for x1 andx2, respectively). their x-ray spectra were dominated by power-laws with photonindices gamma ~ 1.8 and gamma ~ 1.2, respectively. thus, their spectra weresimilar to those at their outburst peaks. both sources have been seen to varyby a factor of 20 in luminosity over the years, but their spectra are alwaysdominated by a hard power-law; unlike most stellar-mass bhs, they have neverbeen found in a canonical high/soft state dominated by a standard disk. thelack of a canonical high/soft state seems to be a common feature of ulxs. wespeculate that the different kind of donor star and/or a persistentlysuper-eddington accretion rate during their outbursts may prevent accretionflows in ulxs from settling into steady standard disks.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0904.0649	quasar feedback: more bang for your buck	we propose a two-stage model for the effects of feedback from a bright quasaron the cold gas in a galaxy. it is difficult for feedback from near theaccretion disk to directly impact dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. but if suchfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ism (a relatively'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, acombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectivelyexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. such expansiondramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material andmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorptionof the incident quasar radiation field. even a moderate effect of this naturecan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionizedand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. since the amount ofmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field ismore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has beenaltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate amoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order ofmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.instead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initialfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of theluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, thismechanism could be efficient. this amounts to hot gas outflow rates from nearthe accretion disk of only 5-10% of the bh accretion rate.

0904.3875	active galactic nuclei and their role in galaxy formation and evolution	there are several key open questions as to the nature and origin of agnincluding: 1) what initiates the active phase, 2) the duration of the activephase, and 3) the effect of the agn on the host galaxy. critical new insightsto these can be achieved by probing the central regions of agn with sub-masangular resolution at uv/optical wavelengths. in particular, such observationswould enable us to constrain the energetics of the agn "feedback" mechanism,which is critical for understanding the role of agn in galaxy formation andevolution. these observations can only be obtained by long-baselineinterferometers or sparse aperture telescopes in space, since the aperturediameters required are in excess of 500 m - a regime in which monolithic orsegmented designs are not and will not be feasible and because theseobservations require the detection of faint emission near the bright unresolvedcontinuum source, which is impossible from the ground, even with adaptiveoptics. two mission concepts which could provide these invaluable observationsare nasa's stellar imager (si; carpenter et al. 2008 &amp;http://hires.gsfc.nasa.gov/si/) interferometer and esa's luciola (labeyrie2008) sparse aperture hypertelescope.

0905.1123	observational limits on type 1 agn accretion rate in cosmos	we present black hole masses and accretion rates for 182 type 1 agn incosmos. we estimate masses using the scaling relations for the broad hb, mgii,and civ emission lines in the redshift ranges 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.88, 1&lt;z&lt;2.4, and2.7&lt;z&lt;4.9. we estimate the accretion rate using an eddington ratio l_i/l_eddestimated from optical and x-ray data. we find that very few type 1 agn accretebelow l_i/l_edd ~ 0.01, despite simulations of synthetic spectra which showthat the survey is sensitive to such type 1 agn. at lower accretion rates theblr may become obscured, diluted or nonexistent. we find evidence that type 1agn at higher accretion rates have higher optical luminosities, as more oftheir emission comes from the cool (optical) accretion disk with respect toshorter wavelengths. we measure a larger range in accretion rate than previousworks, suggesting that cosmos is more efficient at finding low accretion ratetype 1 agn. however the measured range in accretion rate is still comparable tothe intrinsic scatter from the scaling relations, suggesting that type 1 agnaccrete at a narrow range of eddington ratio, with l_i/l_edd ~ 0.1.

0907.5199	massive galaxies in cosmos: evolution of black hole versus bulge mass  but not versus total stellar mass over the last 9 gyrs?	we constrain the ratio of black hole (bh) mass to total stellar mass oftype-1 agn in the cosmos survey at 1&lt;z&lt;2. for 10 agn at mean redshift z~1.4with both hst/acs and hst/nicmos imaging data we are able to compute totalstellar mass m_(*,total), based on restframe uv-to-optical host galaxy colorswhich constrain mass-to-light ratios. all objects have virial bh mass-estimatesavailable from the cosmos magellan/imacs and zcosmos surveys. we find zerodifference between the m_bh--m_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation in the local universe.  our interpretation is: (a) if our objects were purely bulge-dominated, them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. however, (b) since wehave evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies(logm_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logm_bh~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. since allnecessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation oraddition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. merging, inaddition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both bh andstellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final m_bh/m_(*,bulge)ratio.  since the overall cosmic stellar and bh mass buildup trace each other tightlyover time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independentof any strong bh-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling bh and bulgemass until the present is very indirect.

0910.2672	the nature of optically dull active galactic nuclei in cosmos	we present infrared, optical, and x-ray data of 48 x-ray bright, opticallydull agns in the cosmos field. these objects exhibit the x-ray luminosity of anactive galactic nucleus (agn) but lack broad and narrow emission lines in theiroptical spectrum. we show that despite the lack of optical emission lines, mostof these optically dull agns are not well-described by a typical passive redgalaxy spectrum: instead they exhibit weak but significant blue emission likean unobscured agn. photometric observations over several years additionallyshow significant variability in the blue emission of four optically dull agns.the nature of the blue and infrared emission suggest that the opticallyinactive appearance of these agns cannot be caused by obscuration intrinsic tothe agns. instead, up to ~70% of optically dull agns are diluted by theirhosts, with bright or simply edge-on hosts lying preferentially within thespectroscopic aperture. the remaining ~30% of optically dull agns haveanomalously high f_x/f_o ratios and are intrinsically weak, not obscured, inthe optical. these optically dull agns are best described as a weakly accretingagn with a truncated accretion disk from a radiatively inefficient accretionflow.

0910.3691	agn feedback: does it work?	while feedback is important in theoretical models, we do not really know ifit works in reality. feedback from jets appears to be sufficient to keep thecooling flows in clusters from cooling too much and it may be sufficient toregulate black hole growth in dominant cluster galaxies. only about 10% of allquasars, however, have powerful radio jets, so jet-related feedback cannot begeneric. the outflows could potentially be a more common form of agn feedback,but measuring mass and energy outflow rates is a challenging task, the mainunknown being the location and geometry of the absorbing medium. using a noveltechnique, we made first such measurement in ngc 4051 using xmm data and foundthe mass and energy outflow rates to be 4 to 5 orders of magnitude below thoserequired for efficient feedback. to test whether the outflow velocity in ngc4051 is unusually low, we compared the ratio of outflow velocity to escapevelocity in a sample of agns and found it to be generally less than one. it isthus possible that in most seyferts the feedback is not sufficient and may notbe necessary.

0911.1355	the quasar mass-luminosity plane i: a sub-eddington limit for quasars	we use 62185 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 sampleto explore the relationship between black hole mass and luminosity. black holemasses were estimated based on the widths of their h{\beta}, mgii and civ linesand adjacent continuum luminosities using standard virial mass estimate scalinglaws. we find that, over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 4.0, the most luminous low-massquasars are at their eddington luminosity, but the most luminous high-massquasars in each redshift bin fall short of their eddington luminosities, withthe shortfall of the order of 10 or more at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6. we examine severalpotential sources of measurement uncertainty or bias and show that none of themcan account for this effect. we also show the statistical uncertainty in virialmass estimation to have an upper bound of ~0.15 dex, smaller than the 0.4 dexpreviously reported. we also examine the highest mass quasars in every redshiftbin in an effort to learn more about quasars that are about to cease theirluminous accretion. we conclude that the quasar mass-luminosity locus containsa number of new puzzles that must be explained theoretically.

0912.0734	the quasar mass-luminosity plane iii: smaller errors on virial mass  estimates	we use 62185 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr5 sample toexplore the quasar mass-luminosity plane view of virial mass estimation.previous work shows deviations of ~0.4 dex between virial and reverberationmasses. the decline in quasar number density for the highest eddington ratioquasars at each redshift provides an upper bound of between 0.13 and 0.29 dexfor virial mass estimate statistical uncertainties. across different redshiftbins, the maximum possible mgii mass uncertainties average 0.15 dex, whileh{\beta} uncertainties average 0.21 dex and civ uncertainties average 0.27 dex.any physical spread near the high-eddington-ratio boundary will produce a morerestrictive bound. a comparison of the sub-eddington boundary slope usingh{\beta} and mgii masses finds better agreement with uncorrected mgii massesthan with recently proposed corrections. the best agreement for these brightobjects is produced by a multiplicative correction by a factor of 1.19, smallerthan the factor of 1.8 previously reported as producing the best agreement forthe entire sdss sample.

0912.3545	infrared diagnostics for the extended 12 micron sample of seyferts	we present an analysis of spitzer irs spectroscopy of 83 active galaxies fromthe extended 12 micron sample. we find rank correlations between severaltracers of star formation which suggest that (1) the pah feature is a reliabletracer of star formation, (2) there is a significant contribution to theheating of the cool dust by stars, (3) the h$_2$ emission is also primarilyexcited by star formation. the 55-90 vs. 20-30 spectral index plot is also adiagnostic of the relative contribution of starburst to agn. we see there is alarge change in spectral index across the sample. thus, the contribution to their spectrum from the agn and starburst components can be comparable inmagnitude but the relative contribution also varies widely across the sample.we find rank correlations between several agn tracers. we search forcorrelations between agn and starburst tracers and we conclude that the agn andstarburst tracers are not correlated. this is consistent with our conclusionthat the relative strength of the agn and starburst components varies widelyacross the sample. thus, there is no simple link between agn fueling and blackhole growth and star formation in these galaxies. the distribution of sil 10micron and 18 micron strengths is consistent with the clumpy torus models ofsirocky et al. we find a rank correlation between the [nev] 14 micron line andthe 6.7 micron continuum which may be due to an extended component of hot dust.the sy 2s with a hidden broad line region (hblr) have a higher ratio of agn tostarburst contribution to the sed than sy 2s without an hblr. this maycontribute to the detection of the hblr in polarized light. the sy 2s with anhblr are more similar to the sy 1s than they are to the sy 2s without an hblr.

1001.0356	suzaku monitoring of the iron k emission line in the type 1 agn ngc 5548	we present 7 sequential weekly observations of ngc 5548 conducted in 2007with the \textit{suzaku} x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) in the 0.2-12 kevband and hard x-ray detector (hxd) in 10-600 kev band. the iron k$\alpha$ lineis well detected in all seven observations and k$\beta$ line is also detectedin four observations. in this paper, we investigate the origin of the fe klines using both the width of the line and the reverberation mapping method.  with the co-added xis and hxd spectra, we identify fe k$\alpha$ and k$\beta$line at 6.396$_{-0.007}^{+0.009}$ kev and 7.08$_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ kev,respectively. the width of line obtained from the co-added spectra is38$_{-18}^{+16}$ ev ($\textrm{fwhm}=4200_{-2000}^{+1800}$ km/s) whichcorresponds to a radius of 20$_{-10}^{+50}$ light days, for the virialproduction of $1.220\times10^7$ m$_{\odot}$ in ncg 5548.  to quantitatively investigate the origin of the narrow fe line by thereverberation mapping method, we compare the observed light curves of fek$\alpha$ line with the predicted ones, which are obtained by convolving thecontinuum light curve with the transfer functions in a thin shell and aninclined disk. the best-fit result is given by the disk case with $i=30^\circ$which is better than a fit to a constant flux of the fe k line at the 92.7%level (f-test). we find that the emitting radius obtained from the light curveis 25-37 light days, which is consistent with the radius derived from the fe kline width. combining the results of the line width and variation, the mostlikely site for the origin of the narrow iron lines is 20-40 light days awayfrom the central engine, though other possibilities are not completely ruledout.

1009.3276	hot-dust-poor type 1 active galactic nuclei in the cosmos survey	we report a sizable class of type 1 active galactic nuclei (agns) withunusually weak near-infrared (1-3{\mu}m) emission in the xmm-cosmos type 1 agnsample. the fraction of these "hot-dust-poor" agns increases with redshift from6% at lowredshift (z &lt; 2) to 20% at moderate high redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5). thereis no clear trend of the fraction with other parameters: bolometric luminosity,eddington ratio, black hole mass, and x-ray luminosity. the 3{\mu}m emissionrelative to the 1{\mu}m emission is a factor of 2-4 smaller than the typicalelvis et al. agn spectral energy distribution (sed), which indicates a "torus"covering factor of 2%-29%, a factor of 3-40 smaller than required by unifiedmodels. the weak hot dust emission seems to expose an extension of theaccretion disk continuum in some of the source seds. we estimate the outer edgeof their accretion disks to lie at $(0.3-2.0) /times 10^4$ schwarzschild radii,~10-23 times the gravitational stability radii. formation scenarios for thesesources are discussed.

1011.0429	hot-dust-poor quasars in mid-infrared and optically selected samples	we show that the hot-dust-poor (hdp) quasars, originally found in the x-rayselected xmm-cosmos type 1 agn sample, are just as common in two samplesselected at optical/infrared wavelengths: the richards et al. spitzer/sdsssample ($8.7%\pm2.2%$), and the pg-quasar dominated sample of elvis et al.($9.5%\pm 5.0%$). the properties of the hdp quasars in these two samples areconsistent with the xmm-cosmos sample, except that, at the $99% (\sim2.5\sigma)$ significance, a larger proportion of the hdp quasars in thespitzer/sdss sample have weak host galaxy contributions, probably due to theselection criteria used. either the host-dust is destroyed (dynamically or byradiation), or is offset from the central black hole due to recoiling.alternatively, the universality of hdp quasars in samples with differentselection methods and the continuous distribution of dust covering factor intype 1 agns, suggest that the range of seds could be related to the range oftilts in warped fueling disks, as in the model of lawrence and elvis (2010),with hdp quasars having relatively small warps.

1101.3342	the near-infrared broad emission line region of active galactic nuclei.  ii. the one-micron continuum	we use quasi-simultaneous near-infrared (near-ir) and optical spectroscopyfrom four observing runs to study the continuum around 1 micron in 23well-known broad-emission line active galactic nuclei (agn). we show that,after correcting the optical spectra for host galaxy light, the agn continuumaround this wavelength can be approximated by the sum of mainly two emissioncomponents, a hot dust blackbody and an accretion disc. the accretion discspectrum appears to dominate the flux at ~1 micron, which allows us to derive arelation for estimating agn black hole masses based on the near-ir virialproduct. this result also means that a near-ir reverberation programme candetermine the agn state independent of simultaneous optical spectroscopy. onaverage we derive hot dust blackbody temperatures of ~1400 k, a value close tothe sublimation temperature of silicate dust grains, and relatively low hotdust covering factors of ~7%. our preliminary variability studies indicate thatin most sources the hot dust emission responds to changes in the accretion discflux with the expected time lag, however, a few sources show a behaviour thatcan be attributed to dust destruction.

1102.4621	spectropolarimetric evidence for radiatively inefficient accretion in an  optically dull active galaxy	we present subaru/focas spectropolarimetry of two active galaxies in thecosmic evolution survey. these objects were selected to be optically dull, withthe bright x-ray emission of an agn but missing optical emission lines in ourprevious spectroscopy. our new observations show that one target has very weakemission lines consistent with an optically dull agn, while the other objecthas strong emission lines typical of a host-diluted type 2 seyfert galaxy. inneither source do we observe polarized emission lines, with 3-sigma upperlimits of p_blr &lt; 2%. this means that the missing broad emission lines (andweaker narrow emission lines) are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration,e.g., by the canonical agn torus. the weak-lined optically dull agn exhibits ablue polarized continuum with p = 0.78 +/- 0.07% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 7200a (p = 1.37 +/- 0.16% at 4400 a &lt; lambda_rest &lt; 5050 a). the wavelengthdependence of this polarized flux is similar to that of an unobscured agncontinuum and represents the intrinsic agn emission, either as synchrotronemission or the outer part of an accretion disk reflected by a clumpy dustscatterer. because this intrinsic agn emission lacks emission lines, thissource is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

1103.1912	a deep chandra acis study of ngc 4151. ii. the innermost emission line  region and strong evidence for radio jet-nlr cloud collision	we have studied the x-ray emission within the inner 150 pc radius of ngc 4151by constructing high spatial resolution emission line images of ovii, oviii,and neix. these maps show extended structures that are spatially correlatedwith the radio outflow and optical [oiii] emission. we find strong evidence forjet--gas cloud interaction, including morphological correspondences withregions of x-ray enhancement, peaks of near-infrared [feii] emission, andoptical clouds. in these regions, moreover, we find evidence of elevatedneix/ovii ratios; the x-ray emission of these regions also exceeds thatexpected from nuclear photoionization. spectral fitting reveals the presence ofa collisionally ionized component. the thermal energy of the hot gas suggeststhat &gt;0.1% of the estimated jet power is deposited into the host interstellarmedium through interaction between the radio jet and the dense medium of thecircum-nuclear region. we find possible pressure equilibrium between thecollisionally ionized hot gas and the photoionized line-emitting cool clouds.we also obtain constraints on the extended iron and silicon fluorescentemission. both lines are spatially unresolved. the upper limit on thecontribution of an extended emission region to the fe kalpha emission is &lt;5% ofthe total, in disagreement with a previous claim that 65% of the fe kalphaemission originates in the extended narrow line region.

1103.1913	a deep chandra acis study of ngc 4151. iii. the line emission and  spectral analysis of the ionization cone	this paper is the third in a series in which we present deep chandra acis-simaging spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151, devoted to study itscomplex circum-nuclear x-ray emission. emission features in the soft x-rayspectrum of the bright extended emission (l[0.3-2kev]~10^40 erg/s) at r&gt;130 pc(2") are consistent with the brighter ovii, oviii, and neix lines seen in thechandra hetgs and xmm-newton rgs spectra below 2 kev. we construct emissionline images of these features and find good morphological correlations with thenarrow line region clouds mapped in [oiii]5007a. self-consistentphotoionization models provide good descriptions of the spectra of the largescale emission, as well as resolved structures, supporting the dominant role ofnuclear photoionization, although displacement of optical and x-ray featuresimplies a more complex medium. collisionally ionized emission is estimated tobe &lt;12% of the extended emission. presence of both low and high ionizationspectral components and extended emission in the x-ray image perpendicular tothe bicone indicates leakage of nuclear ionization, likely filtered throughwarm absorbers, instead of being blocked by a continuous obscuring torus. theratios of [oiii]/soft x-ray flux are approximately constant (~15) for the 1.5kpc radius spanned by these measurements, indicating a relatively constantionization parameter, consistent with the photoionized outflow of a wind-likedensity profile. using spatially resolved features, we estimate that the massoutflow rate in ngc 4151 is ~2msun/yr at 130 pc and the kinematic power of theionized outflow is 1.7x10^41 erg/s, approximately 0.3% of the bolometricluminosity of ngc 4151.

1103.2152	the near-infrared radius-luminosity relationship for active galactic  nuclei	black hole masses for samples of active galactic nuclei (agn) are currentlyestimated from single-epoch optical spectra. in particular, the size of thebroad-line emitting region needed to compute the black hole mass is derivedfrom the optical or ultraviolet continuum luminosity. here we consider therelationship between the broad-line region size, r, and the near-infrared(near-ir) agn continuum luminosity, l, as the near-ir continuum suffers lessdust extinction than at shorter wavelengths and the prospects for separatingthe agn continuum from host-galaxy starlight are better in the near-ir than inthe optical. for a relationship of the form r propto l^alpha, we obtain for asample of 14 reverberation-mapped agn a best-fit slope of alpha=0.5+/-0.1,which is consistent with the slope of the relationship in the optical band andwith the value of 0.5 naively expected from photoionisation theory. black holemasses can then be estimated from the near-ir virial product, which iscalculated using the strong and unblended paschen broad emission lines (paalpha or pa beta).

1103.5369	extrasolar asteroid mining as forensic evidence for extraterrestrial  intelligence	the development of civilisations like ours into spacefaring, multi-planetentities requires significant raw materials to construct vehicles and habitats.interplanetary debris, including asteroids and comets, may provide such asource of raw materials. in this article we present the hypothesis thatextraterrestrial intelligences (etis) engaged in asteroid mining may bedetectable from earth. considering the detected disc of debris around vega as atemplate, we explore the observational signatures of targeted asteroid mining(tam), such as unexplained deficits in chemical species, changes in the sizedistribution of debris and other thermal signatures which may be detectable inthe spectral energy distribution (sed) of a debris disc. we find thatindividual observational signatures of asteroid mining can be explained bynatural phenomena, and as such they cannot provide conclusive detections ofetis. but, it may be the case that several signatures appearing in the samesystem will prove harder to model without extraterrestrial involvement.therefore signatures of tam are not detections of eti in their own right, butas part of "piggy-back" studies carried out in tandem with conventional debrisdisc research, they could provide a means of identifying unusual candidatesystems for further study using other seti techniques.

1105.4152	ultra-low delta-v objects and the human exploration of asteroids	missions to near-earth objects (neos) are key destinations in nasa's new"flexible path" approach. neos are also of interest for science, for thehazards they pose, and for their resources. we emphasize the importance ofultra-low delta-v from leo to neo rendezvous as a target selection criterion,as this choice can greatly increase the payload to the neo. few such ultra-lowdelta-v neos are currently known; only 65 of the 6699 known neos (march2010)have delta-v &lt;4.5 km/s, 2/3 of typical leo-neo delta-v. even these are smalland hard to recover. other criteria - short transit times, long launch windows,a robust abort capability, and a safe environment for proximity operations -will further limit the list of accessible objects. potentially there are atleast an order of magnitude more ultra-low delta v neos but, to find them allon a short enough timescale (before 2025) requires a dedicated survey in theoptical or mid-ir, optimally from a venus-like orbit because of the shortsynodic period for neos in that orbit, plus long arc determination of theirorbits.

1108.5181	a spitzer-mips search for dust in compact high-velocity hi clouds	we employ three-band spitzer-mips observations to search for cold dustemission in three neutral hydrogen compact high-velocity clouds (chvcs) in thevicinity of the milky way. far-infrared emission correlated with hi columndensity was previously reported in hvc complex c, indicating that this objectcontains dust heated by the galactic radiation field at its distance of ~10kpc.assuming published spitzer, iras, and planck ir-hi correlations for complex c,our spitzer observations are of sufficient depth to directly detect 160um dustemission in the chvcs if it is present at the same level as in complex c, butno emission is detected in any of the targets. for one of the targets (chvc289)which has well-localized hi clumps, we therefore conclude that it isfundamentally different from complex c, with either a lower dust-to-gas ratioor a greater distance from the galactic disk (and consequently cooler dusttemperature). firm conclusions cannot be drawn for the other twospitzer-observed chvcs since their small-scale hi structures are notsufficiently well known; nonetheless, no extended dust emission is apparentdespite their relatively high hi column densities. the lack of dust emission inchvc289 suggests that at least some compact high-velocity clouds objects mayexhibit very low dust-to-gas ratios and/or greater galactocentric distancesthan large hvc complexes.

1109.4651	ngc 5548: lack of a broad fe k line and constraints on the location of  the hard x-ray source	we present an analysis of the co-added and individual 0.7-40 kev spectra fromseven suzaku observations of the sy 1.5 galaxy ngc 5548 taken over a period ofeight weeks. we conclude that the source has a moderately ionized, three-zonewarm absorber, a power-law continuum, and exhibits contributions from cold,distant reflection. relativistic reflection signatures are not significantlydetected in the co-added data, and we place an upper limit on the equivalentwidth of a relativistically broad fe k line at ew \leq 26 ev at 90% confidence.thus ngc 5548 can be labeled an "weak" type-1 agn in terms of its observedinner disk reflection signatures, in contrast to sources with very broad,strong iron lines such as mcg-6-30-15, which are likely much fewer in number.we compare physical properties of ngc 5548 and mcg-6-30-15 that might explainthis difference in their reflection properties. though there is some evidencethat ngc 5548 may harbor a truncated inner accretion disk, this evidence isinconclusive, so we also consider light bending of the hard x-ray continuumemission in order to explain the lack of relativistic reflection in ourobservation. if the absence of a broad fe k line is interpreted in thelight-bending context, we conclude that the source of the hard x-ray continuumlies at &lt;100 gravitational radii. we note, however, that light-bending modelsmust be expanded to include a broader range of physical parameter space inorder to adequately explain the spectral and timing properties of average agn,rather than just those with strong, broad iron lines.

1201.5435	the influence of soft spectral components on the structure and stability  of warm absorbers in agn	the radiation from the central regions of active galactic nuclei, includingthat from the accretion disk surrounding the black hole, is likely to peak inthe extreme ultraviolet $\sim 13 -100$ ev. however, due to galactic absorption,we are limited to constrain the physical properties, i.e. the black hole massand the accretion rate, from what observations we have below $\sim 10$ ev orabove $\sim 100$ ev. in this paper we predict the thermal and ionization statesof warm absorbers as a function of the shape of the unobservable continuum. inparticular we model an accretion disk at $kt_{in} \sim 10$ ev and a {\it softexcess} at $kt_{se} \sim 150$ ev. the warm absorber, which is the highlyionized gas along the line of sight to the continuum, shows signatures in the$\sim 0.3 - 2$ kev energy range consisting of numerous absorption lines andedges of various ions, some of the prominent ones being h- and he-like oxygen,neon, magnesium and silicon. we find that the properties of the warm absorberare significantly influenced by the changes in the temperature of the accretiondisk, as well as by the strength of the {\it soft excess}, as they affect theoptical depth particularly for iron and oxygen. these trends may help develop amethod of characterising the shape of the unobservable continuum and theoccurrence of warm absorbers.

1203.1279	cheers results on mrk 573: study of deep chandra observations	we present results on mrk 573 obtained as part of the chandra survey ofextended emission-line regions in nearby seyfert galaxies (cheers). previousstudies showed that this source features a biconical emission in the soft x-rayband closely related with the narrow line region as mapped by the [o iii]emission line and the radio emission, though on a smaller scale; we investigatethe properties of soft x-ray emission from this source with new deep chandraobservations. making use of the subpixel resolution of the chandra/acis imageand psf-deconvolution, we resolve and study substructures in each ionizingcone. the two cone spectra are fitted with photoionization model, showing amildly photoionized phase diffused over the bicone. thermal collisional gas atabout ~ 1.1 kev and ~ 0.8 kev appears to be located between the nucleus and the"knots" resolved in radio observations, and between the "arcs" resolved in theoptical images, respectively; this can be interpreted in terms of shockinteraction with the host galactic plane. the nucleus shows a significant fluxdecrease across the observations indicating variability of the agn, with thenuclear region featuring higher ionization parameter with respect to the biconeregion. the long exposure allows us to find extended emission up to ~ 7 kpcfrom the nucleus along the bicone axis. significant emission is also detectedin the direction perpendicular to the ionizing cones, disagreeing with thefully obscuring torus prescribed in the agn unified model, and suggestinginstead the presence of a clumpy structure.

1205.6202	constraints on the nature of cid-42: recoil kick or supermassive black  hole pair?	the galaxy cxoc j100043.1+020637, also known as cid-42, is a highly unusualobject. an apparent galaxy merger remnant, it displays signatures of both aninspiraling, kiloparsec-scale active galactic nucleus (agn) pair and of arecoiling agn with a kick velocity &gt; 1300 km s^-1. among recoiling agncandidates, cid-42 alone has both spatial offsets (in optical and x-ray bands)and spectroscopic offsets. in order to constrain the relative likelihood ofboth scenarios, we develop models using hydrodynamic galaxy merger simulationscoupled with radiative transfer calculations. our gas-rich, major merger modelsare generally well matched to the galactic morphology and to the inferredstellar mass and star formation rate. we show that a recoiling supermassiveblack hole (smbh) in cid-42 should be observable as an agn at the time ofobservation. however, in order for the recoiling agn to produce narrow-lineemission, it must be observed shortly after the kick while it still inhabits adense gaseous region, implying a large total kick velocity (v_k &gt; 2000 kms^-1). for the dual agn scenario, an unusually large broad-line offset isrequired, and the best match to the observed morphology requires a galaxy thatis less luminous than cid-42. further, the lack of x-ray emission from one ofthe two optical nuclei is not easily attributed to an intrinsically quiescentsmbh or to a compton-thick galactic environment. while the current data do notallow either the recoiling or the dual agn scenario for cid-42 to be excluded,our models highlight the most relevant parameters for distinguishing thesepossibilities with future observations. in particular, high-quality,spatially-resolved spectra that can pinpoint the origin of the broad and narrowline features will be critical for determining the nature of this uniquesource.

1207.2154	evolution of the quasar luminosity function over 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 in the cosmos  survey field	we investigate the high-redshift quasar luminosity function (qlf) down to anapparent magnitude of i(ab) = 25 in the cosmic evolution survey (cosmos).careful analysis of the extensive cosmos photometry and imaging data allows usto identify and remove stellar and low-redshift contaminants, enabling aselection that is nearly complete for type-1 quasars at the redshifts ofinterest. we find 155 likely quasars at z &gt; 3.1, 39 of which have priorspectroscopic confirmation. we present our sample in detail and use theseconfirmed and likely quasars to compute the rest-frame uv qlf in the redshiftbins 3.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 and 3.5 &lt; z &lt; 5. the space density of faint quasarsdecreases by roughly a factor of four from z \sim 3.2 to z \sim 4, withfaint-end slopes of {\beta} \sim -1.7 at both redshifts. the decline in spacedensity of faint optical quasars at z &gt; 3 is similar to what has been found formore luminous optical and x-ray quasars. we compare the rest-frame uvluminosity functions found here with the x-ray luminosity function at z &gt; 3,and find that they evolve similarly between z \sim 3.2 and z \sim 4; however,the different normalizations imply that roughly 75% of x-ray bright activegalactic nuclei (agn) at z \sim 3 - 4 are optically obscured. this fraction ishigher than found at lower redshift and may imply that the obscured, type-2fraction continues to increase with redshift at least to z \sim 4. finally, theimplications of the results derived here for the contribution of quasars tocosmic reionization are discussed.

1207.6107	the chandra hrc view of the sub-arcsecond structures in the nuclear  region of ngc 1068	we have obtained a high spatial resolution x-ray image of the nucleus of ngc1068 using the high resolution camera (hrc-i) on board the chandra x-rayobservatory, which provides an unprecedented view of the innermost 1 arcsecondradius region of this galaxy. the hrc image resolves the narrow line regioninto x-ray emission clumps matching bright emission-line clouds in the hst[oiii]5007 images and allows comparison with sub-arcsecond scale radio jet forthe first time. two distinct x-ray knots are revealed at 1.3-1.4 arcsecondnortheast and southwest of the nucleus. based on the combined x-ray, [oiii],and radio continuum morphology, we identify the locations of intense radiojet-cloud interaction. the [oiii] to soft x-ray ratios show that some of theseclouds are strongly affected by shock heating, whereas in other locations thejet simply thrusts through with no signs of strong interaction. this is furtherstrengthened by the presence of a kt~1 kev collisionally ionized component inthe acis spectrum of a shock heated cloud (hst-g). we estimate that thekinematic luminosity of the jet-driven shocks is 6x10^{38} erg/s, a negligiblefraction (10^{-4}) of the estimated total jet power.

(1994, hereafter e94) quasar sed with variouscontributions from galaxy emission and some dust reddening is remarkablyeffective in describing the sed shape from 0.3-3\mu m for large ranges ofredshift, luminosity, black hole mass and eddington ratio of type 1 agn. inparticular, the location in the mixing diagram of the highest luminosity agn isvery close (within 1\sigma) to that of the e94 sed. the mixing diagram can alsobe used to estimate the host galaxy fraction and reddening in quasar. we alsoshow examples of some outliers which might be agn in different evolutionarystages compared to the majority of agn in the quasar-host galaxy co-evolutioncycle.

1211.3208	a transition mass for black holes to show broad emission lines	although the super-massive (agn) and stellar mass (xrbs) black holes havemany properties in common, the broad emission lines (bels) are exclusivelysignatures of the agn. based on the detection of these lines from sdss databases, there seems to be no agn with mass m_bh \lesssim 10^5 m_sun. in thispaper we investigate if such low mass black holes are really non-existent orthey are undetected because the bels in them are not produced efficiently.using the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a wide range of black holemass, 10 - 10^9 m_sun, spanning xrbs to agn, we calculate the equivalent widths(ews) of ultraviolet and optical lines ly\alpha 1216 \aa, h\beta 4861 \aa, civ1549 \aa and mgii 2798 \aa. the loc (locally optimally emitting cloud) modelhas been used to describe the broad emission line region (belr) for thecalculations. we find that the hardening of the sed shape with decreasing massdo not decrease the bel ews. however, finite size of the belr, as measured bythe line widths, which is controlled by the mass of the black hole, regulatesthe production of these emission lines. there seems to be a peak in the ews ofthe emission lines for typical agn black holes of ~ 10^8 m_sun, below which thelines become intrinsically fainter with a sharp fall-off below ~ 10^6 m_sun.this may be the cause of the absence of low mass agn in sdss.

1312.4450	how many ore-bearing asteroids?	a simple formalism is presented to assess how many asteroids contain ore,i.e. commercially profitable material, and not merely a high concentration of aresource. i apply this formalism to two resource cases: platinum group metals(pgms) and water. assuming for now that only ni-fe asteroids are of interestfor pgms, then 1% of neos are rich in pgms. the dearth of ultra-low delta-v(&lt;4.5 km s-1) neos larger than 100 m diameter reduces the ore-bearing fractionto only ~1 in 2000 neos. as 100 m diameter neos are needed to have a value &gt;=us$1 b and the population of near-earth objects (neos) larger than 100 mdiameter is ~20,000 (mainzer et al. 2011) the total population of pgmore-bearing neos is roughly 10. i stress that this is a conservative and highlyuncertain value. for example, an order of magnitude increase in pgm ore-bearingneos occurs if delta-v can as large as 5.7 km s-1. water ore for utilization inspace is likely to be found in ~1/1100 neos. neos as small as 18 m diameter canbe water-ore-bodies because of the high richness of water (~20%) expected in~25% of carbonaceous asteroids, bringing the number of water-ore-bearing neosto ~9000 out of the 10 million neos of this size. these small neos are,however, hard to find with present surveys. there will be ~18 water-ore-bearingneos &gt;100 m diameter. these estimates are at present highly imprecise andsensitive to small changes, especially in the maximum delta-v allowed.nonetheless the low values found here mean that much improved determinations ofeach of the terms of the formalism are urgently needed. if better estimatesstill find small numbers of ore-bearing neos then thorough surveys for neadiscovery and, especially, characterization are needed. strategies for the twoclasses are likely to be different.

1312.4452	how many assay probes to find one ore-bearing asteroid?	the number of ore-bearing asteroids could well be small and remote telescopictechniques are inadequate to identify such asteroids confidently. finding anasteroid that can be profitably mined requires proximate observations fromassay probes. here we use a simple statistical approach to estimate the numberof assay probes, nassay, needed to find at least one ore-bearing asteroid at ahigh confidence (90%, 95%, 99%). we present results for a wide range of valuesof the probability of an asteroid being rich in the resource of interest,prich. we find that nassay depends strongly on prich, for likely values ofprich (&lt;0.5). for a plausible value of prich~0.1 then to obtain 90% confidencethat at least one ore-bearing asteroid is found, nassay = 22, and for 99%confidence nassay = 44. a factor two increase in prich roughly halves nassay,while even for prich~0.5, nassay (90%) = 4. hence any improvement in asteroidcharacterization prior to sending probes to its proximity would be an effectiveway to cost-effectively search for valuable resources among the asteroids. somepossibilities for doing so are briefly discussed.

1401.1040	constraints on the outer radius of the broad emission line region of  active galactic nuclei	here we present observational evidence that the broad emission line region(belr) of active galactic nuclei (agn) generally has an outer boundary. thiswas already clear for sources with an obvious transition between the broad andnarrow components of their emission lines. we show that the narrow component ofthe higher-order paschen lines is absent in all sources, revealing a broademission line profile with a broad, flat top. this indicates that the belr iskinematically separate from the narrow emission line region. we use the virialtheorem to estimate the belr outer radius from the flat top width of theunblended profiles of the strongest paschen lines, pa alpha and pa beta, andfind that it scales with the ionising continuum luminosity roughly as expectedfrom photoionisation theory. the value of the incident continuum photon fluxresulting from this relationship corresponds to that required for dustsublimation. a flat-topped broad emission line profile is produced by both aspherical gas distribution in orbital motion as well as an accretion disc windif the ratio between the belr outer and inner radius is assumed to be less than~100 - 200. on the other hand, a pure keplerian disc can be largely excluded,since for most orientations and radial extents of the disc the emission lineprofile is double-horned.

1408.1090	inter-comparison of radio-loudness criteria for type 1 agns in the  xmm-cosmos survey	limited studies have been performed on the radio-loud fraction in x-rayselected type 1 agn samples. the consistency between various radio-loudnessdefinitions also needs to be checked. we measure the radio-loudness of the 407type 1 agns in the xmm-cosmos quasar sample using nine criteria from theliterature (six defined in the rest-frame and three defined in the observedframe): $r_l=\log(l_{5ghz}/l_b)$, $q_{24}=\log(l_{24\mu m}/l_{1.4ghz})$,$r_{uv}=\log(l_{5ghz}/l_{2500\aa})$, $r_{i}=\log(l_{1.4ghz}/l_i)$,$r_x=\log(\nu l_{\nu}(5ghz)/l_x)$, $p_{5ghz}=\log(p_{5ghz}(w/hz/sr))$,$r_{l,obs}=\log(f_{1.4ghz}/f_b)$ (observed frame),$r_{i,obs}=\log(f_{1.4ghz}/f_i)$ (observed frame), and $q_{24,obs}=\log(f_{24\mu m}/f_{1.4ghz})$ (observed frame). using any single criteriondefined in the rest-frame, we find a low radio-loud fraction of $\lesssim 5\%$in the xmm-cosmos type 1 agn sample, except for $r_{uv}$. requiring that anytwo criteria agree reduces the radio-loud fraction to $\lesssim 2\%$ for about3/4 of the cases. the low radio-loud fraction cannot be simply explained by thecontribution of the host galaxy luminosity and reddening. the$p_{5ghz}=\log(p_{5ghz}(w/hz/sr))$ gives the smallest radio-loud fraction. twoof the three radio-loud fractions from the criteria defined in the observedframe without k-correction ($r_{l,obs}$ and $r_{i,obs}$) are much larger thanthe radio-loud fractions from other criteria.

1412.0004	new insights from deep vla data on the potentially recoiling black hole  cid-42 in the cosmos field	we present deep 3 ghz vla observations of the potentially recoiling blackhole cid-42 in the cosmos field. this galaxy shows two optical nuclei in thehst/acs image and a large velocity offset of ~ 1300 km/s between the broad andnarrow h beta emission line although the spectrum is not spacially resolved(civano et al. 2010). the new 3 ghz vla data has a bandwidth of 2 ghz and tocorrectly interpret the flux densities imaging was done with two differentmethods: multi-scale multi-frequency synthesis and spectral windows stacking.the final resolutions and sensitivities of these maps are 0.7" with rms = 4.6mujy/beam and 0.9" with rms = 4.8 mujy/beam respectively. with a 7 sigmadetection we find that the entire observed 3 ghz radio emission can beassociated with the south-eastern component of cid-42, coincident with thedetected x-ray emission. we use our 3 ghz data combined with other radio datafrom the literature ranging from 320 mhz to 9 ghz, which include the vla, vlbaand gmrt data, to construct a radio synchrotron spectrum of cid-42. the radiospectrum suggests a type i unobscured radio-quiet flat-spectrum agn in thesouth-eastern component which may be surrounded by a more extended region ofold synchrotron electron population or shocks generated by the outflow from thesupermassive black hole. our data are consistent with the recoiling black holepicture but cannot rule out the presence of an obscured and radio-quiet smbh inthe north-western component.

0804.1564	x-ray properties of the gigahertz-peaked and compact steep spectrum  sources	we present {\it chandra} x-ray observatory observations of giga-hertz peakedspectrum (gps) and compact steep spectrum (css) radio sources. the {\itchandra} sample contains 13 quasars and 3 galaxies with measured 2-10 kev x-rayluminosity within $10^{42} - 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. we detect all of thesources, five of which are observed in x-ray for the first time. we study thex-ray spectral properties of the sample. the measured absorption columns in thequasars are different than those in the galaxies in the sense that the quasarsshow no absorption (with limits $\sim 10^{21} \rm cm^{-2}$) while the galaxieshave large absorption columns ($&gt; 10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$) consistent withprevious findings. the median photon index of the sources with high s/n is$\gamma=1.84 \pm0.24$ and it is larger than the typical index of radio loudquasars. the arcsec resolution of {\it chandra} telescope allows us toinvestigate x-ray extended emission, and look for diffuse components and x-rayjets. we found x-ray jets in two quasars (pks 1127-145, b2 0738+32), an x-raycluster surrounding a css quasar (z=1.1, 3c 186), detected a possible binarystructure in 0941-080 galaxy and an extended diffuse emission in galaxy pks b21345+12. we discuss our results in the context of x-ray emission processes andradio source evolution. we conclude that the x-ray emission in these sources ismost likely unrelated to a relativistic jet, while the sources' radio-loudnessmay suggest a high radiative efficiency of the jet power in these sources.

1501.02705	coronal-line forest agn: the best view of the inner edge of the agn  torus?	we introduce coronal-line forest active galactic nuclei (clif agn), agn whichhave a rich spectrum of forbidden high-ionization lines (fhils, e.g. [fevii],[fex] and [nev]), as well as relatively strong narrow ($\sim$300 km s$^{-1}$)h$\alpha$ emission when compared to the other balmer transition lines. we findthat the kinematics of the clif emitting region are similar to those of theforbidden low-ionization emission-line (flil) region. we compare emission linestrengths of both fhils and flils to cloudy photoionization results and findthat the clif emitting region has higher densities (10$^{4.5}$ $&lt;$ n$_h$ $&lt;$10$^{7.5}$ cm$^{-3}$) when compared to the flil emitting region (10$^{3.0}$ $&lt;$n$_h$ $&lt;$ 10$^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$). we use the photoionization results tocalculate the clif regions radial distances (0.04 $&lt;$ r$_{clif}$ $&lt;$ 32.5 pc)and find that they are comparable to the dust grain sublimation distances (0.10$&lt;$ r$_{sub}$ $&lt;$ 4.3 pc). as a result we suggest that the inner torus wall isthe most likely location of the clif region, and the unusual strength of thefhils is due to a specific viewing angle giving a maximal view of the far wallof the torus without the continuum being revealed.

1504.01663	intermediate inclinations of type 2 coronal-line forest agn	coronal-line forest active galactic nuclei (clif agn) are remarkable in thesense that they have a rich spectrum of dozens of coronal emission lines (e.g.[fevii], [fex] and [nev]) in their spectra. rose, elvis &amp; tadhunter (2015)suggest that the inner obscuring torus wall is the most likely location of thecoronal line region in clif agn, and the unusual strength of the forbidden highionization lines is due to a specific agn-torus inclination angle. here we testthis suggestion using mid-ir colours (4.6$\mu$m-22$\mu$m) from the wide-fieldinfrared survey explorer (wise) for the clif agn. we use the fischer et al.(2014) result that showed that as the agn-torus inclination becomes more faceon, the spitzer 5.5$\mu$m to 30$\mu$m colours become bluer. we show that the[w2-w4] colours for the clif agn ($\langle$[w2-w4]$\rangle$ = 5.92$\pm$0.12)are intermediate between sdss type 1 ($\langle$[w2-w4]$\rangle$ =5.22$\pm$0.01) and type 2 agn ($\langle$[w2-w4]$\rangle$ = 6.35$\pm$0.03). thisimplies that the agn-torus inclinations for the clif agn are indeedintermediate, supporting the work of rose, elvis \&amp; tadhunter (2015). theconfirmed relation between clif agn and their viewing angle shows that clif agnmay be useful for our understanding of agn unification.

astro-ph;0104125	high-resolution x-ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy of the complex  intrinsic absorption in ngc 4051 with chandra and hst	we present the results from simultaneous observations of the narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 with the chandra high energy transmission gratingspectrometer and the hst space telescope imaging spectrograph. the x-raygrating spectrum reveals absorption and emission lines from hydrogen-like andhelium-like ions of o, ne, mg and si. we resolve two distinct x-ray absorptionsystems: a high-velocity blueshifted system at -2340+/-130 km/s and alow-velocity blueshifted system at -600+/-130 km/s. in the uv spectrum wedetect strong absorption, mainly from c iv, n v and si iv, that is resolvedinto as many as nine different intrinsic absorption systems with velocitiesbetween -650 km/s and 30 km/s. although the low-velocity x-ray absorption isconsistent in velocity with many of the uv absorption systems, thehigh-velocity x-ray absorption seems to have no uv counterpart. in addition tothe absorption and emission lines, we also observe rapid x-ray variability anda state of low x-ray flux during the last ~15 ks of the observation. ngc 4051has a soft x-ray excess which we fit in both the high and low x-ray fluxstates. the high-resolution x-ray spectrum directly reveals that the softexcess is not composed of narrow emission lines and that it has significantspectral curvature. a power-law model fails to fit it, while a blackbodyproduces a nearly acceptable fit. we compare the observed spectral variabilitywith the results of previous studies of ngc 4051.

astro-ph;0105258	a chandra survey of broad absorption line quasars	we have carried out a survey with the chandra x-ray observatory of a sampleof 10 optically bright broad absorption line (bal) qsos. eight out of tensources are detected. the 6 brightest x-ray sources have only high ionizationbals (hibals), while the 4 faintest all show low ionization bals (lobals). weperform a combined spectral fit for hibal qsos to determine the mean spectralparameters of this sample. we derive an underlying best-fit power-law slopegamma=1.8+/-0.35, consistent with the mean slope for radio-quiet quasars fromasca, but balqsos require a (restframe) absorbing column of 6.5e22, with apartial covering fraction of 80%. removing the absorption component from ourbest-fit spectral model yields a range of alphaox from 1.55 to 2.28. all 6hibal qsos have de-absorbed x-ray emission consistent with non-bal qsos ofsimilar luminosity. the spectral energy distributions of the hibal qsos - boththe underlying power-law slope and alphaox provide the first conclusiveevidence that balqsos have appeared to be x-ray weak because of intrinsicabsorption, and that their underlying emission is consistent with non-bal qsos.by contrast, removal of the best-fit absorption column detected in the hibalqsos still leaves the 4 lobal qsos as unusually x-ray faint for their opticalluminosities.

astro-ph;0107003	chandra detection of x-ray absorption associated with a damped lyman  alpha system	we have observed three quasars, pks 1127-145, q 1331+171 and q0054+144, withthe acis-s aboard the chandra x-ray observatory, in order to measure soft x-rayabsorption associated with intervening 21-cm and damped ly$\alpha$ absorbers.for pks 1127-145, we detect absorption which, if associated with an interveningz_{abs}=0.312 absorber, implies a metallicity of 23% solar. if the absorptionis not at z_{abs}=0.312, then the metallicity is still constrained to be lessthan 23% solar. the advantage of the x-ray measurement is that the derivedmetallicity is insensitive to ionization, inclusion of an atom in a molecule,or depletion onto grains. the x-ray absorption is mostly due to oxygen, and isconsistent with the oxygen abundance of 30% solar derived from optical nebularemission lines in a foreground galaxy at the redshift of the absorber.  for q1331+171 and q 0054+144, only upper limits were obtained, although theexposure times were intentionally short, since for these two objects we wereinterested primarily in measuring flux levels to plan for future observations.the imaging results are presented in a companion paper.

astro-ph;0204462	chandra survey of radio-quiet, high-redshift quasars	we observed 17 optically-selected, radio-quiet high-redshift quasars with thechandra observatory acis, and detected 16 of them. the quasars have redshiftbetween 3.70 and 6.28 and include the highest redshift quasars known. whencompared to low-redshift quasars observed with rosat, these high redshiftquasars are significantly more x-ray quiet. we also find that the x-rayspectral index of the high redshift objects is flatter than the average atlower redshift. these trends confirm the predictions of models where theaccretion flow is described by a cold, optically-thick accretion disksurrounded by a hot, optically thin corona, provided the viscosity parameteralpha &gt;= 0.02. the high redshift quasars have supermassive black holes withmasses ~10^{10} m_{sun}, and are accreting material at ~0.1 the eddingtonlimit. we detect 10 x-ray photons from the z=6.28 quasar sds 1030+0524, whichmay have a gunn-peterson trough and be near the redshift of reionization of theintergalactic medium. the x-ray data place an upper limit on the optical depthof the intergalactic medium tau(igm) &lt; 10^6, compared to the lower limit fromthe spectrum of lyalpha and lybeta, which implies tau(igm) &gt; 20.

0809.0883	the reddest dr3 sdss/xmm quasars	we have cross-correlated the sdss dr3 schneider et al. (2005) quasar catalogwith the xmm-newton archive. color and redshift selections (g - r &gt; 0.5 and 0.9z &lt; 2.1) result in a sample of 17 red, moderate redshift quasars. the redshiftselection minimizes possible contamination due to host galaxy emission andlyalpha forest absorption. both optical and x-ray information are required todistinguish between the two likely remaining causes of the red colors: 1)dust-reddening and 2) an intrinsically red continuum. we find that 7 of 17quasars can be classified as probable `intrinsically red' objects. these 7quasars have unusually broad mgii emission lines (&lt;fwhm&gt;=10,500 km s^{-1}),moderately flat, but unabsorbed x-ray spectra &lt;gamma&gt;=1.66+/-0.08), and lowaccretion rates (mdot/mdot_{edd}} ~ 0.01). we suggest low accretion rates as apossible physical explanation for quasars with intrinsically red opticalcontinua. we find that 8 of 17 quasars can be classified as dust-reddened.three of these have upper-limits on the absorption column from x-ray spectralfits of n_h = 3-13 x 10^{22} cm^2, while the other five quasars must beabsorbed by at least n_h = 10^{23} cm^2 in order to be consistent with acomparably selected alpha_{ox}-l_{uv} distribution. two objects in the sampleare unclassified.

astro-ph;0511293	accretion and nuclear activity of quiescent supermassive black holes. i:  x-ray study	we have studied the nuclear activity in a sample of six quiescent early-typegalaxies, with new chandra data and archival hst optical images. their nuclearsources have x-ray luminosities ~ 10^{38} - 10^{39} erg/s (l_x/l_edd ~ 10^{-8}- 10^{-7}), and colors or spectra consistent with accreting supermassive blackholes (smbhs)--except for the nucleus of ngc 4486b, which is softer thantypical agn spectra. in a few cases, the x-ray morphology of the nuclearsources shows hints of marginally extended structures, in addition to thesurrounding diffuse thermal emission from hot gas, which is detectable onscales &gt;~ 1 kpc. in one case (ngc 5845), a dusty disk may partially obstructour direct view of the smbh. we have estimated the temperature and density ofthe hot interstellar medium, which is one major source of fuel for theaccreting smbh; typical central densities are n_e ~ (0.02 +/- 0.01) cm^{-3}.assuming that the hot gas is captured by the smbh at the bondi rate, we showthat the observed x-ray luminosities are too faint to be consistent withstandard disk accretion, but brighter than predicted by radiatively-inefficientsolutions (eg, adaf). in total, there are ~ 20 galaxies for which smbh mass,hot gas density, and nuclear x-ray luminosity are simultaneously known. in somecases, the nuclear sources are brighter than predicted by the adaf model; inother cases, they are consistent or fainter. we discuss the apparent lack ofcorrelations between bondi rate and x-ray luminosity, and suggest that, inorder to understand the observed distribution, we need to know two additionalparameters: the amount of gas supplied by the stellar population inside theaccretion radius, and the fraction (possibly &lt;&lt; 1) of the total gas availablethat is accreted by the smbh. we shall discuss these issues in our paper ii.

astro-ph;0601620	xmm-newton view of the z&gt;0 warm-hot intergalactic medium toward  markarian 421	the recent detection with chandra of two warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim)filaments toward mrk 421 by nicastro et al. provides a measurement of the bulkof the "missing baryons" in the nearby universe. since mrk 421 is a brightx-ray source, it is also frequently observed by the xmm-newton reflectiongrating spectrometer (rgs) for calibration purposes. using all availablearchived xmm observations of this source with small pointing offsets (&lt;15"), weconstruct the highest-quality xmm grating spectrum of mrk 421 to date with anet exposure time (excluding periods of high background flux) of 437 ks and\~15000 counts per resolution element at 21.6a, more than twice that of thechandra spectrum. despite the long exposure time neither of the two interveningabsorption systems is seen, though the upper limits derived are consistent withthe chandra equivalent width measurements. this appears to result from (1) thelarger number of narrow instrumental features caused by bad detector columns,(2) the degraded resolution of xmm/rgs as compared to the chandra/letg, and (3)fixed pattern noise at \lambda &gt; 29a. the non-detection of the whim absorbersby xmm is thus fully consistent with the chandra measurement.

astro-ph;0604222	spitzer irs spectra of a large sample of seyfert galaxies: a variety of  infrared seds in the local agn population	we are conducting a large observing program with the spitzer space telescopeto determine the mid-to-far infrared spectral energy distributions of awell-defined sample of 87 nearby, 12 micron-selected seyfert galaxies. in thispaper we present the results of irs low-resolution spectroscopy of astatistically representative subsample of 51 of the galaxies (59%), with ananalysis of the continuum shapes and a comparison of the seyfert types. we findthat the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes andspectral features. some spectral features are clearly related to a starburstcontribution to the ir spectrum, while the mechanisms producing observedpower-law continuum shapes, attributed to an agn component, may be dust ornon-thermal emission. the infrared spectral types appear to be related to theseyfert types. principal component analysis results suggest that the relativecontribution of starburst emission may be the dominant cause of variance in theobserved spectra. we find that sy 1's have higher ratios of ir/radio emissionthan sy 2's, as predicted by the unified model if the torus is optically thickin the mid-ir. however, smooth-density torus models predict a much largerdifference between type 1's and 2's than observed in our sample. ourobservations may be consistent with clumpy torus models containing a steepradial distribution of optically thick dense clumps.

astro-ph;0608533	active x-ray optics for generation-x, the next high resolution x-ray  observatory	x-rays provide one of the few bands through which we can study the epoch ofreionization, when the first galaxies, black holes and stars were born. toreach the sensitivity required to image these first discrete objects in theuniverse needs a major advance in x-ray optics. generation-x (gen-x) iscurrently the only x-ray astronomy mission concept that addresses this goal.gen-x aims to improve substantially on the chandra angular resolution and to doso with substantially larger effective area. these two goals can only be met ifa mirror technology can be developed that yields high angular resolution atmuch lower mass/unit area than the chandra optics, matching that ofconstellation-x (con-x). we describe an approach to this goal based on activex-ray optics that correct the mid-frequency departures from an ideal wolteroptic on-orbit. we concentrate on the problems of sensing figure errors,calculating the corrections required, and applying those corrections. the timeneeded to make this in-flight calibration is reasonable. a laboratory versionof these optics has already been developed by others and is successfullyoperating at synchrotron light sources. with only a moderate investment inthese optics the goals of gen-x resolution can be realized.

0809.1665	xmm-newton view of the multi-phase warm absorber in seyfert 1 galaxy  ngc985	we present an analysis of an xmm-newton observation of the seyfert 1 galaxyngc 985. the epic spectra present strong residuals to a single power-law model,indicating the presence of ionized absorbing gas and a soft excess. abroad-band fit to the epic and rgs spectra shows that the continuum can be wellfit with a power-law and a blackbody component. the rgs can be modeled eitherwith two or three absorption components. in the two absorber model thelow-ionization one, accounts for the presence of the fe m-shell unresolvedtransition array (fe vii-xiii), and the high ionization component is requiredby the presence of several fe l-shell transitions. the data suggest thepresence of a third ionized component with higher ionization, so that the fel-shell absorption features are produced by two different components (oneproducing absorption by fe xvii-xx, and the other absorption by fe xx-xxii).however, the presence of the third absorbing component cannot be detected bymeans of an isolated absorption line in a significant way, so we consider thisdetection only as tentative. interestingly, all ionization components havesimilar kinematics. in addition, whether two or three absorbers are considered,the components appear to be in pressure balance. these results give furthersupport to the idea that warm absorbers in agn consist of a two or three-phasemedium. we note that, while in the model with only two absorbers one of them(the high ionization component) lies on an unstable branch of the thermalequilibrium curve, in the model with three absorbers all of the components lieon stable branches of the curve. this gives further plausibility to amulti-phase absorber.

(1996), indicatingthat there is no steep soft component below 0.2 kev. 3. the occurrence of warmabsorbers in quasars is rather rare, in sharp contrast to lower luminosity agn.4. the strongest correlation found is between the spectral slope, alpha_x, andthe hb fwhm. this remarkably strong correlation may result from a dependence ofalpha_x on l/l_edd, as seen in galactic black hole candidates. 5. there appearsto exist a distinct class of ``x-ray weak'' quasars. these may be quasars wherethe direct x-ray source is obscured, and only scattered x-rays are observed. 6.thin accretion disk models cannot reproduce the observed optical to soft x-rayspectral shape. an as yet unknown physical mechanism maintains a strongcorrelation between the optical and soft x-ray emission. 7. the well knowndifference in alpha_x between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars may be dueonly to their different hb fwhm. 8. the agreement of the 21 cm and x-raycolumns implies that he in the diffuse h ii component of the galactic ism isionized to he ii or he iii (shortened abstract).

astro-ph;9703096	deriving the quasar luminosity function from accretion disk  instabilities	we have derived the quasar luminosity function assuming that the quasaractivity is driven by a thermal-viscous unstable accretion disk around asupermassive black hole. the instabilities produce large amplitude, long-termvariability of a single source. we take a light curve of a single source andcalculate the luminosity function, from the function of time it spends at eachluminosity. convolving this with an assumed mass distribution we fit well theobserved optical luminosity function of quasars at four redshifts. as a resultwe obtain the evolution of the mass distribution between redshifts 2.5 and 0.5.the maximum of the active black hole mass function moves towards lower mass bya factor ~10 at the low redshift. the number of high mass sources declinesrapidly, and so low mass sources become dominant at lower redshift. the mainconclusions are following: 1) the quasar long-term variability due to the diskthermal-viscous instabilities provides a natural explanation for the observedquasar luminosity function. 2) the peak of the mass function evolves towardslower black hole masses at lower redshifts by a factor ~10. 3) high masssources die subsequently when redshift gets smaller. 4) the number of high masssources declines rapidly, and so low mass sources become dominant at lowerredshift. 5) the periodic outbursts of activity appear as long as the matter issupplied to the accretion disk. 6) since the time-averaged accretion rate islow, the remnant sources (or sources in the low activity phase) do not grow tovery massive black holes. 7) a continuous fuel supply at a relatively lowaccretion rate (~0.01 - 0.1 \dot m_{edd}$) for each single source is requiredover the lifetime of the entire quasar population.

(the rosat hri image of ngc 7582further suggests extent to the se.)  these observations make it clear that the hard x-ray emission of ngc 7582,the most "narrow-line" of the nlxgs, is associated with an agn. the strongsuggestion is that all nlxgs are obscured agns, as hypothesized to explain thex-ray background spectral paradox. the separate soft x-ray component makes ngc7582 (and by extension other nlxgs) detectable as a rosat source.

(1995). unidentified,fainter, sources could increase the fraction of red quasars by up to a factor7.  for the red quasars found here, the h-alpha/h-beta ratios, optical slope andx-ray colors all indicate that they are absorbed by a(v) ~ 2, rather thanhaving intrinsically red spectra. this amount of obscuration seems to hide~1-7% of quasars at a given observed flux, or ~3-20% when their fluxes arecorrected to their intrinsic values. this size of population is consistent withearlier limits, with predicted values from comastri et al. (1995), and iscomparable to the rate found among radio-loud quasars.  a large population of more heavily absorbed (a(v)=5), fainter, quasars equalin size to the blue population could exist, without violating existing upperlimits, in accord with the comastri et al.

0811.3977	the cosmos agn spectroscopic survey i: xmm counterparts	we present optical spectroscopy for an x-ray and optical flux-limited sampleof 677 xmm-newton selected targets covering the 2 deg^2 cosmos field, with ayield of 485 high-confidence redshifts. the majority of the spectra wereobtained over three seasons (2005-2007) with the imacs instrument on themagellan (baade) telescope. we also include in the sample previously publishedsloan digital sky survey spectra and supplemental observations withmmt/hectospec. we detail the observations and classification analyses. thesurvey is 90% complete to flux limits of f_{0.5-10 kev}&gt;8 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2s^-1 and i_ab+&lt;22, where over 90% of targets have high-confidence redshifts.making simple corrections for incompleteness due to redshift and spectral typeallows for a description of the complete population to $i_ab+&lt;23. the correctedsample includes 57% broad emission line (type 1, unobscured) agn at0.13&lt;z&lt;4.26, 25% narrow emission line (type 2, obscured) agn at 0.07&lt;z&lt;1.29,and 18% absorption line (host-dominated, obscured) agn at 0&lt;z&lt;1.22 (excludingthe stars that made up 4% of the x-ray targets). we show that the survey'slimits in x-ray and optical flux include nearly all x-ray agn (defined byl_{0.5-10 kev}&gt;3 x 10^42 erg s^-1) to z&lt;1, of both optically obscured andunobscured types. we find statistically significant evidence that the obscuredto unobscured agn ratio at z&lt;1 increases with redshift and decreases withluminosity.
