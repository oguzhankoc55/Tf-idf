0901.2347	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field. the point-like  x-ray source catalogue	the cosmos survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution ofgalaxies, agn and the large scale structure. the xmm-cosmos is a deep x-raysurvey over the full 2 deg2 of the cosmos area. it consists of 55 xmm-newtonpointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 ms with an average vignetting correcteddepth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. wepresent the catalogue of point-like x-ray sources detected with the epic ccdcameras, the logn-logs relations and the x-ray colour-colour diagrams. theanalysis was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy bands.the completeness of the catalogue as well as logn-logs have been calibratedusing monte carlo simulations. the catalogs contains a total of 1887 uniquesources detected in at least one band. the survey, that shows unprecedentedhomogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kev energy band, respectively. thanks to the ratherhomogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logn-logs relations arevery well determined over the flux range sampled by xmm-cosmos. these relationshave been compared with xrb synthesis models, which reproduce the observationswith an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 kev and 2-10 kev band, while in the 0.5-2kev band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. the hard x-ray colors confirmedthat the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, areactually type i or type ii agn. about 20% of the sources have x-ray luminositytypical of agn (l_x &gt;1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signatureof nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.

0902.2777	resolving the mid-infrared cores of local seyferts	we present new photometry of 16 local seyferts including 6 compton-thicksources in n-band filters around 12-microns, obtained with the visir instrumenton the 8-m very large telescope. the near-diffraction-limited imaging providesthe least-contaminated core fluxes for these sources to date. augmenting thesewith our previous observations and with published intrinsic x-ray fluxes, weform a total sample of 42 sources for which we find a strong mid-infrared:x-ray(12.3 micron:2-10 kev) luminosity correlation. performing aphysically-motivated sub-selection of sources in which the seyfert torus islikely to be best-resolved results in the correlation l_{mir} ~l_x^{1.11+/-0.07}, with a reduction of the scatter in luminosities as comparedto the full sample. consideration of systematics suggests a range of 1.02-1.21for the correlation slope. the mean 2 kev:12.3 micron spectral index (alpha_ix)is found to be -1.10+/-0.01, largely independent of luminosity. observed12-micron bolometric corrections range over ~10-30 if a known luminosity trendof intrinsic x-ray bolometric corrections is assumed. comparison with iso dataspanning a larger luminosity range suggests that our correlation can beextended into the quasar regime. the fact that unobscured, obscured andcompton-thick sources all closely follow the same luminosity correlation hasimportant implications for the structures of seyfert cores. the typicalresolution-limit of our imaging corresponds to ~70 pc at a median z=0.01, andthe tightness of the correlation constrains any residual star-formation withinthese physical scales, for which we infer a mean upper-limit of &lt;~40% of theremaining unresolved flux. we suggest that uncontaminated mid-ir continuumimaging of agn is an accurate proxy for their intrinsic power.

0902.4857	galaxy clusters and the cosmic cycle of baryons across cosmic times	we discuss the central role played by the x-ray study of hot baryons withingalaxy clusters to reconstruct the assembly of cosmic structures and to tracethe past history of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes(bhs). we shortly review the progress in this field contributed by the currentgeneration of x-ray telescopes. then, we focus on the outstanding scientificquestions that have been opened by observations carried out in the last yearsand that represent the legacy of chandra and xmm: (a) when and how is entropyinjected into the inter-galactic medium (igm)? (b) what is the history of metalenrichment of the igm? (c) what physical mechanisms determine the presence ofcool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) how is the appearance of proto-clusters atz~2 related to the peak of star formation activity and bh accretion? we showthat a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is tocarry out a large-area x-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to thatof deep chandra and xmm pointings, but extending over several thousands ofsquare degrees. a similar survey can only be carried out with a wide-fieldx-ray telescope (wfxt), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp psfacross the entire fov. we emphasize the important synergies that wfxt will havewith a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from theradio to the x-ray bands. finally, we discuss the immense legacy value thatsuch a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at large.

0910.2617	the chandra survey of the cosmos field ii: source detection and  photometry	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra program,that covers the central contiguous ~0.92 deg^2 of the cosmos field. c-cosmos isthe result of a complex tiling, with every position being observed in up to sixoverlapping pointings (four overlapping pointings in most of the central ~0.45deg^2 area with the best exposure, and two overlapping pointings in most of thesurrounding area, covering an additional ~0.47 deg^2). therefore, the fullexploitation of the c-cosmos data requires a dedicated and accurate analysisfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the psfchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1arcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)obtaining the best source localization and count rate. we present here ourtreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,photometry, and survey sensitivity. our final procedure consists of a two stepprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) amaximum likelihood point spread function fitting algorithm to evaluate thesource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is afluctuation of the background. we discuss the main characteristics of thisprocedure, that was the result of detailed comparisons between differentdetection algorithms and photometry tools, calibrated with extensive anddedicated simulations.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0912.4166	the x-ray to optical-uv luminosity ratio of x-ray selected type 1 agn in  xmm-cosmos	we present a study of the x-ray to optical properties of a sample of 545x-ray selected type 1 agn, from the xmm-cosmos survey, over a wide range ofredshifts ($0.04&lt;\z&lt;4.25$) and x-ray luminosities ($40.6 \leq \log \lhard \leq45.3$). about 60% of them are spectroscopically identified type 1 agn, whilethe others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as type 1agn on the basis of their multi-band spectral energy distributions. we discussthe relationship between uv and x-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the$\alphaox$ spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. wecompare our findings with previous investigations of optically selectedbroad-line agn (mostly from sdss). a highly significant correlation between$\alphaox$ and $\lo$ is found, in agreement with previous investigations ofoptically selected samples. we calculate bolometric corrections, $\kbol$, forthe whole sample using hard x-ray luminosities ($\lhard$), and the eddingtonratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates areavailable. we confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction withincreasing eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. a tight correlationis found between $\alphaox$ and $\kbol$, which can be used to estimate accuratebolometric corrections using only optical and x-ray data. we find a significantcorrelation between $\alphaox$ and eddington ratio, in which $\alphaox$increases for increasing eddington ratios.

1001.2005	discovery of compton-thick quasars in the sloan digital sky survey	we present new and archival chandra snapshot (10 ks each) observations of 15optically identified (from the sloan digital sky survey, sdss) type 2 quasarsat z=0.40-0.73. when combined with existing x-ray data, this work providescomplete x-ray coverage for all 25 radio-quiet type 2 quasars withlogl_[oiii]&gt;9.28 l_sun from zakamska et al. (2003). two targets out of 15 werenot detected by chandra and most of the remaining sources are x-ray weak, withnine having less than 10 counts in the 0.5-8kev band. low-to-moderate qualityspectral analysis was limited to three sources, whose properties are consistentwith the presence of column densities in the range nh~10^22-10^23 cm^-2 in thesource rest frame. if the [oiii] luminosity is a reliable proxy for theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, the current x-ray data indicate that compton-thickquasars may hide among ~65 per cent of the sdss type 2 quasar population (l_{x,meas}/l_{x, [oiii]}&lt;0.01); however, since the type 2 quasar sample is selectedon [oiii] luminosity, the estimated compton-thick quasar fraction may beoverestimated. using archival spitzer observations, we find that ~50 per centof sdss type 2 quasars appear to be obscured by compton-thick material based onboth the l_{x, meas}/l_{x, mid-ir} (where mid-ir corresponds to rest-frame 12.3micron) and l_{x, meas}/l_{x, [oiii]} ratios. we use this information toprovide an estimate of the compton-thick quasar number density at z=0.3-0.8,which we find is in broad agreement with the expectations from x-ray backgroundmodels.

1002.4299	ultraluminous x-ray sources out to z~0.3 in the cosmos field	using chandra observations we have identified a sample of seven off-nuclearx-ray sources, in the redshift range z=0.072-0.283, located within opticallybright galaxies in the cosmos survey. using the multi-wavelength coverageavailable in the cosmos field, we study the properties of the host galaxies ofthese ulxs. in detail, we derived their star formation rate from h_alphameasurements and their stellar masses using sed fitting techniques with the aimto compute the probability to have an off-nuclear source based on the hostgalaxy properties. we divide the host galaxies in different morphologicalclasses using the available acs/hst imaging. we find that our ulxs candidatesare located in regions of the sfr versus m$_star$ plane where one or moreoff-nuclear detectable sources are expected. from a morphological analysis ofthe acs imaging and the use of rest-frame colours, we find that our ulxs arehosted both in late and early type galaxies. finally, we find that the fractionof galaxies hosting a ulx ranges from ~0.5% to ~0.2% going from l[0.5-2 kev]=3x 10^39 erg s^-1 to l[0.5-2 kev]= 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1004.2790	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field (xmm-cosmos):  demography and multiwavelength properties of obscured and unobscured luminous  agn	we report the final optical identifications of the medium-depth (~60 ksec),contiguous (2 deg^2) xmm-newton survey of the cosmos field. xmm-newton hasdetected ~800 x-ray sources down to limiting fluxes of ~5x10^{-16},~3x10^{-15}, and ~7x10^{-15} erg/cm2/s in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kevbands, respectively. the work is complemented by an extensive collection ofmulti-wavelength data from 24 micron to uv, available from the cosmos survey,for each of the x-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for ~50% ofthe sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. the xmm andmultiwavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the x-ray sourceshave optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have irac counterparts, and 1394 (~78%)have mips 24micron detections. thanks to the redshift completeness (almost100%) we were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the x-rayluminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density oflogl_x&gt;44.5 agn is at z~2. spectroscopically-identified obscured and unobscuredagn, as well as normal and starforming galaxies, present well-defined opticaland infrared properties. we devised a robust method to identify a sample of~150 high redshift (z&gt;1), obscured agn candidates for which opticalspectroscopy is not available. we were able to determine that the fraction ofthe obscured agn population at the highest (l_x&gt;10^{44} erg s^{-1}) x-rayluminosity is ~15-30% when selection effects are taken into account, providingan important observational constraint for x-ray background synthesis. westudied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energydistribution of a prototypical type 2 qso, caught in a stage transitioning frombeing starburst dominated to agn dominated, which was possible to isolate onlythanks to the combination of x-ray and infrared observations.

1005.0373	the x-ray to [ne v]3426 flux ratio: discovering heavily obscured agn in  the distant universe	we investigate the possibility of using the ratio between the 2-10 kev fluxand the [ne v]3426 emission line flux (x/nev) as a diagnostic diagram todiscover heavily obscured, possibly compton-thick active galactic nuclei (agn)up to z~1.5. first, we calibrate a relation between x/nev and the coldabsorbing column density n_h using a sample of 74 bright, nearby seyferts withboth x-ray and [ne v] data available in the literature. similarly to what isfound for the x-ray to [o iii]5007 flux ratio (x/oiii), we found that the x/nevratio decreases towards large column densities. essentially all local seyfertswith x/nev values below 15 are found to be compton-thick objects. second, weapply this diagnostic diagram to different samples of distant obscured andunobscured qsos in the sdss: blue, unobscured, type-1 qsos in the redshiftrange z=[0.1-1.5] show x/nev values typical of unobscured seyfert 1s in thelocal universe. conversely, sdss type-2 qsos at z~0.5 classified either ascompton-thick or compton-thin on the basis of their x/oiii ratio, would havebeen mostly classified in the same way based on the x/nev ratio. we apply thex/nev diagnostic diagram to 9 sdss obscured qsos in the redshift rangez=[0.85-1.31], selected by means of their prominent [ne v]3426 line andobserved with chandra acis-s for 10ks each. based on the x/nev ratio,complemented by x-ray spectral analysis, 2 objects appear good compton-thickqso candidates, 4 objects appear as compton-thin qsos, while 3 have anambiguous classification. when excluding from the sample broad lined qsos witha red continuum and thus considering only genuine narrow-line objects, theefficiency in selecting compton-thick qsos through the [ne v] line is about 50%(with large errors, though), more similar to what is achieved with [o iii]selection.

1005.3253	suzaku observations of hard x-ray selected seyfert 2 galaxies	we present suzaku observations of five hard x-ray selected nearby seyfert 2galaxies. all the sources were clearly detected with the pin hard x-raydetector up to several tens of kev, allowing for a fairly good characterizationof the broad-band x-ray continuum. we find that a unique model, even includingmultiple components, fails to represent the spectra of all the sources. heavyobscuration manifests itself in different flavours. for two sources there isevidence for a reflection dominated continuum; among the other three, one is"mildly" compton thick (n_h ~ 10^24 cm-2), while the remaining two are heavilyobscured (n_h ~ 10^23.5 cm-2), but compton thin. strong, narrow, iron kalphalines (ew ~ 1-2 kev) due to neutral or mildly ionized gas, are detected incompton thick agn. in all of them the kalpha line is accompanied by the kbeta.the intensity and shape of the soft x-ray spectrum are different from object toobject. soft x--rays may originate from a nuclear component scattered off, orleaking through, the x-ray absorber, plus thermal x-rays from the host galaxy.emission from circumnuclear gas photoionized by the active nucleus,parameterized with a power law plus individual narrow gaussian lines, alsoprovides an acceptable description of the soft x-ray spectra. the limitedsuzaku xis ccd energy resolution does not allow us to draw firm conclusions onthe origin of the soft x--ray emission. we briefly discuss our findings in thelight of agn unified model and the geometry of the obscuring gas.

0708.2796	the spatial clustering of mid-ir selected star forming galaxies at z ~ 1  in the goods fields	we present the first spatial clustering measurements of z~1, 24um-selected,star forming galaxies in the great observatories origins deep survey (goods).the sample under investigation includes 495 objects in goods-south and 811objects in goods-north selected down to flux densities of f_24&gt;20 ujy andz_ab&lt;23.5 mag, for which spectroscopic redshifts are available. the medianredshift, ir luminosity and star formation rate (sfr) of the samples are z~0.8,l_ir~4.4 x 10^10 l_sun, and sfr~7.6 m_sun/yr, respectively. we measure theprojected correlation function w(r_p) on scales of r_p=0.06-10 h^-1 mpc, fromwhich we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 4.0 +- 0.4 h^-1mpc and slope of gamma=1.5 +- 0.1 for the whole f_24&gt;20ujy sample aftercombining the two fields. we find indications of a larger correlation lengthfor objects of higher luminosity, with luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs,l_ir&gt;10^11 l_sun) reaching r_0~5.1 h^-1 mpc. this would imply that galaxieswith larger sfrs are hosted in progressively more massive halos, reachingminimum halo masses of ~3 x 10^12 m_sun for lirgs. we compare our measurementswith the predictions from semi-analytic models based on the millenniumsimulation. the variance in the models is used to estimate the errors in ourgoods clustering measurements, which are dominated by cosmic variance. themeasurements from the two goods fields are found to be consistent within theerrors. on scales of the goods fields, the real sources appear more stronglyclustered than objects in the millennium-simulation based catalogs, if theselection function is applied consistently. this suggests that star formationat z~0.5-1 is being hosted in more massive halos and denser environments thancurrently predicted by galaxy formation models.[truncated]

1010.6208	simulating the wfxt sky	we investigate the scientific impact of the wide field x-ray telescopemission. we present simulated images and spectra of x-ray sources as observedfrom the three surveys planned for the nominal 5-year wfxt lifetime. the goalof these simulations is to provide wfxt images of the extragalactic sky indifferent energy bands based on accurate description of agn populations, normaland star forming galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies. the images arerealized using a detailed psf model, instrumental and physicalbackgrounds/foregrounds, accurate model of the effective area and the relatedvignetting effect. thanks to this comprehensive modelization of the wfxtproperties, the simulated images can be used to evaluate the flux limits fordetection of point and extended sources, the effect of source confusion at veryfaint fluxes, and in general the efficiency of detection algorithms. we alsosimulate the spectra of the detected sources, in order to address specificscience topics which are unique to wfxt. among them, we focus on thecharacterization of the intra cluster medium (icm) of high-z clusters, and inparticular on the measurement of the redshift from the icm spectrum in order tobuild a cosmological sample of galaxy clusters. the end-to-end simulationprocedure presented here, is a valuable tool in optimizing the mission design.therefore, these simulations can be used to reliably characterize the wfxtdiscovery space and to verify the connection between mission requirements andscientific goals. thanks to this effort, we can conclude on firm basis that anx-ray mission optimized for surveys like wfxt is necessary to bring x-rayastronomy at the level of the optical, ir, submm and radio wavebands asforeseen in the coming decade.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1102.4714	a compton-thick agn at z~5 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south	we report the discovery of a compton-thick active galactic nucleus (agn) atz=4.76 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south. this object was selected as av-band dropout in hst/acs images and previously recognized as an agn fromoptical spectroscopy. the 4 ms chandra observations show a significant(~4.2sigma) x-ray detection at the v-band dropout position. the x-ray sourcedisplays a hardness ratio of hr=0.23+-0.24, which, for a source at z~5, ishighly suggestive of compton-thick absorption. the source x-ray spectrum isseen above the background level in the energy range of ~0.9-4 kev, i.e., in therest-frame energy range of ~5-23 kev. when fixing the photon index togamma=1.8, the measured column density is n_h=1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{24}cm^{-2}, which is compton-thick. to our knowledge, this is the most distantheavily obscured agn, confirmed by x-ray spectral analysis, discovered so far.the intrinsic (de-absorbed), rest-frame luminosity in the 2-10 kev band is ~2.5x 10^{44} erg s^{-1}, which places this object among type-2 quasars. thespectral energy distribution shows that massive star formation is associatedwith obscured black hole accretion. this system may have then been caughtduring a major co-eval episode of black hole and stellar mass assembly at earlytimes. the measure of the number density of heavily obscured agn at highredshifts will be crucial to reconstruct the bh/galaxy evolution history fromthe beginning.

1103.2570	the population of high redshift agns in the chandra cosmos survey	we present the high redshift (3&lt;z&lt;5.3) 0.5-2 kev number counts and the 2-10kev (rest frame) space density of x-ray selected agns detected in the chandracosmos survey. the sample comprises 81 x-ray detected sources with availablespectroscopic (31) and photometric (50) redshifts plus 20 sources with a formalz_phot&lt;3 but with a broad photometric redshift probability distribution, suchthat z_phot+1sigma&gt;3. 81 sources are selected in the 0.5-2 kev band, 14 areselected in the 2-10 kev and 6 in the 0.5-10 kev bands. we sample the highluminosity (log l_(2-10 kev)&gt;44.15 erg/s) space density up to z~5 and a fainterluminosity range (43.5&lt;log l(2-10 kev)&lt;44.15 erg/s) than previous studies, upto z=3.5. we weighted the contribution to the number counts and the spacedensity of the sources with photometric redshift by using their probability ofbeing at z&gt;3. we find that the space density of high-luminosity agns declinesexponentially at all the redshifts, confirming the trend observed for opticallyselected quasars. at lower luminosity, the measured space density is notconclusive, and a larger sample of faint sources is needed. comparisons withoptical luminosity functions and bh formation models are presented togetherwith prospects for future surveys.

0709.3455	the evolution of agn host galaxies: from blue to red and the influence  of large-scale structures	we present an analysis of 109 moderate-luminosity (41.9 &lt; log l{0.5-8.0 kev}&lt; 43.7) agn in the extended chandra deep field-south survey, which is drawnfrom 5,549 galaxies from the combo-17 and gems surveys having 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.1.these obscured or optically-weak agn facilitate the study of their hostgalaxies since the agn provide an insubstantial amount of contamination to thegalaxy light. we find that the color distribution of agn host galaxies ishighly dependent upon (1) the strong color-evolution of luminous (m_v &lt; -20.7)galaxies, and (2) the influence of ~10 mpc scale structures. when excludinggalaxies within the redshift range 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 0.76, a regime dominated bysources in large-scale structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73, we observe a bimodalityin the host galaxy colors. galaxies hosting agn at z &gt; 0.8 preferentially havebluer (rest-frame u-v &lt; 0.7) colors than their z &lt;~ 0.6 counterparts (many ofwhich fall along the red sequence). the fraction of galaxies hosting agn peaksin the ``green valley'' (0.5 &lt; u-v &lt; 1.0); this is primarily due to enhancedagn activity in the redshift interval 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 0.76. the agn fraction in thisredshift and color interval is 12.8% (compared to its `field' value of 7.8%)and reaches a maximum of 14.8% at u-v~0.8. we further find that blue,bulge-dominated (sersic index n&gt;2.5) galaxies have the highest fraction of agn(21%) in our sample. we explore the scenario that the evolution of agn hosts isdriven by galaxy mergers and illustrate that an accurate assessment requires alarger area survey since only three hosts may be undergoing a merger withtimescales &lt;1 gyr following a starburst phase.

1105.0520	the xmm-newton wide field survey in the cosmos field: redshift evolution  of agn bias and subdominant role of mergers in triggering moderate luminosity  agn at redshift up to 2.2	we present a study of the redshift evolution of the projected correlationfunction of 593 x-ray selected agn with i_ab&lt;23 and spectroscopic redshiftsz&lt;4, extracted from the 0.5-2 kev x-ray mosaic of the 2.13 deg^2 xmm-cosmossurvey. we introduce a method to estimate the average bias of the agn sampleand the mass of agn hosting halos, solving the sample variance using the halomodel and taking into account the growth of the structure over time. we findevidence of a redshift evolution of the bias factor for the total population ofxmm-cosmos agn from b(z=0.92)=2.30 +/- 0.11 to b(z=1.94)=4.37 +/- 0.27 with anaverage mass of the hosting dm halos logm [h^-1 m_sun] ~ 13.12 +/- 0.12 thatremains constant at all z &lt; 2. splitting our sample into broad optical linesagn (bl), agn without broad optical lines (nl) and x-ray unobscured andobscured agn, we observe an increase of the bias with redshift in the rangez=0.7-2.25 and z=0.6-1.5 which corresponds to a constant halo mass logm [h^-1m_sun] ~ 13.28 +/- 0.07 and logm [h^-1 m_sun] ~ 13.00 +/- 0.06 for bl /x-rayunobscured agn and nl/x-ray obscured agn, respectively. the theoretical modelswhich assume a quasar phase triggered by major mergers can not reproduce thehigh bias factors and dm halo masses found for x-ray selected bl agn with l_bol~ 2e45 erg s^-1. our work extends up to z ~ 2.2 the z &lt;= 1 statement that, formoderate luminosity x-ray selected bl agn, the contribution from major mergersis outnumbered by other processes, possibly secular such as tidal disruptionsor disk instabilities.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1105.5643	the chandra deep field-south survey: 4 ms source catalogs	[abridged] we present point-source catalogs for the 4ms chandra deepfield-south (cdf-s), which is the deepest chandra survey to date and covers anarea of 464.5 arcmin^2. we provide a main source catalog, which contains 740x-ray point sources that are detected with wavdetect at a false-positiveprobability threshold of 1e-5 and also satisfy a binomial-probabilitysource-selection criterion of p&lt;0.004; this approach is designed to maximizethe number of reliable sources detected. a total of 300 main-catalog sourcesare new compared to the previous 2ms cdf-s main-catalog sources. we alsoprovide a supplementary catalog, which consists of 36 sources that are detectedwith wavdetect at 1e-5, satisfy 0.004&lt; p&lt;0.1, and have an optical counterpartwith r&lt;24. multiwavelength identifications, basic optical/infrared/radiophotometry, and spectroscopic/photometric redshifts are provided for the x-raysources. basic analyses of the x-ray and multiwavelength properties of thesources indicate that &gt;75% of the main-catalog sources are agns; of the 300 newmain-catalog sources, about 35% are likely normal and starburst galaxies,reflecting the rise of normal and starburst galaxies at the very faint fluxlevels uniquely accessible to the 4ms cdf-s. near the center of the 4ms cdf-s,the observed agn and galaxy source densities have reached ~9800 and 6900 persquare degree, respectively. the 4 ms cdf-s reaches on-axis flux limits of~9.1e-18 and 5.5e-17 erg/cm^2/s for the soft and hard bands, respectively. anincrease in the cdf-s exposure by a factor of ~2-2.5 would provide furthersignificant gains and probe key unexplored discovery space.

1106.1443	x-ray spectral constraints for z~2 massive galaxies: the identification  of reflection-dominated active galactic nuclei	we use the 4ms cdf-s survey to place direct x-ray constraints on the ubiquityof z~2 heavily obscured agns in k&lt;22 bzk galaxies. forty seven of the 222 bzkgalaxies in the central region of the cdf-s are detected at x-ray energies, 11of which have hard x-ray spectral slopes (gamma&lt;1) indicating the presence ofheavily obscured agn activity. the other 36 x-ray detected bzk galaxies appearto be relatively unobscured agns and starburst galaxies; we use x-rayvariability analyses over a rest-frame baseline of ~3 years to further confirmthe presence of agn activity in many of these systems. the majority (7 out of11) of the heavily obscured agns have excess ir emission over that expectedfrom star formation (termed "ir-excess galaxies"). however, we find that x-raydetected heavily obscured agns only comprise ~25% of the ir-excess galaxypopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured agns andstarburst galaxies. we find that the typical x-ray spectrum of the heavilyobscured agns is better characterized by a pure reflection model than anabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme compton-thick absorption in somesystems. we verify this result by producing a composite rest-frame 2-20 kevspectrum, which has a similar shape as a reflection-dominated x-ray spectrumand reveals an emission feature at rest-frame energy ~6.4 kev, likely to be dueto fe k. these heavily obscured agns are likely to be the distant analogs ofthe reflection-dominated agns recently identified at z~0 with &gt;10 kevobservatories. on the basis of these analyses we estimate the space density fortypical (intrinsic x-ray luminosities of l_x&gt;1e43 erg/s) heavily obscured andcompton-thick agns at z~2. our space-density constraints are conservative lowerlimits but they are already consistent with the range of predictions from x-raybackground models.

1107.3148	"revealing a population of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei at  z=0.5-1 in the chandra deep field-south	(abridged) we identify a numerically significant population of heavilyobscured agns at z~0.5-1 in the chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) and extendedchandra deep field-south by selecting 242 x-ray undetected objects withinfrared-based star formation rates (sfrs) substantially higher (a factor of3.2 or more) than their sfrs determined from the uv after correcting for dustextinction. an x-ray stacking analysis of 23 candidates in the central cdf-sregion using the 4 ms chandra data reveals a hard x-ray signal with aneffective power-law photon index of gamma=0.6_{-0.4}^{+0.3}, indicating asignificant contribution from obscured agns. based on monte carlo simulations,we conclude that 74+-25% of the selected galaxies host obscured agns, withinwhich ~95% are heavily obscured and ~80% are compton-thick (ct; nh&gt;1.5x10^{24}cm^{-2}). the heavily obscured objects in our sample are of moderate intrinsicx-ray luminosity [ ~ (0.9-4)x10^{42} erg/s in the 2-10 kev band]. the spacedensity of the ct agns is (1.6+-0.5)x10^{-4} mpc^{-3}. the z~0.5-1 ct objectsstudied here are expected to contribute ~1% of the total xrb flux in the 10-30kev band, and they account for ~5-15% of the emission in this energy bandexpected from all ct agns according to population-synthesis models. in the 6--8kev band, the stacked signal of the 23 heavily obscured candidates accounts for&lt;5% of the unresolved xrb flux, while the unresolved ~25% of the xrb in thisband can probably be explained by a stacking analysis of the x-ray undetectedoptical galaxies in the cdf-s (a 2.5 sigma stacked signal). we discussprospects to identify such heavily obscured objects using future hard x-rayobservatories.

1108.4925	the bolometric output and host-galaxy properties of obscured agn in the  xmm-cosmos survey	we present a study of the multi-wavelength properties, from the mid-infraredto the hard x-rays, of a sample of 255 spectroscopically identified x-rayselected type-2 agn from the xmm-cosmos survey. most of them are obscured thex-ray absorbing column density is determined by either x-ray spectral analyses(for the 45% of the sample), or from hardness ratios. spectral energydistributions (seds) are computed for all sources in the sample. the averageseds in the optical band is dominated by the host-galaxy light, especially atlow x-ray luminosities and redshifts. there is also a trend between x-ray andmid-infrared luminosity: the agn contribution in the infrared is higher athigher x-ray luminosities. we calculate bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections, stellar masses and star formation rates (sfrs) for these sourcesusing a multi-component modeling to properly disentangle the emissionassociated to stellar light from that due to black hole accretion. for 90% ofthe sample we also have the morphological classifications obtained with anupgraded version of the zurich estimator of structural types (zest+). we findthat on average type-2 agn have lower bolometric corrections than type-1 agn.moreover, we confirm that the morphologies of agn host-galaxies indicate thatthere is a preference for these type-2 agn to be hosted in bulge-dominatedgalaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 solar masses.

1108.6061	dissecting photometric redshift for active galactic nuclei using xmm-  and chandra-cosmos samples	with this paper, we release accurate photometric redshifts for 1692counterparts to chandra sources in the central square degree of the cosmosfield. the availability of a large training set of spectroscopic redshifts thatextends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to thehighest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. we demonstratethat morphologically extended, faint x-ray sources without optical variabilityare more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected foremission lines) than by agn-dominated templates, even if these sources haveagn-like x-ray luminosities. preselecting the library on the bases of thesource properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(delta z/(1+z_spec))\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire chandra-cosmossample. in addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735optical counterparts of the xmm-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.ofcosmos. for 248 sources, our updated photometric redshift differs from theprevious release by delta z&gt;0.2. these changes are predominantly due to theinclusion of newly available deep h-band photometry h_ab=24 mag. we illustrateonce again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how anassumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depthof the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshiftsdetermined for agn. these considerations should be kept in mind when definingthe observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting agn, such aserosita at x-ray energies and askap/emu in the radio band.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1111.2447	fe k emission from active galaxies in the cosmos field	we present a rest-frame spectral stacking analysis of ~1000 x-ray sourcesdetected in the xmm-cosmos field in order to investigate the iron k lineproperties of active galaxies beyond redshift z~1. in type i agn that have atypical x-ray luminosity of lx~1.5e44 erg/s and z~1.6, the cold fe k at 6.4 kevis weak (ew~0.05kev), in agreement with the known trend. in contrast,high-ionization lines of fe xxv and fe xxvi are pronounced. thesehigh-ionization fe k lines appear to have a connection with high accretionrates. while no broad fe emission is detected in the total spectrum, it mightbe present, albeit at low significance, when the x-ray luminosity is restrictedto the range below 3e44 erg/s, or when an intermediate range of eddington ratioaround 0.1 is selected. in type ii agn, both cold and high-ionzation linesbecome weak with increasing x-ray luminosity. however, strong high-ionizationfe k (ew~0.3 kev) is detected in the spectrum of objects at z&gt;2, while no 6.4kev line is found. it is then found that the primary source of thehigh-ionization fe k emission is those objects detected with spitzer-mips at 24micron. given their median redshift of z=2.5, their bolometric luminosity islikely to reach 10^13 lsun and the mips-detected emission most likelyoriginates from hot dust heated by embedded agn, probably accreting at higheddington ratio. these properties match those of rapidly growing black holes inultra-luminous infrared galaxies at the interesting epoch (z=2-3) of galaxyformation.

1204.1977	the 4 ms chandra deep field-south number counts apportioned by source  class: pervasive active galactic nuclei and the ascent of normal galaxies	we present 0.5-2 kev, 2-8 kev, 4-8 kev, and 0.5-8 kev cumulative anddifferential number counts (logn-logs) measurements for the recently completed~4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) survey, the deepest x-ray survey todate. we implement a new bayesian approach, which allows reliable calculationof number counts down to flux limits that are factors of ~1.9-4.3 times fainterthan the previously deepest number-counts investigations. in the soft band, themost sensitive bandpass in our analysis, the ~4 ms cdf-s reaches a maximumsource density of ~27,800 deg-2. by virtue of the exquisite x-ray andmultiwavelength data available in the cdf-s, we are able to measure the numbercounts from a variety of source populations (active galactic nuclei [agns],normal galaxies, and galactic stars) and subpopulations (as a function ofredshift, agn absorption, luminosity, and galaxy morphology), and test modelsthat describe their evolution. we find that agns still dominate the x-raynumber counts down to the faintest flux levels for all bands and reach alimiting soft-band source density of ~14,900 deg-2, the highest reliable agnsource density measured at any wavelength. we find that the normal-galaxycounts rise rapidly near the flux limits, and at the limiting soft-band flux,reach source densities of ~12,700 deg-2 and make up 46+/-5% of the total numbercounts. the rapid rise of the galaxy counts toward faint fluxes, andsignificant normal-galaxy contributions to the overall number counts, indicatethat normal galaxies will overtake agns just below the ~4 ms soft-band fluxlimit and will provide a numerically significant new x-ray source population infuture surveys that reach below the ~4 ms sensitivity limit. we show that afuture ~10 ms cdf-s would allow for a significant increase in x-ray detectedsources, with many of the new sources being cosmologically distant (z &gt; 0.6)normal galaxies.

1204.4485	x-ray properties of radio-selected star forming galaxies in the  chandra-cosmos survey	x-ray surveys contain sizable numbers of star forming galaxies, beyond theagn which usually make the majority of detections. many methods to separate thetwo populations are used in the literature, based on x-ray and multiwavelengthproperties. we aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and tostudy the x-ray properties of the resulting samples. we build on a sample ofgalaxies selected at 1.4 ghz in the vla-cosmos survey, classified by smolcic etal. (2008) according to their optical colours and observed with chandra. asimilarly selected control sample of agn is also used for comparison. we reviewsome x-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the samplecomposition. the efficiency of the classification scheme devised by smolcic etal. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expectedbecause of the higher x-ray brightness of agn with respect to galaxies. thelatter fraction is actually 50% in the x-ray detected sources, while it isexpected to be much lower among x-ray undetected sources. indeed, the analysisof the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, stronglydifferent properties between the agn and galaxy samples. x-ray based selectioncriteria are then used to refine both samples. the radio/x-ray luminositycorrelation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the samex-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. some evolution of the ratio may bepossible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likelyexplained by a bias arising from the radio selection. finally, we discuss thex-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the vla- and c-cosmos surveysaccording to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similardetermination from the chandra deep fields. the classification scheme proposedhere may find application in future works and surveys.

(2010).two scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of cid-42: a gwrecoiling smbh and a double type 1/ type 2 agn system, where one of the two isrecoiling because of slingshot effect. in both scenario, one of the opticalnuclei hosts an unobscured agn, while the other one, either an obscured agn ora star forming compact region. the x-ray chandra data allow to unambiguouslyresolve the x-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sourcesin cid-42. we find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for thewhole x-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the fluxof the second optical nucleus is measured. the upper limit on the x-rayluminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energydistribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second sourcerather than an obscured smbh, thus favoring the gw recoil scenario. however thepresence of a very obscured smbh cannot be fully ruled-out. a new x-rayfeature, in a sw direction with respect to the main source, is discovered anddiscussed.

1206.2642	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei in the xmm-cosmos survey	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of both x-ray selectedbroad-line (type-1) and narrow-line (type-2) agn from the xmm-newton survey inthe cosmos field are presented. the sample is composed by 929 agn (382 type-1agn and 547 type-2 agn) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, x-rayluminosities and absorbing column densities. about 65% of the sources arespectroscopically identified as either type-1 or type-2 agn (83% and 52%respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the restof the sample. the study of such a large sample of x-ray selected agn with ahigh quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with theinclusion of herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron) to the optical-uvallows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections and eddington ratios. the kbol-lbol relations derived in thepresent work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable agn sample,and rely on observed redshifts, x-ray luminosities and column densitydistributions. we find that kbol is significantly lower at high lbol withrespect to previous estimates by marconi et al. (2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1208.4105	the nature of the unresolved extragalactic soft cxb	in this paper we investigate the power spectrum of the unresolved 0.5-2 kevcxb with deep chandra 4 ms observations in the cdfs. we measured a signalwhich, on scales &gt;30", is significantly higher than the shot-noise and isincreasing with the angular scale. we interpreted this signal as the jointcontribution of clustered undetected sources like agn, galaxies andinter-galactic-medium (igm). the power of unresolved cosmic sourcesfluctuations accounts for \sim 12% of the 0.5-2 kev extragalactic cxb. overall,our modeling predicts that \sim 20% of the unresolved cxb flux is made by lowluminosity agn, \sim 25% by galaxies and \sim 55% by the igm (inter galacticmedium). we do not find any direct evidence of the so called warm hotintergalactic medium (i.e. matter with 10^5k&lt;t&lt;10^7k and density contrast{\delta} &lt;1000), but we estimated that it could produce about 1/7 of theunresolved cxb. we placed an upper limit to the space density of postulatedx-ray-emitting early black hole at z&gt;7.5 and compared it with smbh evolutionmodels.

1209.0467	tracking down the source population responsible for the unresolved  cosmic 6-8 kev background	using the 4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) survey, we have identified asample of 6845 x-ray undetected galaxies that dominates the unresolved ~ 20-25%of the 6-8 kev cosmic x-ray background (xrb). this sample was constructed byapplying mass and color cuts to sources from a parent catalog based ongoods-south hst z-band imaging of the central 6'-radius area of the 4 ms cdf-s.the stacked 6-8 kev detection is significant at the 3.9 sigma level, but thestacked emission was not detected in the 4-6 kev band which indicates theexistence of an underlying population of highly obscured active galactic nuclei(agns). further examinations of these 6845 galaxies indicate that the galaxieson the top of the blue cloud and with redshifts of 1 &lt; z &lt; 3, magnitudes of 25&lt; z_850 &lt; 28, and stellar masses of 2e8 &lt; m_star/m_sun &lt; 2e9 make the majoritycontributions to the unresolved 6-8 kev xrb. such a population is seeminglysurprising given that the majority of the x-ray detected agns reside in massive(&gt; ~1e10 m_sun) galaxies. we discuss constraints upon this underlying agnpopulation, supporting evidence for relatively low-mass galaxies hosting highlyobscured agns, and prospects for further boosting the stacked signal.

1209.0916	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s ii. a 9-20 kev selection of heavily  obscured active galaxies at z&gt;1.7	we present results on a search of heavily obscured active galaxies z&gt;1.7using the rest-frame 9-20 kev excess for x-ray sources detected in the deepxmm-cdfs survey. out of 176 sources selected with the conservative detectioncriteria (&gt;8 sigma) in the first source catalogue of ranalli et al., 46 objectslie in the redshift range of interest with the median redshift z~2.5. theirtypical rest-frame 10-20 kev luminosity is 1e+44 erg/s, as observed. amongoptically faint objects that lack spectroscopic redshift, four were found to bestrongly absorbed x-ray sources, and the enhanced fe k emission or absorptionfeatures in their x-ray spectra were used to obtain x-ray spectroscopicredshifts. using the x-ray colour-colour diagram based on the rest-frame 3-5kev, 5-9 kev, and 9-20 kev bands, seven objects were selected for their 9-20kev excess and were found to be strongly absorbed x-ray sources with columndensity of nh &gt; 0.6e+24 cm-2, including two possible compton thick sources.while they are emitting at quasar luminosity, ~3/4 of the sample objects arefound to be absorbed by nh &gt; 1e+22 cm-2. a comparison with local agn at thematched luminosity suggests an increasing trend of the absorbed source fractionfor high-luminosity agn towards high redshifts.

1209.1478	spectral energy distributions of type 1 agn in the cosmos survey i - the  xmm-cosmos sample	the "cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) enables the study of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of active galactic nuclei (agn) because of the deepcoverage and rich sampling of frequencies from x-ray to radio. here we presenta sed catalog of 413 x-ray (\xmm) selected type 1 (emission line fwhm$&gt;2000$ kms$^{-1}$) agn with magellan, sdss or vlt spectrum. the seds are corrected forthe galactic extinction, for broad emission line contributions, constrainedvariability, and for host galaxy contribution. we present the mean sed and thedispersion seds after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 ghz to 40kev, and show examples of the variety of seds encountered. in the near-infraredto optical (rest frame $\sim 8\mu m$-- 4000\aa), the photometry is complete forthe whole sample and the mean sed is derived from detections only. reddeningand host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of theobserved sed variety. the seds are all available on-line.

1209.2420	occupation of x-ray selected galaxy groups by x-ray agn	we present the first direct measurement of the mean halo occupationdistribution (hod) of x-ray selected agn in the cosmos field at z &lt; 1, based onthe association of 41 xmm and 17 c-cosmos agn with member galaxies of 189 x-raydetected galaxy groups from xmm and chandra data. we model the mean agnoccupation in the halo mass range logm_200[msun] = 13-14.5 with a rolling-offpower-law with the best fit index alpha = 0.06(-0.22;0.36) and normalizationparameter f_a = 0.05(0.04;0.06). we find the mean hod of agn among centralgalaxies to be modelled by a softened step function at logmh &gt; logmmin = 12.75(12.10,12.95) msun while for the satellite agn hod we find a preference for anincreasing agn fraction with mh suggesting that the average number of agn insatellite galaxies grows slower (alpha_s &lt; 0.6) than the linear proportion(alpha_s = 1) observed for the satellite hod of samples of galaxies. we presentan estimate of the projected auto correlation function (acf) of galaxy groupsover the range of r_p = 0.1-40 mpc/h at &lt;z&gt; = 0.5. we use the large-scaleclustering signal to verify the agreement between the group bias estimated byusing the observed galaxy groups acf and the value derived from the group massestimates. we perform a measurement of the projected agn-galaxy groupcross-correlation function, excluding from the analysis agn that are withingalaxy groups and we model the 2-halo term of the clustering signal with themean agn hod based on our results.

1209.4193	the high-redshift (z&gt;3) agn population in the 4 ms chandra deep field  south	we present results from a spectral analysis of a sample of high-redshift(z&gt;3) x-ray selected agn in the 4 ms chandra deep field south (cdf-s), thedeepest x-ray survey to date. the sample is selected using the most recentspectroscopic and photometric information available in this field. it consistsof 34 sources with median redshift z=3.7, 80 median net counts in the 0.5-7 kevband and median rest-frame absorption-corrected luminosity $l_{2-10\rmn{kev}}\approx1.5\times10^{44}\rmn{erg} \rmn{s^{-1}}$. spectral analysis forthe full sample is presented and the intrinsic column density distribution,corrected for observational biases using spectral simulations, is compared withthe expectations of x-ray background (xrb) synthesis models. we find that$\approx57$ per cent of the sources are highly obscured($n_h&gt;10^{23}\rmn{cm^{-2}}$). source number counts in the $0.5-2\rmn{kev}$ banddown to flux $f_{0.5-2 \rmn{kev}}\approx4\times10^{-17}\rmn{erg}\rmn{s^{-1}cm^{-2}}$ are also presented. our results are consistent with adecline of the agn space density at z&gt;3 and suggest that, at those redshifts,the agn obscured fraction is in agreement with the expectations of xrbsynthesis models.

1210.2521	goods-herschel: radio-excess signature of hidden agn activity in distant  star-forming galaxies	we present here a new spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting approachthat we adopt to select radio-excess sources amongst distant star-forminggalaxies in the goods-herschel (north) field and to reveal the presence ofhidden, highly obscured agn. through extensive sed analysis of 458 galaxieswith radio 1.4 ghz and mid-ir 24 um detections using some of the deepestchandra x-ray, spitzer and herschel infrared, and vla radio data available todate, we have robustly identified a sample of 51 radio-excess agn (~1300deg^-2) out to redshift z~3. these radio-excess agn have a significantly lowerfar-ir/radio ratio (q&lt;1.68) than the typical relation observed for star-forminggalaxies (q~2.2). we find that ~45% of these radio-excess sources have adominant agn component in the mid-ir band, while for the remainders the excessradio emission is the only indicator of agn activity. the fraction ofradio-excess agn increases with x-ray luminosity reaching ~60% atlx~10^44-10^45 erg/s, making these sources an important part of the total agnpopulation. however, almost half (24/51) of these radio-excess agn are notdetected in the deep chandra x-ray data, suggesting that some of these sourcesmight be heavily obscured. we also find that the specific star formation rates(ssfrs) of the radio-excess agn are on average lower that those observed forx-ray selected agn hosts, indicating that our sources are forming stars moreslowly than typical agn hosts, and possibly their star formation isprogressively quenching.

1210.6377	spectrum of the unresolved cosmic x ray background: what is unresolved  50 years after its discovery	we study the spectral properties of the unresolved cosmic x-ray background(cxrb) in the 1.5-7.0 kev energy band with the aim of providing anobservational constraint on the statistical properties of those sources thatare too faint to be individually probed. we made use of the swift x-rayobservation of the chandra deep field south complemented by the chandra data.exploiting the lowest instrument background (swift) together with the deepestobservation ever performed (chandra) we measured the unresolved emission at thedeepest level and with the best accuracy available today. we find that theunresolved cxrb emission can be modeled by a single power law with a very hardphoton index gamma=0.1+/-0.7 and a flux of 5(+/-3)e-12 cgs in the 2.0-10 kevenergy band (1 sigma error). thanks to the low instrument background of theswift-xrt, we significantly improved the accuracy with respect to previousmeasurements. these results point towards a novel ingredient in agn populationsynthesis models, namely a positive evolution of the compton-thick agnpopulation from local universe to high redshift.

1302.1062	the chandra-cosmos survey iv: x-ray spectra of the bright sample	we present the x-ray spectral analysis of the 390 brightest extragalacticsources in the chandra-cosmos catalog, showing at least 70 net counts in the0.5-7 kev band. this sample has a 100% completeness in optical-iridentification, with 75% of the sample having a spectroscopic redshift and 25%a photometric redshift. our analysis allows us to accurately determine theintrinsic absorption, the broad band continuum shape ({\gamma}) and intrinsicl(2-10) distributions, with an accuracy better than 30% on the spectralparameters for 95% of the sample. the sample is equally divided in type-1(49.7%) and type-2 agn (48.7%) plus few passive galaxies at low z. we found asignificant difference in the distribution of {\gamma} of type-1 and type-2,with small intrinsic dispersion, a weak correlation of {\gamma} with l(2-10)and a large population (15% of the sample) of high luminosity, highly obscured(qso2) sources. the distribution of the x ray/optical flux ratio (log(fx /fi))for type-1 is narrow (0 &lt; x/o &lt; 1), while type-2 are spread up to x/o = 2. thex/o correlates well with the amount of x-ray obscuration. finally, a smallsample of compton thick candidates and peculiar sources is presented. in theappendix we discuss the comparison between chandra and xmm-newton spectra for280 sources in common. we found a small systematic difference, with xmm-newtonspectra that tend to have softer power-laws and lower obscuration.

1303.5556	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs iv. candidate compton-thick agn	the chandra deep field is the region of the sky with the highestconcentration of x-ray data available: 4ms of chandra and 3ms of xmm data,allowing excellent quality spectra to be extracted even for faint sources. wetake advantage of this in order to compile a sample of heavily obscured activegalactic nuclei (agn) using x-ray spectroscopy. we select our sample among the176 brightest xmm sources, searching for either a) flat x-ray spectra (photonindex&lt;1.4 at the 90% confidence level) suggestive of a reflection dominatedcontinuum or b) an absorption turn-over suggestive of a column density higherthan ~10^{24} cm-2. we find a sample of nine candidate heavily obscured sourcessatisfying the above criteria. four of these show statistically significantfekalpha lines with large equivalent widths (three out of four have ewconsistent with 1 kev) suggesting that these are the most secure compton-thickagn candidates. two of these sources are transmission dominated while the othertwo are most probably reflection dominated compton-thick agn. although thissample of four sources is by no means statistically complete, it represents thebest example of compton-thick sources found at moderate-to-high redshift withthree sources at z=1.2-1.5 and one source at z=3.7. using spitzer and herschelobservations, we estimate with good accuracy the x-ray to mid-ir (12 micron)luminosity ratio of our sources. these are well below the average agn relation,independently suggesting that these four sources are heavily obscured.

1304.5717	the xmm-newton deep survey in the chandra deep field south. iii. point  source catalogue and number counts in the hard x-rays	(abridged) the xmm-newton survey in the chandra deep field south (xmm-cdfs)aims at detecting and studying the spectral properties of a significant numberof obscured and compton-thick agn. the large effective area of xmmin the 2--10and 5--10 kev bands, coupled with a 3.45 ms nominal exposure time, allows us tobuild clean samples in both bands, and makes the xmm-cdfs the deepest xmmsurvey currently published in the 5--10 kev band. the large multi-wavelengthand spectroscopic coverage of the cdfs area allows for an immediate andabundant scientific return. we present the data reduction of the xmm-cdfsobservations, the method for source detection in the 2--10 and 5--10kev bands,and the resulting catalogues. a number of 339 and 137 sources are listed in theabove bands with flux limits of 6.6e-16 and 9.5e-16 erg/s/cm^2, respectively.the flux limits at 50% of the maximum sky coverage are 1.8e-15 and 4.0e-15erg/s/cm^2, respectively. the catalogues have been cross-correlated with thechandra ones: 315 and 130 identifications have been found with alikelihood-ratio method, respectively. a number of 15 new sources, previouslyundetected by chandra, is found; 5 of them lie in the 4 ms area. redshifts,either spectroscopic or photometric, are available for ~92% of the sources. thenumber counts in both bands are presented and compared to other works. thesurvey coverage has been calculated with the help of two extensive sets ofsimulations, one set per band. the simulations have been produced with anewly-developed simulator, written with the aim of the most carefulreproduction of the background spatial properties. we present a detaileddecomposition of the xmm background into its components: cosmic, particle, andresidual soft protons.

1305.6167	obscured agn at z~1 from the zcosmos-bright survey i. selection and  optical properties of a [ne v]-selected sample	a sample of 94 narrow line agn with 0.65&lt;z&lt;1.20 has been selected from the20k-bright zcosmos galaxy sample by detection of the high-ionization [nev]3426line. taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the cosmosfield, the properties of the [nev]-selected type-2 agn have been investigated,focusing on their host galaxies, x-ray emission, and optical line flux ratios.finally, the diagnostic developed by gilli et al. (2010), based on the x-ray to[nev] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavilyobscured agn. we found that [ne v]-selected narrow line agn have seyfert 2-likeoptical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-formingcomponent. the acs morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectraindicate a preference for our type-2 agn to be hosted in early-spirals withstellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)msun, on average higher than those ofthe galaxy parent sample. the fraction of galaxies hosting [nev]-selectedobscured agn increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at2x10^11 msun. a comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows thatthe detection of the [ne v] line is an effective method to select agn in theoptical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provideby itself a complete census of agn2. finally, the high fraction of[nev]-selected type-2 agn not detected in medium-deep chandra observations(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of compton-thick sources in our sample.the presence of a population of heavily obscured agn is corroborated by thex-ray to [nev] ratio; we estimated, by mean of x-ray stacking technique andsimulations, that the compton-thick fraction in our sample of type-2 agn is43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the xrb synthesismodels.

1309.0814	the obscured fraction of agn in the xmm-cosmos survey: a spectral energy  distribution perspective	the fraction of agn luminosity obscured by dust and re-emitted in the mid-iris critical for understanding agn evolution, unification, and parsec-scale agnphysics. for unobscured (type-1) agn, where we have a direct view of theaccretion disk, the dust covering factor can be measured by computing the ratioof re-processed mid-ir emission to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity. weuse this technique to estimate the obscured agn fraction as a function ofluminosity and redshift for 513 type-1 agn from the xmm-cosmos survey. there-processed and intrinsic luminosities are computed by fitting the 18-bandcosmos photometry with a custom sed-fitting code, which jointly models emissionfrom: hot-dust in the agn torus, the accretion disk, and the host-galaxy. wefind a relatively shallow decrease of the luminosity ratio as a function oflbol, which we interpret as a corresponding decrease in the obscured fraction.in the context of the receding torus model, where dust sublimation reduces thecovering factor of more luminous agn, our measurements require a torus heightwhich increases with luminosity as h ~ lbol^{0.3-0.4}. our obscuredfraction-luminosity relation agrees with determinations from sdss censuses oftype-1 and type-2 quasars, and favors a torus optically thin to mid-irradiation. we find a much weaker dependence of obscured fraction on 2-10 kevluminosity than previous determinations from x-ray surveys, and argue thatx-ray surveys miss a significant population of highly obscured compton-thickagn. our analysis shows no clear evidence for evolution of obscured fractionwith redshift.

1311.1305	the incidence of obscuration in active galactic nuclei	we study the incidence of nuclear obscuration on a complete sample of 1310agn selected on the basis of their rest-frame 2-10 kev x-ray flux from thexmm-cosmos survey, in the redshift range 0.3&lt;z&lt;3.5. we classify the agn asobscured or un-obscured on the basis of either the optical spectral propertiesand the overall sed or the shape of the x-ray spectrum. the two classificationsagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be furthersubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities x-ray un-obscured agndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/uv continuum emission in theiroptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at highluminosities broad line agn may have absorbed x-ray spectra, which hints at anincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration. weconfirm that the fraction of obscured agn is a decreasing function of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity, while the incidence of absorption shows significantevolution only for the most luminous agn, which appear to be more commonlyobscured at higher redshift. we find no significant difference between the meanstellar masses and star formation rates of obscured and un-obscured agn hosts.we conclude that the physical state of the medium responsible for obscurationin agn is complex, and mainly determined by the radiation environment (nuclearluminosity) in a small region enclosed within the gravitational sphere ofinfluence of the central black hole, but is largely insensitive to the widerscale galactic conditions.

1311.1376	analysis of x-ray spectral variability and black hole mass determination  of the nls1 galaxy mrk 766	we present an xmm-newton time-resolved spectral analysis of the nls1 galaxymrk 766. we analyse eight available observations of the epic-pn camera takenbetween may 2000 and june 2005 to investigate the x-ray spectral variability asproduced by changes in the mass accretion rate. the 0.2-10 kev spectra areextracted in time bins longer than 3 ks to accurately trace the variations ofthe best fit parameters of our adopted comptonisation spectral model. we test abulk-motion comptonisation (bmc) model which is in general applicable to anyphysical system powered by accretion onto a compact object, and assumes thatsoft seed photons are efficiently up-scattered via inverse compton scatteringin a hot and dense electron corona. the comptonised spectrum has acharacteristic power-law shape, whose slope was found to increase for largevalues of the normalisation of the seed component, that is proportional to themass accretion rate (in eddington units). our baseline spectral model alsoincludes a warm absorber lying on the line of sight and radiation reprocessingfrom the accretion disk or from outflowing matter in proximity of the centralcompact object. our study reveals that the normalisation-slope correlation,observed in galactic black hole sources (gbhs), also holds for mrk 766:variations of the photon index in the range gamma~1.9-2.4 are indeed likely tobe related to the variations of m-dot, as observed in x-ray binary systems. wefinally applied a scaling technique based on the observed correlation toestimate the bh mass in mrk 766. this technique is commonly and successfullyapplied to measure masses of gbhs, and this is the first time it is applied indetail to estimate the bh mass in an agn. we obtain a value ofm_{bh}=1.26^{+1.00}_{-0.77}x10^6 m_{sun} that is in very good agreement withthat estimated by the reverberation mapping

1312.1087	the dust content of qso hosts at high redshift	infrared observations of high-z quasar (qso) hosts indicate the presence oflarge masses of dust in the early universe. when combined with otherobservables, such as neutral gas masses and star formation rates, the dustcontent of z~6 qso hosts may help constraining their star formation history. wehave collected a database of 58 sources from the literature discovered byvarious surveys and observed in the fir. we have interpreted the available databy means of chemical evolution models for forming proto-spheroids,investigating the role of the major parameters regulating star formation anddust production. for a few systems, given the derived small dynamical masses,the observed dust content can be explained only assuming a top-heavy initialmass function, an enhanced star formation efficiency and an increased rate ofdust accretion. however, the possibility that, for some systems, the dynamicalmass has been underestimated cannot be excluded. if this were the case, thedust mass can be accounted for by standard model assumptions. we providepredictions regarding the abundance of the descendants of qso hosts; albeitrare, such systems should be present and detectable by future deep surveys suchas euclid already at z&gt;4.

1312.2264	agn x-ray variability in the xmm-cosmos survey	we took advantage of the observations carried out by xmm in the cosmos fieldduring 3.5 years, to study the long term variability of a large sample of agn(638 sources), in a wide range of redshift (0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5) and x-ray luminosity($10^{41}&lt;$l(2-10)$&lt;10^{45.5}$). both a simple statistical method to asses thesignificance of variability, and the normalized excess variance($\sigma^{2}_{rms}$) parameter, where used to obtain a quantitative measurementof the variability. variability is found to be prevalent in most agn, wheneverwe have good statistic to measure it, and no significant differences betweentype-1 and type-2 agn were found. a flat (slope -0.23+/-0.03) anti-correlationbetween $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity is found, when significantlyvariable sources are considered all together. when divided in three redshiftbins, the anti-correlation becomes stronger and evolving with z, with higherredshift agn being more variable. we prove however that this effect is due tothe pre-selection of variable sources: considering all the sources withavailable $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ measurement, the evolution in redshift disappears.for the first time we were also able to study the long term x-ray variabilityas a function of $m_{\rm bh}$ and eddington ratio, for a large sample of agnspanning a wide range of redshift. an anti-correlation between$\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and $m_{\rm bh}$ is found, with the same slope of theanti-correlation between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and x-ray luminosity, suggestingthat the latter can be a byproduct of the former one. no clear correlation isfound between $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the eddington ratio in our sample.finally, no correlation is found between the x-ray $\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and theoptical variability.

1403.2491	nustar j033202-2746.8: direct constraints on the compton reflection in a  heavily obscured quasar at z~2	we report nustar observations of nustar j033202-2746.8, a heavily obscured,radio-loud quasar detected in the extended chandra deep field-south, thedeepest layer of the nustar extragalactic survey (~400 ks, at its deepest).nustar j033202-2746.8 is reliably detected by nustar only at e&gt;8 kev and has avery flat spectral slope in the nustar energy band (gamma=0.55^{+0.62}_{-0.64};3-30 kev). combining the nustar data with extremely deep observations bychandra and xmm-newton (4 ms and 3 ms, respectively), we constrain thebroad-band x-ray spectrum of nustar j033202-2746.8, indicating that this sourceis a heavily obscured quasar (n_h=5.6^{+0.9}_{-0.8}x10^23 cm^-2) withluminosity l_{10-40 kev}~6.4x10^44 erg s^-1. although existing optical andnear-infrared (near-ir) data, as well as follow-up spectroscopy with the keckand vlt telescopes, failed to provide a secure redshift identification fornustar j033202-2746.8, we reliably constrain the redshift z=2.00+/-0.04 fromthe x-ray spectral features (primarily from the iron k edge). the nustarspectrum shows a significant reflection component (r=0.55^{+0.44}_{-0.37}),which was not constrained by previous analyses of chandra and xmm-newton dataalone. the measured reflection fraction is higher than the r~0 typicallyobserved in bright radio-loud quasars such as nustar j033202-2746.8, which hasl_{1.4 ghz}~10^27 w hz^-1. constraining the spectral shape of agn, includingbright quasars, is very important for understanding the agn population, and canhave a strong impact on the modeling of the x-ray background. our results showthe importance of nustar in investigating the broad-band spectral properties ofquasars out to high redshift.

1406.3961	the primordial environment of super massive black holes: large scale  galaxy overdensities around $z\sim6$ qsos with lbt	we investigated the presence of galaxy overdensities around four $z\sim6$qsos, namely sdss j1030+0524 (z = 6.28), sdss j1148+5251 (z = 6.41), sdssj1048+4637 (z = 6.20) and sdss j1411+1217 (z = 5.95), through deep $r$-, $i$-and $z$- band imaging obtained with the wide-field ($\sim23'\times25'$) largebinocular camera (lbc) at the large binocular telescope (lbt). we adoptedcolor-color selections within the $i-z$ vs $r-z$ plane to identify samples of$i$-band dropouts at the qso redshift and measure their relative abundance andspatial distribution in the four lbc fields, each covering $\sim8\times8$physical mpc at $z\sim6$. the same selection criteria were then applied to$z$-band selected sources in the $\sim$1 deg$^2$ subaru-xmm newton deep surveyto derive the expected number of dropouts over a blank lbc-sized field($\sim$0.14 deg$^2$). the four observed qso fields host a number of candidateslarger than what is expected in a blank field. by defining as $i$-band dropoutsobjects with $z_{ab}&lt;25$, $i-z&gt;1.4$ and undetected in the $r$-band, we found16, 10, 9, 12 dropouts in sdss j1030+0524, sdss j1148+5251, sdss j1048+4637,and sdss j1411+1217, respectively, whereas only 4.3 such objects are expectedover a 0.14 deg$^2$ blank field. this corresponds to overdensity significancesof 3.3, 1.9, 1.7, 2.5$\sigma$, respectively. by considering the total number ofdropouts in the four lbc fields and comparing it with what is expected in fourblank fields of 0.14 deg$^2$ each, we find that high-z qsos reside in overdenseenvironments at the $3.7\sigma$ level. this is the first direct and unambiguousmeasurement of the large scale structures around $z\sim6$ qsos.

0803.3620	tracing the mass-dependent star formation history of late-type galaxies  using x-ray emission: results from the chandra deep fields	we report on the x-ray evolution over the last ~9 gyr of cosmic history(i.e., since z = 1.4) of late-type galaxy populations in the chandra deepfield-north and extended chandra deep field-south (cdf-n and e-cdf-s,respectively; jointly cdfs) survey fields. our late-type galaxy sample consistsof 2568 galaxies, which were identified using rest-frame optical colors and hstmorphologies. we utilized x-ray stacking analyses to investigate the x-rayemission from these galaxies, emphasizing the contributions from normalgalaxies that are not dominated by active galactic nuclei (agns). over thisredshift range, we find significant increases (factors of ~5--10) in thex-ray--to--optical mean luminosity ratio (l_x/l_b) and thex-ray--to--stellar-mass mean ratio (l_x/m*) for galaxy populations selected byl_b and m*, respectively. when analyzing galaxy samples selected via sfr, wefind that the mean x-ray--to--sfr ratio (l_x/sfr) is consistent with beingconstant over the entire redshift range for galaxies with sfr = 1--100 msolyr^-1, thus demonstrating that x-ray emission can be used as a robust indicatorof star-formation activity out to z = 1.4. we find that the star-formationactivity (as traced by x-ray luminosity) per unit stellar mass in a givenredshift bin increases with decreasing stellar mass over the redshift range z =0.2--1, which is consistent with previous studies of how star-formationactivity depends on stellar mass. finally, we extend our x-ray analyses tolyman break galaxies at z ~ 3 and estimate that l_x/l_b at z ~ 3 is similar toits value at z = 1.4.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1409.6361	the space density of compton-thick agn at z~0.8 in the zcosmos-bright  survey	the obscured accretion phase in bh growth is a key ingredient in many modelslinking the agn activity with the evolution of their host galaxy. at present, acomplete census of obscured agn is still missing. the purpose of this work isto assess the reliability of the [nev] emission line at 3426 a to pick upobscured agn up to z~1 by assuming that [nev] is a reliable proxy of theintrinsic agn luminosity and using moderately deep x-ray data to characterizethe amount of obscuration. a sample of 69 narrow-line (type 2) agn atz=0.65-1.20 were selected from the 20k-zcosmos bright galaxy sample on thebasis of the presence of the [nev] emission. the x-ray properties of thesegalaxies were then derived using the chandra-cosmos coverage of the field; thex-ray-to-[nev] flux ratio, coupled with x-ray spectral and stacking analyses,was then used to infer whether compton-thin or compton-thick absorption werepresent in these sources. then the [nev] luminosity function was computed toestimate the space density of compton-thick (ct) agn at z~0.8. twenty-threesources were detected by chandra, and their properties are consistent withmoderate obscuration (on average, ~a few 10^{22} cm^-2). the x-ray propertiesof the remaining 46 x-ray undetected type 2 agn were derived using x-raystacking analysis. current data indicate that a fraction as high as ~40% of thepresent sample is likely to be ct. the space density of ct agn withlogl_2-10kev&gt;43.5 at z=0.83 is (9.1+/-2.1) 10^{-6} mpc^{-3}, in good agreementwith both xrb model expectations and the previously measured space density forobjects in a similar redshift and luminosity range. we regard our selectiontechnique for ct agn as clean but not complete, since even a mild extinction inthe nlr can suppress [nev] emission. therefore, our estimate of their spacedensity should be considered as a lower limit.

1409.7693	clustering properties of moderate luminosity x-ray selected type 1 and  type 2 agn at z~3	we investigate, for the first time at z~3, the clustering properties of 189type 1 and 157 type 2 x-ray active galactic nuclei (agn) of moderate luminosity(log&lt;lbol&gt; = 45.3 erg/s), with photometric or spectroscopic redshifts in therange 2.2&lt;z&lt;6.8. these samples are based on chandra and xmm-newton data incosmos. we find that type 1 and type 2 cosmos agn at z=3 inhabit dmhs withtypical mass of logmh = 12.84+0.10/-0.11 and 11.73+0.39/-0.45 msun/h,respectively. this result requires a drop in the halo masses of type 1 and 2cosmos agn at z~3 compared to z&lt;2 xmm cosmos agn with similar luminosities.additionally, we infer that unobscured cosmos agn at z~3 reside in 10 timesmore massive halos compared to obscured cosmos agn, at 2.6sigma level. thisresult extends to z~3 that found in cosmos at z&lt;2, and rules out the picture inwhich obscuration is purely an orientation effect. a model which assumes thatthe agn activity is triggered by major mergers is quite successful inpredicting both the low halo mass of cosmos agn and the typical mass ofluminous sdss quasars at z~3, with the latter inhabiting more massive halosrespect to moderate luminosity agn. alternatively we can argue, at least fortype 1 cosmos agn, that they are possibly representative of an early phase offast (i.e. eddington limited) bh growth induced by cosmic cold flows or diskinstabilities. given the moderate luminosity, these new fast growing bhs havemasses of e7-8 msun at z~3 which might evolve into e8.5-9 msun mass bhs at z=0.following our clustering measurements, we argue that this fast bh growth at z~3in agn with moderate luminosity occurs in dmhs with typical mass of 6 times e12msun/h.

1501.03620	mass without radiation: heavily obscured agn, the x-ray background and  the black hole mass density	a recent revision of black hole scaling relations (kormendy &amp; ho 2013),indicates that the local mass density in black holes should be increased by upto a factor of five with respect to previously determined values. the localblack hole mass density is connected to the mean radiative efficiency ofaccretion through the time integral of the agn volume density and a significantincrease of the local black holes mass density would have interestingconsequences on agn accretion properties and demography. one possibility toexplain a large black hole mass density is that most of the black hole growthis via radiatively inefficient channels such as super eddington accretion,however, given the intrinsic degeneracies in the soltan argument, this solutionis not unique. here we show how it is possible to accommodate a larger fractionof heavily buried, compton thick agn, without violating the limit imposed bythe hard x-ray and mid-infrared backgrounds spectral energy density.

1505.01153	the most obscured agn in the cosmos field	highly obscured active galactic nuclei (agn) are common in nearby galaxies,but are difficult to observe beyond the local universe, where they are expectedto significantly contribute to the black hole accretion rate density.furthermore, compton-thick (ct) absorbers (nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) suppress even thehard x-ray (2-10 kev) agn nuclear emission, and therefore the column densitydistribution above 10^24 cm^-2 is largely unknown. we present theidentification and multi-wavelength properties of a heavily obscured (nh&gt;~10^25cm^-2), intrinsically luminous (l(2-10kev)&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn at z=0.353 inthe cosmos field. several independent indicators, such as the shape of thex-ray spectrum, the decomposition of the spectral energy distribution andx-ray/[nev] and x-ray/6{\mu}m luminosity ratios, agree on the fact that thenuclear emission must be suppressed by a 10^25 cm^-2 column density. the hostgalaxy properties show that this highly obscured agn is hosted in a massivestar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlatewith the presence of ct absorbers. finally, asymmetric and blueshiftedcomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate thepresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense agn activity(l(bol)/l(edd) = 0.3-0.5). such highly obscured, highly accreting agn areintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be muchmore common at the peak of the star formation and bh accretion history, atz~2-3. we demonstrate that a fully multi-wavelength approach can recover asizable sample of such peculiar sources in large and deep surveys such ascosmos.

1509.05413	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s. ix. an x-ray outflow in a luminous  obscured quasar at z~1.6	in active galactic nuclei (agn)-galaxy co-evolution models, agn winds andoutflows are often invoked to explain why super-massive black holes andgalaxies stop growing efficiently at a certain phase of their lives. they arecommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. evidence ofultra-fast (v&gt;0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of agn has beencollected in the past decade by sensitive x-ray observations for sizablesamples of agn, mostly at low redshift. here we present ultra-deep xmm-newtonand chandra spectral data of an obscured (nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsicallyluminous (l2-10kev~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named pid352) at z~1.6 (derivedfrom the x-ray spectral analysis) in the chandra deep field-south. the sourceis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observedenergies of e~2-3 kev. while the emission line is interpreted as being due toneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorptionfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (fexxv, fexxvi) with anoutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionizationmodels. the mass outflow rate - ~2 msun/yr - is similar to the source accretionrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. pid352 represents oneof the few cases where indications of x-ray outflowing gas have been observedat high redshift thus far. this wind is powerful enough to provide feedback onthe host galaxy.

astro-ph;0001107	the variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992: the case for a revived  agn	we report the transition to an active state of the nucleus in the seyfert 1.9galaxy ngc 2992, discovered by means of new hard x-ray data. while the 2-10 kevflux declined by a factor of ~ 20 from 1978 to 1994, two recent bepposaxobservations in 1997 and in 1998 caught the nuclear emission raising back tothe same level of activity observed in 1978.  in both bepposax observations the x-ray spectrum of the source is wellrepresented by a power law with spectral index gamma ~ 1.7, absorbed by acolumn density of n_h ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2} and characterized by a prominent ironk\alpha line. while in the second bepposax data set the line properties appearto be consistent with those expected from accretion disc models, in the firstbepposax data set the iron feature is rather peculiar. the broadening is notsignificant and the line energy is e_{k\alpha}=6.62 +/- 0.07 kev, indicatingemission from highly ionized iron. the line has too high equivalent width (~700 ev) to be produced by a hot scattering medium. by comparing these data withdata previously in the literature, we interpret the spectral and flux changesin terms of different phases of rebuilding an accretion disc. the timescale forthe disc rebuilding is estimated to range between 1 and 5 years.  the x-ray data are complemented with optical and near-infrared followupspectra taken 1.5 months after the discovery of the x-ray burst. the spectraare characterized by prominent broad emission lines. there is also evidence forhot dust emission in the h and k bands that, however, is probably still in theprocess of increasing.

astro-ph;0002447	optically dim counterparts of hard x-ray selected agns	we present near-ir photometry and imaging observations of a small sample ofsources identified in the bepposax 5-10 kev survey (hellas) which resolves ~20-30% of the x-ray background at these energies. the near-ir data are combinedwith optical spectra and photometry. only 40% of the sources in our sample havethe blue, power law continuum typical of color-selected qsos. the remaining 60%are dominated by a galactic component which, on the basis of the continuumcolors and shape, have ages ranging from 10^9 to 10^10 years. the images showthat the blue qsos are pointlike at our angular resolution, while all the othersources are extended, consistent with their spectral appearance and lowredshift. since down to r=20 only about two thirds of the hellas sources have acounterpart, the preliminary hellas census comprises in roughly equal parts: i)blue qsos (mostly at high redshifts); ii) optically dim, galaxy-dominatedactive nuclei (mostly at modest redshifts); and iii) empty fields (possiblyhighly absorbed qsos at high redshifts).

astro-ph;0002460	the hard x-ray emission of luminous infrared galaxies	we present a study of the hard x-ray properties of a sample that includes allthe luminous infrared galaxies (ligs, l_ir &gt; 10^11 l_sun) observed in the 2-10kev energy band (new and archival data). we find that a significant fraction ofthe sources optically classified as agns do not show any indication of nuclearactivity in the x rays, thus suggesting heavy absorption along our line ofsight. the absence of strong emission in the 20-200 kev band in a subsample ofligs observed with bepposax suggests that in many cases these sources arecompletely compton thick (n_h &gt; 10^25 cm^(-2)). from a comparison between theinfrared and the x-ray emission we deduce that the mid-ir emission is absorbedby a lower column density than the x-ray emission or, alternatively, that thedust-to-gas ratio is lower than galactic. we describe a simple model thatreproduces the ir-x correlation by means of mixed agn and starburstcontributions and we compare the predictions of this model with theobservational data at x-ray and optical wavelengths. finally, we discuss thebiases that affect the currently available samples of ligs and briefly analyzea small unbiased sample, finding that at least 50% of the sources host a (weak)agn.

astro-ph;0006233	sub-mm and x-ray background: two unrelated phenomena?	obscured agns are thought to contribute a large fraction of the hard x-raybackground (2-10 kev), and have also been proposed as the powerhouse of afraction of the scuba sources which make most of the background at 850um, thusproviding a link between the two spectral windows. we have tackled this issueby comparing data at 2-10 kev and at 850um for a sample of 34 sources at fluxes(or limiting fluxes) which resolve most of the background in the two bands. wepresent here new scuba observations, and new correlations between separate datasets retrieved from the literature. similar correlations presented by othersare added for completeness. none of the 11 hard x-ray (2-10 kev) sources has acounterpart at 850um, with the exception of a chandra source in the ssa13field, which is a candidate type 2, heavily absorbed qso at high redshift. theratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly upper limits) of the x-ray sources aresignificantly lower than the value observed for the cosmic background. inparticular, we obtain that 2-10 kev sources brighter than 10^-15 erg s^-1cm^-2, which make at least 75% of the background in this band, contribute forless than 7% to the submillimeter background. out of the 24 scuba sources, 23are undetected by chandra. the ratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly lower limits) ofthese scuba sources indicate that most of them must be powered either bystarburst activity, or by an agn which is obscured by a column nh &gt; 10^25cm^-2, with a reflection efficiency in the hard x rays significantly lower than1% in most cases. however, agns of this type could not contribute significantlyto the 2-10 kev background.

astro-ph;0103014	new results from the x-ray and optical survey of the chandra deep field  south: the 300ks exposure	we present results from 300 ks of x-ray observations of the chandra deepfield south. the field of the four combined exposures is now 0.1035 deg^2 andwe reach a flux limit of 10^{-16} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.5-2 kev soft bandand 10^{-15} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 2-10 kev hard band, thus a factor 2fainter than the previous 120 ks exposure. the total catalogue is composed of197 sources including 22 sources detected only in the hard band, 51 only in thesoft band, and 124 detected in both bands. we have now the optical spectra for86 optical counterparts. we compute the total contribution to the x-raybackground in the 2-10 kev band, which now amounts to (1.45\pm 0.15)*10^{-11}erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} deg^{-2} (after the inclusion of the asca sources to accountfor the bright end) to a flux limit of 10^{-15} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. thiscorresponds to 60-90% of the unresolved hard x-ray background (xrb), given theuncertainties on its actual value.[abridged]

astro-ph;0103198	a classic type 2 qso	in the chandra deep field south 1msec exposure we have found, at redshift3.700 +- 0.005, the most distant type 2 agn ever detected. it is the sourcewith the hardest x-ray spectrum with redshift z&gt;3. the optical spectrum has nodetected continuum emission to a 3sigma detection limit of ~3 10^{-19}ergs/s/cm^2/aa and shows narrow lines of ly_alpha, civ, nv, heii, ovi, [oiii],and ciii]. their fwhm line widths have a range of ~700-2300 km/s with anaverage of approximately ~1500 km/s. the emitting gas is metal rich (z ~2.5-3z_solar). in the x-ray spectrum of 130 counts in the 0.5-7 kev band there isevidence for intrinsic absorption with n_h &gt; 10^{24} cm^{-2}. an iron k_alphaline with rest frame energy and equivalent width of ~6.4 kev and ~1 kev,respectively, in agreement with the obscuration scenario, is detected at a2sigma level. if confirmed by our forthcoming xmm observations this would bethe highest redshift detection of fek_alpha. depending on the assumed cosmologyand the x-ray transfer model, the 2-10 kev rest frame luminosity corrected forabsorption is ~10^{45 +- 0.5} ergs/s, which makes our source a classic exampleof the long sought type 2 qsos. from standard population synthesis models,these sources are expected to account for a relevant fraction of theblack-hole-powered qso distribution at high redshift.

astro-ph;0105271	hst imaging in the chandra deep field south: i. multiple agn populations	we present preliminary results from imaging three hst/wfpc2 fields in v and iwithin the chandra deep field south (cdfs). hst's sensitivity and resolutionare sufficient to reveal optical counterparts for 24 of the 26 cdfs x-raysources detected in the 300 ksec x-ray catalog and to determine themorphologies of most of these. we find that the x-ray sources comprise twoapparently distinct populations of optical candidates: one optically faint (i &gt;24) with v - i colors consistent with the i &gt; 24 field population; the othersignificantly brighter (i &lt; 22) with colors redder than the i &lt; 22 fieldpopulation. more than 2/3 of the x-ray source counterparts are resolvedgalaxies. the brighter sources are mostly agn, based on their high x-rayluminosity. the optically resolved sources in the brighter population have avery narrow range of v - i color and appear to be a mix of both late and earlytype morphologies at low to moderate redshift. we show that the secondpopulation, with fainter optical counterparts, can be explained as higherredshift type 2 agn.

astro-ph;0110385	hst imaging in the chandra deep field south: ii. wfpc2 observations of  an x-ray flux-limited sample from the 1 msec chandra catalog	we present hst/wfpc2 observations of a well-defined sample of 40 x-raysources with x-ray fluxes above the detection threshold of the full 1 msecchandra deep field south (cdfs). the sensitivity and spatial resolution of ourhst observations are sufficient to detect the optical counterparts of 37 of thex-ray sources, yielding information on their morphologies and environments. inthis paper we extend the results obtained in our previous study on the 300 kscdfs x-ray data (schreier et al. 2001, paper i). specifically, we show that theoptical counterparts to the x-ray sources are divided into two distinctpopulations: 1) an optically faint group with relatively blue colors, similarto the faint blue field galaxy population, and 2) an optically brighter group,including resolved galaxies with average colors significantly redder than thecorresponding bright field galaxy population. the brighter objects comprise awide range of types, including early and late type galaxies, starbursts, andagn. by contrast, we show that the faint blue x-ray population are mostconsistent with being predominantly type 2 agn of low to moderate luminosity,located at higher redshifts (z ~ 1 - 2). this conclusion is supported byluminosity function models of the various classes of objects. hence, thecombination of deep x-ray data with the high spatial resolution of hst are forthe first time allowing us to probe the faint end of the agn luminosityfunction at cosmologically interesting redshifts.

astro-ph;0110452	the chandra deep field south: the 1 million second	we present the main results from our 940 ksec observation of the chandra deepfield south (cdfs), using the source catalog described in an accompanying paper(giacconi et al. 2001). we extend the measurement of source number counts to5.5e-17 erg/cm^2/s in the soft 0.5-2 kev band and 4.5e-16 erg/cm^2/s in thehard 2-10 kev band. the hard band logn-logs shows a significant flattening(slope~=0.6) below ~1e-14 erg/cm^2/s, leaving at most 10-15% of the x-raybackground (xrb) to be resolved, the main uncertainty lying in the measurementof the total flux of the xrb. on the other hand, the analysis in the very hard5-10 kev band reveals a relatively steep logn-logs (slope ~=1.3) down to 1e-15erg/cm^2/s. together with the evidence of a progressive flattening of theaverage x-ray spectrum near the flux limit, this indicates that there is stilla non negligible population of faint hard sources to be discovered at energiesnot well probed by chandra, which possibly contribute to the 30 kev bump in thespectrum of the xrb. we use optical redshifts and identifications, obtainedwith the vlt, for one quarter of the sample to characterize the combinedoptical and x-ray properties of the cdfs sample. different source types arewell separated in a parameter space which includes x-ray luminosity, hardnessratio and r-k color. type ii objects, while redder on average than the fieldpopulation, have colors which are consistent with being hosted by a range ofgalaxy types. type ii agn are mostly found at z&lt;~1, in contrast withpredictions based on agn population synthesis models, thus suggesting arevision of their evolutionary parameters.

astro-ph;0112184	chandra deep field south: the 1msec catalog	in this paper we present the source catalog obtained from a 942 ks exposureof the chandra deep field south (cdfs), using acis-i on the chandra x-rayobservatory. catalog generation proceeded simultaneously using two differentmethods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the sextractoralgorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for chandraobservations. the detection threshold has been set in order to have less than10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. we subdivided thecatalog into four sections. the primary list consists of objects common to thetwo detection methods. two secondary lists contain sources which were detectedby: 1) the sextractor algorithm alone and 2) the wavelet technique alone. thefourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. the flux limitsat the aimpoint for the soft (0.5--2 kev) and hard (2--10 kev) bands are5.5e-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 4.5e-16 erg/s/cm^2 respectively. the total number ofsources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5--2 kev band, and 251in the 2--10 kev band.  we also present optical identifications for the catalogued sources. ourprimary optical data is r band imaging to a depth of r~26.5 (vega). we foundthat the r-band/chandra offsets are small, ~1 arcsec. coordinatecross-correlation finds 85% of the chandra sources covered in r to havecounterparts within the 3-sigma error box (&gt;~1.5 arcsec depending on off-axisangle and signal-to-noise). the unidentified fraction of sources, approximately~10--15 %, is close to the limit expected from the observed x-ray flux tor-band ratio distribution for the identified sample.

astro-ph;0208033	warm-hot intergalactic baryons revealed	several popular cosmological models predict that most of the baryonic mass inthe local universe is located in filamentary and sheet-like structuresassociated with galaxy overdensities. this gas is expected to begravitationally heated to ~10^6 k and therefore emitting in the soft x-rays. wehave detected diffuse soft x-ray structures in a high galactic latitude rosatfield after point source subtraction and correction for galactic absorption.these diffuse structures have an x-ray energy distribution that is much softerthan expected from clusters, groups or unresolved emission from agns, but areconsistent with that expected from a diffuse warm intergalactic medium. todiscriminate between a galactic or extragalactic nature of the diffuse gas wehave correlated the soft x--map with multiband optical images in this field. wehave found a significant overdensity of galaxies in correspondence with thestrongest diffuse x-ray structure. the photometric redshift distribution of thegalaxies over the x-ray peak has an excess over field galaxies at z~0.45. thisresult strongly suggests that the diffuse x-ray flux is due to extragalacticemission by warm gas associated with an overdense galaxy region at z~0.45.

astro-ph;0303115	the x-ray background and the deep x-ray surveys	the deep x-ray surveys performed by the two major x-ray observatories onflight, chandra and xmm, are being resolving the bulk of the cosmic x-raybackground (xrb) in the 2-10 kev energy band, where the sky flux is dominatedby extragalactic emission. although the actual fraction depends on the absolutesky flux, which is measured with an uncertainty of ~40%, most of the xrb isalready resolved. optical identifications of the x-ray sources in the deepsurveys are being showing that these are mainly agn, most of which beingobscured as predicted by population synthesis models. however, first resultsindicate that the redshift distribution of the sources making the xrb seems topeak at much lower redshift than predicted by the models. in this article iwill briefly review and discuss the measurements of the xrb spectrum and theagn synthesis models of the xrb. then, i will introduce the chandra and xmmdeep x-ray surveys, mainly focusing on the chandra deep field north and south.finally, the properties of the x-ray sources populating the deep surveys willbe described and compared with the predictions of the most recent synthesismodels.

astro-ph;0304177	tracing the large scale structure in the chandra deep field south	we report the discovery of large scale structures of x-ray sources in the1msec observation of the chandra deep field south. two main structures appearas narrow (delta_z &lt; 0.02) spikes in the source redshift distribution at z=0.67and z=0.73, respectively. their angular distribution spans a region at least ~17 arcmin wide, corresponding to a physical size of 7.3 h_{70}^{-1} mpc at aredshift of z ~ 0.7 (omega_m=0.3, omega_{lambda}=0.7). these spikes arepopulated by 19 sources each, which are mainly identified as active galacticnuclei (agn). two sources in each spike are extended in x-rays, correspondingto galaxy groups/clusters embedded in larger structures. the x-ray sourceredshift distribution shows other spikes, the most remarkable at z=1.04, 1.62and 2.57. this is one of the first evidences for large scale structure tracedby x-ray sources and for spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn. the x-raydata have been complemented with the spectroscopic data from the k20 nearinfrared survey (cimatti et al. 2002), which covers ~1/10 of the x-ray field.also in this survey the source redshift distribution shows several spikes. twonarrow structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73 (again with delta_z ~ 0.02) are the mostsignificant features, containing 24 and 47 galaxies, respectively. while thek20 structure at z=0.73 is dominated by a standard galaxy cluster with asignificant concentration around a central cd galaxy and morphologicalsegregation, the galaxies at z=0.67 constitute a loose structure ratheruniformly distributed along the k20 field.[abridged]

astro-ph;0305285	a puzzling x-ray source found in the chandra deep field south	in this letter we report the detection of an extremely strong x-ray emissionline in the 940ks chandra acis-i spectrum of cxo cdfs j033225.3-274219. thesource was identified as a type1 agn at redshift of z = 1.617, with 2.0 -- 10.0kev rest frame x-ray luminosity of ~ 10^44 ergs s^-1. the emission line wasdetected at 6.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1} kev, with an equivalent width (ew) of4.4^{+3.2}_{-1.4} kev, both quantities referring to the observed frame. in therest frame, the line is at 16.2^{+0.4}_{-0.3} kev with an ew of11.5^{+8.3}_{-3.7} kev. an x-ray emission line at similar energy (~ 17 kev,rest frame) in qso pks 2149-306 was discovered before using asca data. wereject the possibility that the line is due to a statistical or instrumentalartifact. the line is most likely due to blueshifted fe-k emission from anrelativistic outflow, probably an inner x-ray jet, with velocities of the orderof ~ 0.6-0.7c. other possible explanations are also discussed.

astro-ph;0311619	local supermassive black holes, relics of active galactic nuclei and the  x-ray background	we quantify the importance of mass accretion during agn phases in the growthof supermassive black holes (bh) by comparing the mass function of black holesin the local universe with that expected from agn relics, which are black holesgrown entirely with mass accretion during agn phases. the local bh massfunction (bhmf) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between bhmass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity andvelocity functions. the density of bh's in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) (h/0.7)^2 10^5 msun mpc^-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuityequation with the only assumption that agn activity is due to accretion ontomassive bh's and that merging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf atz=0 is generated mainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical inthe sense that smaller bh's (mbh&lt; 10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) withrespect to more massive one's (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that thebhmf of agn relics is perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating thelocal bh's were mainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtainedwhile satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the x-raybackground. the comparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the mergingprocess is not important in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts(z&lt;3). our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local black holesgrew during agn phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiationwith efficiencies epsilon = 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda =0.1-1.7 of the eddington luminosity. the average total lifetime of these activephases ranges from ~4.5 10^8 yr for mbh&lt; 10^8 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0406029	24 micron properties of x-ray selected agn	we examine the 24 micron to x-ray color of 157 x-ray--selected agn as afunction of x-ray obscuration and optical classification in the chandra deepfield south. the sample consists of the chandra hard--band detections with hardflux &gt;10^-15 erg/s/cm^2. a deep 24 micron mosaic obtained with spitzer providesmid--infrared fluxes for the sample. since obscured agn locally have higher 24micron / 2-8 kev ratios than unobscured agn, and since x-ray background modelspredict a large population of obscured agn, we expect to find many x-ray--hard,ir--bright agn. instead, we find that the 24 micron to x-ray flux ratio doesnot depend on x-ray hardness in the full sample, nor does it differ betweennarrow--line and broad--line agn. we identify 5 nearly compton--thick agn, andfind they have similar 24 micron to x-ray flux ratios compared to the fullsample. we consider agn in the narrow redshift spikes at z~0.7; for these agn,there is some evidence that the flux ratio increases with x-ray hardness. theredshift slice also shows an odd trend, which is also prominent in the fullsample: a group of x-ray--hard agn with very low 24 micron to x-ray fluxratios.

astro-ph;0406482	photometric redshift of x-ray sources in the chandra deep field south	based on the photometry of 10 near-uv, optical, and near-infrared bands ofthe chandra deep field south, we estimate the photometric redshifts for 342x-ray sources, which constitute ~99% of all the detected x-ray sources in thefield. the models of spectral energy distribution are based on galaxies and acombination of power-law continuum and emission lines. color information isuseful for source classifications: type-i agn show non-thermal spectralfeatures that are distinctive from galaxies and type-ii agn. the hardness ratioin x-ray and the x-ray-to-optical flux ratio are also useful discriminators.using rudimentary color separation techniques, we are able to further refineour photometric redshift estimations. among these sources, 137 have reliablespectroscopic redshifts, which we use to verify the accuracy of photometricredshifts and to modify the model inputs. the average relative dispersion inredshift distribution is ~8%, among the most accurate for photometric surveys.the high reliability of our results is attributable to the high quality andbroad coverage of data as well as the applications of several independentmethods and a careful evaluation of every source. we apply our redshiftestimations to study the effect of redshift on broadband colors and to studythe redshift distribution of agn. our results show that both the hardness ratioand u-k color decline with redshift, which may be the result of a k-correction.the number of type-ii agn declines significantly at z&gt;2 and that of galaxiesdeclines at z&gt;1. however, the distribution of type-i agn exhibits less redshiftdependence. as well, we observe a significant peak in the redshift distributionat z=0.6. we demonstrate that our photometric redshift estimation produces areliable database for the study of x-ray luminosity of galaxies and agn.

astro-ph;0409542	local supermassive black holes and relics of active galactic nuclei	we summarize a study where we test the hypothesis that local black holes (bh)are relics of agn activity. we compare the mass function of bhs in the localuniverse with that expected from agn relics, which are bhs grown entirely withmass accretion during agn phases. the local bh mass function (bhmf) isestimated by applying the well-known correlations between bh mass, bulgeluminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocityfunctions. the density of bhs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5msun mpc-3. the relic bhmf is derived from the continuity equation with theonly assumption that agn activity is due to accretion onto massive bhs and thatmerging is not important. we find that the relic bhmf at z=0 is generatedmainly at z&lt;3. moreover, the bh growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense thatsmaller bhs (mbh&lt;10^7 msun) grow at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) with respect to moremassive ones (z~1-3). unlike previous work, we find that the bhmf of agn relicsis perfectly consistent with the local bhmf indicating the local bhs weremainly grown during agn activity. this agreement is obtained while satisfying,at the same time, the constraints imposed by the x-ray background. thecomparison with the local bhmf also suggests that the merging process is notimportant in shaping the relic bhmf, at least at low redshifts (z&lt;3). ouranalysis thus suggests the following scenario: local bhs grew during agn phasesin which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencieseff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the eddingtonluminosity. the average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.510^8 yr for mbh&lt;10^7 msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for mbh&gt;10^9 msun.

astro-ph;0502542	the chandra deep field south/goods survey. optically faint x-ray sources	we provide important new constraints on the nature and redshift distributionof optically faint (r&gt;25) x-ray sources in the chandra deep field south survey.we show that we can derive accurate photometric redshifts for thespectroscopically unidentified sources thus maximizing the redshiftcompleteness for the whole x-ray sample. our new redshift distribution for thex-ray source population is in better agreement with that predicted by x-raybackground synthesis models; however, we still find an overdensity of lowredshift (z&lt;1) sources. the optically faint sources are mainly x-ray absorbedagn, as determined from direct x-ray spectral analysis and other diagnostics.many of these optically faint sources have high (&gt;10) x-ray-to-optical fluxratios. we also find that ~71% of them are well fitted with the sed of anearly-type galaxy with &lt;z_phot&gt;~1.9 and the remaining 29% with irregular orstarburst galaxies mainly at z_phot&gt;3. we estimate that 23% of the opticallyfaint sources are x-ray absorbed qsos. the overall population of x-ray absorbedqsos contributes a ~15% fraction of the [2-10] kev x-ray background (xrb)whereas current xrb synthesis models predict a ~38% contribution.

astro-ph;0506607	the extended chandra deep field-south survey. chandra point-source  catalogs	we present chandra point-source catalogs for the extended chandra deepfield-south (e-cdf-s) survey. the e-cdf-s consists of four contiguous 250 kschandra observations covering an approximately square region of total solidangle ~0.3 deg^2, which flank the existing ~1 ms chandra deep field-south(cdf-s). the survey reaches sensitivity limits of 1.1 x 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s and6.7 x 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s for the 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev bands, respectively. wedetect 762 distinct x-ray point sources within the e-cdf-s exposure; 589 ofthese sources are new (i.e., not previously detected in the ~1 ms cdf-s). thisbrings the total number of x-ray point sources detected in the e-cdf-s regionto 915 (via the e-cdf-s and ~1 ms cdf-s observations). source positions aredetermined using matched-filter and centroiding techniques; the medianpositional uncertainty is ~0.35". the basic x-ray and optical properties ofthese sources indicate a variety of source types, although absorbed activegalactic nuclei (agns) seem to dominate. in addition to our main chandracatalog, we constructed a supplementary source catalog containing 33 lowersignificance x-ray point sources that have bright optical counterparts (r&lt;23).these sources generally have x-ray-to-optical flux ratios expected for normaland starburst galaxies, which lack a strong agn component. we present basicnumber-count results for our main chandra catalog and find good agreement withthe ~1 ms cdf-s for sources with 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev fluxes greater than 3x 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s and 1 x 10^-15 erg/cm^2/s, respectively. furthermore, threeextended sources are detected in the 0.5-2.0 kev band, which are found to belikely associated with galaxy groups or poor clusters at z ~ 0.1-0.7; thesehave typical rest-frame 0.5-2.0 kev luminosities of (1-5) x 10^42 erg/s.

astro-ph;0601629	low radiative efficiency accretion at work in active galactic nuclei:  the nuclear spectral energy distribution of ngc4565	we derive the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the nucleus of theseyfert galaxy ngc4565. despite its classification as a seyfert2, the nuclearsource is substantially unabsorbed. the absorption we find from chandra data(n_h=2.5 x 10^21 cm^-2) is consistent with that produced by material in thegalactic disk of the host galaxy. hst images show a nuclear unresolved sourcein all of the available observations, from the near-ir h band to the optical uband. the sed is completely different from that of seyfert galaxies and qso, asit appears basically ``flat'' in the ir-optical region, with a small drop-offin the u-band. the location of the object in diagnostic planes for lowluminosity agns excludes a jet origin for the optical nucleus, and itsextremely low eddington ratio l_o/l_edd indicates that the radiation we observeis most likely produced in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf).this would make ngc4565 the first agn in which an adaf-like process isidentified in the optical. we find that the relatively high [oiii] fluxobserved from the ground cannot be all produced in the nucleus. therefore, anextended nlr must exist in this object. this may be interpreted in theframework of two different scenarios: i) the radiation from adafs is sufficientto give rise to high ionization emission-line regions through photoionization,or ii) the nuclear source has recently ``turned-off'', switching from ahigh-efficiency accretion regime to the present low-efficiency state.

astro-ph;0602127	x-ray spectral properties of agn in the chandra deep field south	we present a detailed x-ray spectral analysis of the sources in the 1mscatalog of the chandra deep field south (cdfs) taking advantage of opticalspectroscopy and photometric redshifts for 321 sources. as a default spectralmodel, we adopt a power law with slope gamma with an intrinsic redshiftedabsorption n_h, a fixed galactic absorption and an unresolved fe emission line.for 82 x-ray bright sources, we perform the x-ray spectral analysis leavingboth gamma and n_h free. the weighted mean value is &lt;gamma&gt;~ 1.75+-0.02, withan intrinsic dispersion of sigma~0.30. we do not find hints of a correlationbetween gamma and the n_h. we detect the presence of a scattered component atsoft energies in 8 sources, and a pure reflection spectrum, typical ofcompton-thick agn, in 14 sources (compton-thick agn candidates). the intrinsicn_h distribution shows a lognormal shape, peaking around log(n_h)~23.1 and withsigma~1.1. we find that the fraction of absorbed sources (with n_h&gt;10^{22}cm^{-2}) in the sample is constant (at the level of about 75%) or moderatelyincreasing with redshift. finally, we compare the optical classification to thex-ray spectral properties, confirming that the correspondence of unabsorbed(absorbed) x-ray sources to optical type i (type ii) agn is accurate for atleast 80% of the sources with spectral identification (1/3 of the total x-raysample).

astro-ph;0611251	most hard x-ray selected quasars in chandra deep fields are obscured	measuring the population of obscured quasars is one of the key issues tounderstand the evolution of active galactic nuclei (agns). with a redshiftcompleteness of 99%, the x-ray sources detected in chandra deep field south(cdf-s) provide the best sample for this issue. in this letter we study thepopulation of obscured quasars in cdf-s by choosing the 4 -- 7 kev selectedsample, which is less biased by the intrinsic x-ray absorption. the 4 -- 7 kevband selected samples also filter out most of the x-ray faint sources with toofew counts, for which the measurements of n_h and l_x have very largeuncertainties. simply adopting the best-fit l_2-10kev and n_h, we find 71% (20out of 28) of the quasars (with intrinsic l_2-10kev &gt; 10^44 erg/s) are obscuredwith n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. taking account of the uncertainties in the measurementsof both n_h and l_x, conservative lower and upper limits of the fraction are54% (13 out 24) and 84% (31 out 37). in chandra deep field north, the number is29%, however, this is mainly due to the redshift incompleteness. we estimate afraction of ~ 50% - 63% after correcting the redshift incompleteness with astraightforward approach. our results robustly confirm the existence of a largepopulation of obscured quasars.

astro-ph;0612311	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: i. survey  description	we present the first set of xmm-newton epic observations in the 2 squaredegree cosmos field. the strength of the cosmos project is the unprecedentedcombination of a large solid angle and sensitivity over the wholemultiwavelength spectrum. the xmm-newton observations are very efficient inlocalizing and identifying active galactic nuclei (agn) and clusters as well asgroups of galaxies. one of the primary goals of the xmm-newton cosmos survey isto study the co-evolution of active galactic nuclei as a function of theirenvironment in the cosmic web. here we present the log of observations, imagesand a summary of first research highlights for the first pass of 25 xmm-newtonpointings across the field. in the existing dataset we have detected 1416 newx-ray sources in the 0.5-2, 2-4.5 and 4.5-10 kev bands to an equivalent 0.5-2kev flux limit of 7x10-16 erg cm-2 s-1. the number of sources is expected togrow to almost 2000 in the final coverage of the survey. from an x-ray colorcolor analysis we identify a population of heavily obscured, partially leaky orreflecting absorbers, most of which are likely to be nearby, compton-thick agn.

0809.1939	high precision x-ray logn-logs distributions: implications for the  obscured agn population	we have constrained the extragalactic source count distributions over a broadrange of x-ray fluxes and in various energy bands to test whether thepredictions from x-ray background synthesis models agree with the observationalconstraints provided by our measurements. we have used 1129 xmm-newtonobservations at |b|&gt;20 deg covering a sky area of 132.3 deg^2 to compile thelargest complete samples of x-ray objects to date in the 0.5-1 kev, 1-2 kev,2-4.5 kev, 4.5-10 kev, 0.5-2 kev and 2-10 kev energy bands. our survey includesin excess of 30,000 sources down to ~10^-15 erg/cm^2/s below 2 kev and down to~10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s above 2 kev. a break in the source count distributions wasdetected in all energy bands except the 4.5-10 kev band. an analytical modelcomprising 2 power-law components cannot adequately describe the curvature seenin the source count distributions. the shape of the logn(&gt;s)-logs is stronglydependent on the energy band with a general steepening apparent as we move tohigher energies. this is due to non-agn populations, comprised mainly of starsand clusters of galaxies, contribute up to 30% of the source population atenergies &lt;2 kev and at fluxes &gt;10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, and these populations ofobjects have significantly flatter source count distributions than agn. we finda substantial increase in the relative fraction of hard x-ray sources at higherenergies, from &gt;55% below 2 kev to &gt;77% above 2 kev. however the majority ofsources detected above 4.5 kev still have significant flux below 2 kev.comparison with predictions from the synthesis models suggest that the modelsmight be overpredicting the number of faint absorbed agn, which would call forfine adjustment of some model parameters such as the obscured to unobscured agnratio and/or the distribution of column densities at intermediate obscuration.

astro-ph;0701196	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field ii: x-ray data and  the logn-logs	we present the data analysis and the x-ray source counts for the first seasonof xmm-newton observations in the cosmos field. the survey covers ~2 deg^2within the region of sky bounded by 9^h57.5^m&lt;r.a.&lt;10^h03.5^m;1^d27.5^m&lt;dec&lt;2^d57.5^m with a total net integration time of 504 ks. a maximumlikelihood source detection was performed in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-4.5 kev and4.5-10 kev energy bands and 1390 point-like sources were detected in at leastone band. detailed monte carlo simulations were performed to fully test thesource detection method and to derive the sky coverage to be used in thecomputation of the logn-logs relations. the 0.5--2 kev and 2--10 kevdifferential logn-logs were fitted with a broken power-law model which revealeda euclidean slope (alpha~2.5) at the bright end and a flatter slope (alpha~1.5)at faint fluxes. in the 5--10 kev energy band a single power-law provides anacceptable fit to the observed source counts with a slope alpha~2.4. acomparison with the results of previous surveys shows good agreement in all theenergy bands under investigation in the overlapping flux range.  we also notice a remarkable agreement between our logn-logs relations and themost recent model of the xrb. the slightly different normalizations observed inthe source counts of cosmos and previous surveys can be largely explained as acombination of low counting statistics and cosmic variance introduced by thelarge scale structure.

0809.2098	photometric redshift and classification for the xmm-cosmos sources	we present photometric redshifts and spectral energy distribution (sed)classifications for a sample of 1542 optically identified sources detected withxmm in the cosmos field. our template fitting classifies 46 sources as starsand 464 as non-active galaxies, while the remaining 1032 require templates withan agn contribution. high accuracy in the derived photometric redshifts wasaccomplished as the result of 1) photometry in up to 30 bands with highsignificance detections, 2) a new set of sed templates including 18 hybridscovering the far-uv to mid-infrared, which have been constructed by thecombination of agn and non-active galaxies templates, and 3) multi-epochobservations that have been used to correct for variability (most important fortype 1 agn). the reliability of the photometric redshifts is evaluated usingthe sub-sample of 442 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. weachieved an accuracy of $\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} = 0.014$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z_{spec})} \sim0.015$ fori$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5). the high accuracies were accomplished for both type 2 (wherethe sed is often dominated by the host galaxy) and type 1 agn and qsos out to$z=4.5$. the number of outliers is a large improvement over previousphotometric redshift estimates for x-ray selected sources (4.0% and 4.8%outliers for i$_{ab}^*&lt;$22.5 and i$_{ab}^*&lt;$24.5, respectively). we show thatthe intermediate band photometry is vital to achieving accurate photometricredshifts for agn, whereas the broad sed coverage provided by mid infrared(spitzer/irac) bands is important to reduce the number of outliers for normalgalaxies.

0809.2513	high redshift quasars in the cosmos survey: the space density of z&gt;3  x-ray selected qsos	we present a new measurement of the space density of high redshift(3.0&lt;z&lt;4.5), x-ray selected qsos obtained by exploiting the deep and uniformmultiwavelength coverage of the cosmos survey. we have assembled astatistically large (40 objects), x-ray selected (f_{0.5-2 kev} &gt;10^{-15} cgs),homogeneous sample of z&gt;3 qsos for which spectroscopic (22) or photometric (18)redshifts are available. we present the optical (color-color diagrams) andx-ray properties, the number counts and space densities of the z&gt;3 x-rayselected quasars population and compare our findings with previous works andmodel predictions. we find that the optical properties of x-ray selectedquasars are not significantly different from those of optically selectedsamples. there is evidence for substantial x-ray absorption (logn_h&gt;23 cm^{-2})in about 20% of the sources in the sample. the comoving space density ofluminous (l_x &gt;10^{44} erg s^-1) qsos declines exponentially (by an e--foldingper unit redshift) in the z=3.0-4.5 range, with a behavior similar to thatobserved for optically bright unobscured qsos selected in large area opticalsurveys. prospects for future, large and deep x-ray surveys are also discussed.

astro-ph;9904422	beyond the standard model for the cosmic x-ray background	the synthesis model for the cosmic x-ray background (xrb) -based on theintegrated emission of active galactic nuclei (agns)- is complemented with newobservational results. we adopt the most recent estimates of the agn x-rayluminosity function and evolution. we adopt the column density distribution oftype 2 agns observed in the local universe, instead of describing it as a setof free parameters. we maintain the standard assumptions that type 2 agns havethe same luminosity function -apart from a constant factor- and the sameevolution of type 1s, and that the spectral shapes of both types areindependent of redshift. we explore various parametrizations of the data, andin all cases we find that the xrb can be fitted, but the number density ratioof type 2s to type 1s must be higher than the local value, and/or the hardx-ray counts in the 2-10 kev band and the preliminary bepposax counts in the5-10 kev band are underestimated at a level of a few sigma. these resultsconsistently suggest that type 2 agns could undergo a faster evolution thantype 1s, or other sources with hard x-ray spectra might contribute to the xrbat intermediate or high redshifts.

0810.0720	chasing highly obscured qsos in the cosmos field	(abridged) we take advantage of the deep chandra and spitzer coverage of alarge area (more than 10 times the area covered by the chandra deep fields,cdfs in the cosmos field, to extend the search of highly obscured,compton-thick active nuclei to higher luminosity. these sources have lowsurface density and large samples can be provided only through large areasurveys, like the cosmos survey. we analyze the x-ray properties of cosmos mipssources with 24$\mu$m fluxes higher than 550$\mu$jy. for the mips sources notdirectly detected in the chandra images we produce stacked images in soft andhard x-rays bands. to estimate the fraction of compton-thick agn in the mipssource population we compare the observed stacked count rates and hardnessratios to those predicted by detailed monte carlo simulations including bothobscured agn and star-forming galaxies. the density of lower luminositycompton-thick agn (logl(2-10kev)=43.5-44) at z=0.7--1.2 is $(3.7\pm1.1)\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim67%$ of that of x-ray selectedagn. the comparison between the fraction of infrared selected, compton thickagn to the x-ray selected, unobscured and moderately obscured agn at high andlow luminosity suggests that compton-thick agn follow a luminosity dependencesimilar to that discovered for compton-thin agn, becoming relatively rarer athigh luminosities. we estimate that the fraction of agn (unobscured, moderatelyobscured and compton thick) to the total mips source population is $49\pm10%$,a value significantly higher than that previously estimated at similar 24$\mu$mfluxes. we discuss how our findings can constrain agn feedback models.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.
