0901.4561	veritas observations of the bl lac 1es 1218+304	the veritas collaboration reports the detection of very-high-energy (vhe)gamma-ray emission from the high-frequency-peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304located at a redshift of z=0.182. a gamma-ray signal was detected with astatistical significance of 10.4 standard deviations (10.4 sigma) for theobservations taken during the first three months of 2007, confirming thediscovery of this object made by the magic collaboration. the photon spectrumbetween ~160 gev and ~1.8 tev is well described by a power law with an index ofgamma = 3.08 +/- 0.34_stat +/- 0.2_sys. the integral flux is phi(e &gt; 200 gev) =(12.2 +/- 2.6) x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1, which corresponds to ~6% of that of thecrab nebula. the light curve does not show any evidence for vhe fluxvariability. using lower limits on the density of the extragalactic backgroundlight in the near to mid-infrared we are able to limit the range of intrinsicenergy spectra for 1es 1218+304. we show that the intrinsic photon spectrum hasan index that is harder than gamma = 2.32 +/- 0.37_stat. when includingconstraints from the spectra of 1es 1101-232 and 1es 0229+200, the spectrum of1es 1218+304 is likely to be harder than gamma = 1.86 +/- 0.37_stat.

0911.0873	a connection between star formation activity and cosmic rays in the  starburst galaxy m 82	although galactic cosmic rays (protons and nuclei) are widely believed to bedominantly accelerated by the winds and supernovae of massive stars, definitiveevidence of this origin remains elusive nearly a century after their discovery[1]. the active regions of starburst galaxies have exceptionally high rates ofstar formation, and their large size, more than 50 times the diameter ofsimilar galactic regions, uniquely enables reliable calorimetric measurementsof their potentially high cosmic-ray density [2]. the cosmic rays produced inthe formation, life, and death of their massive stars are expected toeventually produce diffuse gamma-ray emission via their interactions withinterstellar gas and radiation. m 82, the prototype small starburst galaxy, ispredicted to be the brightest starburst galaxy in gamma rays [3, 4]. here wereport the detection of &gt;700 gev gamma rays from m 82. from these data wedetermine a cosmic-ray density of 250 ev cm-3 in the starburst core of m 82, orabout 500 times the average galactic density. this result strongly supportsthat cosmic-ray acceleration is tied to star formation activity, and thatsupernovae and massive-star winds are the dominant accelerators.

0912.0941	probing the nature of the unidentified tev gamma-ray source hess  j0632+057 with swift	new generation tev gamma-ray telescopes have discovered many new sources,including several enigmatic unidentified tev objects. hess j0632+057 is aparticularly interesting unidentified tev source since: it is a point source,it has a possible hard-spectrum x-ray counterpart and a positionally consistentbe star, it has evidence of long-term vhe flux variability, and it ispostulated to be a newly detected tev/x-ray binary. we have obtained swiftx-ray telescope observations of this source from mjd 54857 to 54965, in anattempt to ascertain its nature and to investigate the hypothesis that it's apreviously unknown x-ray/tev binary. variability and spectral propertiessimilar to those of the other 3 known x-ray/tev binaries have been observed,with measured flux increases by factors of approximately 3. x-ray variabilityis present on multiple timescales including days to months; however, no clearsignature of periodicity is present on the timescales probed by these data. ifbinary modulation is present and dominating the measured variability, then theperiod of the orbit is likely to be more than 54 days (half of this campaign),or it has a shorter period with a variable degree of flux modulation onsuccessive high states. if the two high states measured to date are due tobinary modulation, then the favored period is approximately 35-40 days. moreobservations are required to determine if this object is truly a binary systemand to determine the extent that the measured variability is due to inter-orbitflaring effects or periodic binary modulation.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1005.0367	veritas 2008 - 2009 monitoring of the variable gamma-ray source m87	m87 is a nearby radio galaxy that is detected at energies ranging from radioto vhe gamma-rays. its proximity and its jet, misaligned from ourline-of-sight, enable detailed morphological studies and extensive modeling atradio, optical, and x-ray energies. flaring activity was observed at allenergies, and multi-wavelength correlations would help clarify the origin ofthe vhe emission. in this paper, we describe a detailed temporal and spectralanalysis of the veritas vhe gamma-ray observations of m87 in 2008 and 2009. inthe 2008 observing season, veritas detected an excess with a statisticalsignificance of 7.2 sigma from m87 during a joint multi-wavelength monitoringcampaign conducted by three major vhe experiments along with the chandra x-rayobservatory. in february 2008, veritas observed a vhe flare from m87 occurringover a 4-day timespan. the peak nightly flux above 250gev was 7.7% of the crabnebula flux. m87 was marginally detected before this 4-day flare period, andwas not detected afterwards. spectral analysis of the veritas observationsshowed no significant change in the photon index between the flare andpre-flare states. shortly after the vhe flare seen by veritas, the chandrax-ray observatory detected the flux from the core of m87 at a historicalmaximum, while the flux from the nearby knot hst-1 remained quiescent. acciariet al. (2009) presented the 2008 contemporaneous vhe gamma-ray, chandra x-ray,and vlba radio observations which suggest the core as the most likely source ofvhe emission, in contrast to the 2005 vhe flare that was simultaneous with anx-ray flare in the hst-1 knot. in 2009, veritas continued its monitoring of m87and marginally detected a 4.2 sigma excess corresponding to a flux of ~1% ofthe crab nebula. no vhe flaring activity was observed in 2009.

1006.5955	veritas search for vhe gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies	indirect dark matter searches with ground-based gamma-ray observatoriesprovide an alternative for identifying the particle nature of dark matter thatis complementary to that of direct search or accelerator productionexperiments. we present the results of observations of the dwarf spheroidalgalaxies draco, ursa minor, bootes 1, and willman 1 conducted by veritas. thesegalaxies are nearby dark matter dominated objects located at a typical distanceof several tens of kiloparsecs for which there are good measurements of thedark matter density profile from stellar velocity measurements. since theconventional astrophysical background of very high energy gamma rays from theseobjects appears to be negligible, they are good targets to search for thesecondary gamma-ray photons produced by interacting or decaying dark matterparticles. no significant gamma-ray flux above 200 gev was detected from thesefour dwarf galaxies for a typical exposure of ~20 hours. the 95% confidenceupper limits on the integral gamma-ray flux are in the range 0.4-2.2x10^-12photons cm^-2s^-1. we interpret this limiting flux in the context of pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles and derive constraints onthe thermally averaged product of the total self-annihilation cross section andthe relative velocity of the wimps. the limits are obtained under conservativeassumptions regarding the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies and areapproximately three orders of magnitude above the generic theoreticalprediction for wimps in the minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.however significant uncertainty exists in the dark matter distribution as wellas the neutralino cross sections which under favorable assumptions couldfurther lower the limits.

1112.4518	veritas observations of day-scale flaring of m87 in 2010 april	veritas has been monitoring the very-high-energy (vhe; &gt;100gev) gamma-rayactivity of the radio galaxy m87 since 2007. during 2008, flaring activity on atimescale of a few days was observed with a peak flux of (0.70 +- 0.16) x10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1} at energies above 350gev. in 2010 april, veritasdetected a flare from m87 with peak flux of (2.71 +- 0.68) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2}s^{-1} for e&gt;350gev. the source was observed for six consecutive nights duringthe flare, resulting in a total of 21 hr of good quality data. the most rapidflux variation occurred on the trailing edge of the flare with an exponentialflux decay time of 0.90^{+0.22}_{-0.15} days. the shortest detected exponentialrise time is three times as long, at 2.87^{+1.65}_{-0.99} days. the quality ofthe data sample is such that spectral analysis can be performed for threeperiods: rising flux, peak flux, and falling flux. the spectra obtained areconsistent with power-law forms. the spectral index at the peak of the flare isequal to 2.19 +- 0.07. there is some indication that the spectrum is softer inthe falling phase of the flare than the peak phase, with a confidence levelcorresponding to 3.6 standard deviations. we discuss the implications of theseresults for the acceleration and cooling rates of vhe electrons in m87 and theconstraints they provide on the physical size of the emitting region.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1212.4739	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from cta 1 by veritas	we report the discovery of tev gamma-ray emission coincident with theshell-type radio supernova remnant (snr) cta 1 using the veritas gamma-rayobservatory. the source, ver j0006+729, was detected as a 6.5 standarddeviation excess over background and shows an extended morphology, approximatedby a two-dimensional gaussian of semi-major (semi-minor) axis 0.30 degree (0.24degree) and a centroid 5' from the fermi gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 andits x-ray pulsar wind nebula (pwn). the photon spectrum is well described by apower-law dn/de = n_0 (e/3 tev)^(-\gamma), with a differential spectral indexof \gamma = 2.2 +- 0.2_stat +- 0.3_sys, and normalization n_0 = (9.1 +-1.3_stat +- 1.7_sys) x 10^(-14) cm^(-2) s^(-1) tev^(-1). the integral flux,f_\gamma = 4.0 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 1 tev, corresponds to 0.2%of the pulsar spin-down power at 1.4 kpc. the energetics, co-location with thesnr, and the relatively small extent of the tev emission strongly argue for thepwn origin of the tev photons. we consider the origin of the tev emission incta 1.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7144	the most powerful flaring activity from the nlsy1 pmn j0948+0022	we report on multifrequency observations performed during 2012 december-2013august of the first narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy detected in gamma rays, pmnj0948+0022 ($z$ = 0.5846). a gamma-ray flare was observed by the large areatelescope on board fermi during 2012 december-2013 january, reaching a dailypeak flux in the 0.1-100 gev energy range of (155 $\pm$ 31) $\times$10$^{-8}$ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on 2013 january 1, corresponding to an apparent isotropicluminosity of about 1.5$\times$10$^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the gamma-ray flaringperiod triggered swift and veritas observations in addition to radio andoptical monitoring by ovro, mojave, and crts. a strong flare was observed inoptical, uv, and x-rays on 2012 december 30, quasi-simultaneously to thegamma-ray flare, reaching a record flux for this source from optical to gammarays. veritas observations at very high energy (e &gt; 100 gev) during 2013january 6-17 resulted in an upper limit of f (&gt; 0.2 tev) &lt;4.0$\times$10$^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. we compared the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2013 january with that of anintermediate state observed in 2011. the two seds, modelled as synchrotronemission and an external compton scattering of seed photons from a dust torus,can be modelled by changing both the electron distribution parameters and themagnetic field.

1411.1439	veritas observations of the bl lac object pg 1553+113	we present results from veritas observations of the bl lac object pg 1553+113spanning the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. the time-averaged spectrum, measuredbetween 160 and 560\,gev, is well described by a power law with a spectralindex of $4.33 \pm 0.09$. the time-averaged integral flux above $200\,$gevmeasured for this period was $(1.69 \pm 0.06) \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{ph} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to 6.9\% of the crab nebulaflux. we also present the combined $\gamma$-ray spectrum from the fermi largearea telescope and veritas covering an energy range from 100~mev to 560~gev.the data are well fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff at $\rm {101.9\pm 3.2 \, \mathrm{gev}} $. the origin of the cutoff could be intrinsic topg~1553+113 or be due to the $\gamma$-ray opacity of our universe through pairproduction off the extragalactic background light (ebl). given lower limits tothe redshift of $\rm z \negthinspace &gt; \negthinspace 0.395$ based on optical/uvobservations of pg~1553+113, the cutoff would be dominated by ebl absorption.conversely, the small statistical uncertainties of the veritas energy spectrumhave allowed us to provide a robust upper limit on the redshift of pg 1553+113of $z \negthinspace \leq \negthinspace 0.62$. a strongly-elevated mean flux of$(2.50 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{ph} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (10.3\% of the crab nebula flux) was observed during 2012,with the daily flux reaching as high as $(4.44 \pm 0.71) \times 10^{-11} \,\mathrm{ph} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (18.3\% of the crab nebulaflux) on mjd 56048. the light curve measured during the 2012 observing seasonis marginally inconsistent with a steady flux, giving a $\chi^2$ probabilityfor a steady flux of 0.03\%.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1506.06246	veritas detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac  object 1es 1727+502 during bright moonlight observations	during moonlit nights, observations with ground-based cherenkov telescopes atvery high energies (vhe, $e&gt;100$ gev) are constrained since the photomultipliertubes (pmts) in the telescope camera are extremely sensitive to the backgroundmoonlight. observations with the veritas telescopes in the standardconfiguration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ offull moon. since 2012, the veritas collaboration has implemented a newobserving mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage appliedto the pmts (reduced-high-voltage configuration, rhv), or by utilizinguv-transparent filters. while these operating modes result in lower sensitivityand increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing timeis useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiringspectral measurements at the highest energies. in this paper we report thedetection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac object 1es 1727+502during rhv observations. this detection represents the first evidence of vhevariability from this blazar. the integral flux is$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 gev, which is aboutfive times higher than the low-flux state. the detection triggered additional\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. multiwavelength observationswith the flwo 48" telescope, and the swift and fermi satellites are presentedand used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (sed) of this objectduring $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. the sed is then fitted with a standardsynchrotron-self-compton model, placing constraints on the properties of theemitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of therelativistic particle population in the jet.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0602258	tev gamma-ray observations of the perseus and abell 2029 galaxy clusters	galaxy clusters might be sources of tev gamma rays emitted by high-energyprotons and electrons accelerated by large scale structure formation shocks,galactic winds, or active galactic nuclei. furthermore, gamma rays may beproduced in dark matter particle annihilation processes at the cluster cores.we report on observations of the galaxy clusters perseus and abell 2029 usingthe 10 m whipple cherenkov telescope during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005observing seasons. we apply a two-dimensional analysis technique to scrutinizethe clusters for tev emission. in this paper we first determine flux upperlimits on tev gamma-ray emission from point sources within the clusters.second, we derive upper limits on the extended cluster emission. wesubsequently compare the flux upper limits with egret upper limits at 100 mevand theoretical models. assuming that the gamma-ray surface brightness profilemimics that of the thermal x-ray emission and that the spectrum of clustercosmic rays extends all the way from thermal energies to multi-tev energieswith a differential spectral index of -2.1, our results imply that the cosmicray proton energy density is less than 7.9% of the thermal energy density forthe perseus cluster.
