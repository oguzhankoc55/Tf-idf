0903.0880	the demographics of extrasolar planets beyond the snow line with  ground-based microlensing surveys	in the currently-favored paradigm of planet formation, the location of thesnow line in the protoplanetary disk plays a crucial role. determining thedemographics of planets beyond the snow line of stars of various masses is thusessential for testing this model. microlensing is sensitive to planets that aregenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive tocool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.terrestrial) planets. hence, microlensing is uniquely suited and so essentialfor a comprehensive study of this region. microlensing is also sensitive toplanets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets, planets in the galacticbulge and disk, and even planets in external galaxies. these planets can alsoprovide critical constraints on models of planet formation. althoughmicrolensing searches have so far detected only a handful of planets, thesehave already changed our understanding of planet formation beyond the snowline. next generation microlensing surveys, which would be sensitive to tens of"cold earths" in this region, are well advanced in design conception and arestarting initial practical implementation.

0905.3426	characterization of microlensing planets with moderately wide  separations	in future high-cadence microlensing surveys, planets can be detected througha new channel of an independent event produced by the planet itself. the twopopulations of planets to be detected through this channel are wide-separationplanets and free-floating planets. although they appear as similar shorttime-scale events, the two populations of planets are widely different innature and thus distinguishing them is important. in this paper, we investigatethe lensing properties of events produced by planets with moderately wideseparations from host stars. we find that the lensing behavior of these eventsis well described by the chang-refsdal lensing and the shear caused by theprimary not only produces a caustic but also makes the magnification contourelongated along the primary-planet axis. the elongated magnification contourimplies that the light curves of these planetary events are generallyasymmetric and thus the asymmetry can be used to distinguish the events fromthose produced by free-floating planets. the asymmetry can be noticed from theoverall shape of the light curve and thus can hardly be missed unlike the veryshort-duration central perturbation caused by the caustic. in addition, theasymmetry occurs regardless of the event magnification and thus the boundnature of the planet can be identified for majority of these events. the closeapproximation of the lensing light curve to that of the chang-refsdal lensingimplies that the analysis of the light curve yields only the information aboutthe projected separation between the host star and the planet.

0911.5578	the importance of binary gravitational microlensing events through  high-magnification channel	we estimate the detection efficiency of binary gravitational lensing eventsthrough the channel of high-magnification events. from this estimation, we findthat binaries in the separations ranges of 0.1 &lt; s &lt; 10, 0.2 &lt; s &lt; 5, and 0.3 &lt;s &lt; 3 can be detected with ~ 100% efficiency for events with magnificationshigher than a=100, 50, and 10, respectively, where s represents the projectedseparation between the lens components normalized by the einstein radius. wealso find that the range of high efficiency covers nearly the whole mass-ratiorange of stellar companions. due to the high efficiency in wide ranges ofparameter space, we point out that majority of binary-lens events will bedetected through the high-magnification channel in lensing surveys that focuson high-magnification events for efficient detections of microlensing planets.in addition to the high efficiency, the simplicity of the efficiency estimationmakes the sample of these binaries useful in the statistical studies of thedistributions of binary companions as functions of mass ratio and separation.we also discuss other importance of these events.

0707.4211	expansion of the planet detection channels in next-generation  microlensing surveys	we classify various types of planetary lensing signals and the channels ofdetecting them. we estimate the relative frequencies of planet detectionsthrough the individual channels with special emphasis on the new channels to beadditionally provided by future lensing experiments that will survey widefields continuously at high cadence by using very large-format imaging cameras.  from this investigation, we find that the fraction of wide-separation planetsthat would be discovered through the new channels of detecting planetarysignals as independent and repeating events would be substantial. we estimatethat the fraction of planets detectable through the new channels would comprise~15 -- 30% of all planets depending on the models of the planetary separationdistribution and mass ratios of planets. considering that a significantfraction of planets might exist in the form of free-floating planets, thefrequency of planets to be detected through the new channel would be evenhigher. with the expansion of the channels of detecting planet, future lensingsurveys will greatly expand the range of planets to be probed.

0708.1215	near-field microlensing from wide-field surveys	we estimate the rate of near-field microlensing events expected from all-skysurveys and investigate the properties of these events. under the assumptionthat all lenses are composed of stars, our estimation of the event rate rangesfrom \gamma_{tot}~0.2 yr^{-1}$ for a survey with a magnitude limit ofv_{lim}=12 to \gamma_{tot}~20 yr^{-1} for a survey with v_{lim}=18. we findthat the average distances to source stars and lenses vary considerablydepending on the magnitude limit, while the dependencies of the average eventtime scale and lens-source transverse speed are weak and nearly negligible,respectively. we also find that the the average lens-source proper motion ofevents expected even from a survey with v_{lim}=18 would be &lt;\mu&gt; &gt;~ 40 masyr^{-1}, implying that the source and lens of a significant fraction ofnear-field events could be resolved from high-resolution follow-upobservations. from the investigation of the variation of the eventcharacteristics depending on the position of the sky, we find that the averagedistances to source stars and lenses become shorter, the lens-source transversespeed increases, and the time scale becomes shorter as the the galacticlatitude of the field increases. due to the concentration of events near thegalactic plane, we find that &gt;~ 50 % of events would be detected in the fieldwith b &lt;= 20^\circ.

0801.4825	color-shift measurement in microlensing-induced stellar variation from  future space-based surveys	if a microlensing event is caused by a star, the event can exhibit change incolor due to the light from the lens. in the previous and current lensingsurveys, the color shift could not be used to constrain the lens populationbecause the blended light responsible for the color shift is mostly attributedto nearby background stars rather than the lens. however, events to be observedin future space-based surveys do not suffer from blending and thus the colorinformation can be used to constrain lenses. in this paper, we demonstrate theusefulness of future surveys in measuring color shifts. by conductingsimulation of galactic lensing events based on the specification of a proposedspace-based lensing survey, we estimate that the shift in the color of $r-h$will be measured at 5$\sigma$ level for $\sim 12%$ of events that occur onsource stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than $j=22.5$. color-shiftedevents tend to have high magnifications and the lenses will have brightnessesequivalent to those of source stars. the time scales of the color-shiftedevents tend to be longer than those without color shifts. from the massdistribution of lenses, we find that most of the color-shifted events will beproduced by stellar lenses with spectral types down to mid m-type main sequencestars.

1403.1032	reevaluating of the feasibility of ground-based earth-mass microlensing  planet detections	one important strength of the microlensing method in detecting extrasolarplanets is its high sensitivity to low-mass planets. however, it is oftenbelieved that microlensing detections of earth-mass planets from ground-basedobservation would be difficult due to the limit set by finite-source effects.this view comes from the previous estimation of the planet detectionprobability based on the fractional deviation of planetary signals, but properprobability estimation requires to additionally consider the source brightness,which is directly related to the photometric precision. in this paper, wereevaluate the feasibility of low-mass planet detections consideringphotometric precision for different populations of source stars. from this, itis found that contribution of the improved photometric precision to theplanetary signal of a giant-source event is big enough to compensate thedecrease of the magnification excess caused by finite-source effects. as aresult, we find that giant-source events are suitable targets for earth-massplanet detections with significantly higher detection probability than eventsinvolved with source stars of smaller radii and predict that earth-mass planetswould be detected by prospective high-cadence surveys.

0805.1103	a characteristic planetary feature in double-peaked, high-magnification  microlensing events	a significant fraction of microlensing planets have been discovered inhigh-magnification events, and a significant fraction of these events exhibit adouble-peak structure at their peak. however, very wide or very close binariescan also produce double-peaked high-magnification events, with the same grossproperties as those produced by planets. traditionally, distinguishing betweenthese two interpretations has relied upon detailed modeling, which is bothtime-consuming and generally does not provide insight into the observableproperties that allow discrimination between these two classes of models. westudy the morphologies of these two classes of double-peaked high-magnificationevents, and identify a simple diagnostic that can be used to immediatelydistinguish between perturbations caused by planetary and binary companions,without detailed modeling. this diagnostic is based on the difference in theshape of the intra-peak region of the light curves. the shape is smooth andconcave for binary lensing, while it tends to be either boxy or convex forplanetary lensing. in planetary lensing this intra-peak morphology is due tothe small, weak cusp of the planetary central caustic located between the twostronger cusps. we apply this diagnostic to five observed double-peakedhigh-magnification events to infer their underlying nature. a corollary of ourstudy is that good coverage of the intra-peak region of double-peakedhigh-magnification events is likely to be important for their uniqueinterpretation.

0805.2642	microlensing detections of moons of exoplanets	we investigate the characteristic of microlensing signals of earth-like moonsorbiting ice-giant planets. from this, we find that non-negligible satellitesignals occur when the planet-moon separation is similar to or greater than theeinstein radius of the planet. we find that the satellite signal does notdiminish with the increase of the planet-moon separation beyond the einsteinradius of the planet unlike the planetary signal which vanishes when the planetis located well beyond the einstein radius of the star. we also find that thesatellite signal tends to have the same sign as that of the planetary signal.these tendencies are caused by the lensing effect of the star on the moon inaddition to the effect of the planet. we determine the range of satelliteseparations where the microlensing technique is optimized for the detections ofmoons. by setting an upper limit as the angle-average of the projected hillradius and a lower limit as the half of the einstein radius of the planet, wefind that the microlensing method would be sensitive to moons with projectedseparations from the planet of $0.05 {\rm au} \lesssim d_{\rm p} \lesssim 0.24{\rm au}$ for a jupiter-mass planet, $0.03 {\rm au}\lesssim d_{\rm p} \lesssim0.17 {\rm au}$ for a saturn-mass planet, and $0.01 {\rm au} \lesssim d_{\rm p}\lesssim 0.08 {\rm au}$ for a uranus-mass planet. we compare thecharacteristics of the moons to be detected by the microlensing and transittechniques

astro-ph;0001491	better astrometric deblending of gravitional microlensing events by  using the difference image analysis method	due to the choice of very dense star fields for a higher event rate, thecurrent microlensing searches suffer from large uncertainties caused byblending effect. to measure light variations of microlensing events free fromthe effect of blending, a newly developed method of differential image analysis(dia) was proposed for microlensing searches. however, even with the lightvariation curve obtained by using the dia method, dramatic reduction of theuncertainty in the determined einstein time scale is not expected due to thedifficulty in determining the baseline flux of a source star.  however, we show in this paper that if the blending effect is investigated bydetecting the shift of a source star image centroid, the dia method will allowone to detect the blending effect with a significantly enhanced efficiencycompared the efficiency of the current method based on psf photometry (psfmethod). this is because for a given event the centroid shift measurable byusing the dia method, $\delta\theta_{\rm c,dia}$, is {\it always} larger thanthe centroid shift measurable by using the psf method, $\delta\theta_{\rmc,psf}$. we find that the ratio $\delta\theta_{\rm c,dia}/\delta\theta_{\rmc,dia}$ rapidly increases with increasing fraction of blended light. inaddition, for events affected by the same fraction of blended light, the ratio$\delta\theta_{\rm c,dia}/ \delta \theta_{\rm c,dia}$ is larger for the eventwith a lower amplification. therefore, centroid shift measurements by using thedia method will be an efficient method to detect the blending effect especiallyof highly blended events, for which the uncertainties in the determinedeinstein time scale are large, as well as of low amplification events, forwhich the current method is highly inefficient.

astro-ph;0008332	comparison of the two followup observation strategies for gravitational  microlensing planet searches	there are two different strategies of followup observations for the detectionof planets by using microlensing. one is detecting the light curve anomaliesaffected by the planetary caustic from continuous monitoring of all eventsdetected by microlensing survey programs (type i strategy) and the other isdetecting anomalies near the peak amplification affected by the central causticfrom intensive monitoring of high amplification events (type ii strategy). itwas shown by griest &amp; safizadeh that the type ii strategy yields high planetdetection efficiency per event. however, it is not known the planet detectionrate by this strategy can make up a substantial fraction of the total rate. inthis paper, we estimate the relative planet detection rates expected under thetwo followup observation strategies. from this estimation, we find that therate under the type ii strategy is substantial and will comprise $\sim 1/4$ --1/2 of the total rate. we also find that compared to the type i strategy thetype ii strategy is more efficient in detecting planets located outside of thelensing zone. we determine the optimal monitoring frequency of the type iistrategy to be $\sim 20$ times/night, which can be easily achieved by thecurrent microlensing followup programs even with a single telescope.

astro-ph;0010557	on the astrometric behavior of binary microlensing events	despite the suspected binarity for a significant fraction of galactic lenses,the current photometric surveys detected binary microlensing events only for asmall fraction of the total events. the detection efficiency is especially lowfor non-caustic crossing events, which comprise majority of the binary lensingevents, due to the absence of distinctive features in their light curvescombined with small deviations from the standard light curve of a singlepoint-mass event. in addition, even they are detected, it will be difficult todetermine the solution of the binary lens parameters due to the severedegeneracy problem. in this paper, we investigate the properties of binarylensing events expected when they are astrometrically observed by using highprecision interferometers. for this, we construct vector field maps of excesscentroid shifts, which represent the deviations of the binary lensing centroidshifts from those of a single lensing events as a function of source position.  from the analysis of the maps, we find that the excess centroid shifts aresubstantial in a considerably large area around caustics. in addition, theyhave characteristic sizes and directions depending strongly on the sourcepositions with respect to the caustics and the resulting trajectories of thelight centroid (astrometric trajectories) have distinctive features, which canbe distinguished from the deviations caused by other reasons. we classify thetypes of the deviations and investigate where they occur. due to the strongdependency of the centroid shifts on the lens system geometry combined with thedistinctive features in the observed astrometric trajectories, astrometricbinary lensing observations will provide an important tool that can probe theproperties of galactic binary lens population.

astro-ph;0011102	detectability of the parallax-induced deviations in the astrometric  centroid shift trajectories of gravitational microlensing events	the uncertainty of the lens mass can be substantially reduced if it isdetermined from the lens proper motion obtained from astrometric measurementsof the source image centroid shifts, $\vdelta\vtheta_c$, by using highprecision interferometers. however, for the complete resolution of the lensparameter degeneracy it is required to determine the lens parallax by measuringthe parallax-induced deviations in the centroid shifts trajectory, $\vdelta\vdelta \vtheta_c$. in this paper, we investigate the detectabilities of$\vdelta\vtheta_c$ and $\vdelta\vdelt\vtheta_c$ by determining thedistributions of the maximum centroid shifts and the average maximum deviationsexpected for different types of galactic microlensing events caused by variousmasses. from this investigation, we find that as long as sources are brightenough for astrometric observations it is expected that $\vdeltavxtheta_c$ formost events caused by masses greater than 0.1 m_\odot regardless of the eventtypes can be easily detected from observations by using not only the spaceinterfeormetry mission (sim, with a detection threshold ~ 3 \mu-as) but alsothe ground-based interferometers (with a threshold ~30 \mu-as). however,detection of $\vdelta\vdelta\vtheta_c$ from ground-based observations will bedifficult for nearly all galactic bulge self-lensing events, and will berestricted only for small fractions of disk-bulge and halo-lmc events, forwhich the deviations are relatively large. from observations by using the sim,on the other hand, detecting $\vdelta\vdelta\vtheta_c$ will be possible formajority of disk-bulge and halo-lmc events and even for some fraction of bulgeself-lensing events. for the complete resolution of the lens parameterdegeneracy, therefore, sim observations (or equivalent) will be essential.

astro-ph;0202058	a new channel to search for extra-solar systems with multiple planets  via gravitational microlensing	gaudi, naber &amp; sackett pointed out that if an event is caused by a lenssystem containing more than two planets, all planets will affect the centralregion of the magnification pattern, and thus the existence of the multipleplanets can be inferred by detecting additionally deformed anomalies fromintensive monitoring of high magnification events. unfortunately, this methodhas important limitations in identifying the existence of multiple planets anddetermining their parameters due to the degeneracy of the resulting light curveanomalies from those induced by a single planet and the complexity of multipleplanet lensing models. in this paper, we propose a new channel to search formultiple planets via microlensing. the method is based on the fact that theanomalies induced by multiple planets are well approximated by thesuperposition of those of the single planet systems where the individualplanet-primary pairs act as independent lens systems. then, if the sourcetrajectory passes both of the outer deviation regions induced by the individualplanets, one can unambiguously identify the existence of the multiple planets.we illustrate that the probability of successively detecting light curveanomalies induced by two jovian-mass planets located in the lensing zonethrough this channel will be substantial. since the individual anomalies can bewell modeled by much simpler single planet lensing models, the proposed methodhas an important advantage of allowing one to accurately determine theparameters of the individual planets.

astro-ph;0204120	astrometric microlensing: a channel to detect multiple lens systems	if a source star is gravitationally microlensed by a multiple lens system,the resulting light curve can have significant deviations from the standardform of a single lens event. the chance to produce significant deviationsbecomes important when the separations between the component lenses areequivalent to the combined angular einstein ring radius of the system. formultiple lens systems composed of more than two lenses, however, this conditionis difficult to meet because the orbits of such systems are unstable. even ifevents are caused by a multiple lens system with stable orbits where a pair oflenses are closely located and the other component (third body) has a wideseparation from the pair, photometrically identifying the lens multiplicitywill be difficult because the event will be identified either by a binary lensevent caused by the close pair lenses or a single lens event caused by thethird body. in this paper, we show that if a seemingly binary lens event isastrometrically followed up by using future high precision interferometers, theexistence of an additional third body can be identified via a repeating event.we show that the signatures of third bodies can be unambiguously identifiedfrom the characteristic distortions they make in the centroid shifttrajectories. we also show that due to the long range astrometric effect ofthird bodies, the detection efficiency will be considerable even for thirdbodies with large separations from their close lens pairs.

astro-ph;0208210	angular radii of stars via microlensing	we outline a method by which the angular radii of giant and main sequencestars in the galactic bulge can be measured to a few percent accuracy. themethod combines ground-based photometry of caustic-crossing bulge microlensingevents, with a handful of precise astrometric measurements of the lensed starduring the event, to measure the angular radius of the source, theta_*. densephotometric coverage of one caustic crossing yields the crossing timescale dt.less frequent coverage of the entire event yields the einstein timescale t_eand the angle phi of source trajectory with respect to the caustic. thephotometric light curve solution predicts the motion of the source centroid upto an orientation on the sky and overall scale. a few precise astrometricmeasurements therefore yield theta_e, the angular einstein ring radius. thenthe angular radius of the source is obtained by theta_*=theta_e(dt/t_e)sin(phi). we argue that theta_* should be measurable to a few percent accuracyfor galactic bulge giant stars using ground-based photometry from a network ofsmall (1m-class) telescopes, combined with astrometric observations with aprecision of ~10 microarcsec to measure theta_e. we find that a factor of ~50times fewer photons are required to measure theta_e to a given precision forbinary-lens events than single-lens events. adopting parameters appropriate tothe space interferometry mission (sim), ~7 min of sim time is required tomeasure theta_e to ~5% accuracy for giant sources in the bulge. formain-sequence sources, theta_e can be measured to ~15% accuracy in ~1.4 hours.with 10 hrs of sim time, it should be possible to measure theta_* to ~5% for\~80 giant stars, or to 15% for ~7 main sequence stars. a byproduct of such acampaign is a significant sample of precise binary-lens mass measurements.

0808.3014	microlensing zone of planets detectable through the channel of  high-magnification events	a microlensing lensing zone refers to the range of planet-star separationswhere the probability of detecting a planetary signal is high. its conventionaldefinition as the range between $\sim 0.6$ and 1.6 einstein radii of theprimary lens is based on the criterion that a major caustic induced by a planetshould be located within the einstein ring of the primary. however, currentplanetary lensing searches focus on high-magnification events to detectperturbations induced by another caustic located always within the einsteinring very close to the primary lens (stellar caustic) and thus a new definitionof a lensing zone is needed. in this paper, we determine this lensing zone. byapplying a criterion that detectable planets should produce signals $\geq 5%$,we find that the new lensing zone varies depending on the planet/star massratio unlike the fixed range of the classical zone regardless of the massratio. the lensing zone is equivalent to the classical zone for a planet with aplanet/star mass ratio $q\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ and it becomes wider for heavierplanets. for a jupiter-mass planet, the lensing zone ranges from 0.25 to 3.9einstein radii, corresponding to a physical range between $\sim 0.5$ au and 7.4au for a typical galactic event. the wider lensing zone of centralperturbations for giant planets implies that the microlensing method providesan important tool to detect planetary systems composed of multiple ice-giantplanets.

astro-ph;0405217	prospects for the detection of earth-mass planets	we compare potential state-of-the-art experiments for detecting earth-massplanets around main-sequence stars using radial velocities, transits,astrometry, and microlensing. for conventionally-discussed signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) thresholds, s/n ~ 8, the last three methods are roughly comparablein terms of both the total number of planets detected and the mass distributionof their host stars. however we argue that s/n ~ 25 is a more conservative andrealistic s/n threshold. we show analytically and numerically that the declinein the number of detections as a function of s/n is very steep for radialvelocities, transits, and astrometry, such that the number of expecteddetections at s/n ~ 25 is more than an order-of-magnitude smaller than atconventional s/n thresholds. indeed, unless earth-mass planets are very commonor are packed much closer to their parent stars than in the solar system,future searches using these methods (as they are currently planned) may notyield any reliable earth-mass planet detections. on the other hand,microlensing has a much shallower s/n slope than the other techniques and sohas much greater sensitivity at realistic s/n thresholds. we show that even ifall stars have earth-mass planets at periods of one year (and adopting otheroptimistic assumptions as well), the combined yield of all four techniqueswould be the detection of only about five such planets at s/n ~ 25.

astro-ph;0507057	on the feasibility of characterizing lens stars in future space-based  microlensing surveys	if a light-emitting star is responsible for a gravitational microlensingevent, the lens can be characterized by analyzing the blended light from thelens. in this paper, we investigate the feasibility of characterizing lenses byusing this method in future space-based lensing surveys. to judge thefeasibility of the method, we estimate the portions of events whose blendedflux f_b can be firmly noticed and most of it can be attributed to the lens bycarrying out detailed simulations of galactic bulge lensing events consideringvarious blending sources, including the lens, background stars, and binarycompanions to the lens and source. from this, it is estimated that among theevents to be detected from a survey using a 1 m space telescope, ~27% will haveblending fractions of f_b/f\geq 10% and the blended flux of half of theseevents will be contaminated more than (f_b-f_l)/f_b=20% by the flux fromblending sources other than the lens, implying the contamination of the blendedflux will be substantial. although the contamination by the background starscan be reduced by using an instrument with a higher resolution, it is estimatedthat the blended flux of more than 1/3 of events will still be contaminated(mostly by binary companions) even using a telescope equivalent to the {\ithubble space telescope}, assuming 50% binary frequency. we, therefore, concludethat caution and consideration of the blending contaminants are required inapplying the lens-light analysis method.

astro-ph;0507058	effect of binary source companions on the microlensing optical depth  determination toward the galactic bulge field	currently, gravitational microlensing survey experiments toward the galacticbulge field utilize two different methods of minimizing blending effect for theaccurate determination of the optical depth \tau. one is measuring \tau basedon clump giant (cg) source stars and the other is using `difference imageanalysis (dia)' photometry to measure the unblended source flux variation.despite the expectation that the two estimates should be the same assuming thatblending is properly considered, the estimates based on cg stars systematicallyfall below the dia results based on all events with source stars down to thedetection limit. prompted by the gap, we investigate the previouslyunconsidered effect of companion-associated events on $\tau$ determination.although the image of a companion is blended with that of its primary star andthus not resolved, the event associated with the companion can be detected ifthe companion flux is highly magnified. therefore, companions work effectivelyas source stars to microlensing and thus neglect of them in the source starcount could result in wrong \tau estimation. by carrying out simulations basedon the assumption that companions follow the same luminosity function ofprimary stars, we estimate that the contribution of the companion-associatedevents to the total event rate is ~5f_{bi}% for current surveys and can reachup to ~6f_{bi}% for future surveys monitoring fainter stars, where f_{bi} isthe binary frequency. therefore, we conclude that the companion-associatedevents comprise a non-negligible fraction of all events. however, theircontribution to the optical depth is not large enough to explain the systematicdifference between the optical depth estimates based on the two differentmethods.

astro-ph;0602066	determination of stellar ellipticities in future microlensing surveys	we propose a method that can determine the ellipticities of source stars ofmicrolensing events produced by binary lenses. the method is based on the factthat the products of the caustic-crossing timescale, $\delta t$, and the cosineof the caustic incidence angle of the source trajectory, $\kappa$, of theindividual caustic crossings are different for events involving an ellipticalsource, while the products are the same for events associated with a circularsource. the product $\delta t_\perp =\delta t \cos\kappa$ corresponds to thecaustic-crossing timescale when the incidence angle of the source trajectory is$\kappa=0$. for the unique determination of the source ellipticity, resolutionsof at least three caustic crossings are required. although this requirement isdifficult to achieve under the current observational setup based onalert/follow-up mode, it will be possible with the advent of future lensingexperiments that will survey wide fields continuously at high cadence. fortypical galactic bulge events, the difference in $\delta t_\perp$ betweencaustic crossings is of the order of minutes depending on the sourceorientations and ellipticities. considering the monitoring frequency of thefuture lensing surveys of $\sim 6$ times/hr and the improved photometryespecially of the proposed space-based survey, we predict that ellipticitydeterminations by the proposed method will be possible for a significantfraction of multiple caustic-crossing binary lens events involving source starshaving non-negligible ellipticities.

astro-ph;0603040	secure identification of free-floating planets	among the methods proposed to detect extrasolar planets, microlensing is theonly technique that can detect free-floating planets. free-floating planets aredetected through the channel of short-duration isolated lensing events.however, if a seemingly isolated planetary event is detected, it is difficultto firmly conclude that the event is caused by a free-floating planet because awide-separation planet can also produce an isolated event. there were severalmethods proposed to break the degeneracy between the isolated planetary eventsproduced by the free-floating and wide-separation planets, but they areincomplete. in this paper, we show that free-floating planets can be securelyidentified by conducting astrometric follow-up observations of isolated eventsto be detected in future photometric lensing surveys by using high-precisioninterferometers to be operated contemporarily with the photometric surveys. themethod is based on the fact that astrometric lensing effect covers much longerrange of the lens-source separation than the photometric effect. we demonstratethat several astrometric follow-up observations of isolated planetary eventsassociated with source stars brighter than $v\sim 19$ by using the {\it spaceinterferometry mission} with an exposure time of $\lesssim 10 {\rm min}$ foreach observation will make it possible to measure the centroid shift induced byprimaries with projected separations up to $\sim 100 {\rm au}$. therefore, theproposed method is far more complete than previously proposed methods that areflawed by the limited applicability only to planets with projected separations$\lesssim 20 {\rm au}$ or planets accompanied by bright primaries.

astro-ph;9707178	the effect of luminous lens blending in gravitational microlensing  experiments	the most important uncertainty in the results of gravitational microlensingexperiments comes from the difficulties of photometry caused by blending ofsource stars. recently nemiroff (1997) pointed out that the results ofmicrolensing experiments can also be affected by the blending of light from thelens itself if a significant fraction of lenses are composed of stars. in thispaper, we estimate the effects of lens blending on the optical depthdetermination and the derived matter distribution toward the galactic bulge byusing realistic models of the lens matter distribution and a well-constrainedstellar luminosity function. we find that the effect of lens blending islargest for lenses located in the galactic disk. however, lens blending doesnot seriously affect both the determination of the optical depth and thegalactic matter distribution. the decrease in optical depth is $\sim 10%$ evenunder the extreme assumption that lenses are totally composed of stars and diskmatter distribution follows a maximal disk model, in which the lens blendingeffect is most severe.

astro-ph;9807165	the effect of bright lenses in the astrometric measurements of macho  proper motion	in current microlensing experiments, the information about the physicalparameters of individual lenses are obtained from the einstein timescales.however, the nature of machos is still very uncertain despite the large numberof detected events. this uncertainty is mainly due to the degeneracy of thelens parameters in the measured einstein timescales. the degeneracy can belifted in a general fashion if the angular einstein ring radius $\theta_{\rme}$, and thus the macho proper motion, can be measured by conducting accurateastrometric measurements of centroid displacement in the source star image.  in this paper, we analyze the influence of bright lenses on the astrometricmeasurements of the centroid displacement and investigate this effect on thedetermination of $\theta_{\rm e}$. we find that if an event is caused by abright lens, the centroid displacement is distorted by the flux of the lens andresulting astrometric ellipse becomes rounder and smaller with increasing lensbrightness, causing an incorrect determination of the angular einstein ringradius. a lens-blended event cannot be distinguished from a dark lens eventfrom the trajectory of the measured centroid displacements alone because bothevents have elliptical trajectories: the degeneracy between dark and brightlens events. we also find that even with information from the analysis of thelight curve of the event it will still be difficult to resolve the degeneracycaused by the bright lens because the light curve is also affected by lensblending.

astro-ph;9808306	the applicability of the astrometric method in determining the physical  parameters of gravitational microlenses	in this paper, we investigate the applicability of the astrometric method tothe determination of the lens parameters for gravitational microlensing eventstoward both the lmc and the galactic bulge. for this analysis, we investigatethe dependency of the astrometrically determined angular einstein ring radius,$\delta(\theta_{\rm e}/\theta_{\rm e,0})$, on the lens parameters by testingvarious types of events. in addition, by computing $\delta(\theta_{\rme}/\theta_{\rm e,0})$ for events with lensing parameters which are the mostprobable for a given lens mass under the standard models of galactic matterdensity and velocity distributions, we determine the expected distribution ofthe uncertainties as a function of lens mass. from this study, we find that thevalues of the angular einstein ring radius are expected to be measured withuncertainties $\delta(\theta_{\rm e}/\theta_{\rm e,0}) \lesssim 10%$ up to alens mass of $m\sim 0.1 m_\odot$ for both galactic disk-bulge and halo-lmcevents with a moderate observational strategy. the uncertainties are relativelylarge for galactic bulge-bulge self-lensing events, $\delta(\theta_{\rme}/\theta_{\rm e,0}) \sim 25%$ for $m\sim 0.1 m_\odot$, but they can besubstantially reduced by adopting more aggressive observational strategies. wealso find that although astrometric observations can be performed for mostphotometrically detected galactic bulge events, a significant fraction ($\sim45%$) of lmc events cannot be astrometrically observed due to the faintness oftheir source stars.

astro-ph;9810401	analytic relations between the observed gravitational microlensing  parameters with and without the effect of blending	when a microlensing light curve is contaminated by blended light fromunresolved stars near the line of sight to the lensed star, the light curveshape and corresponding parameterization for the event will differ from thevalues expected when the event is not affected by blending. as a result,blending makes it difficult to identify the major lens population and toestimate the amount of lensing matter. in order to estimate the effect ofblending on the result of lensing experiments, it is, therefore, essential toknow how the observed lensing parameters change depending on the fraction ofblended light. previously, the changed lensing parameters were obtained with astatistical method that not only required a large amount of computation timebut also was prone to uncertainty. in this paper, we derive analytic relationsbetween the lensing parameters with and without the effect of blending. byusing these relations, we investigate the dependence of the observed lensingparameters on the amount of blended light, the impact parameter, and thethreshold amplification for event detection.

astro-ph;9901198	improved detection rates for close binaries via astrometric observations  of gravitational microlensing events	in addition to constructing a galactic matter mass function free from thebias induced by the hydrogen-burning limit, gravitational microlensing allowsone to construct a mass function which is less affected by the problem ofunresolved binaries (gaudi &amp; gould). however, even with the method ofmicrolensing, the photometric detection of binaries is limited to binarysystems with relatively large separations of $b\gtrsim 0.4$ of their combinedeinstein ring radius, and thus the mass function is still not totally free fromthe problem of unresolved binaries. in this paper, we show that by detectingdistortions of the astrometric ellipse of a microlensing event with highprecision instruments such as the {\it space interferometry mission}, one candetect close binaries at a much higher rate than by the photometric method. wefind that by astrometrically observing microlensing events, $\sim 50%$ ofbinaries with separations of $0.1r_{\rm e}$ can be detected with the detectionthreshold of 3%. the proposed astrometric method is especially efficient atdetecting very close binaries. with a detection threshold of 3% and a rate of10%, one can astrometrically detect binaries with separations down to $\sim0.01r_{\rm e}$.

astro-ph;9902064	unique determination of the physical parameters of individual machos  from astrometric parallax measurements	the einstein time scale, which is the only information obtained from currentmicrolensing experiments, results from a complicated combination of the lensparameters that we want to determine. of the methods for breaking the lensparameter degeneracy, the most promising and generally applicable method is tomeasure the lens parallax from simultaneous observations of a lensing eventfrom the ground and a heliocentric satellite (gould 1994). however, the elegantidea of parallax measurement, which was proposed to resolve the lens parameterdegeneracy, paradoxically suffers from its own degeneracy due to the ambiguityof the source star trajectory. in this paper, we propose to measure the lensparallax astrometrically by mounting an interferometer instead of a photometerin the proposed parallax satellite. by simultaneously measuring the source starcentroid shifts from a geocentric and an additional heliocentric satellite, onecan determine the lens parallax without ambiguity. if the already planned {\itspace interferometry mission} will be used as one of the satellites, one simplyneeds to replace the photometer in the parallax satellite with an instrumentfor astrometric observation. in addition, since the proposed method can measureboth the lens parallax and the proper motion at the same time, one cancompletely break the lens parameter degeneracy, and therefore uniquelydetermine the physical parameters of individual lenses.

astro-ph;9905141	on the intrinsic bias in detecting caustic crossings between galactic  halo and self-lensing events in the magellanic clouds	in this paper, we investigate the intrinsic bias in detecting causticcrossings between galactic halo and self-lensing events in the magellanicclouds. for this, we determine the region for optimal caustic-crossingdetection in the parameter space of the physical binary separations, $\ell$,and the total binary lens mass, $m$, and find that the optimal regions for bothpopulations of events are similar to each other. in particular, if the galactichalo is composed of lenses with the claimed average mass of $&lt;m&gt;\sim 0.5m_\odot$, the optimal binary separation range of galactic halo events of $3.5au\lesssim \ell\lesssim 14 au$ matches well with that of a magellanic cloudself-lensing event caused by a binary lens with a total mass $m\sim 1 m_\odot$;well within the mass range of the most probable lens population of stars in themagellanic clouds. therefore, our computation implies that if the binaryfractions and the distributions of binary separations of the two populations oflenses are not significantly different from each other, there is no strongdetection bias against galactic halo caustic-crossing events.

astro-ph;9906157	identification of bright lenses from the astrometric observations of  gravitational microlensing events	when a source star is gravitationally microlensed by a dark lens, thecentroid of the source star image is displaced relative to the position of theunlensed source star with an elliptical trajectory. recently, routineastrometric follow-up measurements of these source star image centroid shiftsby using high precision interferometers are proposed to measure the lens propermotion which can resolve the lens parameter degeneracy in the photometricallydetermined einstein time scale. when an event is caused by a bright lens, onthe other hand, the astrometric shift is affected by the light from the lens,but one cannot identify the existence of the bright lens from the observedtrajectory because the resulting trajectory of the bright lens event is also anellipse. as results, lensing parameters determined from the trajectory differfrom those of a dark lens event, causing wrong identification of lenspopulation. in this paper, we show that although the shape and size of theastrometric centroid shift trajectory are changed due to the bright lens, theangular speed of centroid shifts around the apparent position of the unlensedsource star is not affected by the lens brightness. then, one can identify theexistence of the bright lens and determine its brightness by comparing the lensparameters determined from the angular speed curve with those determined fromthe trajectory of observed centroid shifts. once the lens brightness isdetermined, one can correct for the lens proper motion. since the proposedmethod provides both information about the lens brightness (dark or bright) andthe corrected values of the physical parameters of the lens, one cansignificantly better constrain the nature of machos.

astro-ph;9910198	on the baseline flux determination of microlensing events detectable  with the difference image analysis method	to improve photometric precision by removing blending effect, a newlydeveloped technique of difference image analysis (dia) is adopted by severalgravitational microlensing experiment groups. however, the principal problem ofthe dia method is that, by its nature, it has difficulties in measuring thebaseline flux $f_0$ of a source star, causing degeneracy problem in determiningthe lensing parameters of an event. therefore, it is often believed that thedia method is not as powerful as the classical method based on the psfphotometry in determining the einstein time scales $t_{\rm e}$ of events.  in this paper, we demonstrate that the degeneracy problem in microlensingevents detectable from the searches by using the dia method will not be asserious as it is often worried about. this is because a substantial fraction ofevents will be high amplification events for which the deviations of theamplification curves constructed with the wrong baseline fluxes from theircorresponding best-fit standard amplification curves will be considerable evenfor a small amount of the fractional baseline flux deviation $\delta f_0/f_0$.with a model luminosity function of source stars and under realisticobservational conditions, we find that $\sim 30%$ of detectable galactic bulgeevents are expected to have high amplifications and their baseline fluxes canbe determined with uncertainties $\delta f_0/f_0\leq 0.5$.

astro-ph;9911250	distribution of caustic-crossing intervals for galactic binary-lens  microlensing events	detection of caustic crossings of binary-lens gravitational microlensingevents is important because by detecting them one can obtain useful informationboth about the lens and source star. in this paper, we compute the distributionof the intervals between two successive caustic crossings, $f(t_{\rm cc})$, forgalactic bulge binary-lens events to investigate the observational strategy forthe optimal detection and resolution of caustic crossings. from thiscomputation, we find that the distribution is highly skewed toward short$t_{\rm cc}$ and peaks at $t_{\rm cc}\sim 1.5$ days. for the maximal detectionof caustic crossings, therefore, prompt initiation of followup observations forintensive monitoring of events will be important. we estimate that under thestrategy of the current followup observations with a second caustic-crossingpreparation time of $\sim 2$ days, the fraction of events with resolvablecaustic crossing is $\sim 80%$. we find that if the followup observations canbe initiated within 1 day after the first caustic crossing by adopting moreaggressive observational strategies, the detection rate can be improved into$\sim 90%$.

astro-ph;9911375	chromaticity of gravitational microlensing events	in this paper, we investigate the color changes of gravitational microlensingevents caused by the two different mechanisms of differential amplification fora limb-darkened extended source and blending. from this investigation, we findthat the color changes of limb-darkened extended source events (color curves)have dramatically different characteristics depending on whether the lenstransits the source star or not. we show that for a source transit event, thelens proper motion can be determined by simply measuring the turning time ofthe color curve instead of fitting the overall color or light curves. we alsofind that even for a very small fraction of blended light, the color changesinduced by the blending effect is equivalent to those caused by thelimb-darkening effect, causing serious distortion in the observed color curve.therefore, to obtain useful information about the lens and source star from thecolor curve of a limb-darkened extended source event, it will be essential toeliminate or correct for the blending effect. we discuss about the methods forthe efficient correction of the blending effect.

0809.4292	planetary lensing signals of high-magnification events under severe  finite-source effect	we investigate the effect of a finite source on the planetary-lensing signalsof high-magnification events. from this, we find that the dependency of thefinite-source effect on the caustic shape is weak and perturbations surviveeven when the source is substantially bigger than the caustic. specifically, wefind that perturbations with fractional magnification excess $\geq 5%$ survivewhen the source star is roughly 4 times bigger than the caustic. we also findcharacteristic features that commonly appear in the perturbation patterns ofplanetary lens systems affected by severe finite-source effect and thus can beused for the diagnosis of the existence of a companion. these features form inand around a circle with its center located at the caustic center and a radiuscorresponding to that of the source star. the light curve of an event where thesource crosses these features will exhibit a distinctive signal that ischaracterized by short-duration perturbations of either positive or negativeexcess and a flat residual region between these short-duration perturbations.

0704.0968	criteria in the selection of target events for planetary microlensing  follow-up observation	to provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable forplanetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of theprobability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of thelensing magnification and source brightness. in estimating the probability, weconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined asthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to thephotometric precision. from this investigation, we find consistent result fromprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of themagnification. the increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at whichperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. we find this boostoccurs at moderate magnifications of $a\lesssim 20$, implying that probabilitycan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. the probabilityincreases as the source brightness increases. we find that the probability ofevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible evenat magnifications as low as $a\sim 5$. in the absence of rare the prime targetof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe eventswith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alertedevents. due to the increase of the source size with the increase of thebrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certainmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant starswith magnifications $a\gtrsim 70$.

0812.1591	distinguishing between planetary and binary interpretations of  microlensing central perturbations under severe finite-source effect	in the current strategy of microlensing planet searches focusing onhigh-magnification events, wide and close binaries pose important sources ofcontamination that imitates planetary signals. for the purpose of findingsystematic differences, we compare the patterns of central perturbationsinduced by a planet and a binary companion under severe finite-source effect.we find that the most prominent difference shows up in the morphology of theedge features with negative excess that appear at the edge of the circle withits center located at the caustic center and a radius equivalent to the sourceradius. it is found that the feature induced a binary companion forms acomplete annulus, while the feature induced by a planet appears as several arcsegments. this difference provides a useful diagnostic for immediateiscrimination of a planet-induced perturbation from that induced by a binarycompanion, where the absence of a well-developed dip in the residual from thesingle-lensing light curve at both or either of the moments of the causticcenter's entrance into and exit from the source star surface indicates that theperturbation is produced by a planetary companion. we find that that thisdifference is basically caused by the difference between the shapes of thecentral caustics induced by the two different types of companions.
