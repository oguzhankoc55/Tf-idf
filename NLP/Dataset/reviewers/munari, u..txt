0902.4609	stha 55: a carbon mira, not a symbiotic binary	we carried out a vri photometric monitoring of stha 55, and in addition weobtained low resolution absolute spectro-photometry and high resolution echellespectroscopy. our data show that stha 55 is a carbon mira, pulsating with a 395day period, with &lt;v&gt;=13.1 mean brightness and 2.8 mag amplitude in v band. itsuffers from a low reddening (e(b-v)=0.15), lies at a distance of 5 kpc fromthe sun and 1 kpc from the galactic plane, and its heliocentric systemicvelocity is close to +22 km/sec. the difference between the radial velocity ofthe optical absorption spectrum and that of the ha emission is unusually smallfor a carbon mira. the spectrum of stha 55 can be classified as c-n5 c2 6-. its13c/12c isotopic ratio is normal, and lines of baii and other s-type elements,as well as lii, have the same intensity as in field carbon stars of similarspectral type. the balmer emission lines are very sharp and unlike those seenin symbiotic binaries. their intensity changes in phase with the pulsationcycles in the same way as seen in field carbon miras. we therefore concludethat sth 55 is a bona fide, normal carbon mira showing no feature supporting asymbiotic binary classification, as previously hypothesized.

0907.0177	rave spectroscopy of luminous blue variables in the large magellanic  cloud	context: the rave spectroscopic survey for galactic structure and evolutionobtains 8400-8800 ang spectra at 7500 resolving power at the uk schmidttelescope using the 6df multi-fiber positioner. more than 300,000 9&lt;i&lt;12 and|b|&gt;25 deg southern stars have been observed to date. aims: this paper presentsthe first intrinsic examination of stellar spectra from the rave survey, aimedat evaluating their diagnostic potential for peculiar stars and at contributingto the general understanding of luminous blue variables (lbvs). methods: weused the multi-epoch spectra for all seven lbvs observed, between 2005 and2008, in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) by the rave survey. results: wedemonstrate that rave spectra possess significant diagnostic potential whenapplied to peculiar stars and, in particular, lbvs. the behaviour of the radialvelocities for both emission and absorption lines, and the spectral changesbetween outburst and quiescence states are described and found to agree withevidence gathered at more conventional wavelengths. the wind outflow signaturesand their variability are investigated, with multi-components detected in sdoradus. photoionisation modelling of the rich emission line spectrum of r 127shows evidence of a massive detached ionised shell that was ejected during the1982-2000 outburst. surface inhomogeneities in the nuclear-processed material,brought to the surface by heavy mass loss, could have been observed in sdoradus, even if alternative explanations are possible. we also detect thetransition from quiescence to outburst state in r 71. finally, our spectrum ofr 84 offers one of the clearest views of its cool companion.

0910.5930	iphas and the symbiotic stars. ii. new discoveries and a sample of the  most common mimics	in a previous paper [arxiv:0712.2391], we presented the selection criterianeeded to search for symbiotic stars in iphas, the int halpha survey of thenorthern galactic plane. iphas gives us the opportunity to make a systematic,complete search for symbiotic stars in a magnitude-limited volume. follow-upspectroscopy at different telescopes worldwide of a sample of sixty twosymbiotic star candidates is presented. seven out of nineteen s-type candidatesobserved spectroscopically are confirmed to be genuine symbiotic stars. thespectral type of their red giant components, as well as reddening and distance,were computed by modelling the spectra. only one new d-type symbiotic system,out of forty-three candidates observed, was found. this was as expected (seediscussion in our paper on the selection criteria). the object shows evidencefor a high density outflow expanding at a speed larger than 65 km/s. most ofthe other candidates are lightly reddened classical t tauri stars and morehighly reddened young stellar objects that may be either more massive youngstars of haebe type or classical be stars. in addition, a few notable objectshave been found, such as three new wolf-rayet stars and two relativelyhigh-luminosity evolved massive stars. we also found a helium-rich source,possibly a dense ejecta hiding a wr star, which is surrounded by a largeionized nebula.

1003.0758	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models	(abridged) aims:we develop a method for deriving distances from spectroscopicdata and obtaining full 6d phase-space coordinates for the rave survey's seconddata release. methods: we used stellar models combined with atmosphericproperties from rave (teff, logg and [fe/h]) and (j-ks) photometry fromarchival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. we are able to derive the full6d phase-space coordinates for a large sample of rave stars. this method istested with artificial data, hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes andobservations of the open cluster m67. results: when we applied our method to aset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative(statistical) distance errors of &lt; 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) haverelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively. ourvarious tests show that we can reliably estimate distances for main-sequencestars, but there is an indication of potential systematic problems with giantstars. for the main-sequence star sample (defined as those with log(g) &gt; 4),25% (1 744) have relative distance errors &lt; 31%, while 50% (3 488) and 75% (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36% and 42%, respectively. our fulldataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a functionof distance from the galactic plane. the known kinematic substructures in the uand v velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset,confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. weprovide independent measurements of the orientation of the uv velocityellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement withprevious work. conclusions: the distance catalogue for the rave second datarelease is available at http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave

1007.0207	a spectroscopic survey of faint, high-galactic-latitude red clump stars.  i. the high resolution sample	context: their high intrinsic brightness and small dispersion in absolutemagnitude make red clump (rc) stars a prime tracer of galactic structure andkinematics. aims: we aim to derive accurate, multi-epoch radial velocities andatmospheric parameters (teff, log g, [m/h], vrot sin i) of a large sample ofcarefully selected rc stars, fainter than those present in other spectroscopicsurveys and located over a great circle at high galactic latitudes. methods: weacquired data of the program stars of high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) and highresolution with the asiago echelle spectrograph. radial velocities wereobtained by applying cross-correlation and atmospheric parameters via chi2 fitto a synthetic spectral library. extensive tests were carried out byre-observing with the same instrument a large number of standard stars takenfrom a variety of sources in the literature. during these tests, we found thatthe absolute tycho vt magnitude of local red clump stars is not dependent onmetallicity. results: a total of 277 red clump stars (101 of them with a secondepoch observation) of the extended solar neighborhood and 55 calibration starswere observed and included in an output catalog that contains (in addition torelevant support astrometric and photometric data taken from literature) themain output of our survey: accurate multi-epoch radial velocities (sigma(rv)=&lt;0.4 km/s), accurate atmospheric parameters (sigma(teff)=68 k, sigma(log g)=0.11dex, sigma([m/h])=0.10 dex, sigma(vrot sin i)=1.1 km/sec), distances, and spacevelocities (u,v,w).

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1104.3482	on the progenitor system of nova v2491 cygni	nova v2491 cyg is one of just two detected pre-outburst in x-rays. the lightcurve of this nova exhibited a rare "re-brightening" which has been attributedby some as the system being a polar, whilst others claim that a magnetic wd isunlikely. by virtue of the nature of x-ray and spectroscopic observations thesystem has been proposed as a recurrent nova, however the adoption of a 0.1 dayorbital period is generally seen as incompatible with such a system. in thisresearch note we address the nature of the progenitor system and the source ofthe 0.1 day periodicity. through the combination of liverpool telescopeobservations with published data and archival 2mass data we show that v2491cyg, at a distance of 10.5 - 14 kpc, is likely to be a recurrent nova of the usco-class; containing a sub-giant secondary and an accretion disk, rather thanaccretion directly onto the poles. we show that there is little evidence, atquiescence, supporting a ~ 0.1 day periodicity, the variation seen at thisstage is likely caused by flickering of a re-established accretion disk. wepropose that the periodicity seen shortly after outburst is more likely relatedto the outburst rather than the - then obscured - binary system. finally weaddress the distance to the system, and show that a significantly lowerdistance (~ 2 kpc) would result in a severely under-luminous outburst, and assuch favour the larger distance and the recurrent nova scenario.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

0709.4219	is the sky falling? searching for stellar streams in the local milky way  disc in the coravel and rave surveys	we have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local milky waydisc in the coravel and rave surveys. the coravel survey consists of localdwarf stars (nordstrom et al. geneva-copenhagen survey) and local famaey et al.giant stars. we select rave stars with radial velocities that are sensitive tothe galactic vertical space velocity (galactic latitude b &lt; -45 deg). kuiperstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the galactic verticalvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net verticalflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with verticallycoherent kinematics. in contrast to the `field of streams' found in the outerhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by thecoravel dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), coravel giants (completewithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and rave (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoidof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. this issufficiently sensitive to allow our rave sample to rule out the passing of thetidal stream of the disrupting sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solarneighbourhood. this agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit anddissociates it from the helmi et al. halo stream. our constraints on theabsence of the sgr stream near the sun could prove a useful tool fordiscriminating between galactic potential models. the lack of a net verticalflow through the solar neighbourhood in the coravel giants and rave samplesargues against the virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the sun. there areno vertical streams in the coravel giants and rave samples with stellardensities &gt;1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore noevidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

1109.6019	is cgcs 5926 a symbiotic x-ray binary?	we here report on multiwavelength (x-ray to optical) followup observations ofcarbon star cgcs 5926. these were motivated by the fact that this star ispositionally coincident with a faint x-ray emitting object belonging to therosat catalog of sources, thus suggesting a possible symbiotic x-ray binary(syxb) nature for it. our spectrophotometric optical data confirm the giantcarbon star nature of the object and allow us to classify its spectral type asc(6,2). this classification places cgcs 5926 at a distance of about 5 kpc fromearth. bvrcic photometry of the star shows that it displays a variability ofabout 0.3 mag on timescales of months, with the star getting bluer when itsbrightness increases. our photometric data indicate a periodicity of 151 days,which we explain as due to radial pulsations of cgcs 5926 on the basis of itsglobal characteristics. the source is not detected at x-rays with swift/xrtdown to a 0.3-10 kev band luminosity of around 3e32 erg/s. this nondetection isapparently in contrast with the rosat data; however we show that, even if theprobability that cgcs 5926 can be a syxb appears quite low, the presentinformation does not completely rule out such a possibility, while it makesother interpretations even more unlikely if we assume that the rosat detectionwas real. this issue might thus be settled by future, more sensitive,observations at high energies.

1110.4637	historical light curve and search for previous outbursts of nova kt  eridani (2009)	context. nova eridani (2009) caught the eye of the nova community due to itsfast decline from maximum, which was initially missed, and its subsequentdevelopment in the radio and x-ray wavelengths. this system also exhibitsproperties similar to those of the much smaller class of recurrent novae;themselves potential progenitors of type ia supernovae. aims. we aim todetermine the nature and physical parameters of the kt eri progenitor system.methods. we searched the harvard college observatory archive plates for theprogenitor of kt eri to determine the nature of the system, particularly theevolutionary stage of the secondary.we used the data obtained to search for anyperiodic signal and the derived luminosity to estimate a recurrence timescale.furthermore, by comparing the colours of the quiescent system on acolour-magnitude diagram we may infer the nature of the secondary star.results. we identified the progenitor system of kt eri and measured a quiescentmagnitude of &lt; b &gt;= 14.7 \pm 0.4. no previous outburst was found. however, wesuggest that if the nova is recurrent it should be on a timescale of centuries.we find a periodicity at quiescence of 737 days which may arise from reflectioneffects and/or eclipses in the central binary. the periodicity and thequiescence magnitude of the system suggest that the secondary star is evolvedand likely in, or ascending, the red giant branch. a second period is evidentat 376 days which has a sinusoidal like light curve. furthermore, the outburstamplitude of ~ 9 magnitudes is inconsistent with those expected for fastclassical novae (~ 17 magnitudes) which may lend further support for an evolvedsecondary.

1204.6502	exploring the morphology of rave stellar spectra	the radial velocity experiment (rave) is a medium resolution r~7500spectroscopic survey of the milky way which already obtained over half amillion stellar spectra. they present a randomly selected magnitude-limitedsample, so it is important to use a reliable and automated classificationscheme which identifies normal single stars and discovers different types ofpeculiar stars. to this end we present a morphological classification of350,000 rave survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, adimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectralmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving theproperties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. we find that the majority ofall spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there isalso a significant population of several types of peculiars. among them themost populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary andchromospherically active stars. both of them include several thousands ofspectra. particularly the latter group offers significant further investigationopportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single starsalone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional spacecorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

1205.0028	international observational campaigns of the last two eclipses in ee  cephei: 2003 and 2008/9	two observational campaigns were carried out during the eclipses of ee cep in2003 and 2008/9 to verify whether the eclipsing body in the system is indeed adark disk and to understand the observed changes in the depth and durations ofthe eclipses. multicolour photometric data and spectroscopic observations atboth low and high resolution were collected. we numerically modelled thevariations in brightness and colour during the eclipses. we tested models withdifferent disk structure. we considered the possibility of disk precession. thecomplete set of observational data collected during the last three eclipses aremade available to the astronomical community. two blue maxima in the colourindices were detected during these two eclipses, one before and one after thephotometric minimum. the first (stronger) blue maximum is simultaneous with a"bump" that is very clear in all the ubvri light curves. variations in thespectral line profiles seem to be recurrent during each cycle. nai lines alwaysshow at least three absorption components during the eclipse minimum and strongabsorption is superimposed on the h_alpha emission. these observations confirmthat the eclipsing object in ee cep system is indeed a dark, dusty disk arounda low luminosity object. the primary appears to be a rapidly rotating be starthat is strongly darkened at the equator and brightened at the poles. some ofthe conclusions of this work require verification in future studies: (i) acomplex, possibly multi-ring structure of the disk in ee cep; (ii) ourexplanation of the "bump" observed during the last two eclipses in terms of thedifferent times of obscuration of the hot polar regions of the be star by thedisk; and (iii) our suggested period of the disk precession (~11-12 p_orb) andpredicted depth of about 2 mag the forthcoming eclipse in 2014.

1205.0546	kinematic groups beyond the solar neighbourhood with rave	we analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the rave survey in andbeyond the solar neighbourhood.we detect significant overdensities in thevelocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.we findthat the main local kinematic groups are large scale features, surviving atleast up to ~1 kpc from the sun in the direction of anti-rotation, and also at~700 pc below the galactic plane.we also find that for regions located atdifferent radii than the sun, the known groups appear shifted in the velocityplane. for example, the hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity forregions inside the solar circle and a lower value outside. we have alsodiscovered a new group at (u, v) = (92,-22) km/s in the solar neighbourhood andconfirmed the significance of other previously found groups. some of thesetrends detected for the first time are consistent with dynamical models of theeffects of the bar and the spiral arms. more modelling is required todefinitively characterise the non-axisymmetric components of our galaxy usingthese groups.

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1209.0456	thick disk kinematics from rave and the solar motion	radial velocity surveys such as the radial velocity experiment (rave) provideus with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby stars most of whichbelong to the galactic thin, thick disk or halo. ideally, to study the galacticdisks (both thin and thick) one should make use of the multi-dimensionalphase-space and the whole pattern of chemical abundances of their stellarpopulations. in this paper, with the aid of the rave survey, we study the thinand thick disks of the milky way, focusing on the latter. we present atechnique to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on thekinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of thestars. using the padova galaxy model, we checked the ability of our method tocorrectly isolate the thick disk component from the galaxy mixture of stellarpopulations. we introduce selection criteria in order to clean the observedradial velocities from the galactic differential rotation and to take intoaccount the partial sky coverage of rave. we developed a numerical technique tostatistically disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. we deducethe components of the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest (lsr)in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag of the thick diskcomponent relative to the lsr, and the square root of the absolute value of thevelocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk alone. the analysis of the thindisk is presented in another paper. we find good agreement with previousindependent parameter determinations. in our analysis we used photometricallydetermined distances. in the appendix we show that similar values can be foundfor the thick disk alone as derived in the main sections of our paper evenwithout the knowledge of photometric distances.

1302.2468	the wobbly galaxy: kinematics north and south with rave red clump giants	the rave survey, combined with proper motions and distance estimates, can beused to study in detail stellar kinematics in the extended solar neighbourhood(solar suburb). using the red clump, we examine the mean velocity components in3d between an r of 6 and 10 kpc and a z of -2 to 2 kpc, concentrating onnorth-south differences. simple parametric fits to the r, z trends for vphi andthe velocity dispersions are presented. we confirm the recently discoveredgradient in mean galactocentric radial velocity, vr, finding that the gradientis more marked below the plane, with a z gradient also present. the verticalvelocity, vz, also shows clear structure, with indications of ararefaction-compression pattern, suggestive of wave-like behaviour. we performa rigorous error analysis, tracing sources of both systematic and randomerrors. we confirm the north-south differences in vr and vz along theline-of-sight, with the vr estimated independent of the proper motions. thecomplex three-dimensional structure of velocity space presents challenges forfuture modelling of the galactic disk, with the galactic bar, spiral arms andexcitation of wave-like structures all probably playing a role.

1307.6073	the asymmetric drift, the local standard of rest, and implications from  rave data	the determination of the lsr is still a matter of debate. the classical valueof the tangential peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr waschallenged in recent years, claiming a significantly larger value. we show thatthe radial velocity experiment (rave) sample of dwarf stars is an excellentdata set to derive tighter boundary conditions to chemodynamical evolutionmodels of the extended solar neighbourhood. we present an improved jeansanalysis, which allows a better interpretation of the measured kinematics ofstellar populations in the milky way disc. we propose an improved version ofthe str\"omberg relation with the radial scalelengths as the only unknown.binning rave stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric drift(corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more metal-richpopulations. with the standard assumption of velocity-dispersion independentradial scalelengths in each metallicity bin, we redetermine the lsr. the newstr\"omberg equation yields a joint lsr value of v_\sun=3.06 \pm 0.68 km/s,which is even smaller than the classical value based on hipparcos data. thecorresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the metal-rich binto 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an even larger scalelengthfor young metal-poor stars. when adopting the recent sch\"onrich value ofv_\sun=12.24 km/s for the lsr, the new str\"omberg equation yields much largerindividual radial scalelengths of the rave subpopulations, which seemunphysical in part. the new str\"omberg equation allows a cleanerinterpretation of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radialscalelengths. lifting the lsr value by a few km/s compared to the classicalvalue results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of smallervalues for larger velocity dispersions.

1309.4272	constraints on the galactic bar from the hercules stream as traced with  rave across the galaxy	non-axisymmetries in the galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) inducekinematic groups such as the hercules stream. assuming that hercules is causedby the effects of the outer lindblad resonance of the galactic bar, we modelanalytically its properties as a function of position in the galaxy and itsdependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. using data from the ravesurvey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the hercules structure decreasesas a function of galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with ouranalytical model. this allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters ofthe milky way's bar. the combined likelihood function of the bar's patternspeed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\omega_b=(1.89 \pm0.08) \times \omega_0$ where $\omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.assuming a solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,this corresponds to $\omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. on the other hand, the bar'sorientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. in fact,the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between thepattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of ourbest fit results is given by the linear relation $\omega_b/\omega_0=1.91 +0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. for example, for anangle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. theseresults are not very sensitive to the other galactic parameters such as thecircular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the sun, and are robust tobiases in distance.

1309.4293	the rave survey: the galactic escape speed and the mass of the milky way	we construct new estimates on the galactic escape speed at variousgalactocentric radii using the latest data release of the radial velocityexperiment (rave dr4). compared to previous studies we have a database largerby a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selectedsample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from rave and a previously published dataset. we calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of milky way-sized galaxies. our best estimate ofthe local galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed requiredto reach three virial radii $r_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $r_{340}$ isthe galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times thecritical density for closure in the universe. from the escape speed we furtherderive estimates of the mass of the galaxy using a simple mass model with twooptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and anadiabatically contracted navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) sphere. if we fix thelocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher massthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on haloconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint wefind very similar masses for both models. our best estimate for $m_{340}$, themass interior to $r_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times 10^{12}$ m$_\odot$ (corresponding to $m_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times10^{12}$ m$_\odot$). this estimate is in good agreement with recently publishedindependent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more distant halo starsand the satellite galaxy leo i.

1310.1919	in the thick of it: metal-poor disc stars in rave	by selecting in the rave-dr4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpcabove the galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplestthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the milky way. weconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions ofthe thick disc are not gaussian. in particular, we find that the thick disc hasan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [m/h]=-2 dex, contributingroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorterscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. the mean azimuthal velocityof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between themetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on theformation mechanisms of the galactic thick disc. given our simple approach, wefind dvphi/d[m/h] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement withprevious literature values. we complete the study with a brief discussion onthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggestthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed byradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1406.7244	chemical gradients in the milky way from the rave data. ii. giant stars	we provide new constraints on the chemo-dynamical models of the milky way bymeasuring the radial and vertical chemical gradients for the elements mg, al,si, ti, and fe in the galactic disc and the gradient variations as a functionof the distance from the galactic plane ($z$). we selected a sample of giantstars from the rave database using the gravity criterium 1.7$&lt;$log g$&lt;$2.8. wecreated a rave mock sample with the galaxia code based on the besan\c con modeland selected a corresponding mock sample to compare the model with the observeddata. we measured the radial gradients and the vertical gradients as a functionof the distance from the galactic plane $z$ to study their variation across thegalactic disc. the rave sample exhibits a negative radial gradient of$d[fe/h]/dr=-0.054$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ close to the galactic plane ($|z|&lt;0.4$ kpc)that becomes flatter for larger $|z|$. other elements follow the same trendalthough with some variations from element to element. the mock sample hasradial gradients in fair agreement with the observed data. the variation of thegradients with $z$ shows that the fe radial gradient of the rave sample haslittle change in the range $|z|\lesssim0.6$ kpc and then flattens. the ironvertical gradient of the rave sample is slightly negative close to the galacticplane and steepens with $|z|$. the mock sample exhibits an iron verticalgradient that is always steeper than the rave sample. the mock sample alsoshows an excess of metal-poor stars in the [fe/h] distributions with respect tothe observed data. these discrepancies can be reduced by decreasing the numberof thick disc stars and increasing their average metallicity in the besan\c conmodel.

1407.2935	radio frequency models of novae in eruption. i. the free-free process in  bipolar morphologies	observations of novae at radio frequencies provide us with a measure of thetotal ejected mass, density profile and kinetic energy of a nova eruption. theradio emission is typically well characterized by the free-free emissionprocess. most models to date have assumed spherical symmetry for the eruption,although it has been known for as long as there have been radio observations ofthese systems, that spherical eruptions are to simplistic a geometry. in thispaper, we build bipolar models of the nova eruption, assuming the free-freeprocess, and show the effects of varying different parameters on the radiolight curves. the parameters considered include the ratio of the minor- tomajor-axis, the inclination angle and shell thickness (further parameters areprovided in the appendix). we also show the uncertainty introduced when fittingspherical model synthetic light curves to bipolar model synthetic light curves.we find that the optically thick phase rises with the same power law ($s_{\nu}\propto t^2$) for both the spherical and bipolar models. in the bipolar casethere is a "plateau" phase -- depending on the thickness of the shell as wellas the ratio of the minor- to major-axis -- before the final decline, thatfollows the same power law ($s_{\nu} \propto t^{-3}$) as in the spherical case.finally, fitting spherical models to the bipolar model synthetic light curvesrequires, in the worst case scenario, doubling the ejected mass, more thanhalving the electron temperature and reducing the shell thickness by nearly afactor of 10. this implies that in some systems we have been over predictingthe ejected masses and under predicting the electron temperature of the ejecta.

1502.04767	the galah survey: scientific motivation	the galah survey is a large high-resolution spectroscopic survey using thenewly commissioned hermes spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. thehermes spectrograph provides high-resolution (r ~28,000) spectra in fourpassbands for 392 stars simultaneously over a 2 degree field of view. the goalof the survey is to unravel the formation and evolutionary history of the milkyway, using fossil remnants of ancient star formation events which have beendisrupted and are now dispersed throughout the galaxy. chemical tagging seeksto identify such dispersed remnants solely from their common and uniquechemical signatures; these groups are unidentifiable from their spatial,photometric or kinematic properties. to carry out chemical tagging, the galahsurvey will acquire spectra for a million stars down to v~14. the hermesspectra of fgk stars contain absorption lines from 29 elements including lightproton-capture elements, alpha-elements, odd-z elements, iron-peak elements andn-capture elements from the light and heavy s-process and the r-process. thispaper describes the motivation and planned execution of the galah survey, andpresents some results on the first-light performance of hermes.

1503.02072	the imprints of the galactic bar on the thick disk with rave	we study the kinematics of a local sample of stars, located within a cylinderof 500 pc radius centered on the sun, in the rave dataset. we find clearasymmetries in the $v_r$-$v_\phi$ velocity distributions of thin and thick diskstars: here are more stars moving radially outwards for low azimuthalvelocities and more radially inwards for high azimuthal velocities. suchasymmetries have been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to thegalactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures areseen in the thick disk. our findings imply that the velocities of thick diskstars should no longer be described by schwarzschild's, multivariate gaussianor purely axisymmetric distributions. furthermore, the nature of previouslyreported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these couldbe associated with dynamical resonances rather than to accretion events. it isclear that dynamical models of the galaxy must fit the 3d velocitydistributions of the disks, rather than the projected 1d, if we are tounderstand the galaxy fully.

1504.07695	identification of globular cluster stars in rave data i: application to  stellar parameter calibration	we present the identification of potential members of nearby galacticglobular clusters using radial velocities from the radial velocity experimentdata release 4 (rave-dr4) survey database. our identifications are based onthree globular clusters -- ngc 3201, ngc 5139 ($\omega$ cen) and ngc 362 -- allof which are shown to have |rv|&gt;100 km/s. the identification of globularcluster stars in rave dr4 data offers a unique opportunity to test theprecision and accuracy of the stellar parameters determined with the currentlyavailable stellar parameter pipelines (spps) used in the survey, as globularclusters are ideal testbeds for the validation of stellar atmosphericparameters, abundances, distances and ages. for both ngc 3201 and $\omega$ cen,there is compelling evidence for numerous members (&gt; 10) in the rave database;in the case of ngc 362 the evidence is more ambiguous, and there may besignificant foreground and/or background contamination in ourkinematically-selected sample. a comparison of the rave-derived stellarparameters and abundances with published values for each cluster and with bastiisochrones for ages and metallicities from the literature reveals overall goodagreement, with the exception of the apparent underestimation of surfacegravities for giants, in particular for the most metal-poor stars. moreover, ifthe selected members are part of the main body of each cluster our resultswould also suggest that the distances from binney et al. 2013, where onlyisochrones more metal-rich than -0.9 dex were used, are typicallyunderestimated by ~ 40% with respect to the published distances for theclusters, while the distances from zwitter et al. 2010 show stars ranging from1 to ~ 6.5 kpc -- with indications of a trend toward higher distances at lowermetallicities -- for the three clusters analysed in this study.

astro-ph;0105167	on the accuracy of gaia radial velocities	we have obtained 782 real spectra and used them as inputs for 6700 automaticcross-correlation runs to the aim of investigating the radial velocity accuracythat gaia could potentially achieve as function of spectral resolution andsignal-to-noise ratio. we have explored the dispersions 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2ang/pix (bracketing the 0.75 ang/pix currently baselined for the 8490--8740 anggaia range centered on the near-infrared caii triplet) over s/n ranging from 10to 110. we have carefully maintained the condition fwhm (psf) = 2 pixels duringthe acquisition of the 782 input spectra, and therefore the resolutions that wehave explored are 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 ang corresponding to resolving powersr=17200, 8600, 4300 and 2150. we have investigated late-f to early-m stars(constituting the vast majority of gaia targets), slowly rotating (v_{rot} sini = 4 km/sec, as for field stars at these spectral types), of solar metallicity(&lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -0.07) and not binary. the results are accurately described by thesimple law: lg sigma = 0.6(lg s/n)^2 - 2.4(lg s/n) + 1.75(lg d) + 3, wheresigma is the cross-correlation standard error (in km/sec) and d is the spectraldispersion (in ang/pix). the spectral dispersion has turned out to be thedominant factor governing the accuracy of radial velocities, with s/n beingless important and the spectral mis-match being a weak player. these resultsare relevant not only within the gaia context but also to ground-basedobservers because the absence of telluric absorptions and proximity to thewavelengths of peak emission make the explored 8490--8740 ang interval aninteresting option for studies of cool stars with conventional telescopes.

astro-ph;0205288	the mysterious eruption of v838 mon	v838 mon is marking one of the most mysterious stellar outbursts on record.the spectral energy distribution of the progenitor resembles an under-luminousf main sequence star (at v=15.6 mag), that erupted into a cool supergiantfollowing a complex and multi-maxima lightcurve (peaking at v=6.7 mag). theoutburst spectrum show baii, lii and lines of several s-elements, with widep-cyg profiles and a moderate and retracing emission in the balmer lines. alight-echo discovered expanding around the object helped to constrain thedistance (d=790+/-30 pc), providing m_v=+4.45 in quiescence and m_v=-4.35 atoptical maximum (somewhat dependent on the still uncertain e(b-v)=0.5reddening). the general outburst trend is toward lower temperatures and largerluminosities, and continuing so at the time of writing. the object propertiesconflict with a classification within already existing categories: theprogenitor was not on a post-agb track and thus the similarities with theborn-again agb stars fg sge, v605 aql and sakurai's object are limited to thecool giant spectrum at maximum; the cool spectrum, the moderate wind velocity(500 km/sec and progressively reducing) and the monotonic decreasing of the lowionization condition argues against a classical nova scenario. the closestsimilarity is with a star that erupted into an m-type supergiant discovered inm31 by rich et al. (1989), that became however much brighter by peaking atm_v=-9.95, and with v4332 sgr that too erupted into an m-type giant (martini etal. 1999) and that attained a lower luminosity, closer to that of v838 mon.m31-redvar, v4332 sgr and v838 mon could be manifestations of the same and newclass of astronomical objects.

astro-ph;0303513	an energetic stellar outburst accompanied by circumstellar light echoes	some classes of stars, including supernovae and novae, undergo explosiveoutbursts that eject stellar material into space. in 2002, the previouslyunknown variable star v838 monocerotis brightened suddenly by a factor of about10^4. unlike a supernova or nova, v838 mon did not explosively eject its outerlayers; rather, it simply expanded to become a cool supergiant with amoderate-velocity stellar wind. superluminal light echoes were discovered aslight from the outburst propagated into surrounding, pre-existing circumstellardust. here we report high-resolution imaging and polarimetry of the lightechoes, which allow us to set direct geometric distance limits to the object.at a distance of &gt;6 kpc, v838 mon at its maximum brightness was temporarily thebrightest star in the milky way. the presence of the circumstellar dust impliesthat previous eruptions have occurred, and spectra show it to be a binarysystem. when combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behavior,these characteristics indicate that v838 mon represents a hitherto unknown typeof stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physicalexplanation.

astro-ph;0506083	spectroscopic survey of the galaxy with gaia ii. the expected science  yield from the radial velocity spectrometer	the gaia mission is designed as a galaxy explorer, and will measuresimultaneously, in a survey mode, the five or six phase space parameters of allstars brighter than 20th magnitude, as well as providing a description of theirastrophysical characteristics. these measurements are obtained by combining anastrometric instrument with micro-arcsecond capabilities, a photometric systemgiving the magnitudes and colours in 15 bands and a medium resolutionspectrograph named the radial velocity spectrometer (rvs). the latterinstrument will produce spectra in the 848 to 874 nm wavelength range, with aresolving power r = 11 500, from which radial velocities, rotationalvelocities, atmospheric parameters and abundances can be derived. a companionpaper (katz et al. 2004) presents the characteristics of the rvs and itsperformance. this paper details the outstanding scientific impact of thisimportant part of the gaia satellite on some key open questions in present dayastrophysics. the unbiased and simultaneous acquisition of multi-epoch radialvelocities and individual abundances of key elements in parallel with theastrometric parameters is essential for the determination of the dynamicalstate and formation history of our galaxy. moreover, for stars brighter thanv=15, the resolving power of the rvs will give information about most of theeffects which influence the position of a star in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram, placing unprecedented constraints on the age, internal structure andevolution of stars of all types. finally, the rvs multi-epoch observations areideally suited to the identification, classification and characterisation ofthe many types of double, multiple and variable stars.

astro-ph;0506106	evaluating gaia performances on eclipsing binaries. iv. orbits and  stellar parameters for sv cam, bs dra and hp dra	this is the fourth in a series of papers that aim both to provide reasonableorbits for a number of eclipsing binaries and to evaluate the expectedperformance of gaia of these objects and the accuracy that is achievable in thedetermination of such fundamental stellar parameters as mass and radius. inthis paper, we attempt to derive the orbits and physical parameters for threeeclipsing binaries in the mid-f to mid-g spectral range. as for previouspapers, only the hp, vt, bt photometry from the hipparcos/tycho mission andground-based radial velocities from spectroscopy in the region 8480-8740 a areused in the analyses. these data sets simulate the photometric andspectroscopic data that are expected to be obtained by gaia, the approved esacornerstone mission to be launched in 2011. the systems targeted in this paperare sv cam, bs dra and hp dra. sv cam and bs dra have been studied previously,allowing comparisons of the derived parameters with those from full scale anddevoted ground-based investigations. hp dra has no published orbital solution.sv cam has a beta lyrae type light curve and the others have algol-like lightcurves. sv cam has the complication of light curve anomalies, usuallyattributed to spots; bs dra has non-solar metallicity, and hp dra appears tohave a small eccentricity and a sizeable time derivative in the argument of theperiastron. thus all three provide interesting and different test cases.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0512038	the design and performance of the gaia photometric system	the european gaia astrometry mission is due for launch in 2011. gaia willrely on the proven principles of esa's hipparcos mission to create an all-skysurvey of about one billion stars throughout our galaxy and beyond, byobserving all objects down to 20th magnitude. through its massive measurementof stellar distances, motions and multi-colour photometry it will providefundamental data necessary for unravelling the structure, formation andevolution of the galaxy. this paper presents the design and performance of thebroad- and medium-band set of photometric filters adopted as the baseline forgaia. the nineteen selected passbands (extending from the ultraviolet to thefar-red), the criteria, and the methodology on which this choice has been basedare discussed in detail. we analyse the photometric capabilities forcharacterizing the luminosity, temperature, gravity and chemical composition ofstars. we also discuss the automatic determination of these physical parametersfor the large number of observations involved, for objects located throughoutthe entire hertzsprung-russell diagram. finally, the capability of thephotometric system to deal with the main gaia science case is outlined.

astro-ph;0606211	the radial velocity experiment (rave): first data release	we present the first data release of the radial velocity experiment (rave),an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellaratmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, surface gravity) of up to onemillion stars using the 6df multi-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidttelescope of the anglo-australian observatory (aao). the rave program startedin 2003, obtaining medium resolution spectra (median r=7,500) in the ca-tripletregion ($\lambda\lambda$ 8,410--8,795 \aa) for southern hemisphere stars drawnfrom the tycho-2 and supercosmos catalogs, in the magnitude range 9&lt;i&lt;12. thefirst data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocitiesfor 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when includingre-observations). those data were obtained on 67 nights between 11 april 2003to 03 april 2004. the total sky coverage within this data release is$\sim$4,760 square degrees. the average signal to noise ratio of the observedspectra is 29.5, and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties betterthan 3.4 km/s. combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode isfound to be 2 km/s. repeat observations are used to assess the stability of ourradial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km/s. we demonstratethat the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show anysystematic trend with color or signal to noise. the rave radial velocities arecomplemented in the data release with proper motions from starnet 2.0, tycho-2and supercosmos, in addition to photometric data from the major optical andinfrared catalogs (tycho-2, usno-b, denis and 2mass). the data release can beaccessed via the rave webpage: http://www.rave-survey.org.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.

astro-ph;0702419	two smc symbiotic stars undergoing steady hydrogen burning	two symbiotic stars in the small magellanic cloud (smc), lin 358 and smc 3,have been supersoft x-ray sources (sss) for more than 10 years. we fitatmospheric and nebular models to their x-ray, optical and uv spectra obtainedat different epochs. the x-ray spectra are extremely soft, and appear to beemitted by the white dwarf atmosphere and not by the nebula like in some othersymbiotics. the white dwarf of smc 3, the hottest of the two sources, had aconstant effective temperature ~500,000 k at various epochs during 12 years. nonova-like outbursts of these systems have been recorded in the last 50 years,despite continuous optical monitoring of the smc, and there are no indicationsof cooling of the white dwarf, expected after a thermonuclear flash. thebolometric luminosity of this system in march of 2003 was more than an order ofmagnitude lower than three years later, however the time of the observation isconsistent with a partial eclipse of the white dwarf, previously found in rosatand optical observations. the red giant wind is either very asymmetric or veryclumpy. the conpact object of lin 358 has been at t&gt;~180,000 k since 1993,perhaps with a moderate increase. atmospheric fits are obtained with log(g)&gt;=9,appropriate only for wd mass &gt;1.18 m(sol). the two systems are probablyaccreting and burning hydrogen steadily at the high rate required for type iasupernova progenitors.

0810.1375	irc-10443: a multi-periodic sra variable and the nature of long  secondary periods in agb stars	we obtained bvic photometry of irc-10443 on 85 different nights distributedover two years, and in addition low resolution absolute spectro- photometry andhigh resolution echelle spectroscopy. our data show that irc-10443, which wasnever studied before in any detail, is a sra variable, characterized bydelta(b)=1.27, delta(v)=1.14 and delta(i)=0.70 mag amplitudes and mean values&lt;b&gt;=13.75, &lt;v&gt;=11.33 and &lt;ic&gt;=6.18 mag. two strong periodicities aresimultaneously present: a principal one of 85.5 (+/-0.2) days, and a secondaryone of 620 (+/-15) days, both sinusoidal in shape, and with semi-amplitudesdelta(v)=0.41 and 0.20 mag, respectively. irc-10443 turns out to be a m7iiistar, with a mean heliocentric radial velocity -28 km/s and reddened bye(b-v)=0.87, a third of which of circumstellar origin. the same 0.5 kpcdistance is derived from application of the appropriate period-luminosityrelations to both the principal and the secondary periods. the long secondaryperiod causes a sinusoidal variation in color of 0.13 mag semi-amplitude inv-ic, with irc-10443 being bluest at maximum and reddest at minimum, and withassociated changes in effective temperature and radius of 85 k and 6%,respectively. this behavior of colors argues in favor of a pulsation nature forthe still mysterious long secondary periods in agb stars.

0810.2387	the nature and evolution of nova cygni 2006	aims: nova cyg 2006 has been intensively observed throughout its fulloutburst. we investigate the energetics and evolution of the central source andof the expanding ejecta, their chemical abundances and ionization structure,and the formation of dust. method: we recorded low, medium, and/orhigh-resolution spectra (calibrated into accurate absolute fluxes) on 39nights, along with 2353 photometric ubvrcic measures on 313 nights, andcomplemented them with ir data from the literature. results: the nova displayedinitially the normal photometric and spectroscopic evolution of a fast nova ofthe feii-type. pre-maximum, principal, diffuse-enhanced, and orion absorptionsystems developed in a normal way. after the initial outburst, the novaprogressively slowed its fading pace until the decline reversed and a secondmaximum was reached (eight months later), accompanied by large spectroscopicchanges. following the rapid decline from second maximum, the nova finallyentered the nebular phase and formed optically thin dust. we computed theamount of formed dust and performed a photo-ionization analysis of theemission-line spectrum during the nebular phase, which showed a strongenrichment of the ejecta in nitrogen and oxygen, and none in neon, in agreementwith theoretical predictions for the estimated 1.0 msun white dwarf in nova cyg2006. the similarities with the poorly investigated v1493 nova aql 1999a arediscussed.
