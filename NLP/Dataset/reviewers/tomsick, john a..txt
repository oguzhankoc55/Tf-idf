0902.4209	optical astrometry of accreting black holes and neutron stars:  scientific opportunities	the extreme conditions found near black holes and neutron stars provide aunique opportunity for testing physical theories. observations of both types ofcompact objects can be used to probe regions of strong gravity, allowing fortests of general relativity. furthermore, a determination of the properties ofmatter at the remarkably high densities that exist within neutron stars wouldhave important implications for nuclear and particle physics. while many ofthese objects are in binary systems ("x-ray binaries"), where accreting matterfrom the stellar companion provides a probe of the compact object, a maindifficulty in making measurements that lead to definitive tests has beenuncertainty about basic information such as distances to sources, orientationof their binary orbits, and masses of the compact objects. optical astrometryat the microarcsecond level will allow for accurate determinations of distancesand proper motions with precisions of a few percent and will provide anopportunity to directly map x-ray binary orbits, leading to measurements oforbital inclination and compact object masses accurate to better than 4%. usingastrometry at this unprecedented accuracy, which would be enabled by the spaceinterferometry mission ("sim lite"), will lead to breakthroughs in theinvestigations of the physics of black holes and neutron stars

0902.4238	x-ray timing of stellar mass black holes	x-ray timing observations of accreting stellar mass black holes have shownthat they can produce signals with such short time scales that we must beprobing very close to the innermost stable circular orbit that is predicted bythe theory of general relativity (gr). these signals are quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos), and both the high-frequency variety (hfqpos, which havefrequencies in the 40-450 hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 hz low-frequency typehave the potential to provide tests of gr in the strong field limit. animportant step on the path to gr tests is to constrain the physical black holeproperties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possiblewith x-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black holespins. while current x-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, thehfqpos are weak signals, and future x-ray timing missions with larger effectivearea are required for testing the candidate theoretical qpo mechanisms. anothermain goal in the study of accreting black holes is to understand the productionof relativistic jets. here, we have also made progress during the past decadeby finding clear connections between the radio emission that traces thestrength of the jet and the properties of the x-ray emission. with new radiocapabilities just coming on-line, continuing detailed x-ray studies ofaccreting black holes is crucial for continuing to make progress.

0911.2240	truncation of the inner accretion disk around a black hole at low  luminosity	most black hole binaries show large changes in x-ray luminosity causedprimarily by variations in mass accretion rate. an important question forunderstanding black hole accretion and jet production is whether the inner edgeof the accretion disk recedes at low accretion rate. measurements of thelocation of the inner edge (rin) can be made using iron emission lines thatarise due to fluorescence of iron in the disk, and these indicate that rin isvery close to the black hole at high and moderate luminosities (near 1% of theeddington luminosity, ledd). here, we report on x-ray observations of the blackhole gx 339-4 in the hard state by suzaku and the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte) that extend iron line studies to 0.14% ledd and show that rin increasesby a factor of &gt;27 over the value found when gx 339-4 was bright. the exactvalue of rin depends on the inclination of the inner disk (i), and we derive90% confidence limits of rin &gt; 35 rg at i = 0 degrees and rin &gt; 175 rg at i =30 degrees. this provides direct evidence that the inner portion of the disk isnot present at low luminosity, allowing for the possibility that the inner diskis replaced by advection- or magnetically-dominated accretion flows.

1006.4665	masses of neutron stars in high-mass x-ray binaries with optical  astrometry	determining the type of matter that is inside a neutron star (ns) has been along-standing goal of astrophysics. despite this, most of the ns equations ofstate (eos) that predict maximum masses in the range 1.4-2.8 solar masses arestill viable. most of the precise ns mass measurements that have been made todate show values close to 1.4 solar masses, but a reliable measurement of anover-massive ns would constrain the eos possibilities. here, we investigate howoptical astrometry at the microarcsecond level can be used to map out theorbits of high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs), leading to tight constraints on nsmasses. while previous studies by unwin and co-workers and tomsick andco-workers discuss the fact that the future space interferometry mission shouldbe capable of making such measurements, the current work describes detailedsimulations for 6 hmxb systems, including predicted constraints on all orbitalparameters. we find that the direct ns masses can be measured to an accuracy of2.5% (1-sigma) in the best case (x per), to 6.5% for vela x-1, and to 10% fortwo other hmxbs.

1102.3666	revealing the nature of high-mass x-ray binaries through  multi-wavelength and statistical analyses	we summarize the results of our long-running campaign to help understand thenature of high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs), emphasizing recent suzakuobservations of igr j16207-5129 and igr j17391-3021. thanks to the expandingranks of hmxbs in our galaxy, we are able to perform more reliable statisticalanalyses on the three currently-known sub-classes of hmxb: those withsupergiant companions (sgxbs); those with be companions (bexbs); and theenigmatic supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts). we discuss new diagnostictools, akin to the "corbet diagram," in which hmxbs tend to segregate based ontheir dominant accretion mechanism. we show how sfxts span across the dividedpopulations of bexbs and sgxbs, bolstering the intriguing possibility that somesfxts represent an evolutionary link. the use of hmxbs as tracers of recentmassive star formation is revisited as we present the first ever spatialcorrelation function for hmxbs and ob star-forming complexes. our resultsindicate that at distances less than a few kpc from a given hmxb, it is morelikely to have neighbors that are known massive-star forming regions as opposedto objects drawn from random distributions. the characteristic scale of thecorrelation function holds valuable clues to hmxb evolutionary timescales.

1104.5248	the 2010 may flaring episode of cygnus x-3 in radio, x-rays, and  {\gamma}-rays	in 2009, cygnus x-3 (cyg x-3) became the first microquasar to be detected inthe gev {\gamma}-ray regime, via the satellites fermi and agile. the additionof this new band to the observational toolbox holds promise for building a moredetailed understanding of the relativistic jets of this and other systems. wepresent a rich dataset of radio, hard and soft x-ray, and {\gamma}-rayobservations of cyg x-3 made during a flaring episode in 2010 may. we detect a~3-d softening and recovery of the x-ray emission, followed almost immediatelyby a ~1-jy radio flare at 15 ghz, followed by a 4.3{\sigma} {\gamma}-ray flare(e &gt; 100 mev) ~1.5 d later. the radio sampling is sparse, but we use archivaldata to argue that it is unlikely the {\gamma}-ray flare was followed by anysignificant unobserved radio flares. in this case, the sequencing of theobserved events is difficult to explain in a model in which the {\gamma}-rayemission is due to inverse compton scattering of the companion star's radiationfield. our observations suggest that other mechanisms may also be responsiblefor {\gamma}-ray emission from cyg x-3.

1301.7307	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) mission	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) mission, launched on 13june 2012, is the first focusing high-energy x-ray telescope in orbit. nustaroperates in the band from 3 -- 79 kev, extending the sensitivity of focusingfar beyond the ~10 kev high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous x-raysatellites. the inherently low-background associated with concentrating thex-ray light enables nustar to probe the hard x-ray sky with a more thanone-hundred-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded-maskinstruments that have operated in this bandpass. using its unprecedentedcombination of sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution, nustar will pursuefive primary scientific objectives, and will also undertake a broad program oftargeted observations. the observatory consists of two co-alignedgrazing-incidence x-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axisstabilized spacecraft. deployed into a 600 km, near-circular, 6degreeinclination orbit, the observatory has now completed commissioning, and isperforming consistent with pre-launch expectations. nustar is now executing itsprimary science mission, and with an expected orbit lifetime of ten years, weanticipate proposing a guest investigator program, to begin in fall 2014.

1309.5361	the smooth cyclotron line in her x-1 as seen with nustar	her x-1, one of the brightest and best studied x-ray binaries, shows acyclotron resonant scattering feature (crsf) near 37 kev. this makes it anideal target for detailed study with the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array(nustar), taking advantage of its excellent hard x-ray spectral resolution. weobserved her x-1 three times, coordinated with suzaku, during one of the highflux intervals of its 35d super-orbital period. this paper focuses on the shapeand evolution of the hard x-ray spectrum. the broad-band spectra can be fittedwith a powerlaw with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a crsf. we findthat the crsf has a very smooth and symmetric shape, in all observations and atall pulse-phases. we compare the residuals of a line with a gaussian opticaldepth profile to a lorentzian optical depth profile and find no significantdifferences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. eventhough the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that itssmooth shape does not. additionally, our data show that the continuum is onlychanging marginally between the three observations. these changes can beexplained with varying amounts of thomson scattering in the hot corona of theaccretion disk. the average, luminosity-corrected crsf energy is lower than inpast observations and follows a secular decline. the excellent data quality ofnustar provides the best constraint on the crsf energy to date.

1310.3830	the reflection component from cygnus x-1 in the soft state measured by  nustar and suzaku	the black hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed in late-2012 with the nuclearspectroscopic telescope array (nustar) and suzaku, providing spectral coverageover the ~1-300 kev range. the source was in the soft state with amulti-temperature blackbody, power-law, and reflection components along withabsorption from highly ionized material in the system. the high throughput ofnustar allows for a very high quality measurement of the complex iron lineregion as well as the rest of the reflection component. the iron line isclearly broadened and is well-described by a relativistic blurring model,providing an opportunity to constrain the black hole spin. although the spinconstraint depends somewhat on which continuum model is used, we obtain a*&gt;0.83for all models that provide a good description of the spectrum. however, noneof our spectral fits give a disk inclination that is consistent with the mostrecently reported binary values for cyg x-1. this may indicate that there is a&gt;13 degree misalignment between the orbital plane and the inner accretion disk(i.e., a warped accretion disk) or that there is missing physics in thespectral models.

1310.5482	complete multiwavelength evolution of galactic black hole transients  during outburst decay i: conditions for "compact" jet formation	compact, steady jets are observed in the near infrared and radio bands in thehard state of galactic black hole transients as their luminosity decreases andthe source moves towards a quiescent state. recent radio observations indicatethat the jets turn off completely in the soft state, therefore multiwavelengthmonitoring of black hole transients are essential to probe the formation ofjets. in this work we conducted a systematic study of all black hole transientswith near infrared and radio coverage during their outburst decays. wecharacterized the timescales of changes in x-ray spectral and temporalproperties and also in near infrared and/or in radio emission. we confirmedthat state transitions occur in black hole transients at a very similarfraction of their respective eddington luminosities. we also found that thenear infrared flux increase that could be due to the formation of a compact jetis delayed by a time period of days with respect to the formation of a corona.finally, we found a threshold disk eddington luminosity fraction for thecompact jets to form. we explain these results with a model such that theincrease in the near infrared flux corresponds to a transition from a patchy,small scale height corona along with an optically thin out flow to a largescale height corona that allows for collimation of a steady compact jet. wediscuss the timescale of jet formation in terms of transport of magnetic fieldsfrom the outer parts of the disk, and also consider two alternativeexplanations for the multiwavelength emission: hot inner accretion flows andirradiation.

1311.5514	nustar discovery of a luminosity dependent cyclotron line energy in vela  x-1	we present nustar observations of vela x-1, a persistent, yet highlyvariable, neutron star high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb). two observations weretaken at similar orbital phases but separated by nearly a year. they show verydifferent 3-79 kev flux levels as well as strong variability during eachobservation, covering almost one order of magnitude in flux. these observationsallow, for the first time ever, investigations on kilo-second time-scales ofhow the centroid energies of cyclotron resonant scattering features (crsfs)depend on flux for a persistent hmxb. we find that the line energy of theharmonic crsf is correlated with flux, as expected in the sub-criticalaccretion regime. we argue that vela x-1 has a very narrow accretion columnwith a radius of around 0.4 km that sustains a coulomb interaction dominatedshock at the observed luminosities of lx ~ 3x10^36 erg/s. besides the prominentharmonic line at 55 kev the fundamental line around 25 kev is clearly detected.we find that the strengths of the two crsfs are anti-correlated, which weexplain by photon spawning. this anti-correlation is a possible explanation forthe debate about the existence of the fundamental line. the ratio of the lineenergies is variable with time and deviates significantly from 2.0, also apossible consequence of photon spawning, which changes the shape of the line.during the second observation, vela x-1 showed a short off-state in which thepower-law softened and a cut-off was no longer measurable. it is likely thatthe source switched to a different accretion regime at these low mass accretionrates, explaining the drastic change in spectral shape.

1312.0708	developing a method for soft gamma-ray laue lens assembly and  calibration	laue lenses constitute a promising option for concentrating soft gamma rayswith a large collection area and reasonable focal lengths. in astronomy theycould lead to increased telescope sensitivity by one to two orders ofmagnitude, in particular for faint nuclear gamma-ray lines, but also forcontinua like hard x-ray tails from a variety of compact objects. other fieldslike homeland security and nuclear medicine share the same need for moresensitive gamma-ray detection systems and could find applications for gamma-rayfocusing optics. there are two primary challenges for developing laue lenses:the search for high-reflectivity and reproducible crystals, and the developmentof a method to accurately orient and fix the thousands of crystals constitutinga lens. in this paper we focus on the second topic. we used our dedicated x-raybeamline and laue lens assembly station to build a breadboard lens made of 15crystals. this allowed us to test our tools and methods, as well as oursimulation code and calibration procedure. although some critical points wereidentified, the results are very encouraging, with a crystal orientationdistribution lower than $10''$, as required to build a laue lens telescopededicated to the study of type ia supernovae (30-m focal length). thisbreadboard lens represents an important step towards raising the technologyreadiness level of laue lenses.

0802.3357	broadband x-ray spectra of gx 339-4 and the geometry of accreting black  holes in the hard state	a major question in the study of black hole binaries involves ourunderstanding of the accretion geometry when the sources are in the hard state.in this state, the x-ray energy spectrum is dominated by a hard power-lawcomponent and radio observations indicate the presence of a steady and powerfulcompact jet. although the common hard state picture is that the accretion diskis truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii from the black hole,recent results for the recurrent transient gx 339-4 by miller and co-workersshow evidence for optically thick material very close to the black hole'sinnermost stable circular orbit. that work focused on an observation of gx339-4 at a luminosity of about 5% of the eddington limit and used parametersfrom a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a soft, thermalcomponent as diagnostics. in this work, we use similar diagnostics, but extendthe study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% ledd) using swift and rxteobservations of gx 339-4. we detect a thermal component with an inner disktemperature of ~0.2 kev at 2.3% ledd. we detect broad features due to ironkalpha that are likely related to reflection of hard x-rays off the opticallythick material. if these features are broadened by relativistic effects, theyindicate that optically thick material resides within 10 rg down to 0.8% ledd,and the measurements are consistent with the inner radius of the disk remainingat ~4 rg down to this level. however, we also discuss an alternative model forthe broadening, and we note that the evolution of the thermal component is notentirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation. finally, wediscuss the results in terms of recent theoretical work on the possibility thatmaterial may condense to maintain an inner optically thick disk.

1409.1932	multiwavelength observations of the black hole transient swift j1745-26  during the outburst decay	we characterized the broad-band x-ray spectra of swift j1745-26 during thedecay of the 2013 outburst using integral isgri, jem-x and swift xrt. the x-rayevolution is compared to the evolution in optical and radio. we fit the x- rayspectra with phenomenological and comptonization models. we discuss possiblescenarios for the physical origin of a ~50 day flare observed both in opticaland x- rays ~170 days after the peak of the outburst. we conclude that it is aresult of enhanced mass accretion in response to an earlier heating event. wecharacterized the evolution in the hard x-ray band and showed that for thejoint isgri-xrt fits, the e-folding energy decreased from 350 kev to 130 kev,while the energy where the exponential cut-off starts increased from 75 kev to112 kev as the decay progressed.we investigated the claim that high energycut-offs disappear with the compact jet turning on during outburst decays, andshowed that spectra taken with hexte on rxte provide insufficient quality tocharacterize cut-offs during the decay for typical hard x-ray fluxes. longintegral monitoring observations are required to understand the relationbetween the compact jet formation and hard x-ray behavior. we found that forthe entire decay (including the flare), the x-ray spectra are consistent withthermal comptonization, but a jet synchrotron origin cannot be ruled out.

1409.3239	complete multiwavelength evolution of galactic black hole transients  during outburst decay ii: compact jets and x-ray variability properties	we investigated the relation between compact jet emission and x-rayvariability properties of all black hole transients with multiwavelengthcoverage during their outburst decays. we studied the evolution of all powerspectral components (including low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations), andrelated this evolution to changes in jet properties tracked by radio andinfrared observations. we grouped sources according to their tracks inradio/x-ray luminosity relation, and show that the standards show strongerbroadband x-ray variability than outliers at a given x-ray luminosity when thecompact jet turned on. this trend is consistent with the internal shock modeland can be important for the understanding of the presence of tracks in theradio/x-ray luminosity relation. we also observed that the total and the qporms amplitudes increase together during the earlier part of the outburst decay,but after the compact jet turns either the qpo disappears or its rms amplitudedecreases significantly while the total rms amplitudes remain high. we discussthese results with a scenario including a variable corona and a non-variabledisk with a mechanism for the qpo separate from the mechanism that create broadcomponents. finally, we evaluated the timing predictions of the magneticallydominated accretion flow model which can explain the presence of tracks in theradio/x-ray luminosity relation.

(1984). wepropose that the line, if real, is formed in the wind above the photosphere ofthe neutron star by a resonant k$\alpha$ transition from h-like crgravitationally redshifted by a factor $1+z=1.09$, corresponding to a radiusrange of 29.0 -- 41.4 km for a mass range of 1.4 -- 2.0 $m_{\odot}$.

(2013) using ~400 days of swift data, but is consistent with a newgamma-ray solution reported in 2014. the light curve folded on the new periodis qualitatively similar to that reported previously, having a spike at phase 0and broad sinusoidal modulation. the x-ray flux enhancement at phase 0 occursmore regularly in time than was previously suggested. a spiky structure at thisphase seems to be a persistent feature, although there is some variability.furthermore, we find that the source flux clearly correlates with the spectralhardness throughout all orbital phases, and that the broadband x-ray spectrameasured with nustar, xmm-newton, and swift are well fit with an unbrokenpower-law model. this spectrum suggests that the system may not beaccretion-powered.

1506.06780	the accreting black hole swift j1753.5-0127 from radio to hard x-ray	(abridged) we report on multi-wavelength measurements of swift j1753.5-0127in the hard state at l=2.7e36 erg/s (assuming d=3 kpc) in 2014. the radioemission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. we takeadvantage of the low extinction and model the near-ir to uv emission with amulti-temperature disk model. assuming a bh mass of m_bh=5 msun and a systeminclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk ofrin/rg&gt;212 d_3 (5msun/m_bh). the outer radius is r_out/r_g=90,000 d_3(5msun/m_bh), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expectedsize of the disk. the 0.5-240 kev spectrum measured by swift/xrt, suzaku, andnustar is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index ofgamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a secondcontinuum component is added. reflection is a possibility, but no iron line isdetected, implying a low iron abundance. we are able to fit the entire sed witha multi-temperature disk component, a comptonization component, and a brokenpower-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. the broken power-lawcannot significantly contribute to the soft x-ray emission, and this may berelated to why swift j1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/x-ray correlation.the broken power-law might dominate above 20 kev, which would constrain thebreak frequency to be between 2.4e10 hz and 3.6e12 hz. although the fits to thefull sed do not include significant thermal emission in the x-ray band,previous observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find thatthere is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with atemperature of 150(+30)(-20) ev and an inner radius of 5-14 r_g. if thiscomponent is real, it might imply the presence of an inner accretion disk inaddition to the strongly truncated (r_in&gt;212 r_g) disk.

1508.02394	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the black hole swift  j1753.5-0127	we report on a multiwavelength observational campaign of the black hole x-raybinary swift j1753.5-0127 that consists of an eso/x-shooter spectrum supportedby contemporaneous swift/xrt+uvot and atca data. ism absorption lines in thex-shooter spectrum allows us to determine e(b-v)=0.45+/-0.02 along theline-of-sight to the source. we also report detection of emission signatures ofhe ii at 4686 angstrom, h alpha, and, for the first time, h i at 10906 angstromand paschen beta. the double-peaked morphology of these four lines is typicalof the chromosphere of a rotating accretion disk. nonetheless, the paucity ofdisk features points towards a low level of irradiation in the system. this isconfirmed through spectral energy distribution modeling and we find that theuvot+x-shooter continuum mostly stems from the thermal emission of a viscousdisk. we speculate that the absence of reprocessing is due to the compactnessof an illumination-induced envelope that fails to reflect enough incoming hardx-ray photons back to the outer regions. the disk also marginally contributesto the compton-dominated x-ray emission and is strongly truncated, with aninner radius about a thousand times larger than the black hole's gravitationalradius. a near-infrared excess is present, and we associate it with synchrotronradiation from a compact jet. however, the measured x-ray flux is significantlyhigher than what can be explained by the optically thin synchrotron jetcomponent. we discuss these findings in the framework of the radio quiet versusx-ray bright hypothesis, favoring the presence of a residual disk, predicted byevaporation models, that contributes to the x-ray emission without enhancingthe radio flux.

1510.04631	nustar hard x-ray survey of the galactic center region i: hard x-ray  morphology and spectroscopy of the diffuse emission	we present the first sub-arcminute images of the galactic center above 10kev, obtained with nustar. nustar resolves the hard x-ray source igrj17456-2901 into non-thermal x-ray filaments, molecular clouds, point sourcesand a previously unknown central component of hard x-ray emission (chxe).nustar detects four non-thermal x-ray filaments, extending the detection oftheir power-law spectra with $\gamma\sim1.3$-$2.3$ up to ~50 kev. amorphological and spectral study of the filaments suggests that their originmay be heterogeneous, where previous studies suggested a common origin in youngpulsar wind nebulae (pwne). nustar detects non-thermal x-ray continuum emissionspatially correlated with the 6.4 kev fe k$\alpha$ fluorescence line emissionassociated with two sgr a molecular clouds: mc1 and the bridge. broad-bandx-ray spectral analysis with a monte-carlo based x-ray reflection modelself-consistently determined their intrinsic column density ($\sim10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), primary x-ray spectra (power-laws with $\gamma\sim2$) and set alower limit of the x-ray luminosity of sgr a* flare illuminating the sgr aclouds to $l_x \stackrel{&gt;}{\sim} 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. above ~20 kev, hardx-ray emission in the central 10 pc region around sgr a* consists of thecandidate pwn g359.95-0.04 and the chxe, possibly resulting from an unresolvedpopulation of massive cvs with white dwarf masses $m_{\rm wd} \sim 0.9m_{\odot}$. spectral energy distribution analysis suggests that g359.95-0.04 islikely the hard x-ray counterpart of the ultra-high gamma-ray source hessj1745-290, strongly favoring a leptonic origin of the gc tev emission.

1512.00044	chandra observations of eight sources discovered by integral	we report on 0.3-10 kev observations with the chandra x-ray observatory ofeight hard x-ray sources discovered within 8 degrees of the galactic plane bythe integral satellite. the short (5 ks) chandra observations of the igr sourcefields have yielded very likely identifications of x-ray counterparts for threeof the igr sources: igr j14091-6108, igr j18088-2741, and igr j18381-0924. thefirst two have very hard spectra in the chandra band that can be described by apower-law with photon indices of gamma = 0.6+/-0.4 and -0.7(+0.4)(-0.3),respectively (90% confidence errors are given), and both have a unique near-ircounterpart consistent with the chandra position. igr j14091-6108 also displaysa strong iron line and a relatively low x-ray luminosity, and we argue that themost likely source type is a cataclysmic variable (cv), although we do notcompletely rule out the possibility of a high mass x-ray binary. igrj18088-2741 has an optical counterpart with a previously measured 6.84 hrperiodicity, which may be the binary orbital period. we also detect five cyclesof a possible 800-950 s period in the chandra light curve, which may be thecompact object spin period. we suggest that igr j18088-2741 is also most likelya cv. for igr j18381-0924, the spectrum is intrinsically softer with gamma =1.5(+0.5)(-0.4), and it is moderately absorbed, nh = (4+/-1)e22 cm-2. there aretwo near-ir sources consistent with the chandra position, and they are bothclassified as galaxies, making it likely that igr j18381-0924 is an activegalactic nucleus (agn). for the other five igr sources, we provide lists ofnearby chandra sources, which may be used along with further observations toidentify the correct counterparts, and we discuss the implications of the lowinferred chandra count rates for these five sources.

astro-ph;0002084	x-ray spectral and timing evolution during the decay of the 1998  outburst from the recurrent x-ray transient 4u 1630-47	we report on the x-ray spectral and timing behavior of the recurrent x-raytransient 4u 1630-47 for 51 rxte observations made during the decay of its 1998outburst. the observations began when the source was still relatively bright,and, during one of the early observations, a qpo with a non-lorentzian profileoccurred near 6 hz. as the source decayed, the x-ray flux dropped exponentiallywith an e-folding time of 14.4 d. the exponential decay was interrupted by anincrease in the x-ray flux, and a secondary maximum occurred 89 d after theonset of the outburst. a transition marked by significant changes in the timingand spectral properties of the source occurred 104 d after the start of theoutburst. the transition is similar to soft-to-hard state transitions observedin other black hole candidate x-ray binaries. most of the changes associatedwith the transition occurred in less than 2 d. the timing changes include anincrease in the continuum noise level from less than 4% rms to greater than 10%rms and the appearance of a quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) at 3.4 hz with anrms amplitude of 7.3% in the 2-21 kev energy band. at the transition, theenergy spectrum also changed with an abrupt drop in the soft component flux inthe rxte band pass. a change in the power-law photon index from 2.3 to 1.8,also associated with the transition, occurred over a time period of 8 d. afterthe transition, the source flux continued to decrease, and the qpo frequencydecayed gradually from 3.4 hz to about 0.2 hz.

astro-ph;0105394	x-ray observations of xte j1550-564 during the decay of the 2000  outburst - i. chandra and rxte energy spectra	we report on the evolution of the x-ray energy spectrum for the black holecandidate (bhc) x-ray transient xte j1550-564 during the decay of the 2000outburst. the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) and chandra observations spannearly five orders of magnitude in luminosity. the rxte spectra are dominatedby a power-law component and a comparatively weak soft component was alsodetected for the first two observations. the source made a transition to thecanonical hard state near a luminosity of 9e36 erg/s over several observationsas evidenced by a drop in the flux of the soft component in the rxte energyband and a hardening of the power-law component to a photon index near 1.6. thepower-law did not exhibit this behavior for the previous xte j1550-564outburst. for some observations, we detect a high energy cutoff and find thatthe cutoff is more significant and at lower energy during the transition thanin the hard state. the cutoff in the hard state is at higher energy than hasbeen seen for most previous accreting bhcs. the chandra spectrum providesevidence for spectral evolution after the hard state transition. it is well,but not uniquely, described by a power-law with a photon index of2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.48} (90% confidence) and interstellar absorption.advection-dominated accretion flow models predict gradual spectral softening asthe luminosity drops, but our observations do not allow us to determine if thespectral evolution is gradual or sudden. the lowest luminosity we measure forxte j1550-564 with chandra is 5e32 erg/s (0.5-7 kev, for a distance of 4 kpc).although this is probably not the true quiescent luminosity, it represents auseful upper limit on this quantity.

astro-ph;0208205	rotational broadening measurement for the neutron star x-ray transient  xte j2123-058	we used optical spectroscopy of the neutron star x-ray transient xtej2123-058 to measure the rotational broadening of the binary companion'sstellar absorption lines and determined that the companion's projectedrotational velocity is vsini = 121 (+21)(-29) km/s. this value is considerablylarger than the measurements of vsini obtained previously for three otherneutron star systems where the values are between 34 and 65 km/s. the largervalue is likely due to the combination of high binary inclination and short (6hr) orbital period for xte j2123-058. along with previously measuredparameters, the rotational broadening measurement allowed us to determine thebinary parameters, including the ratio of the neutron star mass to thecompanion mass, q = m_1/m_2 = 2.7 (+1.3)(-0.9), the neutron star mass, m_1 =1.46 (+0.30)(-0.39) solar masses, and the companion mass, m_2 = 0.53(+0.28)(-0.39) solar masses, assuming a roche lobe filling companionsynchronously rotating with the binary orbit. these values are consistent witha previous measurement where the h alpha emission line was used to determinethe semiamplitude of the neutron star's radial velocity curve (k_1). it is asignificant result that the two methods give consistent values. we also reportthe first measurement of the xte j2123-058 companion's radius. assumingsynchronous rotation, we obtain r_2 = 0.62 (+0.11)(-0.15) solar radii, which isin-line with that expected for a late k-type star on or close to the mainsequence. finally, we report the first precise spectroscopic determination ofthe binary orbital period (p_orb = 21442.3 +/- 1.8 seconds).

astro-ph;0210399	x-ray jet emission from the black hole x-ray binary xte j1550-564 with  chandra in 2000	we have discovered an x-ray jet due to material ejected from the black holex-ray transient xte j1550-564. the discovery was first reported by corbel etal. (science, 298, 196 and astro-ph/0210224), and here, we present an analysisof the three chandra observations made between 2000 june and 2000 september.for these observations, a source is present that moves in an eastward directionaway from the point source associated with the compact object. the separationbetween the new source and the compact object changes from 21.3 arcseconds injune to 23.4 arcseconds in september, implying a proper motion of 21.2 +/- 7.2mas/day, a projected separation of 0.31-0.85 pc and an apparent jet velocitybetween 0.34 +/- 0.12 and 0.93 +/- 0.32 times the speed of light for a sourcedistance range of d = 2.8-7.6 kpc. these observations represent the first timethat an x-ray jet proper motion measurement has been obtained for any accretionpowered galactic or extra-galactic source. while this work deals with the jetto the east of the compact object, the western jet has also been detected inthe x-ray and radio bands. the most likely scenario is that the eastern jet isthe approaching jet and that the jet material was ejected from the black holein 1998. along with a 1998 vlbi proper motion measurement, the chandra propermotion indicates that the eastern jet decelerated between 1998 and 2000. wepresent results on the morphology and energy spectrum of the jet. we cannotdefinitively determine the x-ray emission mechanism, but a synchrotron originis viable and may provide the simplest explanation for the observations.

astro-ph;0304219	x-ray flares and oscillations from the black hole candidate x-ray  transient xte j1650-500 at low luminosity	we report on x-ray observations made with the rossi x-ray timing explorer ofthe black hole candidate (bhc) transient xte j1650-500 at the end of its first,and currently only, outburst. by monitoring the source at low luminosities overseveral months, we found 6 bright ~100 second x-ray flares and long time scaleoscillations of the x-ray flux. the oscillations are aperiodic with acharacteristic time scale of 14.2 days and an order of magnitude variation inthe 2.8-20 kev flux. the oscillations may be related to optical"mini-outbursts" that have been observed at the ends of outbursts for othershort orbital period bhc transients. the x-ray flares have durations between 62and 215 seconds and peak fluxes that are 5-24 times higher than the persistentflux. the flares have non-thermal energy spectra and occur when the persistentluminosity is near 3e34 (d/4 kpc)^2 erg/s (2.8-20 kev). the rise time for thebrightest flare demonstrates that physical models for bhc systems must be ableto account for the situation where the x-ray flux increases by a factor of upto 24 on a time scale of seconds. we discuss the flares in the context ofobservations and theory of galactic bhcs and compare the flares to thosedetected from sgr a*, the super-massive black hole at the galactic center. wealso compare the flares to x-ray bursts that are seen in neutron star systems.while some of the flare light curves are similar to those of neutron starbursts, the flares have non-thermal energy spectra in contrast to the blackbodyspectra exhibited in bursts. this indicates that x-ray bursts should not betaken as evidence that a given system contains a neutron star unless thepresence of a blackbody component in the burst spectrum can be demonstrated.

astro-ph;0307458	detection of low-hard state spectral and timing signatures from the  black hole x-ray transient xte j1650-500 at low x-ray luminosities	using the chandra x-ray observatory and the rossi x-ray timing explorer, wehave studied the black hole candidate (bhc) x-ray transient xte j1650-500 nearthe end of its 2001-2002 outburst after its transition to the low-hard state atx-ray luminosities down to l = 1.5e34 erg/s (1-9 kev, assuming a sourcedistance of 4 kpc). our results include a characterization of the spectral andtiming properties. at the lowest sampled luminosity, we used an 18 ks chandraobservation to measure the power spectrum at low frequencies. for the 3 epochsat which we obtained chandra/rxte observations, the 0.5-20 kev energy spectrumis consistent with a spectral model consisting of a power-law with interstellarabsorption. we detect evolution in the power-law photon index from 1.66 +/-0.05 to 1.93 +/- 0.13 (90% confidence errors), indicating that the sourcesoftens at low luminosities. the power spectra are characterized by strong(20-35% fractional rms) band-limited noise, which we model as a zero-centeredlorentzian. including results from an rxte study of xte j1650-500 near thetransition to the low-hard state by kalemci et al. (2003), the half-width ofthe zero-centered lorentzian (roughly where the band-limited noise cuts off)drops from 4 hz at l = 7e36 erg/s (1-9 kev, absorbed) to 0.067 +/- 0.007 hz atl = 9e34 erg/s to 0.0035 +/- 0.0010 hz at the lowest luminosity. while thespectral and timing parameters evolve with luminosity, it is notable that thegeneral shapes of the energy and power spectra remain the same, indicating thatthe source stays in the low-hard state. this implies that the x-ray emittingregion of the system likely keeps the same overall structure, while theluminosity changes by a factor of 470. we discuss how these results mayconstrain theoretical black hole accretion models.

astro-ph;0603810	identifications of four integral sources in the galactic plane via  chandra localizations	hard x-ray imaging of the galactic plane by the integral satellite isuncovering large numbers of 20-100 kev "igr" sources. we present results fromchandra, integral, optical, and ir observations of 4 igr sources: 3 sources inthe norma region of the galaxy (igr j16195-4945, igr j16207-5129, and igrj16167-4957) and one that is closer to the galactic center (igr j17195-4100).in all 4 cases, one relatively bright chandra source is seen in the integralerror circle, and these are likely to be the soft x-ray counterparts of the igrsources. they have hard 0.3-10 kev spectra with power-law photon indices of 0.5to 1.1. while many previously studied igr sources show high column densities,only igr j16195-4945 has a column density that could be as high as 10^23 cm^-2.using optical and ir sky survey catalogs and our own photometry, we haveobtained identifications for all 4 sources. the j-band magnitudes are in therange 14.9-10.4, and we have used the optical/ir spectral energy distributions(seds) to constrain the nature of the sources. blackbody components withtemperature lower limits of &gt;9400 k for igr j16195-4945 and &gt;18,000 k for igrj16207-5129 indicate that these are very likely high-mass x-ray binaries(hmxbs). however, for igr j16167-4957 and igr j17195-4100, low extinction andthe seds indicate later spectral types for the putative companions, indicatingthat these are not hmxbs.

astro-ph;0606639	geometrical distance determination using type i x-ray bursts	with the excellent angular resolution of the chandra x-ray observatory, it ispossible to geometrically determine the distance to variable galactic sources,based on the phenomenon that scattered radiation appearing in the x-ray halohas to travel along a slightly longer path than the direct, unscatteredradiation. by measuring the delayed variability, constraints on the sourcedistance can be obtained if the halo brightness is large enough to dominate thepoint spread function (psf) and to provide sufficient statistics. the distanceto cyg x-3, which has a quasi-sinusoidal light curve, has been obtained withthis approach by predehl et al. here we examine the feasibility of using thedelayed signature of type i x-ray bursts as distance indicators. we usesimulations of delayed x-ray burst light curves in the halo to find that theoptimal annular region and energy band for a distance measurement with agrating observation is roughly 10-50" and 1-5 kev respectively, assumingchandra's effective area and psf, uniformly distributed dust, the inputspectrum and optical depth to gx 13+1, and the weingartner &amp; draineinterstellar grain model. we find that the statistics are dominated by poissonnoise rather than systematic uncertainties, e.g., the psf contribution to thehalo. using chandra, a distance measurement to such a source at 4 (8) kpc couldbe made to about 23% (30%) accuracy with a single burst with 68% confidence. bystacking many bursts, a reasonable estimate of systematic errors limit thedistance measurement to about 10% accuracy.

astro-ph;0609424	the orbit of the eclipsing x-ray pulsar exo 1722-363	with recent and archival rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) x-raymeasurements of the heavily obscured x-ray pulsar exo 1722-363 (igrj17252-3616), we carried out a pulse timing analysis to determine the orbitalsolution for the first time. the binary system is characterized by a_x sin(i) =101 +/- 3 lt-s and p_orb = 9.7403 +/- 0.0004 days (90% confidence), with theprecision of the orbital period being obtained by connecting datasets separatedby more than 7 years (272 orbital cycles). the orbit is consistent withcircular, and e &lt; 0.19 at the 90% confidence level. the mass function is 11.7+/- 1.2 m_sun and confirms that this source is a high mass x-ray binary (hmxb)system. the orbital period, along with the previously known ~414 s pulseperiod, places this system in the part of the corbet diagram populated bysupergiant wind accretors. using previous eclipse time measurements by corbetet al. and our orbital solution, combined with the assumption that the primaryunderfills its roche lobe, we find i &gt; 61 degrees at the 99% confidence level,the radius of the primary is between 21 r_sun and 37 r_sun, and its mass isless than about 22 m_sun. the acceptable range of radius and mass shows thatthe primary is probably a supergiant of spectral type b0i-b5i. photometricmeasurements of its likely counterpart are consistent with the spectral typeand luminosity if the distance to the system is between 5.3 kpc and 8.7 kpc.spectral analysis of the pulsar as a function of orbital phase reveals anevolution of the hydrogen column density suggestive of dense filaments of gasin the downstream wake of the pulsar, with higher levels of absorption seen atorbital phases 0.5-1.0, as well as a variable fe k_alpha line.

astro-ph;0611341	the discovery outburst of the x-ray transient igr j17497-2821 observed  with rxte and atca	we report the results of a series of rxte and atca observations of therecently-discovered x-ray transient igr j17497-2821. our 3-200 kev pca+hextespectral analysis shows very little variations over a period of ~10 days aroundthe maximum of the outburst. igr j17497-2821 is found in a typical low hardstate (lhs) of x-ray binaries (xrb), well represented by an absorbedcomptonized spectrum with an iron edge at about 7 kev. the high value of theabsorption (~4 e22 cm-2) suggests that the source is located at a largedistance, either close to the galactic center or beyond. the timing analysisshows no particular features, while the shape of the power density spectra isalso typical of lhs of xrbs, with ~36% rms variability. no radio counterpart isfound down to a limit of 0.21 mjy at 4.80 ghz and 8.64 ghz. although theposition of igr j17497-2821 in the radio to x-ray flux diagram is well belowthe correlation usually observed in the lhs of black holes, the comparison ofits x-ray properties with those of other sources leads us to suggest that it isa black hole candidate.

astro-ph;0703501	uncovering the nature of the x-ray transient 4u 1730-22: discovery of  x-ray emission from a neutron star in quiescence with chandra	the x-ray transient, 4u 1730-22, has not been detected in outburst since1972, when a single outburst was detected by the uhuru satellite. this neutronstar or black hole x-ray binary is presumably in quiescence now, and here, wereport on x-ray and optical observations of the 4u 1730-22 field designed toidentify the system's quiescent counterpart. using chandra, we have found avery likely counterpart. the candidate counterpart is close to the center ofthe uhuru error region and has a thermal spectrum. the 0.3-8 kev spectrum iswell-described by a neutron star atmosphere model with an effective temperatureof 131+/-21 ev. for a neutron star with a 10 km radius, the implied sourcedistance is 10(+12)(-4) kpc, and the x-ray luminosity is 1.9e33 ergs/s assuminga distance of 10 kpc. accretion from a companion star is likely required tomaintain the temperature of this neutron star, which would imply that it is anx-ray binary and therefore, almost certainly the 4u 1730-22 counterpart. we donot detect an optical source at the position of the chandra source down to r &gt;22.1, and this is consistent with the system being a low-mass x-ray binary at adistance greater than a few kpc. if our identification is correct, 4u 1730-22is one of the 5 most luminous of the 20 neutron star transients that havequiescent x-ray luminosity measurements.

astro-ph;9809098	broad-band x-ray spectra of the black hole candidate gro j1655-40	we present broad-band (2 kev to 2 mev) x-ray spectra of gro j1655-40, aluminous x-ray transient and occasional source of relativistic radio jets,obtained with rxte and osse. in one observation, the luminosity is found to be18% of the eddington limit, which is one of the highest luminosities everobserved from gro j1655-40. for this observation, we find that an adequate fitis obtained when a broad iron line and a reflection component are added to amodel consisting of a power-law plus a soft excess component. the 95%confidence lower limit on the rms line width is 0.86 kev. the power-lawcomponent has a photon index of 2.72 and extends to at least 800 kev without acutoff. after this observation, a significant drop in the (5-12 kev)/(1.5-5kev) hardness ratio occurred on a timescale less than 2 hours. from an rxteobservation of gro j1655-40 made after the hardness transition, we find thatthe power-law index is harder (2.415 +/- 0.011), the flux of the power-lawcomponent is lower, and the total luminosity is 10% of the eddington limit. thechange in the power-law component is consistent with the correlation betweenthe spectral index and power-law flux previously reported for gro j1655-40.

astro-ph;9903360	xte j2123-058: a new neutron star x-ray transient	we report on optical and rxte observations of a new high-latitude burstingx-ray transient, xte j2123-058. we identified the optical counterpart, measuredthe 5.9573 hr orbital period and constrained the binary inclination and thesource distance. the distance lower limit indicates that the source is at least2.6 kpc from the galactic plane, which is unusual for an lmxb. rxteobservations were made between june and august 1998 during the first detectedoutburst from this source. we describe correlations between x-ray timing andspectral properties and discuss the possibility that the propeller mechanismturned on during the decay of the outburst. during one of the rxteobservations, we detect a pair of high frequency qpos at 847.1 +/- 5.5 hz and1102 +/- 13 hz simultaneously. according to the beat frequency model, the qposeparation implies a neutron star spin period near 3.9 ms. as the x-ray fluxdecreases at the end of the outburst, the amplitude of the optical modulationincreases significantly. this behavior can be explained if the size of theaccretion disk decreases during the decay of the outburst.

0812.2975	an xmm-newton spectral and timing study of igr j16207-5129: an obscured  and non-pulsating hmxb	we report on a 12 hr xmm-newton observation of the supergiant high-mass x-raybinary igr j16207-5129. this is only the second soft x-ray (0.4-15 kev, in thiscase) study of the source since it was discovered by the integral satellite.the average energy spectrum is very similar to those of neutron star hmxbs,being dominated by a highly absorbed power-law component with a photon index of1.15. the spectrum also exhibits a soft excess below 2 kev and an iron kalphaemission line at 6.39+/-0.03 kev. for the primary power-law component, thecolumn density is 1.19e23 cm^-2, indicating local absorption, likely from thestellar wind, and placing igr j16207-5129 in the category of obscured igrhmxbs. the source exhibits a very high level of variability with an rms noiselevel of 64%+/-21% in the 0.0001 to 0.05 hz frequency range. although theenergy spectrum suggests that the system may harbor a neutron star, nopulsations are detected with a 90% confidence upper limit of 2% in a frequencyrange from 0.0001 to 88 hz. we discuss similarities between igr j16207-5129 andother apparently non-pulsating hmxbs, including other igr hmxbs as well as 4u2206+54 (but see arxiv:0812.2365) and 4u 1700-377.
