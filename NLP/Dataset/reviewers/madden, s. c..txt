1004.1142	the sage-spec spitzer legacy program: the life-cycle of dust and gas in  the large magellanic cloud	the sage-spec spitzer legacy program is a spectroscopic follow-up to thesage-lmc photometric survey of the large magellanic cloud carried out with thespitzer space telescope. we present an overview of sage-spec and some of itsfirst results. the sage-spec program aims to study the life cycle of gas anddust in the large magellanic cloud, and to provide information essential to theclassification of the point sources observed in the earlier sage-lmcphotometric survey. we acquired 224.6 hours of observations using the infraredspectrograph and the sed mode of the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer.the sage-spec data, along with archival spitzer spectroscopy of objects in thelarge magellanic cloud, are reduced and delivered to the community. we discussthe observing strategy, the specific data reduction pipelines applied and thedissemination of data products to the scientific community. initial scienceresults include the first detection of an extragalactic "21 um" feature towardsan evolved star and elucidation of the nature of disks around rv tauri stars inthe large magellanic cloud. towards some young stars, ice features are observedin absorption. we also serendipitously observed a background quasar, at aredshift of z~0.14, which appears to be host-less.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1865	the herschel revolution: unveiling the morphology of the high mass star  formation sites n44 and n63 in the lmc	we study the structure of the medium surrounding sites of high-mass starformation to determine the interrelation between the hii regions and theenvironment from which they were formed. the density distribution of thesurroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed starsinteracts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a starformation tracer. we present new herschel/spire 250, 350 and 500 mum data oflha 120-n44 and lha 120-n63 in the lmc. we construct average spectral energydistributions (seds) for annuli centered on the ir bright part of the starformation sites. the annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. we use a phenomenological dustmodel to fit these seds to derive the dust column densities, characterise theincident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules. we see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density asa function of radial distance around n63. n44 does not show a systematic trend.we construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-d density profile ofthe surroundings of these two regions. herschel/spire data have proven veryefficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. we find that the radiationfield in the two sources behaves very differently. n63 is more or lessspherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. n44shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably dueto the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complexdistribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1006.0985	herschel inventory of the agents of galaxy evolution (heritage): the  large magellanic cloud dust	the herschel inventory of the agents of galaxy evolution (heritage) of themagellanic clouds will use dust emission to investigate the life cycle ofmatter in both the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc). using theherschel space observatory's pacs and spire photometry cameras, we imaged a 2x8square degree strip through the lmc, at a position angle of ~22.5 degrees aspart of the science demonstration phase of the herschel mission. we present thedata in all 5 herschel bands: pacs 100 and 160 {\mu}m and spire 250, 350 and500 {\mu}m. we present two dust models that both adequately fit the spectralenergy distribution for the entire strip and both reveal that the spire 500{\mu}m emission is in excess of the models by 6 to 17%. the spire emissionfollows the distribution of the dust mass, which is derived from the model. thepah-to-dust mass (f_pah) image of the strip reveals a possible enhancement inthe lmc bar in agreement with previous work. we compare the gas massdistribution derived from the hi 21 cm and co j=1-0 line emission maps to thedust mass map from the models and derive gas-to-dust mass ratios (gdrs). thedust model, which uses the standard graphite and silicate optical propertiesfor galactic dust, has a very low gdr = 65(+15,-18) making it an unrealisticdust model for the lmc. our second dust model, which uses amorphous carboninstead of graphite, has a flatter emissivity index in the submillimeter andresults in a gdr = 287(+25,-42) that is more consistent with a gdr inferredfrom extinction.

1105.2492	the spitzer discovery of a galaxy with infrared emission solely due to  agn activity	we present a galaxy (sage1cj053634.78-722658.5) at a redshift of 0.14 ofwhich the ir is entirely dominated by emission associated with the agn. wepresent the 5-37 um spitzer/irs spectrum and broad wavelength sed ofsage1cj053634, an ir point-source detected by spitzer/sage (meixner et al2006). the source was observed in the sage-spec program (kemper et al., 2010)and was included to determine the nature of sources with deviant ir colours.the spectrum shows a redshifted (z=0.14+-0.005) silicate emission feature withan exceptionally high feature-to-continuum ratio and weak polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) bands. we compare the source with models of emission fromdusty tori around agns from nenkova et al. (2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

1110.1260	non-standard grain properties, dark gas reservoir, and extended  submillimeter excess, probed by herschel in the large magellanic cloud	aims: in this paper, we perform detailed modelling of the spitzer andherschel observations of the lmc, in order to: (i) systematically study theuncertainties and biases affecting dust mass estimates; and to (ii) explore thepeculiar ism properties of the lmc.  methods: to achieve these goals, we have modelled the spatially resolved sedswith two alternate grain compositions, to study the impact of differentsubmillimetre opacities on the dust mass. we have rigorously propagated theobservational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fittingprocess, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.  results: first, we show that using the integrated sed leads tounderestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained withsufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied. this might be thecase, in general, for unresolved galaxies. second, we show that milky way typegrains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possibleaccording to the element abundances in the lmc. a spatial analysis shows thatthis dilemma is the result of an exceptional property: the grains of the lmchave on average a larger intrinsic submm opacity (emissivity index beta~1.7 andopacity kappa_abs(160 microns)=1.6 m2/kg) than those of the galaxy. by studyingthe spatial distribution of the gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are able toconstrain the fraction of unseen gas mass between ~10, and ~100 % and show thatit is not sufficient to explain the gas-to-dust mass ratio obtained with milkyway type grains. finally, we confirm the detection of a 500 microns extendedemission excess with an average relative amplitude of ~15 %, varying up to 40%. this excess anticorrelates well with the dust mass surface density. althoughwe do not know the origin of this excess, we show that it is unlikely theresult of very cold dust, or cmb fluctuations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

[oiii] is dominated byextended emission from the high-excitation diffuse ionized gas; it is thebrightest far-infrared line, ~4 times brighter than [cii]. the extent of the[oiii] emission suggests that the medium is rather fragmented, allowing far-uvphotons to permeate into the ism to scales of &gt;30pc. furthermore, by comparing[cii] with [nii], we find that 95% of [cii] arises in pdrs, except toward thestellar cluster for which as much as 15% could arise in the ionized gas. wefind a remarkable correlation between [cii]+[oi] and pah emission, with [cii]dominating the cooling in diffuse pdrs and [oi] dominating in the densest pdrs.the combination of [cii] and [oi] provides a proxy for the total gas cooling inpdrs. our results suggest that pah emission describes better the pdr gasheating as compared to the total infrared emission.

(2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

1305.2628	an overview of the dwarf galaxy survey	the dwarf galaxy survey (dgs) program is studying low-metallicity galaxiesusing 230h of far-infrared (fir) and submillimetre (submm) photometric andspectroscopic observations of the herschel space observatory and draws to thisa rich database of a wide range of wavelengths tracing the dust, gas and stars.this sample of 50 galaxies includes the largest metallicity range achievable inthe local universe including the lowest metallicity (z) galaxies, 1/50 zsun,and spans 4 orders of magnitude in star formation rates. the survey is designedto get a handle on the physics of the interstellar medium (ism) of lowmetallicity dwarf galaxies, especially on their dust and gas properties and theism heating and cooling processes. the dgs produces pacs and spire maps oflow-metallicity galaxies observed at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mic withthe highest sensitivity achievable to date in the fir and submm. the firfine-structure lines, [cii] 158 mic, [oi] 63 mic, [oi] 145 mic, [oiii] 88 mic,[niii] 57 mic and [nii] 122 and 205 mic have also been observed with the aim ofstudying the gas cooling in the neutral and ionized phases. the spire ftsobservations include many co lines (j=4-3 to j=13-12), [nii] 205 mic and [ci]lines at 370 and 609 mic. this paper describes the sample selection and globalproperties of the galaxies, the observing strategy as well as the vastancillary database available to complement the herschel observations. thescientific potential of the full dgs survey is described with some exampleresults included.

1308.3702	regional variations in the dense gas heating and cooling in m51 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in m51, [cii](158 \mu m), [nii](122 &amp; 205 \mu m),[oi](63 and 145 \mu m) and [oiii](88 \mu m). we compare the observed flux ofthese lines with the predicted flux from a photon dominated region model todetermine characteristics of the cold gas such as density, temperature and thefar-ultraviolet radiation field, g_0, resolving details on physical scales ofroughly 600 pc. we find an average [cii]/f_tir of 4 x 10^{-3}, in agreementwith previous studies of other galaxies. a pixel-by-pixel analysis of fourdistinct regions of m51 shows a radially decreasing trend in both thefar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation field, g_0 and the hydrogen density, n, peakingin the nucleus of the galaxy, then falling off out to the arm and interarmregions. we see for the first time that the fuv flux and gas density aresimilar in the differing environments of the arm and interarm regions,suggesting that the inherent physical properties of the molecular clouds inboth regions are essentially the same.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

0801.4955	variations of the mid-ir aromatic features inside and among galaxies	we present the results of a systematic study of mid-ir spectra of galacticregions, magellanic hii regions, and galaxies of various types (dwarf, spiral,starburst), observed by the satellites iso and spitzer. we study the relativevariations of the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 micron features inside spatiallyresolved objects (such as m82, m51, 30 doradus, m17 and the orion bar), as wellas among 90 integrated spectra of 50 objects. our main results are that the6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 micron bands are essentially tied together, while the ratiosbetween these bands and the 11.3 micron band varies by one order of magnitude.this implies that the properties of the pahs are remarkably universalthroughout our sample, and that the relative variations of the band ratios aremainly controled by the fraction of ionized pahs. in particular, we show thatwe can rule out both the modification of the pah size distribution, and themid-infrared extinction, as an explanation of these variations. using a fewwell-studied galactic regions (including the spectral image of the orion bar),we give an empirical relation between the i(6.2)/i(11.3) ratio and theionization/recombination ratio g0/ne.tgas^0.5, therefore providing a usefulquantitative diagnostic tool of the physical conditions in the regions wherethe pah emission originates. finally, we discuss the physical interpretation ofthe i(6.2)/i(11.3) ratio, on galactic size scales.

1312.3442	gas-to-dust mass ratios in local galaxies over a 2 dex metallicity range	this paper analyses the behaviour of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) oflocal universe galaxies over a large metallicity range. we combine threesamples: the dwarf galaxy survey, the kingfish survey and a subsample fromgalametz et al. (2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicityrange, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.0. the dust masses arehomogeneously determined with a semi-empirical dust model, including submmconstraints. the atomic and molecular gas masses are compiled from theliterature. two xco are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the galacticxco, and a xco depending on the metallicity (as z^{-2}). correlations withmorphological types, stellar masses, star formation rates and specific starformation rates are discussed. the trend between g/d and metallicity isempirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a brokenpower-law. we compare the evolution of the g/d with predictions from chemicalevolution models. we find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,metallicity is the galactic property driving the observed g/d. the g/d versusmetallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1over the whole metallicity range. the observed trend is steeper formetallicities lower than ~ 8.0. a large scatter is observed in the g/d for agiven metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1dex. the broken power-law reproduces best the observed g/d and providesestimates of the g/d that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. the good agreementof the g/d and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution modelsshows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting thedifferent star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grainsize distributions and chemical compositions across the sample.

1401.0563	the molecular gas reservoir of 6 low-metallicity galaxies from the  herschel dwarf galaxy survey: a ground-based follow-up survey of co(1-0),  co(2-1), and co(3-2)	we aim to quantify the molecular gas reservoir in a subset of 6low-metallicity galaxies from the herschel dwarf galaxy survey with newlyacquired co data, and link this reservoir to the observed star formationactivity. we present co(1-0), co(2-1), and co(3-2) observations obtained at theatnf mopra 22-m, apex, and iram 30-m telescopes, as well as [cii] 157um and[oi] 63um observations obtained with the herschel/pacs spectrometer in the 6galaxies: haro11, mrk1089, mrk930, ngc4861, ngc625, and um311. we derivemolecular gas mass from several methods including the use of the co-to-h2conversion factor xco (both galactic and metallicity-scaled values) and of dustmeasurements. the molecular and atomic gas reservoirs are compared to the starformation activity. we also constrain the physical conditions of the molecularclouds using the non-lte code radex and the spectral synthesis code cloudy. wedetect co in 5 of the 6 galaxies, including first detections in haro11 (z~0.4zsun), mrk930 (0.2 zsun), and um311 (0.5 zsun), but co remains undetected inngc4861 (0.2 zsun). the co luminosities are low while [cii] is bright in thesegalaxies, resulting in [cii]/co(1-0)&gt;10000. our dwarf galaxies are inrelatively good agreement with the schmidt-kennicutt relation for total gas.they show short molecular depletion time scales, even when consideringmetallicity-scaled xco factors. those galaxies are dominated by their hi gas,except haro11 which has high star formation efficiency and is dominated byionized and molecular gas. we determine the mass of each ism phase in haro11using cloudy and estimate an equivalent xco factor which is 10 times higherthan the galactic value. overall, our results confirm the emerging picture thatco suffers from significant selective photodissociation in low-metallicitydwarf galaxies.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1402.5967	a resolved analysis of cold dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral  ngc 891	we investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-onspiral galaxy ngc 891. high resolution herschel pacs and spire 70, 100, 160,250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with jcmt scuba 850 $\mu$mobservations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energydistribution (sed). maps of the hi 21 cm line and co(j=3-2) emission trace theatomic and molecular hydrogen gas, respectively. we fit one-component modifiedblackbody models to the integrated sed, finding a global dust mass of8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 k. wealso fit the pixel-by-pixel seds to produce maps of the dust mass andtemperature. the dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellarpopulation as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. the derived dust temperature,which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 k, is found to correlate with the 24$\mu$m emission. allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an averagevalue of $\beta$ = 1.9$\pm$0.3. we confirm an inverse relation between the dustemissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe anyvariation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of thedisk. a comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of theism reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities ofdust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. observedasymmetries in the dust temperature, and the h$_{2}$-to-dust and totalgas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate may bethe result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel starformation in the ne compared to the sw. whilst the asymmetry likely arises fromdust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of thespiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in thene side of the disk.

1410.3874	quantifying the heating sources for mid-infrared dust emissions in  galaxies: the case of m 81	with the newly available spire images at 250 and 500 micron from herschelspace observatory, we study quantitative correlations over a sub-kpc scaleamong three distinct emission components in the interstellar medium of thenearby spiral galaxy m 81 (ngc 3031): (a) $i_{8}$ or $i_{24}$, the surfacebrightness of the mid-infrared emission observed in the spitzer irac 8 or mips24 micron band, with $i_8$ and $i_{24}$ being dominated by the emissions frompolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and very small grains (vsgs) of dust,respectively; (b) $i_{500}$, that of the cold dust continuum emission in theherschel spire 500 micron band, dominated by the emission from large dustgrains heated by evolved stars, and (c) $i_{{\rm h}\alpha}$, a nominal surfacebrightness of the h$\alpha$ line emission, from gas ionized by newly formedmassive stars. the results from our correlation study, free from any assumptionon or modeling of dust emissivity law or dust temperatures, present solidevidence for significant heating of pahs and vsgs by evolved stars. in the caseof m 81, about 67% (48%) of the 8 micron (24 micron) emission derives itsheating from evolved stars, with the remainder attributed to radiation heatingassociated with ionizing stars.

1410.6156	insights into gas heating and cooling in the disc of ngc 891 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy, ngc 891: [cii]158 $\mu$m, [nii] 122, 205 $\mu$m, [oi] 63, 145 $\mu$m, and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m.we find that the photoelectric heating efficiency of the gas, traced via the([cii]+[oii]63)/$f_{\mathrm{tir}}$ ratio, varies from a mean of3.5$\times$10$^{-3}$ in the centre up to 8$\times$10$^{-3}$ at increasingradial and vertical distances in the disc. a decrease in([cii]+[oii]63)/$f_{\mathrm{tir}}$ but constant([cii]+[oi]63)/$f_{\mathrm{pah}}$ with increasing fir colour suggests thatpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) may become important for gas heating inthe central regions. we compare the observed flux of the fir cooling lines andtotal ir emission with the predicted flux from a pdr model to determine the gasdensity, surface temperature and the strength of the incident far-ultraviolet(fuv) radiation field, $g_{0}$. resolving details on physical scales of ~0.6kpc, a pixel-by-pixel analysis reveals that the majority of the pdrs in ngc891's disc have hydrogen densities of 1 &lt; log ($n$/cm$^{-3}$) &lt; 3.5experiencing an incident fuv radiation field with strengths of 1.7 &lt; log $g_0$&lt; 3. although these values we derive for most of the disc are consistent withthe gas properties found in pdrs in the spiral arms and inter-arm regions ofm51, observed radial trends in $n$ and $g_0$ are shown to be sensitive tovarying optical thickness in the lines, demonstrating the importance ofaccurately accounting for optical depth effects when interpreting observationsof high inclination systems. with an empirical relationship between the mips 24$\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m emission, we estimate an enhancement of the fuvradiation field strength in the far north-eastern side of the disc.

1411.3960	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xviii. star-forming dwarf galaxies in  a cluster environment	to assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different componentsof the interstellar medium, we analyse the fir-submm properties of a sample ofstar-forming dwarf (sfd) galaxies detected by the herschel virgo cluster survey(hevics). we determine dust masses and dust temperatures by fitting a modifiedblack body (mbb) function to the spectral energy distributions (seds). stellarand gas masses, star formation rates (sfrs), and metallicities are obtainedfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. dust is detected in 49 out of 140optically identified dwarfs covered by the hevics field; considering onlydwarfs brighter than $m_b$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. afterevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the fir-submm seds arebest-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $t_d$ = 22.4 k.assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five herschelbands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the mbb model. the excess isinversely correlated with sfr and stellar masses. to study the variations inthe global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we comparethe virgo sfds to other herschel surveys, such as kingfish, the dwarf galaxysurvey (dgs), and the hevics bright galaxy catalogue (bgc). we explore therelations between stellar mass and hi fraction, specific sfr, dust fraction,gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. highly hi-deficientvirgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formationactivity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in clusterdwarfs. however, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less thanthat of the hi component. since the virgo sfds are likely to be crossing thecluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip themore centrally concentrated dust distribution.

1412.7344	the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and  far-infrared dust emission from ngc 2403 and m83	we examine the relation between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission at 8 microns and far-infrared emission from hot dust grains at 24microns and from large dust grains at 160 and 250 microns in the nearby spiralgalaxies ngc 2403 and m83 using data from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory. we find that the pah emission in ngc 2403 is bettercorrelated with emission at 250 microns from dust heated by the diffuseinterstellar radiation field (isrf) and that the 8/250 micron surfacebrightness ratio is well-correlated with the stellar surface brightness asmeasured at 3.6 microns. this implies that the pahs in ngc 2403 are intermixedwith cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) and thatthe pahs are excited by the diffuse isrf. in m83, the pah emission appears morestrongly correlated with 160 micron emission originating from large dust grainsheated by star forming regions. however, the pah emission in m83 is low wherethe 24 micron emission peaks within star forming regions, and enhancements inthe 8/160 micron surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dustand the star forming regions within the spiral arms. this suggests that thepahs observed in the 8 micron band are not excited locally within star formingregions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star formingregions or locally by young, non-photoionising stars that have migrateddownstream from the spiral density waves. the results from just these twogalaxies show that pahs may be excited by different stellar populations indifferent spiral galaxies.

1501.03634	star-formation rates from young-star counts and the structure of the ism  across the ngc346/n66 complex in the smc	the rate at which interstellar gas is converted into stars, and itsdependence on environment, is one of the pillars on which our understanding ofthe visible universe is build. we present a comparison of the surface densityof young stars (sigma_*) and dust surface density (sigma_d) across ngc346 (n66)in 115 independent pixels of 6x6 pc^2. we find a correlation between sigma_*and sigma_d with a considerable scatter. a power law fit to the data yields asteep relation with an exponent of 2.6+-0.2. we convert sigma_d to gas surfacedensity (sigma_g) and sigma_* to star formation rate (sfr) surface densities(sigma_sfr), using simple assumptions for the gas-to-dust mass ratio and theduration of star formation. the derived total sfr (4+-1 10^-3 m_sun/yr) isconsistent with sfr estimated from the ha emission integrated over the hanebula. on small scales the sigma_sfr derived using ha systematicallyunderestimates the count-based sigma_sfr, by up to a factor of 10. this is dueto ionizing photons escaping the area, where the stars are counted. we findthat individual 36 pc^2 pixels fall systematically above integrateddisc-galaxies in the schmidt-kennicutt diagram by on average a factor of ~7.the ngc346 average sfr over a larger area (90 pc radius) lies closer to therelation but remains high by a factor of ~3. the fraction of the total mass(gas plus young stars) locked in young stars is systematically high (~10 percent) within the central 15 pc and systematically lower outside (2 per cent),which we interpret as variations in star formation efficiency. the inner 15 pcis dominated by young stars belonging to a centrally condensed cluster, whilethe outer parts are dominated by a dispersed population. therefore, theobserved trend could reflect a change of star formation efficiency betweenclustered and non-clustered star-formation.

1502.03131	the herschel dwarf galaxy survey: i. properties of the low-metallicity  ism from pacs spectroscopy	the far-infrared (fir) lines are key tracers of the physical conditions ofthe interstellar medium (ism) and are becoming workhorse diagnostics forgalaxies throughout the universe. our goal is to explain the differences andtrends observed in the fir line emission of dwarf galaxies compared to moremetal-rich galaxies. we present herschel pacs spectroscopic observations of thecii157um, oi63 and 145um, oiii88um, nii122 and 205um, and niii57umfine-structure cooling lines in a sample of 48 low-metallicity star-forminggalaxies of the guaranteed time key program dwarf galaxy survey. we correlatepacs line ratios and line-to-ltir ratios with ltir, ltir/lb, metallicity, andfir color, and interpret the observed trends in terms of ism conditions andphase filling factors with cloudy radiative transfer models. we find that thefir lines together account for up to 3 percent of ltir and that star-formingregions dominate the overall emission in dwarf galaxies. compared to metal-richgalaxies, the ratios of oiii/nii122 and niii/nii122 are high, indicative ofhard radiation fields. in the photodissociation region (pdr), the cii/oi63ratio is slightly higher than in metal-rich galaxies, with a small increasewith metallicity, and the oi145/oi63 ratio is generally lower than 0.1,demonstrating that optical depth effects should be small on the scales probed.the oiii/oi63 ratio can be used as an indicator of the ionized gas/pdr fillingfactor, and is found ~4 times higher in the dwarfs than in metal-rich galaxies.the high cii/ltir, oi/ltir, and oiii/ltir ratios, which decrease withincreasing ltir and ltir/lb, are interpreted as a combination of moderate fuvfields and low pdr covering factor. harboring compact phases of low fillingfactor and a large volume filling factor of diffuse gas, the ism oflow-metallicity dwarf galaxies has a more porous structure than that inmetal-rich galaxies.

1506.06782	modeling the physical properties in the ism of the low-metallicity  galaxy ngc4214	we present a model for the interstellar medium of ngc4214 with the objectiveto probe the physical conditions in the two main star-forming regions and theirconnection with the star formation activity of the galaxy. we used the spectralsynthesis code cloudy to model an hii region and the associatedphotodissociation region (pdr) to reproduce the emission of mid- andfar-infrared fine-structure cooling lines from the spitzer and herschel spacetelescopes for these two regions. input parameters of the model, such aselemental abundances and star formation history, are guided by earlier studiesof the galaxy, and we investigated the effect of the mode in which starformation takes place (bursty or continuous) on the line emission. furthermore,we tested the effect of adding pressure support with magnetic fields andturbulence on the line predictions. we find that this model can satisfactorilypredict (within a factor of ~2) all observed lines that originate from theionized medium ([siv] 10.5um, [neiii] 15.6um, [siii] 18.7um, [siii] 33.5um, and[oiii] 88um), with the exception of [neii] 12.8um and [nii] 122um, which mayarise from a lower ionization medium. in the pdr, the [oi] 63um, [oi] 145um,and [cii] 157um lines are matched within a factor of ~5 and work better whenweak pressure support is added to the thermal pressure or when the pdr cloudsare placed farther away from the hii regions and have covering factors lowerthan unity. our models of the hii region agree with different evolutionarystages found in previous studies, with a more evolved, diffuse central region,and a younger, more compact southern region. however, the local pdr conditionsare averaged out on the 175 pc scales that we probe and do not reflectdifferences observed in the star formation properties of the two regions.

1507.05432	linking dust emission to fundamental properties in galaxies: the  low-metallicity picture	in this work, we aim at providing a consistent analysis of the dustproperties from metal-poor to metal-rich environments by linking them tofundamental galactic parameters. we consider two samples of galaxies: the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs) and kingfish, totalling 109 galaxies, spanning almost 2 dexin metallicity. we collect infrared (ir) to submillimetre (submm) data for bothsamples and present the complete data set for the dgs sample. we model theobserved spectral energy distributions (sed) with a physically-motivated dustmodel to access the dust properties. using a different sed model (modifiedblackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage atsubmm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factortwo to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligiblesystematic modelling uncertainties. for eight galaxies in our sample, we find arather small excess at 500 microns (&lt; 1.5 sigma). we find that the dust sed oflow-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths comparedto more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. thepah mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be drivenmostly by the specific star-formation rate, ssfr, with secondary effects frommetallicity. the correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-irluminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.the dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studiedtrend of decreasing ratio for decreasing ssfr. the relation is more complex forhighly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemicalevolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio). dust growthprocesses in the ism play a key role in the dust mass build-up with respect tothe stellar content at high ssfr and low metallicity.

1511.07457	the dust properties and physical conditions of the interstellar medium  in the lmc massive star forming complex n11	we combine spitzer and herschel data of the star-forming region n11 in thelarge magellanic cloud to produce detailed maps of the dust properties in thecomplex and study their variations with the ism conditions. we also compareapex/laboca 870um observations with our model predictions in order to decomposethe 870um emission into dust and non-dust (free-free emission and co(3-2) line)contributions. we find that in n11, the 870um can be fully accounted for bythese 3 components. the dust surface density map of n11 is combined with hi andco observations to study local variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratios. ouranalysis leads to values lower than those expected from the lmc low-metallicityas well as to a decrease of the gas-to-dust mass ratio with the dust surfacedensity. we explore potential hypotheses that could explain the low observedgas-to-dust mass ratios (variations in the xco factor, presence of co-dark gasor of optically thick hi or variations in the dust abundance in the denseregions). we finally decompose the local seds using a principal componentanalysis (i.e. with no a priori assumption on the dust composition in thecomplex). our results lead to a promising decomposition of the local seds invarious dust components (hot, warm, cold) coherent with that expected for theregion. further analysis on a larger sample of galaxies will follow in order tounderstand how unique this decomposition is or how it evolves from oneenvironment to another.

astro-ph;0005208	high-resolution imaging of molecular gas and dust in the antennae (ngc  4038/39): super giant molecular complexes	we present new aperture synthesis co maps of the antennae (ngc 4038/39)obtained with the caltech millimeter array. these sensitive images showmolecular emission associated with the two nuclei and a partial ring of starformation to the west of ngc 4038, as well as revealing the large extent of theextra-nuclear region of star formation (the ``overlap region''), whichdominates the co emission from this system. the largest molecular complexeshave masses of 3-6x10^8 m_sun, typically an order of magnitude larger than thelargest structures seen to date in more quiescent galaxy disks. the extremelyred luminous star clusters identified previously with hst are well-correlatedwith the co emission, which supports the conclusion that they are highlyembedded young objects rather than old globular clusters. there is an excellentcorrelation between the co emission and the 15 micron emission seen with iso,particularly for the brightest regions. the most massive complexes in theoverlap region have similar [neiii]/[neii] ratios, which implies that all theseregions are forming many massive stars. however, only the brightestmid-infrared peak shows strong, rising continuum emission longward of 10microns, indicative of very small dust grains heated to high temperatures bytheir proximity to nearby luminous stars. since these grains are expected to beremoved rapidly from the immediate environment of the massive stars, it ispossible that this region contains very young (&lt; 1 myr) sites of starformation. alternatively, fresh dust grains could be driven into the sphere ofinfluence of the massive stars, perhaps by the bulk motions of two giantmolecular complexes. the kinematics and morphology of the co emission in thisregion provide some support for this second scenario.

astro-ph;0005376	mid-infrared diagnostics to distinguish agns from starbursts	we present new mid-infrared (mir) diagnostics to distinguish emission ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) from that originating in starburst regions. ourmethod uses empirical spectroscopic criteria based on the fact that miremission from star forming or active galaxies arises mostly from hii regions,photo-dissociation regions (pdrs) and agns. the analysis of the strength of the6.2micron unidentified infrared band (uib) and the mir continuum shows thatuibs are very faint or absent in regions harboring the intense and hardradiation fields of agns and pure hii regions, where the uib carriers could bedestroyed. the mir signature of agns is the presence of an important continuumin the 3-10micron band which originates from very hot dust heated by theintense agn radiation field. using these two distinct spectral properties foundin our mir templates, we build diagnostic diagrams which provide quantitativeestimates of the agn, pdr and hii region contribution in a given mir spectrum.this new mir classification can be used to reveal the presence of agns highlyobscured by large columns of dust.

astro-ph;0107365	star formation in m51 triggered by galaxy interaction	we have mapped the inner 360'' regions of m51 in the 158micron [cii] line at55'' spatial resolution using the far-infrared imaging fabry-perotinterferometer (fifi) on the kuiper airborne observatory (kao). the emission ispeaked at the nucleus, but is detectable over the entire region mapped, whichcovers much of the optical disk of the galaxy. there are also two strongsecondary peaks at ~43% to 70% of the nuclear value located roughly 120'' tothe north-east, and south-west of the nucleus. these secondary peaks are at thesame distance from the nucleus as the corotation radius of the density wavepattern. the density wave also terminates at this location, and the outlyingspiral structure is attributed to material clumping due to the interactionbetween m51 and ngc5195. this orbit crowding results in cloud-cloud collisions,stimulating star formation, that we see as enhanced [cii] line emission. the[cii] emission at the peaks originates mainly from photodissociation regions(pdrs) formed on the surfaces of molecular clouds that are exposed to obstarlight, so that these [cii] peaks trace star formation peaks in m51. thetotal mass of [cii] emitting photodissociated gas is ~2.6x10^{8} m_{sun}, orabout 2% of the molecular gas as estimated from its co(1-0) line emission. atthe peak [cii] positions, the pdr gas mass to total gas mass fraction issomewhat higher, 3-17%, and at the secondary peaks the mass fraction of the[cii] emitting photodissociated gas can be as high as 72% of the molecularmass....

astro-ph;0306192	ism properties in low-metallicity environments ii. the dust spectral  energy distribution of ngc 1569	we present new 450 and 850 microns scuba data of the dwarf galaxy ngc 1569.we construct the mid-infrared to millimeter sed of ngc 1569, using isocam,isophot, iras, kao, scuba and mambo data, and model the sed in order to explorethe nature of the dust in low metallicity environments. the detailed modelingis performed in a self-consistent way, synthesizing the global isrf of thegalaxy using an evolutionary synthesis model with further constraints providedby the observed mir ionic lines and a photoionisation model. our results showthat the dust properties are different in this low metallicity galaxy comparedto other more metal rich galaxies. the results indicate a paucity of pahsprobably due to the destructive effects of the isrf penetrating a clumpyenvironment and a size-segregation of grains where the emission is dominated bysmall grains of size ~3 nm, consistent with the idea of shocks having adramatic effect on the dust properties in ngc 1569. a significant millimetreexcess is present in the dust sed which can be explained by the presence ofubiquitous very cold dust (t = 5-7 k). this dust component accounts for 40 to70 % of the total dust mass in the galaxy (1.6 - 3.4 10^5 msol) and could bedistributed in small clumps (size a few pc) throughout the galaxy. we find agas-to-dust mass ratio of 740 - 1600, larger than that of the galaxy and adust-to-metals ratio of 1/4 to 1/7. we generate an extinction curve for ngc1569, consistent with the modeled dust size distribution. this extinction curvehas relatively steep fuv rise and smaller 2175 angstroms bump, resembling theobserved extinction curve of some regions in the large magellanic cloud.

astro-ph;0308545	the mass function of super giant molecular complexes and implications  for forming young massive star clusters in the antennae (ngc 4038/39)	we have used previously published observations of the co emission from theantennae (ngc 4038/39) to study the detailed properties of the super giantmolecular complexes with the goal of understanding the formation of youngmassive star clusters. over a mass range from 5e6 to 9e8 solar masses, themolecular complexes follow a power-law mass function with a slope of -1.4 +/-0.1, which is very similar to the slope seen at lower masses in molecularclouds and cloud cores in the galaxy. compared to the spiral galaxy m51, whichhas a similar surface density and total mass of molecular gas, the antennaecontain clouds that are an order of magnitude more massive. many of theyoungest star clusters lie in the gas-rich overlap region, where extinctions ashigh as av~100 imply that the clusters must lie in front of the gas. combiningdata on the young clusters, thermal and nonthermal radio sources, and themolecular gas suggests that young massive clusters could have formed at aconstant rate in the antennae over the last 160 myr and that sufficient gasexists to sustain this cluster formation rate well into the future. however,this conclusion requires that a very high fraction of the massive clusters thatform initially in the antennae do not survive as long as 100 myr. finally, wecompare our data with two models for massive star cluster formation andconclude that the model where young massive star clusters form from dense coreswithin the observed super giant molecular complexes is most consistent with ourcurrent understanding of this merging system.

astro-ph;0312029	dust emission in early-type galaxies: the mid-infrared view	we present mid-infrared (mir) maps for a sample of 18 early-type galaxiesobserved at 4.5, 6.7 and 15 microns with the isocam instrument on board the isosatellite with a 6'' spatial resolution. we model the spectral energydistribution (sed) of these galaxies using the stellar evolutionary synthesismodel pegase and we derive the mir excess over the stellar component. we thenexplore the nature of this excess in terms of dust and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon molecules (pahs). we find that out of 18 galaxies, 10 show excessat 6.7 microns (due to the presence of pah features) and 14 show excess at 15microns (due to the presence of warm dust). in two galaxies, where a morecomplete wavelength coverage exists, an excess around 9.7 microns is seen(presumably due to silicate dust emission), while two other galaxies aretotally devoid of dust. we also examine the morphology of the galaxies in thesewavelengths by plotting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles as well as themir color profiles. we find that for the majority of the galaxies the 4.5micron emission is well described by a de vaucouleurs profile. the 6.7 and 15micron emission is smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy while only a fewgalaxies show mir emission which is more concentrated close to the center. twodwarf galaxies in our sample show patchy distributions of the mir emissionwhile two other galaxies show edge-on disks. with color-color diagrams wedelineate the regions occupied by late-type and early-type galaxies. finally weshow that the mir excess found in strong radio galaxies like ngc 4486 (m87) canbe explained by synchrotron emission.

astro-ph;0508027	dissecting the spiral galaxy m83: mid-infrared emission and comparison  with other tracers of star formation	we present a detailed mid-infrared study of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxym83 based on isocam data. m83 is a unique case study, since a wide variety ofmir broad-band filters as well as spectra, covering the wavelength range of 4to 18\mu m, were observed and are presented here. emission maxima trace thenuclear and bulge area, star-formation regions at the end of the bar, as wellas the inner spiral arms. the fainter outer spiral arms and interarm regionsare also evident in the mir map. spectral imaging of the central 3'x3' (4 kpc x4 kpc) field allows us to investigate five regions of different environments.the various mir components (very small grains, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(pah) molecules, ionic lines) are analyzed for different regions throughout thegalaxy. in the total 4\mu m to 18\mu m wavelength range, the pahs dominate theluminosity, contributing between 60% in the nuclear and bulge regions and 90%in the less active, interarm regions. throughout the galaxy, the underlyingcontinuum emission from the small grains is always a smaller contribution inthe total mir wavelength regime, peaking in the nuclear and bulge components.the implications of using broad-band filters only to characterize themid-infrared emission of galaxies, a commonly used isocam observation mode, arediscussed. we present the first quantitative analysis of new h-alpha and 6cmvla+effelsberg radio continuum maps of m83. the distribution of the miremission is compared with that of the co, hi, r band, h-alpha and 6cm radio. astriking correlation is found between the intensities in the two mid-infraredfilter bands and the 6cm radio continuum. to explain the tightmid-infrared-radio correlation we propose the anchoring of magnetic field linesin the photoionized shells of gas clouds.

(2005) for a larger survey. combined effects of metallicityand radiation field seem to be playing important roles in the observed behaviorof pahs in the low metallicity systems.

astro-ph;0612651	dissecting the cosmic infrared background with 3d instruments	the cosmic infrared background (cib) consists of emission from distant,dusty, star-forming galaxies. energetically, the cib is very important as itcontains as much energy as the extragalactic optical background. the nature andevolutionary status of the objects making up the background are, however,unclear. the cib peaks at ~150 microns, and as such is most effectively studiedfrom space. the limited apertures of space-borne telescopes set the angularresolution that can be attained, and so even herschel, with its 3.5m diameter,will be confusion-limited at this wavelengths at ~5mjy. the bulk of thegalaxies contributing to the cib are fainter than this, so it is difficult tostudy them without interferometry. here we present the results of a preliminarystudy of an alternative way of probing fainter than the continuum confusionlimit using far-ir imaging spectroscopy. an instrument capable of suchobservations is being planned for spica - a proposed japanese mission with anaperture equivalent to that of herschel and more than 2 orders of magnitudemore sensitive. we investigate the potential of imaging spectrometers to breakthe continuum confusion limit. we have simulated the capabilities of aspectrometer with modest field of view (2'x2'), moderate spectral resolution(r~1-2000) and high sensitivity. we find that such an instrument is capable ofnot only detecting line emission from sources with continuum fluxessubstantially below the confusion limit, but also of determining theirredshifts and, where multiple lines are detected, some emission linediagnostics. we conclude that 3-d imaging spectrometers on cooled far-ir spacetelescopes will be powerful new tools for extragalactic far-ir astronomy.

[cii] emissionarising partly from confined starburst regions and partly from surroundingquiescent clouds could explain the observed [cii] radiation at the interactionzone and the nuclei. there are small confined regions with high star formationactivity in the interaction zone and with a lower star formation activity inthe nuclei. this supports the high density and high fuv intensity for the pdrsin the interaction zone and the nuclei.

0812.2396	a spatially resolved study of photoelectric heating and [cii] cooling in  the lmc	(abridged) we study photoelectric heating throughout the large magellaniccloud. we quantify the importance of the [cii] cooling line and thephotoelectric heating process of various environments in the lmc andinvestigate which parameters control the extent of photoelectric heating. weuse the bice [cii] map and the spitzer/sage infrared maps. we examine thespatial variations in the efficiency of photoelectric heating: photoelectricheating rate over power absorbed by grains. we correlate the photoelectricheating efficiency and the emission from various dust constituents and studythe variations as a function of h\alpha emission, dust temperatures, and thetotal infrared luminosity. from this we estimate radiation field, gastemperature, and electron density. we find systematic variations inphotoelectric efficiency. the highest efficiencies are found in the diffusemedium, while the lowest coincide with bright star-forming regions (~1.4 timeslower). the [cii] line emission constitutes 1.32% of the far infraredluminosity across the whole of the lmc. we find correlations between the [cii]emission and ratios of the mid infrared and far infrared bands, which comprisevarious dust constituents. the correlations are interpreted in light of thespatial variations of the dust abundance and by the local environmentalconditions that affect the dust emission properties. as a function of the totalinfrared surface brightness, s_{tir}, the [cii] surface brightness can bedescribed as: s_{[cii]}=1.25 s_{tir}^{0.69} [10^{-3} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}sr^{-1}]. the [cii] emission is well-correlation with the 8 micrometeremission, suggesting that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons play a dominantrole in the photoelectric heating process.
