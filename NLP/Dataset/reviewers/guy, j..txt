0907.4524	the carnegie supernova project: first near-infrared hubble diagram to  z~0.7	the carnegie supernova project (csp) is designed to measure the luminositydistance for type ia supernovae (sne ia) as a function of redshift, and to setobservational constraints on the dark energy contribution to the total energycontent of the universe. the csp differs from other projects to date in itsgoal of providing an i-band {rest-frame} hubble diagram. here we present thefirst results from near-infrared (nir) observations obtained using the magellanbaade telescope for sne ia with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. we combine these results withthose from the low-redshift csp at z &lt;0.1 (folatelli et al. 2009). we presentlight curves and an i-band hubble diagram for this first sample of 35 sne iaand we compare these data to 21 new sne ia at low redshift. these data supportthe conclusion that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. whencombined with independent results from baryon acoustic oscillations (eisensteinet al. 2005), these data yield omega_m = 0.27 +/- 0.0 (statistical), andomega_de = 0.76 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09 (systematic), for the matterand dark energy densities, respectively. if we parameterize the data in termsof an equation of state, w, assume a flat geometry, and combine with baryonacoustic oscillations, we find that w = -1.05 +/- 0.13 (statistical) +/- 0.09(systematic). the largest source of systematic uncertainty on w arises fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration, signaling the importance ofsecuring more accurate photometric calibrations for future supernova cosmologyprograms. finally, we conclude that either the dust affecting the luminositiesof sne ia has a different extinction law (r_v = 1.8) than that in the milky way(where r_v = 3.1), or that there is an additional intrinsic color term withluminosity for sne ia independent of the decline rate.

0908.3808	photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey fields	we present the photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey (snls)fields. the snls aims at measuring the distances to sne ia at (0.3&lt;z&lt;1) usingmegacam, the 1 deg^2 imager on the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). theuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates thesystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the darkenergy equation of state. the photometric calibration of the snls requiresobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science fieldstars in each survey band (sdss-like ugriz bands) with respect to standardswith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the ubvrilandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby sne from the literaturenecessary to produce cosmological constraints. the spatial non-uniformities ofthe imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of densestellar fields. photometric zero-points against landolt standards are obtained.the linearity of the instrument is studied. we show that the imager filters andphotometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. we presentmodels of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of theposition on the focal plane. we define a natural magnitude system for megacam.we show that the systematics affecting the magnitude-to-flux relations can bereduced if we use the spectrophotometric standard star bd +17 4708 instead ofvega as a fundamental flux standard. we publish ugriz catalogs of tertiarystandards for all the snls fields.

0909.3316	the eso/vlt 3rd year type ia supernova data set from the supernova  legacy survey	we present 139 spectra of 124 type ia supernovae (sneia) that were observedat the eso/vlt during the first three years of the canada-france-hawaitelescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). this homogeneous data set isused to test for redshift evolution of sneia spectra, and will be used in thesnls 3rd year cosmological analyses.  spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that usesphotometric information from deep cfht legacy survey (cfht-ls) reference imagesto trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on thespectrogram as a function of wavelength. it also separates the supernova andits host light in 60% of cases. the identification of the supernova candidatesis performed using a spectrophotometric snia model.  a total of 124 sneia, roughly 50% of the overall snls spectroscopic sample,have been identified using the eso/vlt during the first three years of thesurvey. their redshifts range from z=0.149 to z=1.031. the average redshift ofthe sample is z=0.63+/-0.02. this constitutes the largest snia spectral set todate in this redshift range. the spectra are presented along with theirbest-fit spectral snia model and a host model where relevant. in the lattercase, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. we produce average spectrafor pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z&lt;0.5 and z&gt;=0.5sneia. we find that z&lt;0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass elementabsorptions than z&gt;= 0.5 spectra. the differences with redshift are consistentwith the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.

0912.1646	the type ia supernova rate in radio and infrared galaxies from the cfht  supernova legacy survey	we have combined the large sn ia database of the canada-france-hawaiitelescope supernova legacy survey and catalogs of galaxies with photometricredshifts, vla 1.4 ghz radio sources, and spitzer infrared sources. we presenteight sne ia in early-type host galaxies which have counterparts in the radioand infrared source catalogs. we find the sn ia rate in subsets of radio andinfrared early-type galaxies is ~1-5 times the rate in all early-type galaxies,and that any enhancement is always &lt;~ 2 sigma. rates in these subsets areconsistent with predictions of the two component "a+b" sn ia rate model. sinceinfrared properties of radio sn ia hosts indicate dust obscured star formation,we incorporate infrared star formation rates into the "a+b" model. we also showthe properties of sne ia in radio and infrared galaxies suggest the hostscontain dust and support a continuum of delay time distributions for sne ia,although other delay time distributions cannot be ruled out based on our data.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1006.2254	real-time analysis and selection biases in the supernova legacy survey	the supernova legacy survey (snls) has produced a high-quality, homogeneoussample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. in itsfirst four years of full operation (to june 2007), the snls discovered morethan 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmedspectroscopically as sne ia. use of these sne ia in precision cosmologycritically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in thesnls survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying sn ia population.this paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures,and uses detailed monte carlo simulations to examine the effects of malmquistbias and spectroscopic sampling. such sampling effects are found to becomeapparent at z~0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of thespectroscopically confirmed sn ia sample towards brighter values for z&gt;0.75. wedescribe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-yearsnls cosmological analysis (snls3), and present a breakdown of the systematicuncertainties involved.

1010.0509	dark energy constraints from a space-based supernova survey	we present a forecast of dark energy constraints that could be obtained froma large sample of distances to type ia supernovae detected and measured fromspace. we simulate the supernova events as they would be observed by aeuclid-like telescope with its two imagers, assuming those would be equippedwith 4 visible and 3 near infrared swappable filters. we account for knownsystematic uncertainties affecting the cosmological constraints, includingthose arising through the training of the supernova model used to fit thesupernovae light curves. using conservative assumptions and planck priors, wefind that a 18 month survey would yield constraints on the dark energy equationof state comparable to the cosmic shear approach in euclid: a variabletwo-parameter equation of state can be constrained to ~0.03 at z~0.3. theseconstraints are derived from distances to about 13,000 supernovae out to z=1.5,observed in two cones of 10 and 50 deg^2. these constraints do not requiremeasuring a nearby supernova sample from the ground. provided swappable filterscan be accommodated on euclid, distances to supernovae can be measured fromspace and contribute to obtain the most precise constraints on dark energyproperties.

1010.4743	the supernova legacy survey 3-year sample: type ia supernovae  photometric distances and cosmological constraints	we present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 highredshift type ia supernovae (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1) discovered during the first threeyears of the supernova legacy survey (snls). these events were detected andtheir multi-colour light curves measured using the megaprime/megacam instrumentat the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht), by repeatedly imaging fourone-square degree fields in four bands. follow-up spectroscopy was performed atthe vlt, gemini and keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae andto measure their redshifts. systematic uncertainties arising from light curvemodeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peakmagnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of aprecise calibration of the snls fields. a flat lambdacdm cosmological fit to231 snls high redshift type ia supernovae alone gives omega_m = 0.211 +/-0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). the dominant systematic uncertainty comes fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration. systematic uncertainties fromlight curve fitters come next with a total contribution of +/- 0.026 onomega_m. no clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope(beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.

1104.1443	supernova constraints and systematic uncertainties from the first 3  years of the supernova legacy survey	we combine high redshift type ia supernovae from the first 3 years of thesupernova legacy survey (snls) with other supernova (sn) samples, primarily atlower redshifts, to form a high-quality joint sample of 472 sne (123 low-$z$,93 sdss, 242 snls, and 14 {\it hubble space telescope}). sn data alone requirecosmic acceleration at &gt;99.9% confidence, including systematic effects. for thedark energy equation of state parameter (assumed constant out to at least$z=1.4$) in a flat universe, we find $w = -0.91^{+0.16}_{-0.20}(\mathrm{stat})^{+0.07}_{-0.14} (\mathrm{sys})$ from sne only, consistent with a cosmologicalconstant. our fits include a correction for the recently discoveredrelationship between host-galaxy mass and sn absolute brightness. we payparticular attention to systematic uncertainties, characterizing them using asystematics covariance matrix that incorporates the redshift dependence ofthese effects, as well as the shape-luminosity and color-luminosityrelationships. unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic termson the empirical light-curve models. the total systematic uncertainty isdominated by calibration terms. we describe how the systematic uncertaintiescan be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby andintermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated ontousno/sdss-like systems.

1104.1444	snls3: constraints on dark energy combining the supernova legacy survey  three year data with other probes	we present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using thesupernova legacy survey three year sample (snls3) of guy et al. (2010) andconley et al. (2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

1109.0948	photometric selection of type ia supernovae in the supernova legacy  survey	we present a sample of 485 photometrically identified type ia supernovacandidates mined from the first three years of data of the cfht supernovalegacy survey (snls). the images were submitted to a deferred processingindependent of the snls real-time detection pipeline. light curves of alltransient events were reconstructed in the g_m, r_m, i_m and z_m filters andsubmitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possiblesupernovae. pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by lightcurve shape criteria. type ia supernova identification relied on eventcharacteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normalsne ia. the light curve fitter salt2 was used for this purpose, assigning hostgalaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. the selected sample of 485candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the snls spectroscopicidentification. the contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated tobe 4%. testing hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us tomeasure the malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. the resultis fully consistent with the precise monte carlo based estimate used to correctsn ia distance moduli in the snls 3-year cosmological analyses. this paperdemonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshiftsupernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects forcosmological analyses from future large photometric sn ia surveys.

1109.5757	the rise-time of normal and subluminous type ia supernovae	we calculate the average stretch-corrected rise-time of type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the supernova legacy survey. we use the aggregate lightcurves ofspectroscopic and photometrically identified sne ia to fit the rising part ofthe lightcurve with a simple quadratic model. we obtain a lightcurve shapecorrected, i .e. stretch-corrected, fiducial rise-time of 17.02^{+0.18}_{-0.28}(stat) days. the measured rise-time differs from an earlier finding by the snls(conley et al. 2006) due to the use of different sn ia templates. we compare itto nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the earlypart of the lightcurve of sne ia up to z=1. we search for variations amongdifferent populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the samplein stretch. bright and slow decliners (s&gt;1.0) have consistent stretch-correctedrise-times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0); they areshorter by 0.57^{+0.47}_{-0.50} (stat) days. subluminous sne ia (here definedas objects with s&lt;0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with arise-time of 18.03^{+0.81}_{-1.37} (stat) days. we study several systematicbiases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect theaverage rise-time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. basedon our results, we estimate that subluminous sne ia are powered by 0.05-0.35solar masses of radioactive nickel synthesized in the explosion. ourconclusions are the same for the single-stretch and two-stretchparameterizations of the lightcurve.

0710.3896	verifying the cosmological utility of type ia supernovae: implications  of a dispersion in the ultraviolet spectra	we analyze the mean rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectrum of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and its dispersion using high signal-to-noise keck-i/lris-bspectroscopy for a sample of 36 events at intermediate redshift (z=0.5)discovered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey(snls). we introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in ourspectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the snls sne andtheir host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the uvspectral properties of a large sample of distant sne ia. although the mean snia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparablesample of high quality local spectra. within the high-redshift sample, wediscover significant uv spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as theprimary cause by examining trends with the optical sn color. althoughprogenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we seeare much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expectedpatterns. an interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength ofselected uv features with phase. we also demonstrate systematic differences inthe sn ia spectral features with sn light curve width in both the uv and theoptical. we show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statisticallimitation in the future use of high-redshift sne ia for precision cosmology.we conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and atmoderate redshift where the rest-frame uv can be studied precisely, in orderthat future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit sne ia ascosmological probes [abridged].

1203.4839	constraining type ia supernova models: sn 2011fe as a test case	the nearby supernova sn 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail.therefore, it is an important test case for type ia supernova (sn ia) models,which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of theseobjects. here, we explore how available and expected future observations of sn2011fe can be used to constrain sn ia explosion scenarios. we base ourdiscussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two whitedwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the mostwidely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to sne ia. althoughboth models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early andnear-maximum spectra of sn 2011fe obtained by the nearby supernova factory(snfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. the levelof agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating theexplosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leadsto differences in the 55co production. sn 2011fe is close enough to be followedsufficiently long to study this effect.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1212.4864	improved photometric calibration of the snls and the sdss supernova  surveys	we present a combined photometric calibration of the snls and the sdsssupernova survey, which results from a joint effort of the sdss and the snlscollaborations. we deliver fluxes calibrated to the hst spectrophotometric starnetwork for large sets of tertiary stars that cover the science fields of bothsurveys in all photometric bands. we also cross-calibrate directly the twosurveys and demonstrate their consistency. for each survey the flat-fielding isrevised based on the analysis of dithered star observations. the calibrationtransfer from the hst spectrophotometric standard stars to the multi-epochtertiary standard star catalogs in the science fields follows three differentpaths: observations of primary standard stars with the sdss pt telescope;observations of landolt secondary standard stars with snls megacam instrumentat cfht; and direct observation of faint hst standard stars with megacam. inaddition, the tertiary stars for the two surveys are cross-calibrated usingdedicated megacam observations of stripe 82. this overlap enables thecomparison of these three calibration paths and justifies using theircombination to improve the calibration accuracy. flat-field corrections haveimproved the uniformity of each survey as demonstrated by the comparison ofphotometry in overlapping fields: the rms of the difference between the twosurveys is 3 mmag in gri, 4 mmag in z and 8 mmag in u. we also find aremarkable agreement (better than 1%) between the sdss and the snls calibrationin griz. the cross-calibration and the introduction of direct calibrationobservations bring redundancy and strengthen the confidence in the resultingcalibration. we conclude that the surveys are calibrated to the hst with aprecision of about 0.4% in griz. this precision is comparable to the externaluncertainty affecting the color of the hst primary standard stars.

1304.4719	host galaxies of type ia supernovae from the nearby supernova factory	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of galaxies hostingtype ia supernovae (sne ia) observed by the nearby supernova factory(snfactory). combining galex uv data with optical and near infrared photometry,we employ stellar population synthesis techniques to measure sn ia host galaxystellar masses, star-formation rates (sfrs), and reddening due to dust. wereinforce the key role of galex uv data in deriving accurate estimates ofgalaxy sfrs and dust extinction. optical spectra of sn ia host galaxies arefitted simultaneously for their stellar continua and emission lines fluxes,from which we derive high precision redshifts, gas-phase metallicities, andhalpha-based sfrs. with these data we show that sn ia host galaxies presenttight agreement with the fiducial galaxy mass-metallicity relation from sdssfor stellar masses log(m_*/m_sun)&gt;8.5 where the relation is well-defined. thestar-formation activity of sn ia host galaxies is consistent with a sample ofcomparable sdss field galaxies, though this comparison is limited by systematicuncertainties in sfr measurements. our analysis indicates that sn ia hostgalaxies are, on average, typical representatives of normal field galaxies.

1304.4720	host galaxy properties and hubble residuals of type ia supernovae from  the nearby supernova factory	we examine the relationship between type ia supernova (sn ia) hubbleresiduals and the properties of their host galaxies using a sample of 115 sneia from the nearby supernova factory (snfactory). we use host galaxy stellarmasses and specific star-formation rates fitted from photometry for all hosts,as well as gas-phase metallicities for a subset of 69 star-forming (non-agn)hosts, to show that the sn ia hubble residuals correlate with each of thesehost properties. with these data we find new evidence for a correlation betweensn ia intrinsic color and host metallicity. when we combine our data with thoseof other published sn ia surveys, we find the difference between mean sn iabrightnesses in low and high mass hosts is 0.077 +- 0.014 mag. when viewed innarrow (0.2 dex) bins of host stellar mass, the data reveal apparent plateausof hubble residuals at high and low host masses with a rapid transition over ashort mass range (9.8 &lt;= log(m_*/m_sun) &lt;= 10.4). although metallicity has beena favored interpretation for the origin of the hubble residual trend with hostmass, we illustrate how dust in star-forming galaxies and mean sn ia progenitorage both evolve along the galaxy mass sequence, thereby presenting equallyviable explanations for some or all of the observed sn ia host bias.

0705.0367	is there evidence for a hubble bubble? the nature of type ia supernova  colors and dust in external galaxies	we examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of type iasupernovae (sne ia) for the $\sim 3 \sigma$ detection of a ``hubble bubble'' --a departure of the local value of the hubble constant from its globallyaveraged value \citep{jha:07}. by comparing the mlcs2k2 fits used in that studyto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, wedemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of sn color excesses(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of acolor gradient across the local sample. if the slope of the linear relation($\beta$) between sn color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then thebubble disappears. if, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely frommilky way-like dust, then sn data clearly favors a hubble bubble. wedemonstrate that sn data give $\beta \simeq 2$, instead of the $\beta \simeq 4$one would expect from purely milky-way-like dust. this suggests that either snintrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a singlelight-curve shape parameter, or that dust around sn is unusual. disentanglingthese possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey snia cosmology.

1306.5153	photometry of supernovae in an image series : methods and application to  the supernova legacy survey (snls)	we present a technique to measure lightcurves of time-variable point sourceson a spatially structured background from imaging data. the technique wasdeveloped to measure light curves of snls supernovae in order to infer theirdistances. this photometry technique performs simultaneous psf photometry atthe same sky position on an image series. we describe two implementations ofthe method: one that resamples images before measuring fluxes, and one whichdoes not. in both instances, we sketch the key algorithms involved and presentthe validation using semi-artificial sources introduced in real images in orderto assess the accuracy of the supernova flux measurements relative to that ofsurrounding stars. we describe the methods required to anchor these psf fluxesto calibrated aperture catalogs, in order to derive sn magnitudes. we find amarginally significant bias of 2 mmag of the after-resampling method, and nobias at the mmag accuracy for the non-resampling method. given surrounding starmagnitudes, we determine the systematic uncertainty of sn magnitudes to be lessthan 1.5 mmag, which represents about one third of the current photometriccalibration uncertainty affecting sn measurements. the sn photometry deliversseveral by-products: bright star psf flux mea- surements which have arepeatability of about 0.6%, as for aperture measurements; we measure relativeastrometric positions with a noise floor of 2.4 mas for a single-image brightstar measurement; we show that in all bands of the megacam instrument, starsexhibit a profile linearly broadening with flux by about 0.5% over the wholebrightness range.

1309.1182	evidence of environmental dependencies of type ia supernovae from the  nearby supernova factory indicated by local h{\alpha}	(abridged) we study the host galaxy regions in close proximity to type iasupernovae (sne ia) to analyze relations between the properties of sn ia eventsand environments most similar to where their progenitors formed. we focus onlocal h\alpha\ emission as an indicator of young environments. the nearbysupernova factory has obtained flux-calibrated spectral timeseries for sne iausing integral field spectroscopy, allowing the simultaneous measurement of thesn and its immediate vicinity. for 89 sne ia we measure h\alpha\ emissiontracing ongoing star formation within a 1 kpc radius around each sn. thisconstitutes the first direct study of the local environment for a large sampleof sne ia also having accurate luminosity, color and stretch measurements. wefind that sne ia with local h\alpha\ emission are redder by 0.036+/-0.017 mag,and that the previously-noted correlation between stretch and host mass isentirely driven by the sne ia coming from passive regions. most importantly,the mean standardized brightness for sne ia with local h\alpha\ emission is0.094+/-0.031 mag fainter than for those without. this offset arises from abimodal structure in the hubble residuals, that also explains thepreviously-known host-mass bias. we combine this bimodality with the cosmicstar-formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean sn iabrightness and the host-mass bias. this change is confirmed using high-redshiftsne ia from the literature. these environmental dependences point to remainingsystematic errors in sne ia standardization. the observed brightness offset ispredicted to cause a significant bias in measurements of the dark energyequation of state. recognition of these effects offers new opportunities toimprove sne ia as cosmological probes - e.g. sne ia having local h\alpha\emission are more homogeneous, having a brightness dispersion of 0.105+/-0.012mag.

1401.3352	type ia supernova hubble residuals and host-galaxy properties	kim et al. (2013) [k13] introduced a new methodology for determiningpeak-brightness absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae from multi-band lightcurves. we examine the relation between their parameterization of light curvesand hubble residuals, based on photometry synthesized from the nearby supernovafactory spectrophotometric time series, with global host-galaxy properties. thek13 hubble residual step with host mass is $0.013\pm 0.031$ mag for a supernovasubsample with data coverage corresponding to the k13 training; at $\ll1\sigma$, the step is not significant and lower than previous measurements.relaxing the data coverage requirement the hubble residual step with host massis $0.045\pm 0.026$ mag for the larger sample; a calculation using the modes ofthe distributions, less sensitive to outliers, yields a step of 0.019 mag. theanalysis of this article uses k13 inferred luminosities, as distinguished fromprevious works that use magnitude corrections as a function of salt2 color andstretch parameters: steps at $&gt;2\sigma $ significance are found in salt2 hubbleresiduals in samples split by the values of their k13 $x(1)$ and $x(2)$light-curve parameters. $x(1)$ affects the light-curve width and color aroundpeak (similar to the $\delta m_{15}$ and stretch parameters), and $x(2)$affects colors, the near-uv light-curve width, and the light-curve decline 20to 30 days after peak brightness. the novel light-curve analysis, increasedparameter set, and magnitude corrections of k13 may be capturing features ofsn~ia diversity arising from progenitor stellar evolution.

1401.4064	improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the sdss-ii  and snls supernova samples	we present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type iasupernova (sn ia) observations obtained by the sdss-ii and snls collaborations.the data set includes several low-redshift samples (z&lt;0.1), all 3 seasons fromthe sdss-ii (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.4), and 3 years from snls (0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1) and totals\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with high quality lightcurves. we have followed the methods and assumptions of the snls 3-year dataanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition ofthe full sdss-ii spectroscopically-confirmed sn ia sample in both the trainingof the salt2 light curve model and in the hubble diagram analysis (\nsdsscsne), 2) inter-calibration of the snls and sdss surveys and reduced systematicuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect tothe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errorsassociated with the salt2 modeling of sn ia light-curves. we producerecalibrated sn ia light-curves and associated distances for the sdss-ii andsnls samples. the large sdss-ii sample provides an effective, independent,low-z anchor for the hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error fromcalibration systematics in the low-z sn sample. for a flat lcdm cosmology wefind omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recentcmb measurement from the planck and wmap experiments. our result is 1.8sigma(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of snls 3-year data.the change is due primarily to improvements in the snls photometriccalibration. when combined with cmb constraints, we measure a constantdark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flatuniverse. adding bao distance measurements gives similar constraints:w=-1.027+-0.055.

1403.0854	first experimental constraints on the disformally coupled galileon model	the galileon model is a modified gravity model that can explain the late-timeaccelerated expansion of the universe. in a previous work, we derivedexperimental constraints on the galileon model with no explicit coupling tomatter and showed that this model agrees with the most recent cosmologicaldata. in the context of braneworld constructions or massive gravity, thegalileon model exhibits a disformal coupling to matter, which we study in thispaper. after comparing our constraints on the uncoupled model with recentstudies, we extend the analysis framework to the disformally coupled galileonmodel and derive the first experimental constraints on that coupling, usingprecise measurements of cosmological distances and the growth rate of cosmicstructures. in the uncoupled case, with updated data, we still observe a lowtension between the constraints set by growth data and those from distances. inthe disformally coupled galileon model, we obtain better agreement with dataand favour a non-zero disformal coupling to matter at the $2.5\sigma$ level.this gives an interesting hint of the possible braneworld origin of galileontheory.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

1411.4424	a metric space for type ia supernova spectra	we develop a new framework for use in exploring type ia supernova (sn ia)spectra. combining principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squareanalysis (pls) we are able to establish correlations between the principalcomponents (pcs) and spectroscopic/photometric sne ia features. the techniquewas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the nearby supernovafactory. the ability of pca to group together sne ia with similar spectralfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by twoimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivativesof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines anddiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through theuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input datamatrix. these allow us to define a stable pc parameter space which can be usedto characterize synthetic sn ia spectra by means of real sn features. usingpls, we demonstrate that the information from important previously knownspectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pew) of si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 and the line velocity of s ii 5640 / si ii 6355) at a given epoch,is contained within the pc space and can be determined through a linearcombination of the most important pcs. we also show that the pc spaceencompasses photometric features like b or v magnitudes, b-v color and salt2parameters c and x1. the observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavilyaffected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. allthe above mentioned applications allowed us to construct a metric space forcomparing synthetic sn ia spectra with observations.

1412.5533	type ia supernova distance modulus bias and dispersion from k-correction  errors: a direct measurement using lightcurve fits to observed spectral time  series	we estimate systematic errors due to k-corrections in standard photometricanalyses of high redshift type ia supernovae. errors due to k-correction occurwhen the spectral template model underlying the lightcurve fitter poorlyrepresents the actual supernova spectral energy distribution, meaning that thedistance modulus cannot be recovered accurately. in order to quantify thiseffect, synthetic photometry is performed on artificially redshiftedspectrophotometric data from 119 low-redshift supernovae from the nearbysupernova factory, and the resulting lightcurves are fit with a conventionallightcurve fitter. we measure the variation in the standardized magnitude thatwould be fit for a given supernova if located at a range of redshifts andobserved with various filter sets corresponding to current and future supernovasurveys. we find significant variation in the measurements of the samesupernovae placed at different redshifts regardless of filters used, whichcauses dispersion greater than $\sim0.05$ mag for measurements of photometryusing the sloan-like filters and a bias that corresponds to a $0.03$ shift in$w$ when applied to an outside data set. to test the result of a shift insupernova population or environment at higher redshifts, we repeat ourcalculations with the addition of a reweighting of the supernovae as a functionof redshift and find that this strongly affects the results and would haverepercussions for cosmology. we discuss possible methods to reduce thecontribution of the k-correction bias and uncertainty.

astro-ph;0510857	photometric selection of high-redshift type ia supernovae	we present a method for selecting high-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia)located via rolling sn searches. the technique, using both color and magnitudeinformation of events from only 2-3 epochs of multi-band real-time photometry,is able to discriminate between sne ia and core collapse sne. furthermore, forthe sne ia, the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase and light-curveparameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. wedemonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of sne iaand core-collapse sne, where the selection method effectively rejects mostcore-collapse sne while retaining sne ia. we also apply the selection code toreal-time data acquired as part of the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey (snls). during the period may 2004 to january 2005 in the snls,440 sn candidates were discovered of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopicallyas sne ia and 15 as core-collapse events. for this test dataset, the selectiontechnique correctly identifies 100% of the identified sne ii as non-sne ia withonly a 1-2% false rejection rate. the predicted parameterization of the sne iahas a precision of |delta_z|/(1+z_spec)&lt;0.09 in redshift, and +/- 2-3rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planningspectroscopic follow-up observations. we also investigate any bias introducedby this selection method on the ability of surveys such as snls to measurecosmological parameters (e.g., w and omega matter), and find any effect to benegligible.

astro-ph;0605148	the type ia supernova rate at z ~0.5 from the supernova legacy survey	we present a measurement of the distant type ia supernova rate derived fromthe first two years of the canada -- france -- hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey. we observed four one-square degree fields with a typicaltemporal frequency of &lt;delta t&gt; ~ 4 observer-frame days over time spans of from158 to 211 days per season for each field, with breaks during full moon. weused 8-10 meter-class telescopes for spectroscopic followup to confirm ourcandidates and determine their redshifts. our starting sample consists of 73spectroscopically verified type ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt;0.6. we derive a volumetric sn ia rate of r_v(&lt;z&gt;=0.47) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.09}(systematic) +- 0.06 (statistical) x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^3, assuming h = 0.7,omega_m = 0.3 and a flat cosmology. using recently published galaxy luminosityfunctions derived in our redshift range, we derive a sn ia rate per unitluminosity of r_l(&lt;z&gt;=0.47) = 0.154^{+0.048}_{-0.033} (systematic)^{+0.039}_{-0.031} (statistical) snu. using our rate alone, we place an upperlimit on the component of sn ia production that tracks the cosmic starformation history of 1 sn ia per 10^3 m_sun of stars formed. our rate and otherrates from surveys using spectroscopic sample confirmation display only amodest evolution out to z=0.55.

astro-ph;0605455	rates and properties of type ia supernovae as a function of mass and  star-formation in their host galaxies	(abridged) we show that type ia supernovae (sne ia) are formed within bothvery young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on thestellar mass and mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of their host galaxies.models where the sn ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass areruled out with 99% confidence. our analysis is based on 100spectroscopically-confirmed sne ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,all from the supernova legacy survey (snls) and distributed over 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.75.using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and sfrs for the sn iahost galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions withthe galaxy spectral synthesis code, pegase.2. we show that the sn ia rate perunit mass is proportional to the specific sfr of the parent galaxies -- morevigorously star-forming galaxies host more sne ia per unit stellar mass,broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing sn ia rate in later-type galaxiesseen in the local universe. following earlier suggestions for a simple"two-component" model approximating the sn ia rate, we find bivariate lineardependencies of the sn ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean sfrs ofthe host systems. we also demonstrate a dependence of distant sn ia light-curveshapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observedlocally. passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially hostfaster-declining/dimmer sne ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are onlyfound in systems with ongoing star-formation. we model the light-curve widthdistribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and anold component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0607363	the rise time of type ia supernovae from the supernova legacy survey	we compare the rise times of nearby and distant type ia supernovae (sne ia)as a test for evolution using 73 high-redshift spectroscopically-confirmed sneia from the first two years of the five year supernova legacy survey (snls) andpublished observations of nearby sn. because of the ``rolling'' search natureof the snls, our measurement is approximately 6 times more precise thanprevious studies, allowing for a more sensitive test of evolution betweennearby and distant supernovae. adopting a simple $t^2$ early-time model (as inprevious studies), we find that the rest-frame $b$ rise times for a fiducial snia at high and low redshift are consistent, with values$19.10^{+0.18}_{-0.17}({stat}) \pm 0.2 ({syst})$ and $19.58^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$days, respectively; the statistical significance of this difference is only 1.4\sg . the errors represent the uncertainty in the mean rather than anyvariation between individual sn. we also compare subsets of our high-redshiftdata set based on decline rate, host galaxy star formation rate, and redshift,finding no substantive evidence for any subsample dependence.

astro-ph;0610062	dune: the dark universe explorer	understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy is one of the mostpressing issues in cosmology and fundamental physics. the purpose of the dune(dark universe explorer) mission is to study these two cosmological componentswith high precision, using a space-based weak lensing survey as its primaryscience driver. weak lensing provides a measure of the distribution of darkmatter in the universe and of the impact of dark energy on the growth ofstructures. dune will also include a complementary supernovae survey to measurethe expansion history of the universe, thus giving independent additionalconstraints on dark energy. the baseline concept consists of a 1.2m telescopewith a 0.5 square degree optical ccd camera. it is designed to be fast withreduced risks and costs, and to take advantage of the synergy betweenground-based and space observations. stringent requirements for weak lensingsystematics were shown to be achievable with the baseline concept. this willallow dune to place strong constraints on cosmological parameters, includingthe equation of state parameter of the dark energy and its evolution fromredshift 0 to 1. dune is the subject of an ongoing study led by the frenchspace agency (cnes), and is being proposed for esa's cosmic vision programme.

0809.4407	photometry assisted spectral extraction (phase) and identification of  snls supernovae	aim: we present new extraction and identification techniques for supernova(sn) spectra developed within the supernova legacy survey (snls) collaboration.  method: the new spectral extraction method takes full advantage ofphotometric information from the canada-france-hawai telescope (cfht) discoveryand reference images by tracing the exact position of the supernova and thehost signals on the spectrogram. when present, the host spatial profile ismeasured on deep multi-band reference images and is used to model the hostcontribution to the full (supernova + host) signal. the supernova is modelledas a gaussian function of width equal to the seeing. a chi-square minimisationprovides the flux of each component in each pixel of the 2d spectrogram. for ahost-supernova separation greater than &lt;~ 1 pixel, the two components arerecovered separately and we do not use a spectral template in contrast to morestandard analyses. this new procedure permits a clean extraction of thesupernova separately from the host in about 70% of the 3rd year eso/vlt spectraof the snls. a new supernova identification method is also proposed. it usesthe salt2 spectrophotometric template to combine the photometric and spectraldata. a galaxy template is allowed for spectra for which a separate extractionof the supernova and the host was not possible.  result: these new techniques have been tested against more standardextraction and identification procedures. they permit a secure type andredshift determination in about 80% of cases. the present paper illustratestheir performances on a few sample spectra.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.

0810.5129	dark energy constraints and correlations with systematics from cfhtls  weak lensing, snls supernovae ia and wmap5	we combine measurements of weak gravitational lensing from the cfhtls-widesurvey, supernovae ia from cfht snls and cmb anisotropies from wmap5 to obtainjoint constraints on cosmological parameters, in particular, the dark energyequation of state parameter w. we assess the influence of systematics in thedata on the results and look for possible correlations with cosmologicalparameters.  we implement an mcmc algorithm to sample the parameter space of a flat cdmmodel with a dark-energy component of constant w. systematics in the data areparametrised and included in the analysis. we determine the influence ofphotometric calibration of snia data on cosmological results by calculating theresponse of the distance modulus to photometric zero-point variations. the weaklensing data set is tested for anomalous field-to-field variations and asystematic shape measurement bias for high-z galaxies.  ignoring photometric uncertainties for snls biases cosmological parameters byat most 20% of the statistical errors, using supernovae only; the parameteruncertainties are underestimated by 10%. the weak lensing field-to-fieldvariance pointings is 5%-15% higher than that predicted from n-bodysimulations. we find no bias of the lensing signal at high redshift, within theframework of a simple model. assuming a systematic underestimation of thelensing signal at high redshift, the normalisation sigma_8 increases by up to8%. combining all three probes we obtain -0.10&lt;1+w&lt;0.06 at 68% confidence(-0.18&lt;1+w&lt;0.12 at 95%), including systematic errors. systematics in the dataincrease the error bars by up to 35%; the best-fit values change by less than0.15sigma.
