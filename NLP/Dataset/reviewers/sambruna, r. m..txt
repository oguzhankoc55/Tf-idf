physics;0412114	six years of bepposax observations of blazars: a spectral catalog	we present a spectral catalog for blazars based on the bepposax archive. thesample includes 44 high-energy peaked bl lacs (hbls), 14 low-energy peaked bllacs (lbls), and 28 flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs). a total of 168 lecs,mecs, and pds spectra were analyzed, corresponding to observations taken in theperiod 1996--2002. the 0.1--50 kev continuum of lbls and fsrqs is generallyfitted by a single power law with galactic column density. a minority of theobservations of lbls (25%) and fsrqs (15%) is best fitted by more complexmodels like the broken power law or the continuously curved parabola. theselatter models provide also the best description for half of the hbl spectra.complex models are more frequently required for sources with fluxes f_{2-10kev} &gt; 10^-11 cm-2 s-1, corresponding to spectra with higher signal-to-noiseratio. as a result, considering sources with flux above this threshold, thepercentage of spectra requiring those models increases for all the classes. wenote that there is a net separation of x-ray spectral properties between hblson one side, and lbls and fsrqs on the other, the distinction between lbls andfsrqs is more blurry. this is most likely related to ambiguities in the opticalclassification of the two classes.

0905.0472	the evolution of swift/bat blazars and the origin of the mev background	we use 3 years of data from the swift/bat survey to select a complete sampleof x-ray blazars above 15 kev. this sample comprises 26 flat-spectrum radioquasars (fsrqs) and 12 bl lac objects detected over a redshift range of0.03&lt;z&lt;4.0. we use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15--55kev band, the evolution of blazars. we find that, contrary to the seyfert-likeagns detected by bat, the population of blazars shows strong positiveevolution. this evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous opticalqsos and luminous x-ray selected agns. we also find evidence for anepoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quietagns. we interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion andjet activity. in our sample, the fsrqs evolve strongly, while our best-fitshows that bl lacs might not evolve at all. the blazar population accounts for10-20 % (depending on the evolution of the bl lacs) of the cosmic x-raybackground (cxb) in the 15--55 kev band. we find that fsrqs can explain theentire cxb emission for energies above 500 kev solving the mystery of thegeneration of the mev background. the evolution of luminous fsrqs shows a peakin redshift ($z_c$=4.3$\pm0.5$) which is larger than the one observed in qsosand x-ray selected agns. we argue that fsrqs can be used as tracers of massiveelliptical galaxies in the early universe.

0906.0799	structure of the accretion flow in broad-line radio galaxies: the case  of 3c390.3	we present xmm and suzaku observations of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg)3c390.3. the fe ka line has a width fwhm ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within afactor two with the width of the double-peaked h_alpha line, suggesting anorigin from the broad line region. the data show for the first time a weak,broad bump extending from 5 to 7 kev. when fitted with a gaussian, its centroidenergy is 6.6 kev in the source's rest-frame with fwhm of 43,000 km/s and ew of50 ev; its most likely interpretation is emission from he-like fe (fe xxv),suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3c390.3.the broad-band 0.5-100 kev continuum is well described by a single power lawwith photon index gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 kev, plus cold reflectionwith strength r=0.5. in addition, ionized reflection is required to account forthe 6.6 kev bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameterxi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector isconstrained to be larger than 20 r_g, although this result depends on theassumed emissivity profile of the disk. if true, we argue that the lack ofbroad fe k emission from within 20 r_g indicates that the innermost regions ofthe disk in 3c390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. while the sed of3c390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretionlow states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to x-ray bandsvia synchrotron self-compton emission.

0908.0716	short-term variability and psd analysis of the radio-loud agn 3c 390.3	we investigate the short-term variability properties and the power spectraldensity (psd) of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 390.3 using observationsmade by xmm, rxte, and suzaku on several occasions between october 2004 anddecember 2006. the main aim of this work is to derive model-independentconstraints on the origin of the x-ray emission and on the nature of thecentral engine in 3c 390.3. on timescales of the order of few hours, probed byuninterrupted xmm light curves, the flux of 3c 390.3 is consistent with beingconstant in all energy bands. on longer timescales, probed by the 2-day rxteand suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. the latterobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3c 390.3 isconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet seyfertgalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. the correlatedvariability between soft and hard x-rays, observed during the suzaku exposureand between the 2 xmm pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarioscharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10kev x-ray band. a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades infrequency suggests the presence of a break at t_br~43 days at a 92% confidencelevel. this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio-loud,non-jet dominated agn, after the blrg 3c120, and appears to be in generalagreement with the relation between t_br, m_bh, and l_bol, followed by seyfertgalaxies. our results indicate that the x-ray variability properties of 3c390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet agn, suggesting that thex-ray emission mechanism in 3c 390.3 is similar to that of nearby seyfertgalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

0707.2925	swift observations of high-redshift radio-loud quasars	we report on swift observations of four z&gt;2 radio-loud quasars (0212+735,0537-286, 0836+710, and 2149-307), classified as blazars. the sources,well-known emitters at soft-medium x-rays, were detected at &gt;5sigma with thebat experiment in 15-150 kev. no flux variability was detected within the xrtand bat exposures, with the exception of 0836+710 which shows an increase of afactor 4 of the 15-150 kev flux on a timescale of one month. the 0.3-10 kevspectra are well fitted by power law models, with rather hard continua (photonindices gamma_xrt ~1.3-1.5); similarly, the 15-150 kev spectra are described bypower laws with gamma_bat ~1.3-1.8. the xrt data exhibit spectral curvature,which can be modeled either in terms of excess absorption along the line ofsight, or a downward-curved broken power law. in the former case, if the excessn_h is at the rest-frame of the source, columns of n_h^z=(0.3-6)x10^22 cm^-2are measured. modeling of the seds of the four quasars shows that the emissionat the higher frequencies, &gt;~ 10^16 hz, is dominated by the jet, while thesteep optical-to-uv continua, observed with the uvot, can be attributed tothermal emission from the accretion disk. the disk luminosity is between 1% and10% the jet power, similar to other powerful blazars.

0912.2721	swift bat, fermi lat, and the blazar sequence	using public \fermi lat and \swift bat observations, we constructed the firstsample of blazars selected at both hard x-rays and gamma-rays. studying itsspectral properties, we find a luminosity dependence of the spectral slopes atboth energies. specifically, luminous blazars, generally classified as fsrqs,have {\it hard} continua in the medium-hard x-ray range but {\it soft} continuain the lat gamma-ray range (photon indices $\gamma_x$ \ltsima 2 and $\gamma_g$\gtsima 2), while lower luminosity blazars, classified as bl lacs, haveopposite behavior, i.e., {\it soft} x-ray and {\it hard} gamma-ray continua($\gamma_x$ \gtsima 2.4 and $\gamma_g &lt; 2$). the trends are confirmed bydetailed monte carlo simulations explicitly taking into account theobservational biases of both instruments. our results support the so-called``blazar sequence'' which was originally based on radio samples of blazars andradio luminosities. we also argue that the x-ray-to-gamma-ray continua ofblazars may provide independent insights into the physical conditions aroundthe jet, complementing/superseding the ambiguities of the traditionalclassification based on optical properties.

0707.3980	deep chandra and multicolor hst observations of the jets of 3c 371 and  pks 2201+044	this paper presents multiwavelength imaging and broad-band spectroscopy ofthe relativistic jets in the two nearby radio galaxies 3c 371 and pks 2201+044,acquired with chandra, hst, vla, and merlin. radio polarization images are alsoavailable. the two sources stand out as "intermediate'' between fris and friis;their cores are classified as bl lacs, although broad and narrow opticalemission lines were detected at times. the multiwavelength images show jetmorphologies with the x-ray emission peaking closer to the nucleus than thelonger wavelengths. the jets are resolved at all wavelengths in a directionperpendicular to the jet axis. the jets seds are consistent with a singlespectral component from radio to x-rays, interpreted as synchrotron emission.the seds show a progressive softening from the inner to the outer regions ofthe jet, indicating that the electron break energy moves to lower energies withdistance from the core. overall, the x-ray and multiwavelength properties ofthe jets of 3c 371 and pks 2201+044 appear intermediate between those of frisand friis.

1006.3536	discovery of ultra-fast outflows in a sample of broad line radio  galaxies observed with suzaku	we present the results of a uniform and systematic search for blue-shifted fek absorption lines in the x-ray spectra of five bright broad-line radiogalaxies (blrgs) observed with suzaku. we detect, for the first time at x-raysin radio-loud agn, several absorption lines at energies greater than 7 kev inthree out of five sources, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. the lines aredetected with high significance according to both the f-test and extensivemonte carlo simulations. their likely interpretation as blue-shifted fe xxv andfe xxvi k-shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gasoutflowing with mildly relativistic velocities, in the range 0.04-0.15c. a fitwith specific photo-ionization models gives ionization parameters in the rangelog_xi~4-5.6 and column densities of n_h~10^22-10^23 cm^-2. thesecharacteristics are very similar to those of the ultra-fast outflows (ufos)previously observed in radio-quiet agn. their estimated location within~0.01-0.3pc from the central super-massive black hole suggests a likely originrelated with accretion disk winds/outflows. depending on the absorber coveringfraction, the mass outflow rate of these ufos can be comparable to theaccretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fractionof the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power.therefore, these ufos can play a significant role in the expected feedback fromthe agn on the surrounding environment and can give us further clues on therelation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds/jets in bothradio-quiet and radio-loud agn.

1010.5243	q2122-444: a naked agn fully dressed	based on previous spectral and temporal optical studies, q2122-444 has beenclassified as a naked agn or true type 2 agn, that is, an agn that genuinelylacks a broad line region (blr). its optical spectrum seemed to possess onlynarrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 (obscured) agns, butthe long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign overmore than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out thepresence of heavy obscuration. here, we present the results from a ~40 ksxmm-newton observation of q2122-444 carried out to shed light on the energeticsof this enigmatic agn. the x-ray analysis was complemented with atca radio datato assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new ntt/efosc2 opticalspectroscopic data to verify the actual absence of a blr. the higher-qualityoptical data revealed the presence of strong and broad balmer lines that are atodds with the previous spectral classification of this agn. the lack ofdetection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. the x-ray datacombined with simultaneous uv observations carried out by the om aboardxmm-newton confirm that q2122-444 is a typical type-1 agn without anysignificant intrinsic absorption. new estimates of the black hole massindependently obtained from the broad balmer lines and from a new scalingtechnique based on x-ray spectral data suggest that q2122-444 is accreting at arelatively high rate in eddington units.

1012.0834	black holes in bulgeless galaxies: an xmm-newton investigation of ngc  3367 and ngc 4536	the vast majority of optically identified active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe local universe reside in host galaxies with prominent bulges, supportingthe hypothesis that black hole formation and growth is fundamentally connectedto the build-up of galaxy bulges. however, recent mid-infrared spectroscopicstudies with spitzer of a sample of optically "normal" late-type galaxiesreveal remarkably the presence of high-ionization [nev] lines in severalsources, providing strong evidence for agns in these galaxies. we presentfollow-up x-ray observations recently obtained with xmm-newton of two suchsources, the late-type optically normal galaxies ngc 3367 and ngc 4536. bothsources are detected in our observations. detailed spectral analysis revealsthat for both galaxies, the 2-10 kev emission is dominated by a power law withan x-ray luminosity in the 10^39 - 10^40 ergs s^-1 range, consistent with lowluminosity agns. while there is a possibility that x-ray binaries account forsome fraction of the observed x-ray luminosity, we argue that this fraction isnegligible. these observations therefore add to the growing evidence that thefraction of late-type galaxies hosting agns is significantly underestimatedusing optical observations alone. a comparison of the mid-infrared [nev]luminosity and the x-ray luminosities suggests the presence of an additionalhighly absorbed x-ray source in both galaxies, and that the black hole massesare in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 m_solar for ngc 3367 and 10^4 - 10^6 m_solarfor ngc 4536.

1102.5234	evidence for a circum-nuclear and ionised absorber in the x-ray obscured  broadline radio galaxy 3c 445	here we present the results of a suzaku observation of the broad line radiogalaxy 3c 445. we confirm the results obtained with the previous x-rayobservations which unveiled the presence of several soft x-ray emission linesand an overall x-ray emission which strongly resembles a typical seyfert 2despite of the optical classification as an unobscured agn. the broad bandspectrum allowed us to measure for the first time the amount of reflection(r~0.9) which together with the relatively strong neutral fe kalpha emissionline (ew ~ 100 ev) strongly supports a scenario where a compton-thick mirror ispresent. the primary x-ray continuum is strongly obscured by an absorber with acolumn density of nh =2-3 x10^{23} cm^{-2}. two possible scenarios are proposedfor the absorber: a neutral partial covering or a mildly ionised absorber withan ionisation parameter log\xi ~ 1.0 erg cm s^{-1}. a comparison with the pastand more recent x-ray observations of 3c 445 performed with xmm-newton andchandra is presented, which provided tentative evidence that the ionised andoutflowing absorber varied. we argue that the absorber is probably associatedwith an equatorial disk-wind located within the parsec scale molecular torus.

1104.1812	the suzaku view of 3c 382	we present a long suzaku observation of 3c 382. a swift bat spectrum from the58-month survey is also analyzed, together with an archival xmm-newton epicexposure. our main result is the finding with suzaku of a broad fek line with arelativistic profile consistent with emission from an accretion disk at tens ofgravitational radii from the central black hole. the xis data indicate emissionfrom highly ionized iron and allow us to set tight, albeit model-dependent,constraints on the inner and outer radii of the disk reflecting region,r_in~10r_g and r_out~20r_g, respectively, and on the disk inclination, i~30deg.two ionized reflection components are possibly observed, with similarcontributions of ~10% to the total continuum. a highly ionized one, withlog_xi~3, which successfully models the relativistic line and a mildly ionizedone, with log_xi~1.5, which models the narrow fe k line and high energy hump.when both these components are included, there is no further requirement for anadditional black body soft excess below 2kev. the suzaku data confirm thepresence of a warm absorber previously known from grating studies. afteraccounting for all the spectral features, the intrinsic photon index of thex-ray continuum is ~1.8 with a cutoff energy at ~200kev, consistent withcomptonization models and excluding jet-related emission up to these energies.comparison of the x-ray properties of 3c 382 and other blrgs to seyfertsconfirms the idea that the distinction between radio-loud and radio-quiet agnat x-rays is blurred.

0704.2756	the nature of a broad line radio galaxy: simultaneous rxte and chandra  hetg observations of 3c 382	we present the results from simultaneous chandra and rxte observations of thex-ray bright broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 382. the long (120 ks) exposurewith chandra hetg allows a detailed study of the soft x-ray continuum and ofthe narrow component of the fe kalpha line. the rxte pca data are used to putan upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard x-raycontinuum. a strong soft excess below 1 kev is observed in the time-averagedhetg spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermalmodel. the flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of thesoft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). a narrow (sigma&lt;90ev) fe kalpha line (with ew&lt; 100 ev) is observed by the chandra heg. similarvalues for the line parameters are measured by the rxte pca, suggesting thatthe contribution from a broad line component is negligible. the fact that theexposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us toinvestigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on differenttimescales. significant flux variability associated with spectral changes isobserved on timescales of hours and days. the spectral variability is similarto that observed in radio-quiet agn ruling out a jet-dominated origin of thex-rays.

1108.2609	the high energy view of the broad line radio galaxy 3c 111	we present the analysis of suzaku and xmm-newton observations of thebroad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 111. its high energy emission showsvariability, a harder continuum with respect to the radio quiet agn population,and weak reflection features. suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;a comparison with the xmm-newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 inthe 0.5-10 kev flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. the ironk complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).the intensity of the iron k complex does not respond to the change in continuumflux. an ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in thexis data; the absorber is most likely unstable. indeed, during the xmm-newtonobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. no clearroll-over in the hard x-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergenceof the jet as a dominant component in the hard x-ray band, as suggested by thedetection above ~ 100 kev with the gso on-board suzaku, although the presentdata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of thedifferent components. the fluxes observed by the gamma-ray satellites cgro andfermi would be compatible with the putative jet component if peaking atenergies e ~ 100 mev. in the x-ray band, the jet contribution to the continuumstarts to be significant only above 10 kev. if the detection of the jetcomponent in 3c 111 is confirmed, then its relative importance in the x-rayenergy band could explain the different observed properties in the high-energyemission of blrgs, which are otherwise similar in their other multiwavelengthproperties. comparison between x-ray and gamma-ray data taken at differentepochs suggests that the strong variability observed for 3c 111 is probablydriven by a change in the primary continuum.

1111.0908	new insights on the accretion disk-winds connection in radio-loud agns  from suzaku	from the spectral analysis of long suzaku observations of five radio-loudagns we have been able to discover the presence of ultra-fast outflows withvelocities ~0.1c in three of them, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. they areconsistent with being accretion disk winds/outflows. we also performed afollow-up on 3c 111 to monitor its outflow on ~7days time-scales and detectedan anti-correlated variability of a possible relativistic emission line withrespect to blue-shifted fe k features, following a flux increase. this providesthe first direct evidence for an accretion disk-wind connection in an agn. themass outflow rate of these outflows can be comparable to the accretion rate andtheir mechanical power can correspond to a significant fraction of thebolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power. therefore,they can possibly play a significant role in the expected feedback from agnsand can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk andthe formation of winds/jets.

0704.3053	the remarkable x-ray spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c 445	we present the results of the analysis of an archival 15 ks xmm-newtonobservation of the nearby (z=0.057) radio-loud source 3c445, opticallyclassified as a broad-line radio galaxy. while the rgs data are of insufficientquality to allow a meaningful analysis, the epic data show a remarkable x-rayspectrum. the 2-10 kev continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (nh~ 1e22 -1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index gamma ~1.4, and strong (r~2) coldreflection. a narrow, unresolved fe kalpha emission line is detected,confirming previous findings, with ew 120ev. a soft excess is present below 2kev over the extrapolation of the hard x-ray power law, which we model with apower law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by acolumn density nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to galactic. a host of emission lines arepresent below 2 kev, confirming previous indications from asca, due to h- andhe-like o, mg, and si. we attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionizedgas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured agn. two differentionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the softx-ray data satisfactorily. the similarity of the x-ray spectrum of 3c445 toseyferts underscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet agnsimilarly host both cold and warm gas.

1205.1734	comparison of ejection events in the jet and accretion disc outflows in  3c 111	we present a comparison of the parameters of accretion disc outflows and thejet of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c 111 on sub-pc scales. we make use ofpublished x-ray observations of ultra-fast outflows (ufos) and new 43ghz vlbaimages to track the jet knots ejection. we find that the superluminal jetcoexists with the mildly relativistic outflows on sub-pc scales, possiblyindicating a transverse stratification of a global flow. the two are roughly inpressure equilibrium, with the ufos potentially providing additional supportfor the initial jet collimation. the ufos are much more massive than the jet,but their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at leastfor the observations considered here. however, their momentum flux isequivalent and both of them are powerful enough to exert a concurrent feedbackimpact on the surrounding environment. a link between these components isnaturally predicted in the context of mhd models for jet/outflow formation.however, given the high radiation throughput of agns, radiation pressure shouldalso be taken into account. from the comparison with the long-term 2-10kev rxtelight curve we find that the ufos are preferentially detected during periods ofincreasing flux. we also find the possibility to place the ufos within theknown x-ray dips-jet ejection cycles, which has been shown to be a strong proofof the disc-jet connection, in analogue with stellar-mass black holes. however,given the limited number of observations presently available, these relationsare only tentative and additional spectral monitoring is needed to test themconclusively.

1208.5031	x-ray evidence for ultra-fast outflows in local agns	x-ray evidence for ultra-fast outflows (ufos) has been recently reported in anumber of local agns through the detection of blue-shifted fe xxv/xxviabsorption lines. we present the results of a comprehensive spectral analysisof a large sample of 42 local seyferts and 5 broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs)observed with xmm-newton and suzaku. we detect ufos in &gt;40% of the sources.their outflow velocities are in the range 0.03-0.3c, with a mean value of~0.14c. the ionization is high, in the range logxi~3-6 erg s^{-1} cm, and alsothe associated column densities are large, in the interval ~10^{22}-10^{24}cm^{-2}. overall, these results point to the presence of highly ionized andmassive outflowing material in the innermost regions of agns. their variabilityand location on sub-pc scales favor a direct association with accretion diskwinds/outflows. this also suggests that ufos may potentially play a significantrole in the agn cosmological feedback besides jets and their study can provideimportant clues on the connection between accretion disks, winds and jets.

0705.0234	low energy cut-offs and hard x-ray spectra in high-z radio-loud quasars:  the suzaku view of rbs315	we present the results from the suzaku observation of the powerful radio-loudquasar rbs315 (z=2.69), for which a previous xmm-newton observation showed anextremely flat x-ray continuum up to 10 kev (photon index gamma=1.26) andindications of strong intrinsic absorption (n_h~10^22 cm^{-2} assuming neutralgas). the instrument for hard x-rays hxd/pin allows us a detection of thesource up to 50 kev. the broad-band continuum (0.5-50 kev) can be well modeledwith a power-law with slope gamma=1.5 (definitively softer than the continuummeasured by xmm-newton) above 1 kev with strong deficit of soft photons. thelow-energy cut-off can be well fitted either with intrinsic absorption (withcolumn density n_h~10^22 cm^{-2} in the quasar rest frame) or with a break inthe continuum, with an extremely hard (gamma =0.7) power-law below 1 kev. weconstruct the spectral energy distribution of the source, using also optical-uvmeasurements obtained through a quasi-simultaneous uvot/swift observation. theshape of the sed is similar to that of other flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs) with similar power, making this source an excellent candidate for thedetection in gamma-rays by glast. we model the sed with the synchrotron-inversecompton model usually applied to fsrqs, showing that the deficit of softphotons can be naturally interpreted as due to an intrinsic curvature of thespectrum near the low energy end of the ic component rather than to intrinsicabsorption, although the latter possibility cannot be ruled out. we proposethat in at least a fraction of the radio-loud qsos at high redshift the cut-offin the soft x-ray band can be explained in a similar way. further studies arerequired to distinguish between the two alternatives.

0801.2104	long-term x-ray monitoring of ngc6251: evidence for a jet-dominated  radio galaxy	we present the first x-ray monitoring observations of the x-ray bright friradio galaxy ngc6251 observed with rxte for 1 year. the primary goal of thisstudy is to shed light on the origin of the x-rays, by investigating thespectral variability with model-independent methods coupled with time-resolvedand flux-selected spectroscopy. the main results can be summarized as follows:1) throughout the monitoring campaign, ngc6251 was in relatively high-fluxstate. 2) the flux persistently changed with fluctuations of the order of ~2 ontime scales of 20-30 days. 3) when the hardness ratio is plotted against theaverage count rate, there is evidence for a spectral hardening as the sourcebrightens; this finding is confirmed by a flux-selected spectral analysis. 4)the fractional variability appears to be more pronounced in the hard energyband (5-12 kev) than in the soft one (2.5-5 kev). 5) 2-month averaged andflux-limited energy spectra are adequately fitted by a power law. a fe kalphaline is never statistically required, although the presence of a strong ironline cannot be ruled out, due to the high upper limits on the line equivalentwidth. the inconsistency of the spectral variability behavior of ngc6251 withthe typical trend observed in seyfert galaxies and the similarity with blazarslead support to a jet-dominated scenario during the rxte monitoring campaign.however, a possible contribution from a disk-corona system cannot be ruled out.

0805.0190	infrared to x-ray observations of pks 2155-304 in a low state	aims: our goal is to understand the nature of blazars and the mechanisms forthe generation of high-energy gamma-rays, through the investigation of theprototypical blazar pks 2155-304, which shows complex behaviour. methods: weanalyze simultaneous infrared-to-x-ray observations obtained with xmm-newtonand rem on november 7, 2006, when the source was in a low x-ray state. weperform a comparative analysis of these results with those obtained fromprevious observations in different brightness states. results: we found thatthe peak of the synchrotron emission moved from ultraviolet to opticalwavelengths and the x-ray spectrum is best fit with a broken power law modelwith gamma_2 ~ 2.4 harder than gamma_1 ~ 2.6 and a break at about 3.5 kev. thissuggests that the soft x-rays (e &lt; 3.5 kev) are related to the high-energy tailof the synchrotron emission, while the hard x-rays (e &gt; 3.5 kev) are from theenergy region between the synchrotron and inverse-compton humps. the differentvariability at energies below and above the break strengthens this hypothesis.our results also stress the importance of monitoring this source at both lowand high energies to better characterize its variability behaviour.

astro-ph;0002201	chandra uncovers a hidden low-luminosity agn in the radio galaxy hydra~a  (3c~218)	we report the detection with chandra of a low-luminosity agn (llagn) in thelow ionization emission line region (liner) hosted by hydra a, a nearby(z=0.0537) powerful fri radio galaxy with complex radio and optical morphology.in a 20 ks acis-s exposure during the calibration phase of the instrument, apoint source is detected at energies $\grtsim$ 2 kev at the position of thecompact radio core, embedded in diffuse thermal x-ray emission ($kt \sim 1$kev) at softer energies. the spectrum of the point source is well fitted by aheavily absorbed power law with intrinsic column density n$_h^{int} \sim 3\times 10^{22}$ \nh and photon index $\gamma \sim 1.7$. the intrinsic(absorption-corrected) luminosity is $l_{2-10 kev} \sim 1.3 \times 10^{42}$\lum. these results provide strong evidence that an obscured agn is present inthe nuclear region of hydra~a. we infer that the optical/uv emission of the agnis mostly hidden by the heavy intrinsic reddening. in order to balance thephoton budget of the nebula, we must either postulate that the ionizingspectrum includes a uv bump or invoke and additional power source (shocks inthe cooling flow or interaction with the radio jets). using an indirectestimate of the black hole mass and the x-ray luminosity, we infer that theaccretion rate is low, suggesting that the accretion flow is advectiondominated. finally, our results support current unification schemes forradio-loud sources, in particular the presence of the putative molecular torusin fr~is. these observations underscore the power of the x-rays and of \chandrain the quest for black holes.

astro-ph;0002265	hard x-ray spectra of broad-line radio galaxies from the rossi x-ray  timing explorer	we present the results of hard-x-ray observations of four broad-line radiogalaxies (blrgs) with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). the originalmotivation behind the observations was to search for systematic differencesbetween the blrgs and their radio-quiet counterparts, the seyfert galaxies. wedo, indeed, find that the fe k-alpha lines and compton "reflection" components,which are hallmarks of the x-ray spectra of seyferts galaxies, are weaker inblrgs by about a factor of 2. this observational result is in agreement withthe conclusions of other recent studies of these objects. we examine severalpossible explanations for this systematic difference, including beaming of theprimary x-rays away from the accretion disk, a low iron abundance, a smallsolid angle subtended by the disk to the primary x-ray source, and dilution ofthe observed spectrum by beamed x-rays from the jet. we find that a small solidangle subtended by the disk to the primary x-ray source is a viable andappealing explanation, while all others suffer from drawbacks. we interpretthis as an indication of a difference in the inner accretion disk structurebetween seyfert galaxies and blrgs, namely that the inner accretion disks ofblrgs have the form of an ion-supported torus or an advection-dominatedaccretion flow, which irradiates the geometrically thin outer disk.

astro-ph;0010355	x-ray imaging of the seyfert 2 galaxy circinus with chandra	we present results from the zeroth-order imaging of a chandra hetgsobservation of the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy circinus. twelve x-ray sources weredetected in the acis-s image of the galaxy, embedded in diffuse x-ray emission.the latter shows a prominent (~18arcsec) soft ``plume'' in the n-w direction,coincident with the [oiii] ionization cone. the radial profiles of thebrightest x-ray source at various energies are consistent with an unresolved(fwhm ~0.8arcsec) component, which we identify as the active nucleus, plus twoextended components with fwhms ~ 2.3arcsec and 18arcsec, respectively. in aradius of 3arcsec, the nucleus contributes roughly the same flux as theextended components at the softest energies (&lt; 2 kev). however, at harderenergies (&gt; 2 kev), the contribution of the nucleus is dominant. thezeroth-order acis spectrum of the nucleus exhibits emission lines at both softand hard x-rays, including a prominent fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev, showing thatmost of the x-ray lines previously detected with asca originate in a compactregion (&lt;15 pc). based on its x-ray spectrum, we argue that the 2.3arcsecextended component is scattered nuclear radiation from nearby ionized gas. thelarge-scale extended component includes the emission from the n-w plume andpossibly from the outer starburst ring.

astro-ph;0010356	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the seyfert 2 galaxy circinus with  chandra	results from a 60 ks chandra hetgs observation of the nearby seyfert 2circinus are presented. the spectrum shows a wealth of emission lines at bothsoft and hard x-rays, including lines of ne, mg, si, s, ar, ca, and fe, and aprominent fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev. we identify several of the he-likecomponents and measure several of the lyman lines of the h-like ions. thelines' profiles are unresolved at the limited signal-to-noise ratio of thedata. our analysis of the zeroth-order image in a companion paper constrainsthe size of the emission region to be 20-60 pc, suggesting that emission withinthis volume is almost entirely due to the reprocessing of the obscured centralsource. here we show that a model containing two distinct components canreproduce almost all the observed properties of this gas. the ionized componentcan explain the observed intensities of the ionized species, assumingtwice-solar composition and an n \propto r^{-1.5} density distribution. theneutral component is highly concentrated, well within the 0.8arcsec pointsource, and is responsible for almost all of the observed kalpha (6.4 kev)emission. circinus seems to be different than mkn~3 in terms of its gasdistribution.

astro-ph;0104035	a chandra study of the circinus galaxy point-source population	we have used the chandra x-ray observatory to resolve spatially andspectrally the x-ray emission from the circinus galaxy. we report here on thenature of the x-ray emission from the off-nuclear point sources associated withthe disk of circinus. we find that many of the serendipitous x-ray sources areconcentrated along the optical disk of the galaxy, but few have opticalcounterparts within 1" of their x-ray positions down to v=23-25. at 3.8 mpc,their intrinsic 0.5-10 kev luminosities range from approx. 2e37 erg/s to 4e39erg/s. one quarter of the sources are variable over the duration of the 67 ksobservation, and spectral fitting of these off-nuclear sources shows a diverserange of spectral properties. the properties of the two strongest off-nuclearsources are remarkable, with average x-ray luminosities of 3.7e39 erg/s and3.4e39 erg/s. the former displays large and periodic flux variations every 7.5hr and is well fit by a multicolor blackbody accretion-disk model witht_in=1.35 kev, properties consistent with an eclipsing &gt;50 m_sun black-holebinary. the latter appears to be a young supernova remnant, as it coincideswith a non-thermal radio counterpart and an h\alpha-detected hii region. thissource exhibits both long-term (approx. 4 yr) x-ray variability and a 6.67-6.97kev iron emission-line blend with a 1.6 kev equivalent width. these two objectsfurther support the notion that super-eddington x-ray sources in nearbygalaxies can be explained by a mixture of intermediate-mass black holes inx-ray binaries and young supernova remnants.

astro-ph;0210300	long-term, continuous monitoring of the broad line radio galaxies 3c  390.3 and 3c 120 with the rossi x-ray timing explorer	we present a study of the flux and spectral variability of the two broad-lineradio galaxies (blrgs) 3c 390.3 and 3c 120, observed almost daily with rxte fornearly two months each in 1996 and 1997, respectively. our original motivationfor this study was to search for systematic differences between blrgs and theirradio-quiet counterparts, the seyfert galaxies, whose temporal and spectralbehavior is better studied. we find that both 3c 390.3 and 3c 120 are highlyvariable, but in a different way, and quantify this difference by means of astructure function analysis. 3c 390.3 is significantly more variable than 3c120, despite its jet larger inclination angle, implying either that the x-rayvariability is not dominated by the jet or that two different variabilityprocesses are simultaneously at work in 3c 390.3. we performed anenergy-selected and time-resolved analysis based on the fractional variabilityamplitude and found that the variability amplitude of both objects is stronglyanticorrelated with the energy. this last result, along with the correlatedchange of the photon index with the x-ray continuum flux, can be qualitativelyexplained within the scenario of thermal comptonization, generally invoked forradio-quiet active galaxies. moreover, the time-resolved and energy-selectedfractional variability analyses show a trend opposite to that observed injet-dominated agn (blazars), suggesting only a minor contribution of the jet tothe x-ray properties of blrgs. time-averaged spectral analysis indicates thepresence of a strong, resolved iron line with centroid at 6.4 kev and a weakreflection component in both objects. the overall pca+hexte spectra are bestfitted with the constant density ionization model of ross &amp; fabian, but with amodest ionization parameter(abridged).

astro-ph;0302265	chandra observations of nuclear x-ray emission from a sample of radio  sources	we present the x-ray properties of a sample of 17 radio sources observed withthe chandra x-ray observatory as part of a project aimed at studying the x-rayemission from their radio jets. in this paper, we concentrate on the x-rayproperties of the unresolved cores. the sample includes 16 quasars (11core-dominated and 5 lobe-dominated) in the redshift range z=0.30--1.96, andone low-power radio-galaxy at z=0.064. no diffuse x-ray emission is presentaround the cores of the quasars, except for the nearby low-power galaxy thathas diffuse emission on a scale and with a luminosity consistent with otherfris. no high-amplitude, short-term variability is detected within therelatively short chandra exposures. however, 1510-089 shows low-amplitude fluxchanges with a timescale of $\sim$25 minutes. the x-ray spectra of the quasarcores are generally well described by a single power law model with galacticabsorption. however, in six quasars we find soft x-ray excess emission below1.6 kev. interestingly, we detect an fe k-shell emission line, consistent withfluorescent kalpha emission from cold iron, in one lobe- and two core-dominatedsources. the average x-ray photon index for the quasars in the sample isgamma=1.66 and dispersion, sigma=0.23. the average spectral slope for oursample is flatter than the slope found for radio-quiet quasars and forradio-loud agns with larger jet orientations; this indicates that beamingaffects the x-ray emission from the cores in our sample of quasars.

astro-ph;0305407	chandra observations of the x-ray environment of bl lacs	we present chandra observations of the x-ray environment of a sample of 6 bllacertae objects. the improved sensitivity of the acis experiment allows us toseparate the core x-ray emission from the contribution of diffuse emission fromthe host galaxy/cluster scales. within the short (2-6 ks) acis exposures, wefind evidence for diffuse x-ray emission in 3 sources (bl lac, pks 0548-322,and pks 2005-489). the diffuse emission can be modeled with a king profile withbeta~0.3-0.6, core radii rc~15-28 kpc, and 0.4-5 kev luminosities in the range10^{41}-10^{42} erg/s. in the remaining 3 sources, one (3c 371) has a radialprofile entirely consistent with an unresolved source, while two (1es 2344+514and 1es 2321+419) show evidence for weak diffuse emission on kpc scales. theseresults support current models for radio-loud agn unifying bl lacs and friradio galaxies through the orientation of their jets. in pks 0548-322 and pks2005-489, we also find evidence for diffuse emission on cluster scales,although the spatial properties of this emission are not constrained. thetemperature and luminosity of the cluster gas are typical of normal clusters.interestingly, these are the two brightest sources of the sample, suggesting alink between environment and nuclear activity.

astro-ph;0306510	on the origin of the x-rays and the nature of accretion in ngc 4261	we report on the x-ray properties of the radio galaxy ngc 4261, combininginformation from the xmm, chandra, and sax satellites. goals of this study areto investigate the origin of the x-rays from this low-power radio galaxy andthe nature of the accretion process onto the central black hole. the x-rayspectrum of the nuclear source extending up to 100--150 kev is well describedby a partially covered (covering factor $&gt;$ 0.8) power law with a photon index\~1.5 absorbed by a column density 5e22 cm^-2. the x-ray luminosity associatedwith the non-thermal component is ~5e41 erg/s. the nuclear source is embeddedin a diffuse hot gas (kt~0.6 kev), whose density profile implies a bondiaccretion rate of 4.5e-2 solar masses/year. for the first time rapid x-rayvariability is detected in a low-power radio galaxy at more than 99% confidencelevel. the observed x-ray spectral and variability properties indicate theaccretion flow as the most likely origin of the bulk x-ray continuum.thisconclusion is strengthened by energetic considerations based on a comparisonbetween the x-ray luminosity and the kinetic power of the jet, whichalsosuggest that the bondi accretion rate overestimates the actual accretion rateonto the black hole.

astro-ph;0309082	a joint mid-infrared spectroscopic and x-ray imaging investigation of  liner galaxies	we present a comprehensive comparative high resolution mid-ir spectroscopicand x-ray imaging investigation of liners using archival observations from theiso-sws and the chandra advanced ccd imaging spectrometer. although the sampleis heterogenous and incomplete, this is the first comprehensive study of themid-infrared fine structure line emission of liners. these results have beencompared with similar observations of starburst galaxies and agn. we find thatliners very clearly fall between starbursts and agn in their mid-ir finestructure line spectra, showing l_[oiv]26um/l_fir andl_[oiv]26um/l_[neii]12.8um ratios, both measures of the dominant nuclear energysource in dust-enshrouded galaxies, intermediate between those of agn andstarbursts. chandra imaging observations of the liners reveal hard nuclearpoint sources morphologically consistent with agn in most (67%) of the sample,with a clear trend with ir-brightness. most liners that show a single dominanthard compact x-ray core are ir-faint ((l_fir/l_b &lt; 1), whereas most liners thatshow scattered x-ray sources are ir-bright. a comparative x-ray/mid-irspectroscopic investigation of liners reveals some puzzling results. objectsthat display strong hard nuclear x-ray cores should also display highexcitation lines in the ir. however, we find two liners disagree with thisexpectation. the galaxy ngc 404 shows weak soft x-ray emission consistent witha starburst but has the most prominent highest excitation mid-ir spectrum ofour entire sample. using ir emission line diagnostics alone, this galaxy wouldbe classified as hosting a dominant agn. conversely, the ir luminous liner ngc6240 has an extremely luminous binary agn as revealed by the x-rays but showsweak ir emission lines.

astro-ph;0309632	the xmm-newton view of ngc 6251	we report on the nuclear x-ray properties of the radio galaxy ngc 6251observed with xmm-newton. ngc 6251 is a well-known radio galaxy withintermediate fri/ii radio properties. it is optically classified as a seyfert 2and hosts a supermassive black hole with mass~6e8 solar masses. the 0.4-10 kevepic pn continuum is best fitted by two thermal components (kt~0.5 and 1.4 kev,respectively), plus a power law with photon index ~1.9 absorbed by a columndensity nh~5e20 cm-2. we confirm the previous asca detection of a strong ironline. the line, resolved in the epic pn spectrum, is adequately fitted with abroad (sigma~0.6 kev) gaussian at rest-frame energy 6.4 kev with ew 220 ev. wealso detect, for the first time, short-term, low-amplitude variability of thenuclear flux on a timescale of a few ks. the spectral properties argue in favorof the presence of a standard accretion disk, ruling out the base of the jet asthe sole origin of the x-rays. the moderate x-ray luminosity and lack of strongintrinsic absorption suggest that ngc 6251 is a ``pure'' type 2 agn which lacksa broad-line region.

astro-ph;0310722	the xmm-newton view of the x-ray halo and jet of ngc 6251	we present an xmm observation of the radio jet and diffuse halo of the nearbyradio galaxy ngc6251. the epic spectrum of the galaxy's halo is best-fitted bya thermal model with temperature kt~1.6 kev and subsolar abundances.interestingly, an additional hard x-ray component is required to fit the epicspectra of the halo above 3 kev, and is independently confirmed by an archivalchandra observation. however, its physical origin is not clear. contributionfrom a population of undetected low mass x-ray binaries seems unlikely.instead, the hard x-ray component could be due to inverse compton scattering ofthe cmb photons off relativistic electrons scattered throughout the halo of thegalaxy, or non-thermal bremsstrahlung emission. the ic/cmb interpretation,together with limits on the diffuse radio emission, implies a very weakmagnetic field, while a non-thermal bremsstrahlung origin implies the presenceof a large number of very energetic electrons. we also detect x-ray emissionfrom the outer (~3.5') jet, confirming previous rosat findings. both the epicand acis spectra of the jet are best-fitted by a power law with photon index\~1.2. a thermal model is formally ruled out by the data. assuming an origin ofthe x-rays from the jet via ic/cmb, as suggested by energetic arguments, andassuming equipartition implies a large doppler factor (delta~10).alternatively, weaker beaming is possible for magnetic fields several orders ofmagnitude lower than the equipartition field.

astro-ph;0401475	a survey of extended radio jets with chandra and hst	we present the results from an x-ray and optical survey of a sample of 17radio jets in agn performed with chandra and hst. the sample was selected fromthe radio and is unbiased toward detection at shorter wavelengths, butpreferentially it includes beamed sources. we find that x-ray emission iscommon on kpc-scales, with over half radio jets exhibiting at least one x-rayknot on the chandra images. the distributions of the radio-to-x-ray andradio-to-optical spectral indices for the detected jets are similar to thelimits for the non-detections,suggesting all bright radio jets have x-raycounterparts which will be visible in longer observations. comparing the radioand x-ray morphologies shows that the majority of the x-ray jets havestructures that closely map the radio. analysis of the sed of the jet knotssuggest the knots in which the x-ray and radio morphologies track each otherproduce x-rays by ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background. theremaining knots produce x-rays by the synchrotron process. spectral changes aredetected along the jets, with the ratio of the x-ray-to-radio andoptical-to-radio flux densities decreasing from the inner to the outer regions.this suggests the presence of an additional contribution to the x-ray flux inthe jet's inner part, either from synchrotron or ic of the stellar light.alternatively, in a pure ic/cmb scenario, the plasma decelerates as it flowsfrom the inner to the outer regions. finally, the x-ray spectral indices forthe brightest knots are flat, indicating that the bulk of the luminosity of thejets is emitted at gev energies, and raising the interesting possibility offuture detections with glast.

astro-ph;0408451	obscuration and origin of nuclear x-ray emission in fr i radio galaxies	we present x-ray observations of the nuclear region of 25 fanaroff-riley iradio galaxies from the 3crr and b2 catalogs, using data from the chandra andxmm archives. we find the presence of a x-ray central compact core (cccx) in13/25 sources, in 3/25 sources the detection of a cccx is uncertain, while inthe remaining 9/25 sources no cccx is found. all the sources are embedded in adiffuse soft x-ray component, generally on kpc-scales, which is in agreementwith the halo of the host galaxy and/or with the intracluster medium. the x-rayspectra of the cores are described by a power law with photon indices gamma=1.1- 2.6. in 8 sources excess absorption over the galactic value is detected, withrest-frame column densities n_h^z ~ 10^20 - 10^21 cm^-2; thus, we confirm theprevious claim based on optical data that most fri radio galaxies lack astandard optically-thick torus. we find significant correlations between thex-ray core luminosity and the radio and optical luminosities, suggesting thatat least a fraction of the x-ray emission originates in a jet; however, theorigin of the x-rays remains ambiguous. if the x-ray emission is entirelyattributed to an isotropic, accretion-related component, we find very smalleddington ratios, l_bol/l_edd ~ 10^-3 - 10^-8, and we calculate the radiativeefficiency to be eta ~ 10^-2 - 10^-6, based on the bondi accretion rates fromthe spatial analysis. this suggests that radiatively inefficient accretionflows are present in the cores of low-power radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0410305	a chandra snapshot survey of ir-bright liners: a possible link between  star formation, agn fueling, and mass accretion	we present results from a high resolution x-ray imaging study of nearbyliners observed by chandra. this study complements and extends previous x-raystudies of liners, focusing on the under-explored population of nearbydust-enshrouded infrared-bright liners. the sample consists of 15 ir-brightliners (l_fir/l_b &gt; 3), with distances that range from 11 to 26 mpc. combiningour sample with previous chandra studies we find that ~ 51% (28/55) of theliners display compact hard x-ray cores. the nuclear 2-10 kev luminosities ofthe galaxies in this expanded sample range from ~ 2 x 10^38 ergs s^-1 to ~ 2 x10^44 ergs s^-1. we find an intriguing trend in the eddington ratio vs. l_firand l_fir/l_b for the agn-liners in the expanded sample that extends over sevenorders of magnitude in l/l_edd. this correlation may imply a link between blackhole growth, as measured by the eddington ratio, and the star formation rate(sfr), as measured by the far-ir luminosity and ir-brightness ratio. if thefar-ir luminosity is an indicator of the molecular gas content in our sample ofliners, our results may further indicate that the mass accretion rate scaleswith the host galaxy's fuel supply. we discuss the potential implications ofour results in the framework of black hole growth and agn fueling in lowluminosity agn.

astro-ph;0605530	shedding new light on the 3c 273 jet with the spitzer space telescope	we have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3c 273 atwavelengths 3.6 and 5.8 microns with the infrared array camera (irac) on thespitzer space telescope. when combined with the radio, optical and x-raymeasurements, the irac photometry clearly shows that the optical emission isdominated by the high-energy component of the jet, not by the radio synchrotroncomponent, as had been assumed to date. the high-energy component may be due toa second synchrotron component or to ic scattering of ambient photons. in theformer case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding 10^16 ev orpossibly even to 10^19 ev would be taking place in the jet. in contrast, the icmodel, into which highly relativistic doppler beaming has to be incorporated,requires very low-energy electrons (~ 1 mev). the present polarization data inthe radio and optical would favor the former interpretation in the case of the3c 273 jet. sensitive and detailed measurements of optical polarization areimportant to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high-energyemission. the present study offers new clues as to the controversial origin ofthe x-ray emission seen in many quasar jets.

astro-ph;0606659	the jet/disk connection in agn: chandra and xmm observations of three  powerful radio-loud quasars	the connection between the accretion process that powers agn and theformation of jets is still poorly understood. here we tackle this issue usingnew, deep \chandra and \xmm observations of the cores of three powerful radioloud quasars: 1136--135, 1150+497 (\chandra), and 0723+679 (\xmm), in theredshift range $z$=0.3--0.8. these sources are known from our previous \chandrasnapshot survey to have kpc-scale x-ray jets. in 1136--135 and 1150+497,evidence is found for the presence of diffuse thermal x-ray emission around thecores, on scales of 40--50 kpc and with luminosity l$_{0.3-2 kev} \sim 10^{43}$\lum, suggesting thermal emission from the host galaxy or a galaxy group. thex-ray continua of the cores in the three sources are described by anupward-curved (concave) broken power law, with photon indices $\gamma_{soft}\sim 1.8-2.1$ and $\gamma_{hard} \sim 1.7$ below and above $\approx 2$ kev,respectively. there is evidence for an unresolved \feka line with ew $\sim$ 70ev in the three quasars. the spectral energy distributions of the sources canbe well described by a mix of jet and disk emission, with the jet dominatingthe radio and hard x-rays (via synchrotron and external compton) and the diskdominating the optical/uv through soft x-rays. the ratio of the jet-to-diskpowers is $\sim 1$, consistent with those derived for a number of gamma-rayemitting blazars. this indicates that near equality of accretion and jet powermay be common in powerful radio-loud agn.

astro-ph;0610416	swift xrt and uvot deep observations of the high energy peaked bl lac  object pks 0548-322 close to its brightest state	we present the results of a spectral analysis of 5 swift xrt and uvotobservations of the bl lac object pks 0548-322 carried out over the periodapril-june 2005. the x-ray flux of this high energy peaked bl lac (hbl) sourcewas found to be approximately constant at a level of f(2-10 kev) ~ 4x10^-11 ergcm^-2 s^-1, a factor of 2 brighter than when observed by bepposax in 1999 andclose to the maximum intensity reported in the einstein slew survey. the verygood statistics obtained in the 0.3-10 kev swift x-ray spectrum allowed us todetect highly significant deviations from a simple power law spectraldistribution. a log-parabolic model describes well the x-ray data and gives abest fit curvature parameter of 0.18 and peak energy in the spectral energydistribution of about 2 kev. the uv spectral data from swift uvot join wellwith a power law extrapolation of the soft x-ray data points suggesting thatthe same component is responsible for the observed emission in the two bands.the combination of synchrotron peak in the x-ray band and high intensity stateconfirms pks 0548-322 as a prime target for tev observations. x-ray monitoringand coordinated tev campaigns are highly advisable.

astro-ph;0703295	an infrared study of the large-scale jet in quasar pks 1136-135	we present spitzer irac imaging of the large-scale jet in the quasar pks1136-135 at wavelengths of 3.6 and 5.8 um, combined with previous vla, hst, andchandra observations. we clearly detect infrared emission from the jet,resulting in the most detailed multifrequency data among the jets inlobe-dominated quasars. the spectral energy distributions of the jet knots havesignificant variations along the jet, like the archetypal jet in 3c 273. theinfrared measurements with irac are consistent with the previous idea that thejet has two spectral components, namely (1) the low-energy synchrotron spectrumextending from radio to infrared, and (2) the high-energy component responsiblefor the x-ray flux. the optical fluxes may be a mixture of the two components.we consider three radiation models for the high-energy component: inversecompton scattering off cmb photons by radio-emitting electrons in a highlyrelativistic jet, synchrotron radiation by a second distinct electronpopulation, and synchrotron radiation by ultra high energy protons. eachhypothesis leads to important insights into and constraints on particleacceleration in the jet, as well as the basic physical properties of the jetsuch as bulk velocity, transporting power, and particle contents.

astro-ph;9704194	multiwavelength monitoring of the bl lacertae object pks 2155-304 in may  1994. iii. probing the inner jet through multiwavelength correlations	in may 1994 the bl lac object pks 2155-304 was observed continuously for ~10d with iue and euve and for 2 d with asca, as well as with rosat and withground- based radio, ir, and optical telescopes. the light curves show awell-defined x-ray flare (x2 increase in 1/2 d, with similar decay) followed bya broader, lower amplitude euv flare ~1 day later, and a broad, low-amplitudeuv flare ~2 d later (amplitude ~35%, duration &gt;2 d). in the preceding weekthere was at least one x-ray flare of comparable amplitude or perhaps ongoingstochastic x-ray variations. an extremely rapid change in uv flux was seen atthe beginning of the iue observation. assuming the central x-ray, euv, and uvevents are associated, the lags, the decrease of amplitude with wavelength, andthe broadening of the temporal profile with wavelength are all qualitatively asexpected for synchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous relativistic jet. wecan rule out a fermi-type shock acceleration event or a pair cascade in ahomogeneous synchrotron-emitting region. a homogeneous region is still possibleif there was an instantaneous (t&lt;&lt;hours) injection of high energy electronsthat emit first at x-ray energies. alternatively, the data are consistent witha compression wave or other disturbance crossing a region with stratifiedparticle energy distributions (e.g., behind a shock front and/or in aninhomogeneous jet). the present light curves are in sharp contrast to november1991, when the amplitude was wavelength independent and the uv lagged thex-rays by less than ~3 hours. this means that the origin of rapidmultiwavelength variability in this blazar is complex, involving at least twodifferent modes.

astro-ph;9707078	rosat, asca and osse observations of the broad line radio galaxy 3c120	we present simultaneous observations of the superluminal radio galaxy 3c120performed with the asca and gro (osse) satellites on february-march 1994, aswell as an analysis of all the rosat archival data. the asca spectrum of thisobject can be described by an absorbed (n_h=1.6e^21 cm^-2) power law withphoton index gamma_asca=2 and a very broad sigma&gt;0.8 kev intense iron line(ew&gt;400 ev) at ~ 6 kev. the combined asca--osse data do not exclude thepresence of a narrower (sigma=0.4 kev) and less intense (ew&lt;300 ev) iron lineplus a hard component, corresponding either to reflection from an accretiondisk or to a flatter power law from a jet. however a single power law plusbroad fe line is preferred from a statistical point of view by the asca data.the rosat data yield a column density in excess of the galactic value. thespectral slopes, ranging from gamma_rosat=2.5 to 3.3, are steeper than thatmeasured by asca, suggesting the presence of a soft excess. the 0.1-2 kevpower-law slope is variable and softer at higher intensity. these results showthat the combined soft and hard x-ray spectrum of 3c120 is rather complex. theintrinsic absorption, the soft excess, and the iron line indicate that thex-ray emission from this blazar-like radio galaxy is dominated by aseyfert-like component, at least in the 0.1-10kev energy band. the jetcontribution, if present, becomes important only at higher energies.

astro-ph;9902045	exploratory asca observations of broad absorption line quasi-stellar  objects	we present the analysis and interpretation of a sample of eight ascaobservations of broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects (balqsos). this isthe first moderate-sized sample of sensitive balqso observations above 2 kev,and the balqsos in our sample are among the optically brightest known(b=14.5-18.5). despite the ability of 2-10 kev x-rays to penetrate large columndensities, we find balqsos to be extremely weak sources above 2 kev, and we areonly able to add two new 2-10 kev detections (0226-104 and iras 07598+6508) tothose previously reported. by comparison with non-balqsos of similar opticalcontinuum magnitudes, we derive the column densities needed to suppress theexpected x-ray fluxes of our balqsos. in several cases we derive columndensities &gt; 5x10^{23} cm^{-2} for a neutral absorber with solar abundances.these are the largest x-ray column densities yet inferred for balqsos, and theyexceed rosat lower limits by about an order of magnitude. optical brightnessdoes not appear to be a good predictor of 2-10 kev brightness for balqsos, butour data do suggest that the balqsos with high optical continuum polarizationsmay be the x-ray brighter members of the class. for example, the highlypolarized object phl 5200 appears to be unusually x-ray bright for a balqsogiven its optical magnitude. we discuss the implications of our results forfuture observations with axaf and xmm. if the objects in our sample arerepresentative of the balqso population, precision x-ray spectroscopy of mostbalqsos will unfortunately prove difficult in the near future.

astro-ph;9905365	an x-ray spectral survey of radio-loud agn with asca	we present a uniform and systematic analysis of the 0.6-10 kev x-ray spectraof radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) observed by asca. the sample 10blrgs, 5 qsrs, 9 nlrgs, and 10 rgs. at soft x-rays, about half of the nlrgs andall of the rgs exhibit a thermal plasma component, with a bimodal distributionof temperatures and luminosities, suggesting an origin either in a surroundingcluster or loose group or in a hot corona. at energies above 2 kev, a hardpower-law component is detected in 90% of cases. the power-law photon indicesand luminosities in blrgs, qsrs, and nlrgs are similar, consistent withorientation-based unification schemes. significant excess cold absorption isdetected in most nlrgs, but also in some blrgs and qsrs, which was somewhatunexpected. in contrast to seyfert galaxies, only one object showss thesignature of a warm absorber. the nuclear x-ray luminosity is correlated withthe luminosity of the [o iii] emission line, the fir emission at 12 microns,and the lobe radio power at 5 ghz. the fe k line is detected in 50% of blrgs,one qsr, and a handful of nlrgs. this sample also includes 6 weak line radiogalaxies (wlrgs). their spectra wlrgs can be generally decomposed into a softthermal component with hard absrorbed power-law component, which issignificantly flatter than any other radio-loud agns. their intrinsicluminosities are two orders of magnitude lower than in other sources of thesample. an interesting possibility is that wlrgs represent an extremepopulation of radio galaxies in which the central black hole is accreting at arate well below the eddington rate.

astro-ph;9909284	x-rays from the highly polarized broad absorption line qso cso 755	we present results from a bepposax observation of the bal qso cso 755,observed as part of our program to investigate the x-ray properties of highlypolarized bal qsos. cso 755 is clearly detected by the bepposax mecs, making itthe highest redshift (z=2.88) and most optically luminous (m_v=-27.4) bal qsoseen in x-rays. it is detected in several energy bands including the rest-frame21-39 kev band, but we are only able to place loose constraints upon its x-rayspectral shape. our x-ray detection is consistent with the hypothesis that thebal qsos with high optical continuum polarization tend to be the x-ray brightermembers of the class. we examine a scattering interpretation of apolarization/x-ray flux connection, and we discuss the data needed to prove orrefute such a connection. we also discuss a probable rosat detection of cso755. the observed-frame 2-10 kev flux from bepposax (1.3 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}) is high enough to allow xmm spectroscopy, and studies of iron k lineemission should prove of particular interest if a large amount of scatteredx-ray flux is present.

0810.0145	testing the blazar spectral sequence: x-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous optical and x-ray data from swift for a sample offsrqs selected from the emss survey. we present also a complete analysis ofswift and integral data on 4 blazars recently discussed as possibly challengingthe trends of the "blazar spectral sequence". the seds of all these objects aremodelled in terms of a general theoretical scheme leading to an estimate of thejets' physical parameters. our results show that, in the case of the emss broadline blazars, x-ray selection does not lead to find sources with synchrotronpeaks in the uv/x-ray range, as was the case for x-ray selected bl lacs.instead, for a wide range of radio powers all the sources with broad emissionlines show similar seds, with synchrotron components peaking below theoptical/uv range. of the remaining 4 "anomalous" blazars, two highly luminoussources with broad lines, claimed to possibly emit synchrotron x-rays, areshown to be better described with ic models for their x-ray emission. for onesource with weak emission lines (a bl lac object) a synchrotron peak in thesoft x-ray range is confirmed, while for the fourth source, exhibiting linestypical of nlsy1s, no evidence of x-ray emission from a relativistic jet isfound. we reexamine the original "blazar spectral sequence" and suggest thatthe photon ambient, in which the particle acceleration and emission occur, islikely the main factor determining the shape of the blazar sed.

0704.0939	does the blazar gamma-ray spectrum harden with increasing flux? analysis  of 9 years of egret data	the energetic gamma-ray experiment telescope (egret) on the compton gamma-rayobservatory (cgro) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazarsduring its 9 yr lifetime. we conducted an exhaustive search of the egretarchives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times andwere bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-lawmodels. the sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs), 6low-frequency peaked bl lac objects (lbls) and 2 high-frequency peaked bl lacobjects (hbls). we do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectralindex with flux. some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence forspectral variability. the spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.there is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes infive blazars. the well-observed blazars (3c 279, 3c 273, pks 0528+134, pks1622-297 pks 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectraldependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. weobserved a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales inall three fsrqs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks wereavailable. all three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite thewidely different flux profiles. we analyze the observed spectral behavior inthe context of various inverse compton mechanisms believed to be responsiblefor emission in the egret energy range. our analysis uses the egret skymapsthat were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.
