0901.0555	arcade 2 measurement of the extra-galactic sky temperature at 3-90 ghz	the arcade 2 instrument has measured the absolute temperature of the sky atfrequencies 3, 8, 10, 30, and 90 ghz, using an open-aperture cryogenicinstrument observing at balloon altitudes with no emissive windows between thebeam-forming optics and the sky. an external blackbody calibrator provides an{\it in situ} reference. systematic errors were greatly reduced by usingdifferential radiometers and cooling all critical components to physicaltemperatures approximating the cmb temperature. a linear model is used tocompare the output of each radiometer to a set of thermometers on theinstrument. small corrections are made for the residual emission from theflight train, balloon, atmosphere, and foreground galactic emission. the arcade2 data alone show an extragalactic rise of $50\pm7$ mk at 3.3 ghz in additionto a cmb temperature of $2.730\pm .004$ k. combining the arcade 2 data withdata from the literature shows a background power law spectrum of $t=1.26\pm0.09$ [k] $(\nu/\nu_0)^{-2.60\pm 0.04}$ from 22 mhz to 10 ghz ($\nu_0=1$ ghz)in addition to a cmb temperature of $2.725\pm .001$ k.

0901.0559	interpretation of the extragalactic radio background	we use absolutely calibrated data between 3 and 90 ghz from the 2006 balloonflight of the arcade 2 instrument, along with previous measurements at otherfrequencies, to constrain models of extragalactic emission. such emission is acombination of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) monopole, galacticforeground emission, the integrated contribution of radio emission fromexternal galaxies, any spectral distortions present in the cmb, and any otherextragalactic source. after removal of estimates of foreground emission fromour own galaxy, and the estimated contribution of external galaxies, we presentfits to a combination of the flat-spectrum cmb and potential spectraldistortions in the cmb. we find 2 sigma upper limits to cmb spectraldistortions of mu &lt; 5.8 x 10^{-5} and y_ff &lt; 6.2 x 10^{-5}. we also find asignificant detection of a residual signal beyond that which can be explainedby the cmb plus the integrated radio emission from galaxies estimated fromexisting surveys. after subtraction of an estimate of the contribution ofdiscrete radio sources, this unexplained signal is consistent withextragalactic emission in the form of a power law with amplitude 1.06 \pm 0.11k at 1 ghz and a spectral index of -2.56 \pm 0.04.

1001.4555	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  galactic foreground emission	[abridged] we present updated estimates of galactic foreground emission usingseven years of wmap data. using the power spectrum of differences betweenmulti-frequency template-cleaned maps, we find no evidence for foregroundcontamination outside of the updated (kq85y7) foreground mask. we place a 15microkelvin upper bound on rms foreground contamination in the cleaned mapsused for cosmological analysis. we find no indication in the polarization dataof an extra "haze" of hard synchrotron emission from energetic electrons nearthe galactic center. we provide an updated map of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) using the internal linear combination (ilc) method, updatedforeground masks, and updates to point source catalogs with 62 newly detectedsources. also new are tests of the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) foregroundfitting procedure against systematics in the time-stream data, and testsagainst the observed beam asymmetry.  within a few degrees of the galactic plane, wmap total intensity data show arapidly steepening spectrum from 20-40 ghz, which may be due to emission fromspinning dust grains, steepening synchrotron, or other effects. comparisons aremade to a 1-degree 408 mhz map (haslam et al.) and the 11-degree arcade 2 data(singal et al.). we find that spinning dust or steepening synchrotron modelsfit the combination of wmap and 408 mhz data equally well. arcade data appearinconsistent with the steepening synchrotron model, and consistent with thespinning dust model, though some discrepancies remain regarding the relativestrength of spinning dust emission. more high-resolution data in the 10-40 ghzrange would shed much light on these issues.

1001.4758	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations: are  there cosmic microwave background anomalies?	(abridged) a simple six-parameter lcdm model provides a successful fit towmap data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with othercosmological data. even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints ofdeviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. the cosmological communityhas subjected the wmap data to extensive and varied analyses. while there iswidespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter lcdm model,various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. in this paper weexamine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of theirsignificance. in most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posteriorselection of some aspect or subset of the data. compared with sky simulationsbased on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of thewmap data. low probability features are expected, but it is not usuallystraightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature isthe result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. weexamine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the lcdmmodel. we examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the skymaps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, andquadrupole power asymmetry. we conclude that there is no compelling evidencefor deviations from the lcdm model, which is generally an acceptablestatistical fit to wmap and other cosmological data.

astro-ph;0302222	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  data processing methods and systematic errors limits	we describe the calibration and data processing methods used to generatefull-sky maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the first year ofwilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations. detailed limits onresidual systematic errors are assigned based largely on analyses of the flightdata supplemented, where necessary, with results from ground tests. the dataare calibrated in flight using the dipole modulation of the cmb due to theobservatory's motion around the sun. this constitutes a full-beam calibrationsource. an iterative algorithm simultaneously fits the time-ordered data toobtain calibration parameters and pixelized sky map temperatures. the noiseproperties are determined by analyzing the time-ordered data with this skysignal estimate subtracted. based on this, we apply a pre-whitening filter tothe time-ordered data to remove a low level of 1/f noise. we infer and correctfor a small ~1% transmission imbalance between the two sky inputs to eachdifferential radiometer, and we subtract a small sidelobe correction from the23 ghz (k band) map prior to further analysis. no other systematic errorcorrections are applied to the data. calibration and baseline artifacts,including the response to environmental perturbations, are negligible.systematic uncertainties are comparable to statistical uncertainties in thecharacterization of the beam response. both are accounted for in the covariancematrix of the window function and are propagated to uncertainties in the finalpower spectrum. we characterize the combined upper limits to residualsystematic uncertainties through the pixel covariance matrix.

astro-ph;0302223	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  tests of gaussianity	we present limits to the amplitude of non-gaussian primordial fluctuations inthe wmap 1-year cosmic microwave background sky maps. a non-linear couplingparameter, f_nl, characterizes the amplitude of a quadratic term in theprimordial potential. we use two statistics: one is a cubic statistic whichmeasures phase correlations of temperature fluctuations after combining allconfigurations of the angular bispectrum. the other uses the minkowskifunctionals to measure the morphology of the sky maps. both methods find thewmap data consistent with gaussian primordial fluctuations and establishlimits, -58&lt;f_nl&lt;134, at 95% confidence. there is no significant frequency orscale dependence of f_nl. the wmap limit is 30 times better than cobe, andvalidates that the power spectrum can fully characterize statistical propertiesof cmb anisotropy in the wmap data to high degree of accuracy. our results alsovalidate the use of a gaussian theory for predicting the abundance of clustersin the local universe. we detect a point-source contribution to the bispectrumat 41 ghz, b_src = (9.5+-4.4) x 1e-5 uk^3 sr^2, which gives a power spectrumfrom point sources of c_src = (15+-6) x 1e-3 uk^2 sr in thermodynamictemperature units. this value agrees well with independent estimates of sourcenumber counts and the power spectrum at 41 ghz, indicating that b_src directlymeasures residual source contributions.

astro-ph;0305097	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  dark energy induced correlation with radio sources	the first-year wmap data, in combination with any one of a number of othercosmic probes, show that we live in a flat \lambda-dominated cdm universe with\omega_m ~ 0.27 and \omega_\lambda ~ 0.73. in this model the late-time actionof the dark energy, through the integrated sachs-wolfe effect, should producecmb anisotropies correlated with matter density fluctuations at z&lt;2 (crittenden&amp; turok 1996). the measurement of such a signal is an important independentcheck of the model. we cross-correlate the nrao vla sky survey radio sourcecatalog (condon et al. 1998) with the wmap data in search of this signal, andsee indications of the expected correlation. assuming a flat \lambda-cdmcosmology, we find \omega_\lambda&gt;0 (95% cl, statistical errors only) with thepeak of the likelihood at \omega_\lambda=0.68, consistent with the preferredwmap value. a closed model with \omega_m=1.28, h=0.33, and no dark energycomponent (\omega_\lambda=0), marginally consistent with the wmap cmb ttangular power spectrum, would produce an anti-correlation between the matterdistribution and the cmb. our analysis of the cross-correlation of the wmapdata with the nvss catalog rejects this cosmology at the 3\sigma level.

astro-ph;0402579	the temperature of the cmb at 10 ghz	we report the results of an effort to measure the low frequency portion ofthe spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation (cmb), using aballoon-borne instrument called arcade (absolute radiometer for cosmology,astrophysics, and diffuse emission). these measurements are to search fordeviations from a thermal spectrum that are expected to exist in the cmb due tovarious processes in the early universe. the radiometric temperature wasmeasured at 10 and 30 ghz using a cryogenic open-aperture instrument with noemissive windows. an external blackbody calibrator provides an in situreference. a linear model is used to compare the radiometer output to a set ofthermometers on the instrument. the unmodeled residuals are less than 50 mkpeak-to-peak with a weighted rms of 6 mk. small corrections are made for theresidual emission from the flight train, atmosphere, and foreground galacticemission. the measured radiometric temperature of the cmb is 2.721 +/- 0.010 kat 10 ghz and 2.694 +/- 0.032 k at 30 ghz.

astro-ph;0603449	wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) three year results:  implications for cosmology	a simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, omega_mh^2, baryon density, omega_b h^2, hubble constant, h_0, amplitude offluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalarperturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year wmap temperature andpolarization data, but also small scale cmb data, light element abundances,large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distancerelationship. using wmap data only, the best fit values for cosmologicalparameters for the power-law flat lcdm model are (omega_m h^2, omega_b h^2, h,n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+-0.016, 0.089+-0.030, 0.761+0.049-0.048). the three year datadramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space.assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power lawspectrum, the wmap data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral indexthat is significantly less than the harrison-zel'dovich-peebles scale-invariantspectrum (n_s=1, r=0). models that suppress large-scale power through a runningspectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fitto the wmap and small scale cmb data than the power-law lcdm model; however,the improvement in the fit to the wmap data is only delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extradegree of freedom. the combination of wmap and other astronomical data yieldssignificant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of stateof the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrinoproperties. consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, wedetect no significant deviations from gaussianity in the cmb maps.

astro-ph;0603451	three-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  temperature analysis	we present new full-sky temperature maps in five frequency bands from 23 to94 ghz, based on the first three years of the wmap sky survey. the new maps,which are consistent with the first-year maps and more sensitive, incorporateimprovements in data processing made possible by the additional years of dataand by a more complete analysis of the polarization signal. these includerefinements in the gain calibration and beam response models. we employ twoforms of multi-frequency analysis to separate astrophysical foreground signalsfrom the cmb, each of which improves on our first-year analyses. first, we forman improved 'internal linear combination' map, based solely on wmap data, byadding a bias correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in theresulting map. second, we fit and subtract new spatial templates that tracegalactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency wmap data to tracesynchrotron emission. the wmap point source catalog is updated to include 115new sources. we derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropyusing a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l(large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l&gt;30. our bestestimate of the cmb power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectrafrom 153 statistically independent channel pairs. the combined spectrum iscosmic variance limited to l=400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-modeexceeds unity up to l=850. the first two acoustic peaks are seen at l=220.8 +-0.7 and l=530.9 +- 3.8, respectively, while the first two troughs are seen atl=412.4 +- 1.9 and l=675.1 +- 11.1, respectively. the rise to the third peak isunambiguous; when the wmap data are combined with higher resolution cmbmeasurements, the existence of a third acoustic peak is well established.

astro-ph;9609186	millimetric ground-based observations of cosmic microwave background  anisotropy	first results of a cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy experimentconducted at the observatorio del teide (tenerife, spain) are presented. theinstrument is a four channel (3.1, 2.1, 1.3 and 1.1 mm) $^3$he bolometer systemcoupled to a 45 cm diameter telescope. the resultant configuration is sensitiveto structures on angular scales ~ 1-2 degrees. we use the channels at the twohighest frequencies for monitoring the atmosphere, and apply a simple method tosubtract this contribution in channels 1 (3.1 mm) and 2 (2.1 mm). the mostintense structure at these two frequencies is the galactic crossing with peakamplitudes of ~ 350 micro-k. these crossings have been clearly detected withthe amplitude and shape predicted. this demonstrates that our multifrequencyobservations allow an effective assessment and subtraction of the atmosphericcontribution. in the section of data at high galactic latitude we obtainsensitivities ~ 40 micro-k per beam. the statistical analyses show the presenceof common signals between channels 1 and 2. assuming a simple gaussianauto-correlation model with a scale of coherence $\theta_c=1.32$ degrees forthe signal, a likelihood analysis of this section of data reveals the presenceof fluctuations with intrinsic amplitude $c_{0}^{1/2} = 76^{+43}_{-32}$ micro-k (68 % cl including a ~ 20% calibration uncertainty). since residualatmospheric noise might still contaminate our results, we also give our resultas an upper limit of 118 micro-k at 95% c.l.

astro-ph;9705089	a search for millimetric emission from gamma ray bursts	we have used the 2- year differential microwave radiometer data from thecosmic background explorer (cobe) satellite to systematically search formillimetric (31 - 90 ghz) emission from the gamma ray bursts (grbs) in theburst and transient source experiment (batse) grb 3b catalog. the largebeamsize of the cobe instrument (7 degs fwhm) allows for an efficient search ofthe large grb positional error boxes, although it also means that fluxes from(point source) grb objects will be somewhat diluted. a likelihood analysis hasbeen used to look for a change in the level of millimetric emission from thelocations of 81 grb events during the first two years (1990 &amp; 1991) of the cobemission. the likelihood analysis determined that we did not find anysignificant millimetric signal before or after the occurance of the grb. wefind 95% confidence level upper limits of 175, 192 and 645 jy or, in terms offluxes, of 9.6, 16.3 and 54.8 10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, respectively at 31, 53 and90 ghz. we also look separately at different classes of grbs, including a studyof the top ten (in peak flux) grbs, the "short burst" and "long burst" subsets,finding similar upper limits. while these limits may be somewhat higher thanone would like, we estimate that using this technique with future plannedmissions could push these limits down to \sim 1 mjy.

astro-ph;9711225	the iac-bartol cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiment:  results of the 1994 campaign	we present the results of a cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropyground-based millimetric experiment sensitive to fluctuations on angular scalesof $\sim 2\degg$. four independent bands centered at 3.3, 2.1, 1.3 and 1.1 mmcollected $\sim 550$ hours of observation during the summer of 1994. theinstrument was located on the island of tenerife at an altitude of 2400 m. thelow water-vapor content and the atmospheric stability of the site, combinedwith new techniques to subtract atmospheric noise, result in the reduction ofatmospheric contamination in the lowest frequency channel to a level of $\sim1.5$~times the instrument noise. detailed estimations of galactic foregroundcontamination show that this contribution is negligible at $|b|\stackrel{&gt;}{_\sim} 12\degg$. two different multipole bands($\ell=53^{+22}_{-13}$ and $33^{+24}_{-13}$) are analyzed showing that ourtechnique to subtract the atmospheric contribution is more effective in themultipole band at $\ell=53$. a likelihood analysis of these data reveals thepresence of a common signal between the channels at 3.3, 2.1 and 1.3 mmcorresponding to a band power estimate of $ \sqrt{\lla (\lla+1) c_{\lla}/(2\pi)} = 2.0^{+1.0}_{-0.8} \cdot 10^{-5}$ and $\sqrt{\lla (\lla+1) c_{\lla}/(2\pi)} = 4.1^{+2.4}_{-2.2} \cdot 10^{-5}$ for the $\ell =53$ and 33 multipolebands respectively. calibration uncertainty has been treated as a systematiceffect. the level of fluctuations in the $\ell =53$ band is in good agreementwith our preliminary analysis presented in piccirillo \et 1997, withmeasurements by other experiments working at similar angular scales, and withthe predictions of standard cold dark matter (cdm) models.

0811.4280	five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  bayesian estimation of cmb polarization maps	we describe a sampling method to estimate the polarized cmb signal fromobserved maps of the sky. we use a metropolis-within-gibbs algorithm toestimate the polarized cmb map, containing q and u stokes parameters at eachpixel, and its covariance matrix. these can be used as inputs for cosmologicalanalyses. the polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of threecomponents: cmb, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. the polarizedgalactic components are modeled with spatially varying power law spectralindices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and theircomponent maps are estimated as by-products. we apply the method to simulatedlow resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 degrees, using diagonal and fullnoise realizations drawn from the wmap noise matrices. the cmb maps arerecovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. computing the likelihoodof the e-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization,tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau=0.091+-0.019 for asimulation with input tau=0.1, and mean tau=0.098 averaged over 10 simulations.a `null' simulation with no polarized cmb signal has maximum likelihoodconsistent with tau=0. the method is applied to the five-year wmap data, usingthe k, ka, q and v channels. we find tau=0.090+-0.019, compared totau=0.086+-0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary wmapanalysis. the synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over highsignal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta)&lt;0.25, but excluding~6% of the sky masked in the galactic plane, is -3.03+-0.04. this estimate doesnot vary significantly with galactic latitude, although includes an informativeprior.
