0907.2068	coronae as consequence of large scale magnetic fields in turbulent  accretion disks	non-thermal x-ray emission in compact accretion engines can be interpreted toresult from magnetic dissipation in an optically thin magnetized corona abovean optically thick accretion disk. if coronal magnetic field originates in thedisk and the disk is turbulent, then only magnetic structures large enough fortheir turbulent shredding time to exceed their buoyant rise time survive thejourney to the corona. we use this concept and a physical model to constrainthe minimum fraction of magnetic energy above the critical scale for buoyancyas a function of the observed coronal to bolometric emission. our resultssuggest that a significant fraction of the magnetic energy in accretion disksresides in large scale fields, which in turn provides circumstantial evidencefor significant non-local transport phenomena and the need for large scalemagnetic field generation. for the example of seyfert agn, for which of order30 per cent of the bolometric flux is in the x-ray band, we find that more than20 per cent of the magnetic energy must be of large enough scale to rise anddissipate in the corona.

0909.1100	magnetic nested-wind scenarios for bipolar outflows: pre-planetary and  yso nebular shaping	we present results of a series of magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) and hydro-dynamic (hd) 2.5d simulations of the morphology of outflows driven by nestedwide-angle winds - i.e. winds which eminate from a central star as well as froman orbiting accretion disk. while our results are broadly relevent to nestedwind systems we have tuned the parameters of the simulations to touch on issuesin both young stellar objects and planetary nebula studies. in particular ourstudies connect to open issues in the early evolution of planetary nebulae. wefind that nested mhd winds exhibit marked morphological differences from thesingle mhd wind case along both dimensions of the flow. nested hd winds on theother hand give rise mainly to geometric distortions of an outflow that istopologically similar to the flow arising from a single stellar hd wind. ourmhd results are insensitive to changes in ambient temperature between ionizedand un-ionized circumstellar environments. the results are sensitive to therelative mass-loss rates, and to the relative speeds of the stellar and diskwinds. we also present synthetic emission maps of both nested mhd and hdsimulations. we find that nested mhd winds show knots of emission appearingon-axis that do not appear in the hd case.

0911.2315	comparisons and connections between mean field dynamo theory and  accretion disc theory	the origin of large scale magnetic fields in astrophysical rotators, and theconversion of gravitational energy into radiation near stars and compactobjects via accretion have been subjects of active research for a half century.magnetohydrodynamic turbulence makes both problems highly nonlinear, so bothsubjects have benefitted from numerical simulations.however, understanding thekey principles and practical modeling of observations warrants testablesemi-analytic mean field theories that distill the essential physics. meanfield dynamo (mfd) theory and alpha-viscosity accretion disc theory exemplifythis pursuit. that the latter is a mean field theory is not always madeexplicit but the combination of turbulence and global symmetry imply such. themore commonly explicit presentation of assumptions in 20th century textbookmfdt has exposed it to arguably more widespread criticism than incurred by 20thcentury alpha-accretion theory despite complementary weaknesses. in the 21stcentury however, mfdt has experienced a breakthrough with a dynamicalsaturation theory that consistently agrees with simulations. such has not yetoccurred in accretion disc theory, though progress is emerging. ironicallyhowever, for accretion engines, mfdt and accretion theory are presently twoartificially uncoupled pieces of what should be a single coupled theory. largescale fields and accretion flows are dynamically intertwined because largescale fields likely play a key role in angular momentum transport. i discussand synthesize aspects of recent progress in mfdt and accretion disc theory tosuggest why the two likely conspire in a unified theory.

0707.4629	on the role of stochastic fermi acceleration in setting the dissipation  scale of turbulence in the interstellar medium	we consider the dissipation by fermi acceleration of magnetosonic turbulencein the reynolds layer of the interstellar medium. the scale in the cascade atwhich electron acceleration via stochastic fermi acceleration (stfa) becomescomparable to further cascade of the turbulence defines the inner scale. forany magnetic turbulent spectra equal to or shallower than goldreich-sridharthis turns out to be $\ge 10^{12}$cm, which is much larger than the shortestlength scales observed in radio scintillation measurements. while stfa for suchspectra then contradict models of scintillation which appeal directly to anextended, continuous turbulent cascade, such a separation of scales isconsistent with the recent work of \citet{boldyrev2} and \citet{boldyrev3}suggesting that interstellar scintillation may result from the passage of radiowaves through the galactic distribution of thin ionized boundary surfaces ofhii regions, rather than density variations from cascading turbulence. thepresence of stfa dissipation also provides a mechanism for the non-ionizingheat source observed in the reynolds layer of the interstellar medium\citep{reynolds}. stfa accommodates the proper heating power, and the inputenergy is rapidly thermalized within the low density reynolds layer plasma.

1010.1478	quantifying the imprecision of accretion theory and implications for  multi-epoch observations of protoplanetary discs	if accretion disc emission results from turbulent dissipation, thenaxisymmetric accretion theory must be used as a mean field theory: turbulentflows are at most axisymmetric only when suitably averaged. spectralpredictions therefore have an intrinsic imprecision that must be quantified tointerpret the variability exhibited by a source observed at different epochs.we quantify contributions to the stochastic imprecision that come fromazimuthal and radial averaging and show that the imprecision is minimized for aparticular choice of radial averaging, which in turn, corresponds to an optimalspectral resolution of a telescope for a spatially unresolved source. if theoptimal spectral resolution is less than that of the telescope then the datacan be binned to compare to the theoretical prediction of minimum imprecision.little stochastic variability is predicted at radii much larger than that atwhich the dominant eddy turnover time ($\sim$ orbit time) exceeds the timeinterval between observations; the epochs would then be sampling the samemember of the stochastic ensemble. we discuss the application of theseprinciples to protoplanetary discs for which there is presently a paucity ofmulti-epoch data but for which such data acquisition projects are underway.

0708.4199	planetary nebulae principles &amp; paradigms: binaries, accretion, magnetic  fields	observations suggest that many, if not all, post agb systems evolve throughan aspherical outflow phase. such outflows require a sufficient enginerotational energy which binaries can provide. via common envelope evolution,binaries can directly eject equatorial outflows or produce poloidal outflowsfrom magnetized accretion disks around the primary or secondary. we discuss howaccretion driven magnetohydrodynamic outflow models all make similarpredictions for the outflow power and speed and we distinguish between thelaunch vs. propagation regimes of such outflows. we suggest that the highvelocity bipolar outflows observed in planetary nebulae (pne) and the lowervelocity but higher power bipolar outflows observed in pre-pne (ppne) arekinematically consistent with time dependent accretion onto a white dwarf (wd)within a depleting envelope. since the wd primary core is always present in allpost-agb systems, accretion onto this core is potentially common. previous workhas focused on core accretion from sub-stellar companions, but low mass stellarcompanions may be more important, and further work is needed.

1107.0415	from bipolar to elliptical: simulating the morphological evolution of  planetary nebulae	the majority of proto-planetary nebulae (ppn) are observed to have bipolarmorphologies. the majority of mature pn are observed to have elliptical shapes.in this paper we address the evolution of ppn/pn morphologies attempting tounderstand if a transition from strongly bipolar to elliptical shape can bedriven by changes in the parameters of the mass loss process. to this end wepresent 2.5d hydrodynamical simulations of mass loss at the end stages ofstellar evolution for intermediate mass stars. we track changes in windvelocity, mass loss rate and mass loss geometry. in particular we focus on thetransition from mass loss dominated by a short duration jet flow (driven duringthe ppn phase) to mass loss driven by a spherical fast wind (produced by thecentral star of the pn). we address how such changes in outflow characteristicscan change the nebula from a bipolar to an elliptical morphology. our resultsshow that including a period of jet formation in the temporal sequence of ppnto pn produces realistic nebular synthetic emission geometries. moreimportantly such a sequence provides insight, in principle, into the apparentdifference in morphology statistics characterizing ppn and pn systems. inparticular we find that while jet driven ppn can be expected to be dominated bybipolar morphologies, systems that begin with a jet but are followed by aspherical fast wind will evolve into elliptical nebulae. furthermore, we findthat spherical nebulae are highly unlikely to ever derive from either bipolarppn or elliptical pn.

1203.0823	accretion disks and dynamos: toward a unified mean field theory	conversion of gravitational energy into radiation in accretion discs and theorigin of large scale magnetic fields in astrophysical rotators have often beendistinct topics of research. in semi-analytic work on both problems it has beenuseful to presume large scale symmetries, necessarily resulting in mean fieldtheories. mhd turbulence makes the underlying systems locally asymmetric andnonlinear. synergy between theory and simulations should aim for thedevelopment of practical mean field models that capture essential physics andcan be used for observational modeling. mean field dynamo (mfd) theory andalpha-viscosity accretion theory exemplify such ongoing pursuits. 21st centurymfd theory has more nonlinear predictive power compared to 20th century mfdtheory, whereas accretion theory is still in a 20th century state. in fact,insights from mfd theory are applicable to accretion theory and the two areartificially separated pieces of what should be a single theory. i discusspieces of progress that provide clues toward a unified theory. a key concept isthat large scale magnetic fields can be sustained via local or global magnetichelicity fluxes or via relaxation of small scale magnetic fluctuations, withoutthe kinetic helicity driver of 20th century textbooks. these concepts may helpexplain the formation of large scale fields that supply non-local angularmomentum transport via coronae and jets in a unified theory of accretion anddynamos. in diagnosing the role of helicities and helicity fluxes in disksimulations, each disk hemisphere should be studied separately to avoid beingmisled by cancelation that occurs as a result of reflection asymmetry. thefraction of helical field energy in disks is expected to be small compared tothe total field in each hemisphere as a result of shear, but can still beessential for large scale dynamo action.

1204.0800	on the structure and stability of magnetic tower jets	modern theoretical models of astrophysical jets combine accretion, rotation,and magnetic fields to launch and collimate supersonic flows from a centralsource. near the source, magnetic field strengths must be large enough tocollimate the jet requiring that the poynting flux exceeds the kinetic-energyflux. the extent to which the poynting flux dominates kinetic energy flux atlarge distances from the engine distinguishes two classes of models. inmagneto-centrifugal launch (mcl) models, magnetic fields dominate only atscales $\lesssim 100$ engine radii, after which the jets becomehydrodynamically dominated (hd). by contrast, in poynting flux dominated (pfd)magnetic tower models, the field dominates even out to much larger scales. tocompare the large distance propagation differences of these two paradigms, weperform 3-d ideal mhd amr simulations of both hd and pfd stellar jets formedvia the same energy flux. we also compare how thermal energy losses androtation of the jet base affects the stability in these jets. for theconditions described, we show that pfd and hd exhibit observationallydistinguishable features: pfd jets are lighter, slower, and less stable than hdjets. unlike hd jets, pfd jets develop current-driven instabilities that areexacerbated as cooling and rotation increase, resulting in jets that areclumpier than those in the hd limit. our pfd jet simulations also resemble themagnetic towers that have been recently created in laboratory astrophysical jetexperiments.

1209.1565	comparing poynting flux dominated magnetic tower jets with  kinetic-energy dominated jets	magnetic towers represent one of two fundamental forms of mhd outflows.driven by magnetic pressure gradients, these flows have been less well studiedthan magneto-centrifugally launched jets even though magnetic towers may wellbe as common. here we present new results exploring the behavior and evolutionof magnetic tower outflows and demonstrate their connection with pulsed powerexperimental studies and purely hydrodynamic jets which might represent theasymptotic propagation regimes of magneto-centrifugally launched jets.high-resolution amr mhd simulations (using the astrobear code) provide insightsinto the underlying physics of magnetic towers and help us constrain models oftheir propagation. our simulations have been designed to explore the effects ofthermal energy losses and rotation on both tower flows and their hydrocounterparts. we find these parameters have significant effects on thestability of magnetic towers, but mild effects on the stability of hydro jets.current-driven perturbations in the poynting flux dominated (pdf) towers areshown to be amplified in both the cooling and rotating cases. our studies ofthe long term evolution of the towers show that the formation of weaklymagnetized central jets within the tower are broken up by these instabilitiesbecoming a series of collimated clumps which magnetization properties vary overtime. in addition to discussing these results in light of laboratoryexperiments, we address their relevance to astrophysical observations of youngstar jets and outflow from highly evolved solar type stars.

1209.2230	on the resilience of helical magnetic fields to turbulent diffusion and  the astrophysical implications	the extent to which large scale magnetic fields are susceptible to turbulentdiffusion is important for interpreting the need for in situ large scaledynamos in astrophysics and for observationally inferring field strengthscompared to kinetic energy. by solving coupled equations for magnetic energyand magnetic helicity in a system initiated with isotropic turbulence and anarbitrarily helical large scale field, we quantify the decay rate of the latterfor a bounded or periodic system. the energy associated with the non-helicalmagnetic field rapidly decays by turbulent diffusion, but the decay rate of thehelical component depends on whether the ratio of its magnetic energy to theturbulent kinetic energy exceeds a critical value given by m_{1,c}=(k_1/k_2)^2, where k_1 and k_2 are the wave numbers of the large and forcingscales. turbulently diffusing helical fields to small scales while conservingmagnetic helicity requires a rapid increase in total magnetic energy. as such,only when the helical fields are sub-critical can they so diffuse. whensuper-critical, the large scale helical field decays slowly, at a ratedetermined by microphysical dissipation even when macroscopic turbulence ispresent. amplification of small scale magnetic helicity abates the turbulentdiffusion. two implications are that: (1) standard arguments supporting theneed for in situ large scale dynamos based on the otherwise rapid turbulentdiffusion of large scale fields require re-thinking since only the non-helicalfield is so diffused in a closed system. boundary terms could however providepotential pathways for rapid change of the large scale helical field. (2) sincem_{1,c} &lt;&lt;1 for k_1 &lt;&lt; k_2, the presence of long-lived ordered large scalehelical fields, as in extragalactic jets, does not guarantee that the magneticfield dominates the kinetic energy.

1305.2080	a study of large scale dynamo growth rates from numerical simulations  and implications for mean field theories	understanding large scale magnetic field growth in turbulent plasmas in themagnetohydrodynamic limit is a goal of magnetic dynamo theory. in particular,assessing how well large scale helical field growth and saturation insimulations matches that predicted by existing theories is important forprogress. using numerical simulations of isotropically forced turbulencewithout large scale shear with the implications, we focus on several aspects ofthis comparison that have not been previously tested: (1) leading mean fielddynamo theories which break the field into large and small scales predict thatlarge scale helical field growth rates are determined by the difference betweenkinetic helicity and current helicity with no dependence on the non-helicalenergy in small scale magnetic fields. our simulations show that the growthrate of the large scale field from fully helical forcing is indeed unaffectedby the presence or absence of small scale magnetic fields amplified in aprecursor non-helical dynamo. however, because the precursor non helical dynamoin our simulations produced fields that were strongly sub-equipartition withrespect to the kinetic energy, we cannot yet rule out the potential influenceof stronger non- helical small scale fields. (2) we have identified twofeatures in our simulations which cannot be explained by the most minimalistversions of two-scale mean field theory: (i) fully helical small scale forcingproduces significant non-helical large scale magnetic energy and (ii) thesaturation of the large scale field growth is time-delayed with respect to whatminimalist theory predicts. we comment on desirable generalizations to thetheory in this context and future desired work.

1308.4198	size of discs formed by wind accretion in binaries can be underestimated  if the role of wind-driving force is ignored	binary systems consisting of a secondary accreting form a wind-emittingprimary are ubiquitous in astrophysics. the phenomenology of suchbondi-hoyle-lyttleton (bhl) accretors is particularly rich when an accretiondisc forms around the secondary. the outer radius of such discs is commonlyestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation ofmaterial across the bhl or bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tiltedwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. but thisapproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward drivingforce that the secondary does not. in actuality, the accretion stream fallstoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulledtoward the primary relative to the stream. the result is a finite separation or"accretion stream impact parameter" (asip) separating the secondary and stream.when the orbital radius a_o exceeds the bhl radius r_b, the ratio of outer discradius estimated as the asip to the conventional estimatea_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}&gt;1. we therefore predict that discs will form at largerradii from the secondary than traditional estimates. this agrees with theimportance of the asip emphasized by huarte-espinosa et al.

1310.0695	resilience of helical fields to turbulent diffusion ii: direct numerical  simulations	the recent study of blackman and subramanian (paper i) indicates that largescale helical magnetic fields are resilient to turbulent diffusion in the sensethat helical fields stronger than a critical value, decay on slow (~resistivelymediated), rather than fast ($\sim$ turbulent) time scales. this gives morecredence to potential fossil field origin models of the magnetic fields instars, galaxies and compact objects. we analyze a suite of direct numericalsimulations (dns) of decaying large scale helical magnetic fields in thepresence of non-helical turbulence to further study the physics of helicalfield decay. we study two separate cases: (1) the initial field is large enoughto decay resistively, is tracked until it transitions to decay fast, and thecritical large scale helical field at that transition is sought; (2) the caseof paper i, wherein there is a critical initial helical field strength belowwhich the field undergoes fast decay right from the beginning. in case (1),both dns and solutions of the two scale model (from paper 1), reveal that thetransition energy, $e_{c1}$, is independent of the scale of the turbulentforcing, within a small range of $\rm$. we also find that the kinetic alpha,$\alpha_k$, is subdominant to magnetic alpha, $\alpha_m$, in the dns,justifying an assumption in the two scale model. for case (2), we show exactsolutions of two scale model in the limit of $\eta \rightarrow 0$ in fullyhelical case, leading to the transition energy, $e_{c2} = (k_1/\kf)^2 m_{eq}$,where $k_1$ and $\kf$ are the large scale and small turbulent forcing scalerespectively and $m_{eq}$ is the equipartition magnetic energy. the dns in thiscase agree qualitatively with the two scale model but the $r_m$ currentlyachievable, is too small to satisfy a condition $3/r_m &lt;&lt; (k_1/k_f)^2$,necessary to robustly reveal the transition, $e_{c2}$ (abridged).

1402.0933	magnetic helicity and large scale magnetic fields: a primer	magnetic fields of laboratory, planetary, stellar, and galactic plasmascommonly exhibit significant order on large temporal or spatial scales comparedto the otherwise random motions within the hosting system. such ordered fieldscan be measured in the case of planets, stars, and galaxies, or inferredindirectly by the action of their dynamical influence, such as jets. whetherlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages ofan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magneticactivity cycle. magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magneticfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolutionfor both mechanisms of origin. its importance stems from its two basicproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magneticenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetichelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to thelargest scale available. here i discuss how magnetic helicity has come to helpus understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the needfor either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and theassociated observational consequences. i also discuss how magnetic helicityacts as a hindrance to turbulent diffusion of large scale fields, and thus ahelper for fossil remnant large scale field origin models in some contexts. ibriefly discuss the connection between large scale fields and accretion disktheory as well. the goal here is to provide a conceptual primer to help thereader efficiently penetrate the literature.

1403.4288	on characterizing nonlocality and anisotropy for the magnetorotational  instability	the extent to which angular momentum transport in accretion discs isprimarily local or non-local and what determines this is an important avenue ofstudy for understanding accretion engines. taking a step along this path, weanalyze simulations of the magnetorotational instability (mri) by calculatingenergy and stress power spectra in stratified isothermal shearing boxsimulations in several new ways. we divide our boxes in two regions, disc andcorona where the disc is the mri unstable region and corona is the magneticallydominated region. we calculate the fractional power in different quantities,including magnetic energy and maxwell stresses and find that they are dominatedby contributions from the lowest wave numbers. this is even more dramatic forthe corona than the disc, suggesting that transport in the corona region isdominated by larger structures than the disc. by calculating averaged powerspectra in one direction of $k$ space at a time, we also show that the mriturbulence is strongly anisotropic on large scales when analyzed by thismethod, but isotropic on small scales. although the shearing box itself ismeant to represent a local section of an accretion disc, the fact that thestress and energy are dominated by the largest scales highlights that thelocality is not captured within the box. this helps to quantify the intuitiveimportance of global simulations for addressing the question of locality oftransport, for which similar analyses can be performed.

1409.2442	sensitivity of the magnetorotational instability to the shear parameter  in stratified simulations	the magnetorotational instability (mri) is a shear instability and thus itssensitivity to the shear parameter $q = - d\ln\omega/d\ln r $ is of interest toinvestigate. motivated by astrophysical disks, most (but not all) previous mristudies have focused on the keplerian value of $ q=1.5$. using simulation with8 vertical density scale heights, we contribute to the subset of studiesaddressing the the effect of varying $q$ in stratified numerical simulations.we discuss why shearing boxes cannot easily be used to study $q&gt;2$ and thusfocus on $q&lt;2$. as per previous simulations, which were either unstratified orstratified with a smaller vertical domain, we find that the $q$ dependence ofstress for the stratified case is not linear, contrary to the shakura-sunyaevmodel. we find that the scaling agrees with \cite{1996mnras.281l..21a} whofound it to be proportional to the shear to vorticity ratio $q/(2-q)$. we alsofind however, that the shape of the magnetic and kinetic energy spectra arerelatively insensitive to $q$ and that the ratio of maxwell stress to magneticenergy ratio also remains nearly independent of $q$. this is consistent with atheoretical argument in which the rate of amplification of the azimuthal fielddepends linearly on $q$ and the turbulent correlation time $\tau$ dependsinversely on $q$. as such, we measure the correlation time of the turbulenceand find that indeed it is inversely proportional to $q$.

1501.00291	motivation and challenge to capture both large scale and local transport  in next generation accretion theory	accretion disc theory is less developed than stellar evolution theoryalthough a similarly mature phenomenological picture is ultimately desired.while the interplay of theory and numerical simulations has amplified communityawareness of the role of magnetic fields in angular momentum transport, thereremains a long term challenge to incorporate insight gained from simulationsback into improving practical models for comparison with observations. here weemphasize the need to incorporate the role of non-local transport moreprecisely. to show where large scale transport would fit into the theoreticalframework and how it is currently missing, we review why the wonderfullypractical approach of shakura-sunyaev (1973,ss73) is necessarily a mean fieldtheory, and one which does not include large scale transport. observations ofcoronae and jets combined with the interpretation of results even from shearingbox simulations of the magnetorotational instability (mri) suggest that asignificant fraction of disc transport is indeed non-local. we show that themaxwell stresses in saturation are dominated by large scale contributions andthe physics of mri transport is not fully captured by a viscosity. we alsoclarify the standard physical interpretation of the mri as it applies toshearing boxes. computational limitations have so far focused most attentiontoward local simulations but the next generation of global simulations shouldhelp to inform improved mean field theories. mean field accretion theory andmean field dynamo theory should in fact be unified into a single theory thatpredicts the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from separate disc,corona, and outflow contributions. finally, we note that any mean field theoryhas a finite predictive precision that needs to be quantified when comparingthe predictions to observations.

1502.04410	detecting the oldest geodynamo and attendant shielding from the solar  wind: implications for habitability	the onset and nature of the earliest geomagnetic field is important forunderstanding the evolution of the core, atmosphere and life on earth. a recordof the early geodynamo is preserved in ancient silicate crystals containingminute magnetic inclusions. these data indicate the presence of a geodynamoduring the paleoarchean, between 3.4 and 3.45 billion years ago. while themagnetic field sheltered earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoffof the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modernextreme solar storms. these conditions suggest that intense radiation from theyoung sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young earth by promoting lossof volatiles, including water. such effects would have been more pronounced ifthe field were absent or very weak prior to 3.45 billion years ago, assuggested by some models of lower mantle evolution. the frontier is thus tryingto obtain geomagnetic field records that are &gt;&gt;3.45 billion-years-old, as wellas constraining solar wind pressure for these times. in this review we suggestpathways for constraining these parameters and the attendant history of earth'sdeep interior, hydrosphere and atmosphere. in particular, we discuss newestimates for solar wind pressure for the first 700 million years of earthhistory, the competing effects of magnetic shielding versus solar ioncollection, and bounds on the detection level of a geodynamo imposed by thepresence of external fields. we also discuss the prospects for constraininghadean-paleoarchean magnetic field strength using paleointensity analyses ofzircons.

0804.4197	protostellar outflow evolution in turbulent environments	the link between turbulence in star formatting environments and protostellarjets remains controversial. to explore issues of turbulence and fossil cavitiesdriven by young stellar outflows we present a series of numerical simulationstracking the evolution of transient protostellar jets driven into a turbulentmedium. our simulations show both the effect of turbulence on outflowstructures and, conversely, the effect of outflows on the ambient turbulence.we demonstrate how turbulence will lead to strong modifications in jetmorphology. more importantly, we demonstrate that individual transient outflowshave the capacity to re-energize decaying turbulence. our simulations support ascenario in which the directed energy/momentum associated with cavities israndomized as the cavities are disrupted by dynamical instabilities seeded bythe ambient turbulence. consideration of the energy power spectra of thesimulations reveals that the disruption of the cavities powers an energycascade consistent with burgers'-type turbulence and produces a drivingscale-length associated with the cavity propagation length. we conclude thatfossil cavities interacting either with a turbulent medium or with othercavities have the capacity to sustain or create turbulent flows in star formingenvironments. in the last section we contrast our work and its conclusions withprevious studies which claim that jets can not be the source of turbulence.

0805.4645	outflow driven turbulence in molecular clouds	in this paper we explore the relationship between protostellar outflows andturbulence in molecular clouds. using 3-d numerical simulations we focus on thehydrodynamics of multiple outflows interacting within a parsec scale volume. weexplore the extent to which transient outflows injecting directed energy andmomentum into a sub-volume of a molecular cloud can be converted into randomturbulent motions. we show that turbulence can readily be sustained by theseinteractions and show that it is possible to broadly characterize an effectivedriving scale of the outflows. we compare the velocity spectrum obtained in ourstudies to that of isotropically forced hydrodynamic turbulence finding that inoutflow driven turbulence a power law is indeed achieved. however we find asteeper spectrum (beta ~ 3) is obtained in outflow driven turbulence modelsthan in isotropically forced simulations (beta ~ 2). we discuss possiblephysical mechanisms responsible for these results as well and theirimplications for turbulence in molecular clouds where outflows will act inconcert with other processes such as gravitational collapse.

0806.4418	stochastic wobble of accretion discs and jets from turbulent rocket  torques	models of accretion discs and their associated outflows often incorporateassumptions of axisymmetry and symmetry across the disc plane. however, forturbulent discs these symmetries only apply to averaged quantities and do notapply locally. the local asymmetries can induce local imbalances in outflowpower across the disc mid-plane, which can in turn induce local tiltingtorques. here we calculate the effect of the resulting stochastic torques ondisc annuli that are a consequence of standard mean field accretion discmodels. the torques induce a random walk of the vector perpendicular to theplane of each averaged annulus. this random walk is characterized by a radiallydependent diffusion coefficient which we calculate for small angle tilt. we usethe coefficient to calculate a radially dependent time scale for annular tiltand associated jet wobble. the wobble time depends on the square of the wanderangle so the age of a given system determines the maximum wobble angle. weapply this to examples of blazars, young stellar objects and binary engines ofpre-planetary nebulae and microquasars. it is noteworthy that for an averagingtime $t_w\sim 3$ days, we estimate a wobble angle for jets in ss433 of$\theta\sim 0.8$ degrees, not inconsistent with observational data. in generalthe non-periodic nature of the stochastic wobble could distinguish it fromfaster periodic jet precession.

astro-ph;0004212	grbs from unstable poynting dominated outflows	poynting flux driven outflows from magnetized rotators are a plausibleexplanation for gamma-ray burst engines. we suggest a new possibility for howsuch outflows might transfer energy into radiating particles. we argue that thepoynting flux drives non-linearly unstable large amplitude electromagneticwaves (laemw) which ``break'' at radii $r_t \sim 10^{14} $ cm where the mhdapproximation becomes inapplicable. in the ``foaming'' (relativisticlyreconnecting) regions formed during the wave breaks the random electric fieldsstochastically accelerate particles to ultrarelativistic energies which thenradiate in turbulent electromagnetic fields. the typical energy of the emittedphotons is a fraction of the fundamental compton energy $ \epsilon \sim f \hbarc/r_e $ with $f \sim 10^{-3}$ plus additional boosting due to the bulk motionof the medium. the emission properties are similar to synchrotron radiation,with a typical cooling time $\sim 10^{-4}$ sec. during the wave break, theplasma is also bulk accelerated in the outward radial direction and at largerradii can produce afterglows due to the interactions with external medium. thenear equipartition fields required by afterglow models maybe due to magneticfield regeneration in the outflowing plasma (similarly to the field generationby laemw of laser-plasma interactions) and mixing with the upstream plasma.

astro-ph;0005288	mhd stellar and disk winds: application to planetary nebulae	mhd winds can emanate from both stars and surrounding accretion disks. it isof interest to know how much wind power is available and which (if either) ofthe two rotators dominates that power. we investigate this in the context ofmulti-polar planetary nebulae (pne) and proto-planetary nebulae (ppne), forwhich recent observations have revealed the need for a wind power source inexcess of that available from radiation driving, and a possible need formagnetic shaping. we calculate the mhd wind power from a coupled disk and star,where the former results from binary disruption. the resulting wind powersdepend only on the accretion rate and stellar properties. we find that if thestellar envelope were initially slowly rotating, the disk wind would dominatethroughout the evolution. if the envelope of the star were rapidly rotating,the stellar wind could initially be of comparable power to the disk wind untilthe stellar wind carries away the star's angular momentum. since an initiallyrapidly rotating star can have its spin and magnetic axes misaligned to thedisk, multi-polar outflows can result from this disk wind system. for timesgreater than a spin-down time, the post-agb stellar wind is slaved to the diskfor both slow and rapid initial spin cases and the disk wind luminositydominates. we find a reasonably large parameter space where a hybrid star+diskmhd driven wind is plausible and where both or either can account for ppne andpne powers. we also speculate on the morphologies which may emerge from thecoupled system. the coupled winds might help explain the shapes of a number ofremarkable multi-shell or multi-polar nebulae. magnetic activity such as x-rayflares may be associated with the both central star and the disk and would be avaluable diagnostic for the dynamical role of mhd processes in pne.

astro-ph;0006241	implications of mean field accretion disc theory for vorticity and  magnetic field growth	in addition to the scalar shakura-sunyaev $\alpha_{ss}$ turbulent viscositytransport term used in simple analytic accretion disc modeling, a pseudoscalartransport term also arises. the essence of this term can be captured even insimple models for which vertical averaging is interpreted as integration over ahalf-thickness and one separately studies each hemisphere. the additional termhighlights a complementarity between mean field magnetic dynamo theory andaccretion disc theory treated as a mean field theory. such pseudoscalar termshave been studied, and can lead to large scale magnetic field and vorticitygrowth. here it is shown that vorticity can grow even in the simplest azimuthaland half-height integrated disc model, for which mean quantities depend only onradius. the simplest vorticity growth solutions seem to have scales and vortexsurvival times consistent those required for facilitating planet formation.also it is shown that when the magnetic back-reaction is included to lowestorder, the pseudoscalar driving the magnetic field growth and that driving thevorticity growth will behave differently with respect to shearing andnon-shearing flows: the former can reverse sign in the two cases, while thelatter will have the same sign.

astro-ph;0009263	reprocessed emission line profiles from dense clouds in geometrically  thick accretion engines	the central engines of active galactic nuclei (agn) contain cold, densematerial as well as hot x-ray emitting gas. the standard paradigm for theengine geometry is a cold thin disc sandwiched between hot x-ray coronae.strong support for this geometry in seyferts comes from the study offluorescent iron line profiles, although the evidence is not ubiquitously airtight. the thin disc model of line profiles in agn and in x-ray binaries shouldbe bench marked against other plausible possibilities. one proposed alternativeis an engine consisting of dense clouds embedded in an optically thin,geometrically thick x-ray emitting engine. this model is further motivated bystudies of geometrically thick engines such as advection dominated accretionflows (adafs). here we compute the reprocessed iron line profiles from denseclouds embedded in geometrically thick, optically thin x-ray emitting discsnear a schwarzchild black hole. we consider a range of cloud distributions anddisc solutions, including adafs, pure radial infall, and bipolar outflows. wefind that such models can reproduce line profiles similar to those fromgeometrically thin, optically thick discs and might help alleviate some of theproblems encountered from the latter.

astro-ph;0012048	how astrophysical mean field dynamos can circumvent existing quenching  constraints	mean field dynamo theory is a leading candidate to explain the observed largescale magnetic fields of galaxies and stars. however, controversy arises overthe extent of premature quenching by the backreaction of the growing field. wedistinguish between rapid mean field dynamo action, which is required byastrophysical systems, and resistively limited action. we show how the flow ofmagnetic helicity is important for rapid action. existing numerical andanalytic work suggesting that mean field dynamos are prematurely quenched andresistively limited include approximations or boundary conditions whichsuppress the magnetic helicity flow from the outset. thus they do notunambiguously reveal whether real astrophysical mean field dynamos aredynamically suppressed when the helicity flow is allowed. an outflow ofhelicity also implies an outflow of magnetic energy and so active coronae orwinds should accompany mean field dynamos. open boundaries alone may not besufficient for rapid dynamo action and the additional physics of buoyancy andoutflows may be required. possible simulation approaches to test some of theprinciples are briefly discussed. some limitations of the ``zeldovichrelation'' are also addressed.

astro-ph;0101492	dynamos in asymptotic-giant-branch stars as the origin of magnetic  fields shaping planetary nebulale	planetary nebulae are thought to be formed when a slow wind from theprogenitor giant star is overtaken by a subsequent fast wind generated as thestar enters its white dwarf stage$^{1}$. a shock forms near the boundarybetween the winds, which creates a relatively dense shell that provides thecharacteristic appearance of a planetary nebula. a spherically symmetric windwill produce a spherically symmetric shell, yet over half of known planetarynebulae are not spherical; rather, they are elliptical or bipolar inshape$^{2}$. while a magnetic field could launch and collimate a bipolaroutflow, the origin of such a field has hitherto been unclear, as previous worksuggested that a field could not be generated${^3}$. here we show that anasymptotic-giant-branch (agb) star can indeed generate a strong magnetic field,in a dynamo at the interface between a rapidly rotating core and the moreslowly rotating envelope of the star. the field is strong enough to shape thebipolar outflows that produce the observed bipolar planetary nebulae. magneticbraking of the stellar core during this process may also explain thepuzzlingly$^{4}$ slow rotation of most white dwarf stars.

astro-ph;0110018	effect of fractional kinetic helicity on turbulent magnetic dynamo  spectra	magnetic field amplification in astrophysics ultimately requires anunderstanding of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. kinetic helicity has long beenknown to be important for large scale field growth in forced mhd turbulence,and has been recently demonstrated numerically to be asymptotically consistentwith slow mean field dynamo action in a periodic box. here we show numericallythat the magnetic spectrum at and below the forcing scale is also stronglyinfluenced by kinetic helicity. we identify a critical value, $f_{h,crit}$above which the magnetic spectrum develops maxima at wavenumber $= 1$ scale{\it and} at the forcing scale, for $f&lt; f_{h,crit}$ the field peaks only at theresistive scale. kinetic helicity may thus be important not only for generatinga large scale field, but also for establishing observed peaks in magneticspectra at the forcing scale. the turbulent galactic disk provides an examplewhere both large scale ($&gt;$ supernova forcing scale) fields and small scale($\le$ forcing scale, with peak at forcing scale) fields are observed. wediscuss this, and the potential application to the protogalaxy, but alsoemphasize the limitations in applying our results to these systems.

astro-ph;0204497	dynamic nonlinearity in large scale dynamos with shear	we supplement the mean field dynamo growth equation with the total magnetichelicity evolution equation. this provides an explicitly time dependent modelfor alpha quenching in dynamo theory. for dynamos without shear, this approachaccounts for the observed large scale field growth and saturation in numericalsimulations. after a significant kinematic phase, the dynamo is resistivelyquenched, i.e. the saturation time depends on the microscopic resistivity. thisis independent of whether or not the turbulent diffusivity is resistivelyquenched. we find that the approach is also successful for dynamos that includeshear and exhibit migratory waves (cycles). in this case however, whether ornot the cycle period remains of the order of the dynamical time scale at largemagnetic reynolds numbers does depend how on how the turbulent magneticdiffusivity quenches. since this is unconstrained by magnetic helicityconservation, the diffusivity is presently an input parameter. comparison tocurrent numerical experiments suggests a turbulent diffusivity that dependsonly weakly on the magnetic reynolds number, but higher resolution simulationsare needed.

astro-ph;0301432	understanding helical magnetic dynamo spectra with a nonlinear  four-scale theory	recent mhd dynamo simulations for magnetic prandtl number $&gt;1$ demonstratethat when mhd turbulence is forced with sufficient kinetic helicity, thesaturated magnetic energy spectrum evolves from having a single peak below theforcing scale to become doubly peaked with one peak at the system (=largest)scale and one at the forcing scale. the system scale field growth is wellmodeled by a recent nonlinear two-scale nonlinear helical dynamo theory inwhich the system and forcing scales carry magnetic helicity of opposite sign.but a two-scale theory cannot model the shift of the small-scale peak towardthe forcing scale. here i develop a four-scale helical dynamo theory whichshows that the small-scale helical magnetic energy first saturates at verysmall scales, but then successively saturates at larger values at largerscales, eventually becoming dominated by the forcing scale. the transfer of thesmall scale peak to the forcing scale is completed by the end of the kinematicgrowth regime of the large scale field, and does not depend on magneticreynolds number $r_m$ for large $r_m$. the four-scale and two-scale theoriessubsequently evolve almost identically, and both show significant field growthon the system and forcing scales that is independent of $r_m$. in the presentapproach, the helical and nonhelical parts of the spectrum are largelydecoupled. implications for fractionally helical turbulence are discussed.

0808.3378	identifying deficiencies of standard accretion disk theory: lessons from  a mean-field approach	turbulent viscosity is frequently used in accretion disk theory to replacethe microphysical viscosity in order to accomodate the observational need forin- stabilities in disks that lead to enhanced transport. however, simplyreplacing the microphysical transport coefficient by a single turbulenttransport coeffi- cient hides the fact that the procedure should formally ariseas part of a closure in which the hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic equationsare averaged, and correlations of turbulent fluctuations are replaced bytransport coefficients. here we show how a mean field approach leads quitenaturally two transport coefficients, not one, that govern mass and angularmomentum transport. in particular, we highlight that the conventional approachsuffers from a seemingly inconsistent neglect of turbulent diffusion in thesurface density equation. we constrain these new transport coefficients forspecific cases of inward, outward, and zero net mass transport. in addition, wefind that one of the new transport terms can lead to oscillations in the meansurface density which then requires a constant or small inverse rossby numberfor disks to maintain a monotonic power-law surface density.

astro-ph;0508530	on particle acceleration and trapping by poynting flux dominated flows	using particle-in-cell (pic) simulations, we study the evolution of astrongly magnetized plasma slab propagating into a finite density ambientmedium. like previous work, we find that the slab breaks into discrete magneticpulses. the subsequent evolution is consistent with diamagnetic relativisticpulse acceleration of \cite{liangetal2003}. unlike previous work, we use theactual electron to proton mass ratio and focus on understanding trapping vs.transmission of the ambient plasma by the pulses and on the particleacceleration spectra. we find that the accelerated electron distributioninternal to the slab develops a double-power law. we predict that emission fromreflected/trapped external electrons will peak after that of the internalelectrons. we also find that the thin discrete pulses trap ambient electronsbut allow protons to pass through, resulting in less drag on the pulse than inthe case of trapping of both species. poynting flux dominated scenarios havebeen proposed as the driver of relativistic outflows and particle accelerationin the most powerful astrophysical jets.

astro-ph;0509373	the shock reprocessing model of electron acceleration in impulsive solar  flares	we propose a new two-stage model for acceleration of electrons in solarflares. in the first stage, electrons are accelerated stochastically in apost-reconnection turbulent downflow. the second stage is the reprocessing of asubset of these electrons as they pass through a weakly compressive fast shockabove the apex of the closed flare loop on their way to the chromosphere. wecall this the "shock reprocessing" model. the model reproduces the energydependent arrival time delays observed for both the pulsed and smoothcomponents of impulsive solar flare x-rays with physically reasonableparameters for the downflow region. the model also predicts an emission siteabove the loop-top, as seen in the masuda flare. the loop-top sourcedistinguishes the shock reprocessing model from previous models. the modelmakes testable predictions for the energy dependence of footpoint pulsestrengths and the location and spectrum of the loop-top emission, and canaccount for the observed soft-hard-soft trend in the spectral evolution offootpoint emission. our model highlights the concept that reconnection is anacceleration environment rather than a single process. which combination ofprocesses operate may depend on the initial conditions that determine, forexample, whether the reconnection downflow is turbulent. the shock reprocessingmodel comprises one such combination.

astro-ph;0509701	planetesimal growth in turbulent discs before the onset of gravitational  instability	it is difficult to imagine a planet formation model that does not at somestage include a gravitationally unstable disc. initially unstable gas-dustdiscs may form planets directly, but the high surface density required hasmotivated the alternative that gravitational instability occurs in a dustsub-layer only after grains have grown large enough by electrostatic sticking.although such growth up to the instability stage is efficient for laminardiscs, concern has mounted as to whether realistic disc turbulencecatastrophically increases the settling time, thereby requiring additionalprocesses to facilitate planet formation on the needed time scales. to evaluatethis concern, we develop a model for grain growth that accounts for theinfluence of turbulence on the collisional velocity of grains and on the scaleheight of the dust layer. the relative effect on these quantities depends onthe grain size. the model produces a disc-radius dependent time scale to reacha gravitationally unstable phase of planet formation. for a range of duststicking and disc parameters, we find that for viscosity parameters $\alpha \le10^{-3}$, this time scale is short enough over a significant range in radii $r$that turbulence does not catastrophically slow the early phases of planetformation, even in the absence of agglomeration enhancement agents likevortices.

astro-ph;0603014	outflow driven cavities: numerical simulations of intermediaries of  protostellar turbulence	we investigate the evolution of fossil cavities produced by extinct yso jetsand wide angle outflows. fossil cavities are ellipsoidal or cylindrical shellsof swept-up of ambient (molecular cloud) material moving at low velocities. thecavities form when the momentum in a yso jet or wide angle outflow decays intime allowing the bowshock or swept-up shell to decelerate to velocities nearthe turbulent speed in the cloud. it has been suggested in previous studiesthat cavities provide efficient coupling between the jets/outflows and thecloud and, as such, are the agents by which cloud turbulence is can bere-energized. in this paper we carry forward a series of numerical simulationsof jets and outflows whose momentum flux decrease in time. we comparesimulations with decaying momentum fluxes to those with constant flux. we showthat decaying flux models exhibit deceleration of the outflow head andbackfilling via expansion off of the cavity walls. they also have lower densitycontrast, are longer lived and wider than their continuously drivencounterparts. the simulations recover the basic properties of observed fossilcavities. in addition, we provide synthetic observations in terms of p-vdiagrams which demonstrate that fossil cavities form both jets and wide angleoutflows are characterized by linear "hubble-law" expansions patternssuperimposed on "spur" patterns indicative of the head of a bow shock.

astro-ph;0604221	laboratory plasma dynamos, astrophysical dynamos, and magnetic helicity  evolution	the term ``dynamo'' means different things to the laboratory fusion plasmaand astrophysical plasma communities. to alleviate the resulting confusion andto facilitate interdisciplinary progress, we pinpoint conceptual differencesand similarities between laboratory plasma dynamos and astrophysical dynamos.we can divide dynamos into three types: 1. magnetically dominated helicaldynamos which sustain a large scale magnetic field against resistive decay anddrive the magnetic geometry toward the lowest energy state, 2. flow-drivenhelical dynamos which amplify or sustain large scale magnetic fields in anotherwise turbulent flow, and 3. flow-driven nonhelical dynamos which amplifyfields on scales at or below the driving turbulence. we discuss how all threetypes occur in astrophysics whereas plasma confinement device dynamos are ofthe first type. type 3 dynamos requires no magnetic or kinetic helicity of anykind. focusing on type 1 and 2 dynamos, we show how different limits of aunified set of equations for magnetic helicity evolution reveal both types. weexplicitly describe a steady-state example of a type 1 dynamo, and threeexamples of type 2 dynamos: (i) closed volume and time dependent; (ii)steady-state with open boundaries; (iii) time dependent with open boundaries.

astro-ph;0604585	agn jet mass loading and truncation by stellar winds	active galactic nuclei can produce extremely powerful jets. while tightlycollimated, the scale of these jets and the stellar density at galactic centersimplies that there will be many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load thejet through stellar winds. previous work employed modest wind mass outflowrates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by a small numberof high mass-loss stars. we construct a framework for jet mass-loading bystellar winds for a broader spectrum of wind mass-loss rates than has beenpreviously considered. given the observed stellar mass distributions ingalactic centers, we find that even highly efficient (0.1 eddington luminosity)jets from supermassive black holes of masses $m_{bh} \la 10^4m_{\odot}$ arerapidly mass loaded and quenched by stellar winds. for $10^4m_{\odot}&lt;m_{bh}&lt;10^8 m_{\odot}$, the quenching length of highly efficient jetsis independent of the jet's mechanical luminosity. stellar wind mass-loading isunable to quench efficient jets from more massive engines, but can account forthe observed truncation of the inefficient m87 jet, and implies a baryondominated composition on scales $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet isinitially pair plasma dominated.

astro-ph;0606741	astrophysical explosions driven by a rotating, magnetized, gravitating  sphere	we present the results of a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation thatdemonstrates a mechanism by which magnetic fields tap rotational energy of astellar core and expel the envelope. our numerical setup, designed to focus onthe basic physics of the outflow mechanism, consists of a solid, gravitatingsphere, which may represent the compact core of a star, surrounded by aninitially hydrostatic envelope of ionized gas. the core is threaded by adipolar magnetic field that also permeates the envelope. at the start of thesimulation, the core begins to rotate at 10% of the escape speed. the magneticfield is sufficiently strong to drive a magneto-rotational explosion, wherebythe entire envelope is expelled, confirming the expectation of analyticalmodels. furthermore, the dipolar nature of the field results in an explosionthat is enhanced simultaneously along the rotation axis (a jet) and along themagnetic equator. while the initial condition is simplified, the simulationapproximates circumstances that may arise in astrophysical objects such as typeii supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and proto-planetary nebulae.

astro-ph;0610488	a search for molecular gas in the nucleus of m87 and implications for  the fueling of supermassive black holes	supermassive black holes in giant elliptical galaxies are remarkably faintgiven their expected accretion rates. this motivates models of radiativelyinefficient accretion, due to either ion-electron thermal decoupling,generation of outflows that inhibit accretion, or settling of gas to agravitationally unstable disk that forms stars in preference to feeding theblack hole. the latter model predicts the presence of cold molecular gas in athin disk around the black hole. here we report submillimeter arrayobservations of the nucleus of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 that probe 230ghz continuum and co(j=2--1) line emission. continuum emission is detected fromthe nucleus and several knots in the jet, including one that has beenundergoing flaring behavior. we estimate a conservative upper limit on the massof molecular gas within ~100pc and +-400km/s line of sight velocity of thecentral black hole of ~8x10^6msun, which includes an allowance for possiblesystematic errors associated with subtraction of the continuum. ignoring sucherrors, we have a 3 sigma sensitivity to about 3x10^6msun. in fact, thecontinuum-subtracted spectrum shows weak emission features extending up to 4sigma above the rms dispersion of the line-free channels. these may beartifacts of the continuum subtraction process. alternatively, if they areinterpreted as co emission, then the implied molecular gas mass is ~5x10^6msunspread out over a velocity range of 700km/s. these constraints on molecular gasmass are close to the predictions of the model of self-gravitating,star-forming accretion disks fed by bondi accretion (tan &amp; blackman 2005).

astro-ph;9601142	can the formation of x-ray obscuring tori and jets in active galaxies be  determined by one parameter?	a torus of reduced differential rotation can form in the inner $\siml 10$pccore of active galactic nuclei incurring a density enhancement that can accountfor obscuration of x-rays in seyferts when the initial inner core to black holemass ratio $\gsim 50$. the same density enhancement and reduction indifferential rotation can also lead to dynamo growth of poloidal fields whichattain a magnitude $\sim 10^4$g when accreted onto the central engine. as radiojet models often employ poloidal fields as agents in extracting power for thejet luminosity, we suggest that jetted agn might require this poloidal fieldproduction. although the poloidal field would be originally produced in theobscuring torus, jetted objects are less likely to have obscuring tori: thepoloidal field would only aid in powering jet emission after it accretes withthe torus matter to the central engine. thus, only during the relatively shorttorus accretion time scale could there be both a jet and and torus.

astro-ph;9704239	distinguishing solar flare types by differences in reconnection regions	observations show that magnetic reconnection and its slow shocks occur insolar flares. the basic magnetic structures are similar for long duration event(lde) flares and faster compact impulsive (ci) flares, but the former requireless non-thermal electrons than the latter. slow shocks can produce therequired non-thermal electron spectrum for ci flares by fermi acceleration ifelectrons are injected with large enough energies to resonate with scatteringwaves. the dissipation region may provide the injection electrons, so theoverall number of non-thermal electrons reaching the footpoints would depend onthe size of the dissipation region and its distance from the chromosphere. inthis picture, the lde flares have converging inflows toward a dissipationregion that spans a smaller overall length fraction than for ci flares. brightloop-top x-ray spots in some ci flares can be attributed to particle trappingat fast shocks in the downstream flow, the presence of which is determined bythe angle of the inflow field and velocity to the slow shocks.

astro-ph;9704268	formation of millisecond pulsars from accretion induced collapse and  constraints on pulsar gamma ray burst models	we study accretion induced collapse of magnetized white dwarfs as an originof millisecond pulsars. we apply magnetized accretion disk models to thepre-collapse accreting magnetic white dwarfs and calculate the white dwarf spinevolution. if the pulsar magnetic field results solely from the flux-frozenfossil white dwarf field, a typical millisecond pulsar is born with a fieldstrength $\sim 10^{11}-10^{12}g$. the uncertainty in the field strength ismainly due to the uncertain physical parameters of the magnetized accretiondisk models. a simple correlation between the pulsar spin $\omega_*$ and themagnetic field $b_*$, $(\omega_*/10^4s^{-1})\sim (b_{*}/10^{11}g)^{-4/5}$, isderived for a typical accretion rate $\sim 5\times 10^{-8}m_{\sun}/yr$. thiscorrelation remains valid for a wide pre-collapse physical conditions unlessthe white dwarf spin and the binary orbit are synchronized prior to accretioninduced collapse. we critically examine the possibility of spin-orbitsynchronization in close binary systems. using idealized homogeneous ellipsoidmodels, we compute the electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission from themillisecond pulsars and find that electromagnetic dipole emission remainsnearly constant while millisecond pulsars may spin up rather than spin down asa result of gravitational wave emission. we also derive the physical conditionsunder which electromagnetic emission from millisecond pulsars formed byaccretion induced collapse can be a source of cosmological gamma-ray bursts. wefind that relativistic beaming of gamma-ray emission and precession ofgamma-ray emitting jets are required unless the dipole magnetic field strengthsare $&gt;10^{15}$g; such strong dipole fields are in excess of those allowed fromthe accretion induced collapse formation process except in spin-orbitsynchronization.

astro-ph;9710137	on proton energization in accretion flows	two-temperature advection dominated accretion flow (adaf) or hot ion tori(hit) models help explain low luminosity stellar and galactic accreting sourcesand may complement observational support for black holes in nature. but lowradiative efficiencies demand that ions receive a fraction $\eta \gsim 99%$ ofenergy dissipated in the turbulent accretion. the $\eta$ depends on the ratioof particle to magnetic pressure. if compressive modes of dissipation, likemagnetic mirroring, dominate incompressible modes, then even when the pressureratio is o(1), the required large $\eta$ can be attained. however the relativeimportance of compressive vs. incompressible modes is hard to estimate. thelarger up in the turbulent cascade, the more compressible the turbulence. therelevant length scale for particle energization can be determined by equatingthe dominant eddy turnover time to the time for which an energy equal to thatin the turbulence can be drained. based on the large scales resulting from thisestimate, it is suggested that compressive mirroring may be important. also,regardless of the precise $\eta$ or dissipation mechanism, non-thermal protonsseem natural in two- temperature discs because all dissipation mechanisms, andthe use of an isotopic pressure, require wave-particle resonances that operateonly on a subset of the particles. finally, it is briefly mentioned howmirroring may help to generate an adaf or hit in the first place.

astro-ph;9710149	an explanation for the bimodal distribution of gamma-ray bursts:  millisecond pulsars from accretion-induced collapse	cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) could be driven by dissipation of pureelectromagnetic energy (poynting flux) extracted from rapidly rotating compactobjects with strong magnetic fields. one such possibility is a youngmillisecond pulsar (msp) formed from accretion-induced collapse (aic) of awhite dwarf. the combination of an efficient magnetic dynamo, likely operatingduring the first seconds of the initially hot and turbulent msp interior, andthe subsequent modest beaming of gamma-ray emitting outflows, would easilyaccount for energy constraints. but the remarkable feature of such models isthat they may naturally explain the hitherto unexplained bimodal distributionin grb time durations. the two burst classes could correspond to msps that formspinning above and below a gravitationally unstable limit respectively. in theformer case, the spin-down time scale is due to gravitational radiationemission ($&lt;1s$) while the spin-down time scale of the latter is due toelectromagnetic dipole emission ($\gg 1s$). these two time scales account forthe short and long grb durations, i.e. the observed bimodal grb durationdistribution. a natural prediction is that the short duration grbs would beaccompanied by strong gravitational radiation emission which is absent from thelonger class. both would show millisecond variabilities.

astro-ph;9802017	on fueling gamma-ray bursts and their afterglows with pulsars	cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and their afterglows seem to result fromdissipation of bulk energy in relativistic outflows, but their engine has notbeen unambiguously identified. the engine could be a young pulsar formed fromaccretion induced collapse with a dynamo amplified field. elsewhere, we suggestthat such a ``usov type'' strong field pulsar may help explain the bimodaldistribution in grb durations. here we discuss possible roles of a pulsar forthe afterglow. we derive the expected bolometric luminosity decay. theextracted rotational energy could dissipate by shocks or by large amplitudeelectromagnetic waves (laemw). the simplest laemw approach predicts a slowerdecay in observed afterglow peak frequency and faster decay in flux than thesimplest blast-wave model, though more complicated models of both can providedifferent dependences. laemw do not require the rapid magnetic fieldamplification demanded of the blast-wave approach because the emissionoriginates from a nearly fixed radius. different time dependent behavior of grband post-grb emission is also predicted. observational evidence for a pulsar ina grb would make some grb engine models, such as neutron star mergers and blackholes unlikely. therefore, the question of whether a pulsar is present is animportant one even if it could drive a canonical fireball.

astro-ph;9804266	variability associated with alpha accretion disc theory for standard and  advection dominated discs	the $\alpha$ turbulent viscosity formalism for accretion discs must beinterpreted as a mean field theory. the extent to which the disc scale exceedsthat of the turbulence determines the precision of the predicted luminosity$l_\nu$. the assumption of turbulence and use of $\a$ implies: (1) field linestretching generates a magnetic pressure $\gsim \a^2/6$ of the total pressuregenerally, and a 1 to 1 relation between $\a$ and the pressure ratio whenshearing instabilities dominate the viscosity. (2) large eddy sizes and speedsin typical advection dominated accretion flows (adafs) lead to a lowerprecision in $l_\nu$ than for thin discs of a given total observation durationand central mass. the allowed variability (relative precision) at a particularfrequency increases (decreases) with the size of the contributing region. forx-ray binary type adafs, the allowed variability is $\sim 5$% at $r \le 1000$schwarzchild radii for averages over $\gsim 1000$sec. but for large galacticnuclei like ngc 4258 and m87, the relative precision error can approach$50-100%$ even at $r \le 100 r_s$ for currently available observationdurations. more data are then required to compare with adaf predictions.

astro-ph;9810345	nonlinear alpha effect in dynamo theory	we extend the standard two-scale theory of the turbulent dynamo coefficient$\alpha$ to include the nonlinear back reaction of the mean field $\bar b$ onthe turbulence. we calculate the turbulent emf as a power series in $\bar b$,assuming that the base state of the turbulence ($\bar b=0$) is isotropic, and,for simplicity, that the magnetic diffusivity equals the kinematic viscosity.the power series converges for all $\bar b$, and for the special case that thespectrum of the turbulence is sharply peaked in $k$, our result is proportionalto a tabulated function of the magnetic reynolds number $r_m$ and the ratio$\beta$ of $\bar b$ (in velocity units) to the rms turbulent velocity $v_0$.for $\beta\to 0$ (linear regime) we recover the results of steenbeck et al.(1966) as modified by pouquet et al. (1976). for $r_m\gg 1$, the usualastrophysical case, $\alpha$ starts to decrease at $\beta \sim 1$, droppinglike $\beta^{-2}$ as $\beta \to \infty$. hence for large $r_m$, $\alpha$saturates at $\bar b\sim v_0$, as estimated by kraichnan (1979), rather than at$\bar b\sim r^{-1/2}_mv_0$, as inferred by cattaneo and hughes (1996) fromtheir numerical simulations at $r_m$=100. we plan to carry out simulations withvarious values of $r_m$ to investigate the discrepency.

astro-ph;9901098	resolution of an ambiguity in dynamo theory and its consequences for  back reaction studies	an unsolved problem in turbulent dynamo theory is the ``back reaction''problem: to what degree does the mean magnetic field suppress the turbulentdynamo coefficients which are needed to drive its growth? the answer willultimately derive from a combination of numerical and analytical studies. herewe show that analytic approaches to the dynamo and back reaction problemsrequire one to separate turbulent quantities into two components: thoseinfluenced by the mean field (which are therefore anisotropic) and thoseindependent of the mean field (and are therefore isotropic), no matter how weakthe mean field is. upon revising the standard formalism to meet thisrequirement, we find that: (1) the two types of components often appear in thesame equation, so that standard treatments, which do not distinguish betweenthem, are ambiguous. (2) the usual first-order smoothing approximation that isnecessary to make progress in the standard treatment is unnecessary when thedistinction is made. (3) in contrast to previous suggestions, the correction tothe dynamo $\a$ coefficient found by pouquet et al (1976) is actuallyindependent of the mean field, and therefore cannot be interpreted as aquenching.

astro-ph;9901216	concave accretion discs and x-ray reprocessing	spectra of seyfert is are commonly modelled as emission from an x-rayilluminated flat accretion disc orbiting a central black hole. this providesboth a reprocessed and direct component of the x-ray emission as required byobservations of individual objects and possibly a fraction of the cosmologicalx-ray background. there is some observational motivation to at least considerthe role that an effectively concave disc surface might play: (1) a reprocessedfraction $\gsim 1/2$ in some seyferts and possibly in the x-ray background, and(2) the commonality of a sharp iron line peak for seyferts at 6.4kev despite adependence of peak location on inclination angle for flat disc models. here itis shown that a concave disc may not only provide a larger total fraction ofreprocessed photons, but can also reprocess a much larger fraction of photonsin its outer regions when compared to a flat disc. this reduces the sensitivityof the 6.4kev peak location to the inner disc inclination angle because theouter regions are less affected by doppler and gravitational effects. if thex-ray source is isotropic, the reprocessed fraction is directly determined bythe concavity. if the x-ray source is anisotropic, the location of iron linepeak can still be determined by concavity but the total reflected fraction neednot be as large as for the isotropic emitter case. the geometric calculationsherein are applicable to general accretion disc systems illuminated from thecenter.

astro-ph;9903384	constraints on the magnitude of alpha in dynamo theory	we consider the backreaction of the magnetic field on the magnetic dynamocoefficients and the role of boundary conditions in interpreting whethernumerical evidence for suppression is dynamical. if a uniform field in aperiodic box serves as the initial condition for modeling the backreaction onthe turbulent emf, then the magnitude of the turbulent emf and thus the dynamocoefficient $\a$, have a stringent upper limit that depends on the magneticreynolds number $r_m$ to a power of order -1. this is not a dynamic suppressionbut results just because of the imposed boundary conditions. in contrast, whenmean field gradients are allowed within the simulation region, or non-periodicboundary are used, the upper limit is independent of $r_m$ and takes itskinematic value. thus only for simulations of the latter types could a measuredsuppression be the result of a dynamic backreaction. this is fundamental forunderstanding a long-standing controversy surrounding $\alpha$ suppression.numerical simulations which do not allow any field gradients and invokeperiodic boundary conditions appear to show a strong $\alpha$ suppression (e.g.cattaneo &amp; hughes 1996). simulations of accretion discs which allow fieldgradients and allow free boundary conditions (brandenburg &amp; donner 1997)suggest a dynamo $\alpha$ which is not suppressed by a power of $r_m$. ourresults are consistent with both types of simulations.

astro-ph;9907061	mean magnetic field generation in sheared rotators	a generalized mean magnetic field induction equation for differentialrotators is derived, including a compressibility, and the anisotropy induced onthe turbulent quantities from the mean magnetic field itself and a meanvelocity shear. derivations of the mean field equations often do not emphasizethat there must be anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the turbulence for meanfield growth. the anisotropy from shear is the source of a term involving theproduct of the mean velocity gradient and the cross-helicity correlation of theisotropic parts of the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field,$\lb{\bfv}\cdot{\bfb}\rb^{(0)}$. the full mean field equations are derived tolinear order in mean fields, but it is also shown that the cross-helicity termsurvives to all orders in the velocity shear. this cross-helicity term canobviate the need for a pre-existing seed mean magnetic field for mean fieldgrowth: though a fluctuating seed field is necessary for a non-vanishingcross-helicity, the term can produce linear (in time) mean field growth of thetoroidal field from zero mean field. after one vertical diffusion time, thecross-helicity term becomes sub-dominant and dynamo exponentialamplification/sustenance of the mean field can subsequently ensue. thecross-helicity term should produce odd symmetry in the mean magnetic field, incontrast to the usually favored even modes of the dynamo amplification insheared discs. this may be important for the observed mean field geometries ofspiral galaxies. the strength of the mean seed field provided by the cross-helicity depends linearly on the magnitude of the cross-helicity.

astro-ph;9912459	coronal activity as a consequence of dynamos in astrophysical rotators	we show that the presence of a steady $\ao$ dynamo in astrophysical rotatorslikely leads to an outflow of relative magnetic helicity and thus magneticenergy available for particle acceleration in a corona. the connection betweenenergy and magnetic helicity arises because the generation of large scale fieldis linked to a generation of large scale magnetic helicity. in a steady state,the relative magnetic helicity associated with the large scale field canescape, accompanied by an equal and opposite small scale contribution from thefield, since the total magnetic helicity in large magnetic reynolds numberflows is conserved. from the helicity flow, a lower limit on the magneticenergy deposited in the corona can be estimated. steady coronal activity andthe dissipation of magnetic energy is therefore a signature of an internaldynamo. our theoretical estimate of the power delivered by a mean field dynamois consistent with that inferred from observations to be delivered to the solarcorona, the galactic corona, and seyfert i agn coronae.
