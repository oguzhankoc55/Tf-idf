0902.1188	the greater impact of mergers on the growth of massive galaxies:  implications for mass assembly and evolution since z~1	using deep infrared observations conducted with the moircs on the subarutelescope in goods-n combined with public surveys in goods-s, we investigatethe dependence on stellar mass, m_*, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction(5 kpc &lt; r &lt; 20 kpc) and implied merger rate. in common with some recentstudies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in majormergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift toz~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \pm 1.6}. our key finding is that massive galaxies withm_* &gt; 1e11 msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massivesystems (m_* ~ 1e10 msun). we find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectationsbased on clustering at small scales. so-called "dry" mergers between early-typegalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with m_* &gt; 3e10 msun at z~0.5, butless than 30% at z~1. this result can be explained by the increasing abundanceof red, early-type galaxies at these masses. we compare the volumetric mergerrate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxyevolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation ofspheroidal galaxies since z~1. in terms of mass assembly, major mergerscontribute little to galaxy growth below m_* ~ 3e10 msun but are moresignificant among galaxies with m_* &gt; 1e11 msun, 30% of which have undergonemostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. overall, the relativelymore rapid coalescence of high mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchicalgrowth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if thedownsizing of star formation and morphological evolution involves additionalphysical processes.

0902.4240	measuring the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust correlations through  magnification and reddening	we present a simultaneous detection of gravitational magnification and dustreddening effects due to galactic halos and large-scale structure. themeasurement is based on correlating the brightness of ~85,000 quasars at z&gt;1with the position of 20 million galaxies at z~0.3 derived from the sloandigital sky survey and is used to constrain the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dustcorrelation functions up to cosmological scales.  the presence of dust is detected from 20 kpc to several mpc, and we find itsprojected density to follow: sigma_dust ~ theta^-0.8, a distribution similar tomass. the amount of dust in galactic halos is found to be comparable to that indisks. on large scales its wavelength dependence is described by r_v=3.9+/-2.6,consistent with interstellar dust. we estimate the resulting opacity of theuniverse as a function of redshift and find a_v~0.03 mag up to z=0.5. this, inturn, implies a cosmic dust density of omega_dust ~ 5x10^-6, roughly half ofwhich comes from dust in halos of ~l* galaxies.  we present magnification measurements, corrected for dust extinction, fromwhich the galaxy-mass correlation function is inferred. the mean mass profilearound galaxies is found to be sigma ~ 30 (theta/arcmin)^-0.8 h m_sun/pc^2 upto a radius of 10 mpc, in agreement with gravitational shear estimates.

0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

1002.3701	photometric response functions of the sdss imager	the monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situmeasurements of the response function of the mosaicked ccd imager used in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). the system is outlined and the results of themeasurements, mostly during the first 6 years of the sdss, are described. wepresent the reference response functions for the five colour passbands derivedfrom these measurements, and discuss column to column variations and variationsin time, and also their effects on photometry. we also discuss the effectarising from various, slightly different response functions of the associateddetector systems that were used to give sdss photometry. we show that thecalibration procedures of sdss remove these variations reasonably well with theresulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to belarger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of thesurvey. the considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the responsefunction showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength sideduring the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error inphotometry. the aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumentalsensitivity in u-band, which is calibrated out. the expected colour variationis consistent with measured colour variation in the catalog of repeatedphotometry. the colour variation is delta (u-g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and atmost delta (u-g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colours. we verified in thefinal catalogue that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag aredetected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonaleffects except for the secular u-g colour variation for stars with extremecolours.

1008.0510	characterisation of sloan digital sky survey stellar photometry	we study the photometric properties of stars in the data archive of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), the prime aim being to understand the photometriccalibration over the entire data set. it is confirmed that the photometriccalibration for point sources has been made overall tightly against the sdssstandard stars. we have also confirmed that photometric synthesis of the sdssspectrophotometric data gives broad band fluxes that agree with broad bandphotometry with errors no more than 0.04 mag and little tilt along the widerange of colours, verifying that the response functions of the sdss 2.5 mtelescope system are well characterised. we locate stars in the sdssphotometric system, so that stars can roughly be classified into spectralclasses from the colour information. we show how metallicity and surfacegravity affect colours, and that stars contained in the sdss general catalogue,plotted in colour space, show the distribution that matches well with what isanticipated from the variations of metallicity and surface gravity. thecolour-colour plots are perfectly consistent among the three samples, stars inthe sdss general catalogue, sdss standard stars and spectrophotometric stars ofgunn &amp; stryker, especially when some considerations are taken into account ofthe differences (primarily metallicity) of the samples. we show that the g-r -inverse temperature relation is tight and can be used as a good estimator ofthe effective temperature of stars over a fairly wide range of effectivetemperatures. we also confirm that the colours of g2v stars in the sdssphotometric system match well with the sun.

1011.4796	microwave emission from the edgeworth-kuiper belt and the asteroid belt  constrained from wmap	objects in the edgeworth-kuiper belt and the main asteroid belt should emitmicrowaves that may give rise to extra anisotropy signals in the multipole ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiment. constraints are derived fromthe absence of positive detection of such anisotropies for ell &lt; 50, giving thetotal mass of edgeworth-kuiper belt objects to be smaller than 0.2 earth mass.this limit is consistent with the mass extrapolated from the observablepopulation with the size of a &gt; 15 km, assuming that the small-objectpopulation follows the power law in size dn/da ~ a^{-q} with the canonicalindex expected for collisional equilibrium, q ~ 3.5, with which 23% of the massis ascribed to objects smaller than are observationally accessible down tograins. a similar argument applied to the main asteroid belt indicates that thegrain population should not increase faster than q ~ 3.6 towards smaller radii,if it follows the power law continued to observed asteroids with larger radii.it is underlined that both cases are at or only slightly above the limit thatcan be physically significant, implying the importance of tightening furtherthe cmb anisotropy limit, which may be attained with the observation at higherradio frequencies.

0709.1153	cross-correlation weak lensing of sdss galaxy clusters i: measurements	this is the first in a series of papers on the weak lensing effect caused byclusters of galaxies in sloan digital sky survey. the photometrically selectedcluster sample, known as maxbcg, includes ~130,000 objects between redshift 0.1and 0.3, ranging in size from small groups to massive clusters. we split theclusters into bins of richness and luminosity and stack the surface densitycontrast to produce mean radial profiles. the mean profiles are detected over arange of scales, from the inner halo (25 kpc/h) well into the surrounding largescale structure (30 mpc/h), with a significance of 15 to 20 in each bin. thesignal over this large range of scales is best interpreted in terms of thecluster-mass cross-correlation function. we pay careful attention to sources ofsystematic error, correcting for them where possible. the resulting signals arecalibrated to the ~10% level, with the dominant remaining uncertainty being theredshift distribution of the background sources. we find that the profilesscale strongly with richness and luminosity. we find the signal within a givenrichness bin depends upon luminosity, suggesting that luminosity is moreclosely correlated with mass than galaxy counts. we split the samples byredshift but detect no significant evolution. the profiles are not welldescribed by power laws. in a subsequent series of papers we invert theprofiles to three-dimensional mass profiles, show that they are well fit by ahalo model description, measure mass-to-light ratios and provide a cosmologicalinterpretation.

1111.4985	milky way tomography iv: dissecting dust	we use sdss photometry of 73 million stars to simultaneously obtain best-fitmain-sequence stellar energy distribution (sed) and amount of dust extinctionalong the line of sight towards each star. using a subsample of 23 millionstars with 2mass photometry, whose addition enables more robust results, weshow that sdss photometry alone is sufficient to break degeneracies betweenintrinsic stellar color and dust amount when the shape of extinction curve isfixed. when using both sdss and 2mass photometry, the ratio of the total toselective absorption, $r_v$, can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.1for most stars in high-extinction regions. these fits enable detailed studiesof the dust properties and its spatial distribution, and of the stellar spatialdistribution at low galactic latitudes. our results are in good agreement withthe extinction normalization given by the schlegel et al. (1998, sfd) dust mapsat high northern galactic latitudes, but indicate that the sfd extinction mapappears to be consistently overestimated by about 20% in the southern sky, inagreement with schlafly et al. (2010). the constraints on the shape of the dustextinction curve across the sdss and 2mass bandpasses support the models byfitzpatrick (1999) and cardelli et al. (1989). for the latter, we find an$r_v=3.0\pm0.1$(random) $\pm0.1$(systematic) over most of the high-latitudesky. at low galactic latitudes (|b|&lt;5), we demonstrate that the sfd map cannotbe reliably used to correct for extinction as most stars are embedded in dust,rather than behind it. we introduce a method for efficient selection ofcandidate red giant stars in the disk, dubbed "dusty parallax relation", whichutilizes a correlation between distance and the extinction along the line ofsight. we make these best-fit parameters, as well as all the input sdss and2mass data, publicly available in a user-friendly format.

1203.1088	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. vi. constraints on dark  energy and the evolution of massive galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the final lens sample from the sloandigital sky survey quasar lens search (sqls). the number distribution of acomplete subsample of 19 lensed quasars selected from 50,836 source quasars iscompared with theoretical expectations, with particular attention to theselection function. assuming that the velocity function of galaxies does notevolve with redshift, the sqls sample constrains the cosmological constant to\omega_\lambda=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07}(stat.)^{+0.06}_{-0.06}(syst.) for a flatuniverse. the dark energy equation of state is found to be consistent with w=-1when the sqls is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) measurements or results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). we also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters andredshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence forredshift evolution at z&lt;1 in any combinations of constraints. for instance,number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and thevelocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrainedto \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectivelywhen the sqls result is combined with bao and wmap for flat models with acosmological constant. we find that a significant amount of dark energy ispreferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmicexpansion.

1204.1978	cosmic dust in mgii absorbers	mgii absorbers induce reddening on background quasars. we measure this effectand infer the cosmic density of dust residing in these systems to be \omega\ ~2e-6, in units of the critical density of the universe, which is comparable tothe amount of dust found in galactic disks or about half the amount inferred toexist outside galaxies. we also estimate the neutral hydrogen abundance in mgiiclouds to be \omega\ ~ 1.5e-4, which is approximately 5% of hydrogen in starsin galaxies. this implies a dust-to-gas mass ratio for mgii clouds of about1/100, which is similar to the value for normal galaxies. this would supportthe hypothesis of the outflow origin of mgii clouds, which are intrinsicallydevoid of stars and hence have no sources of dust. considerations of the dustabundance imply that the presence of mgii absorbers around galaxies lastseffectively for a few gyr. high redshift absorbers allow us to measure therest-frame extinction curve to 900 angstroms at which the absorption by thelyman edge dominates over scattering by dust in the extinction opacity.

1301.4024	properties of dust grains probed with extinction curves	modern data of the extinction curve from the ultraviolet to the near infraredare revisited to study the property of dust grains in the milky way (mw) andthe small magellanic cloud (smc). we confirm that the graphite-silicate mixtureof grains yields the observed extinction curve with the simple power-lawdistribution of the grain size but with a cutoff at some maximal size: theparameters are tightly constrained to be $q = 3.5 \pm 0.2$ for the sizedistribution $a^{-q}$ and the maximum radius $a_{max} = 0.24 \pm 0.05$ um, forboth mw and smc. the abundance of grains, and hence the elemental abundance, isconstrained from the reddening versus hydrogen column density, e(b-v)/n_h. ifwe take the solar elemental abundance as the standard for the mw, &gt;56 % ofcarbon should be in graphite dust, while it is &lt;40 % in the smc using itsavailable abundance estimate. this disparity and the relative abundance of c tosi explain the difference of the two curves. we find that 50-60 % of carbon maynot necessarily be in graphite but in the amorphous or the glassy phase. ironmay also be in the metallic phase or up to ~80 % in magnetite rather than insilicates, so that the mg/fe ratio in astronomical olivine is arbitrary. withthese substitutions the parameters of the grain size remain unchanged. the massdensity of dust grains relative to hydrogen is $\rho_{dust}/\rho_h = 1/(120{+10 \atop -16})$ for the mw and $1/(760 {+70 \atop -90}) for the smc undersome abundance constraints. we underline the importance of thewavelength-dependence slope of the extinction curve in the near infrared inconstructing the dust model: if $a_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{-gamma}$ withgamma ~ 1.6, the power-law grain-size model fails, whereas it works if gamma ~1.8-2.0.

1403.4339	the nature of damped lyman-{\alpha} and mgii absorbers explored with  their dust contents	we estimate the abundance of dust in damped lyman-{\alpha} absorbers (dlas)by statistically measuring the excess reddening they induce on their backgroundquasars. we detect systematic reddening behind dla consistent with the smc typereddening curve, but it is inconsistent with the milky way type reddening. wefind that the derived dust-to-gas ratio is, on average, inversely proportionalto the column density of neutral hydrogen, implying that the amount of dust isconstant, irrespective of the column density of hydrogen. it means that theaverage metallicity is inversely proportional to the column density ofhydrogen, unless the average dust-to-metal ratio varies with the hydrogencolumn density. this indicates that the prime origin of metals seen in dlas isnot by in situ star formation, with which z ~ n_{hi}^{0.4} is expected from theempirical star formation law, contrary to our observation. we interpret themetals observed in absorbers being deposited dominantly from nearby galaxies bygalactic winds ubiquitous in intergalactic space. when extrapolating therelation between dust-to-gas ratio and hi column density to lower columndensity, we find a value which is consistent with what is observed for mg iiabsorbers.

0804.4516	luminosity function constraints on the evolution of massive red galaxies  since z~0.9	we measure the evolution of the luminous red galaxy (lrg) luminosity functionin the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.9 using samples of galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey as well as new spectroscopy of high-redshift massive redgalaxies. our high-redshift sample of galaxies is largest spectroscopic sampleof massive red galaxies at z~0.9 collected to date and covers 7 square deg,minimizing the impact of large scale structure on our results. we find that thelrg population has evolved little beyond the passive fading of its stellarpopulations since z~0.9. based on our luminosity function measurements andassuming a non-evolving salpeter stellar initial mass function, we find thatthe most massive (l&gt;3l*) red galaxies have grown by less than 50% (at 99%confidence), since z=0.9, in stark contrast to the factor of 2-4 growthobserved in the l* red galaxy population over the same epoch. we alsoinvestigate the evolution of the average lrg spectrum since z~0.9 and find thehigh-redshift composite to be well-described as a passively evolving example ofthe composite galaxy observed at low-redshift. from spectral fits to thecomposite spectra, we find at most 5% of the stellar mass in massive redgalaxies may have formed within 1gyr of z=0.9. while l* red galaxies areclearly assembled at z&lt;1, 3l* galaxies appear to be largely in place and evolvelittle beyond the passive evolution of their stellar populations over the lasthalf of cosmic history.

astro-ph;0006436	cmb observables and their cosmological implications	we show that recent measurements of the power spectrum of cosmic microwavebackground anisotropies by boomerang and maxima can be characterized by fourobservables, the position of the first acoustic peak l_1= 206 pm 6, the heightof the first peak relative to cobe normalization h_1= 7.6 pm 1.4, the height ofthe second peak relative to the first h_2 = 0.38 pm 0.04, and the height of thethird peak relative to the first h_3 = 0.43 pm 0.07. this phenomenologicalrepresentation of the measurements complements more detailed likelihoodanalyses in multidimensional parameter space, clarifying the dependence onprior assumptions and the specific aspects of the data leading to theconstraints. we illustrate their use in the flat lcdm family of models, wherewe find omega_m h^{3.8} &gt; 0.079 (or nearly equivalently, the age of theuniverse t_0 &lt; 13-14 gyr) from l_1 and a baryon density omega_b h^2 &gt; 0.019, amatter density omega_m h^2 &lt; 0.42 and tilt n&gt;0.85 from the peak heights (95%cl). with the aid of several external constraints, notably nucleosynthesis, theage of the universe and the cluster abundance and baryon fraction, we constructthe allowed region in the (omega_m,h) plane; it points to high h (0.6&lt; h &lt; 0.9)and moderate omega_m (0.25 &lt; omega_m &lt; 0.6).

astro-ph;0008401	discovery of a close pair of z = 4.25 quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we report the discovery of a pair of z = 4.25 quasars with a separation of 33arcseconds. the brighter of the two objects was identified as a high-redshiftquasar candidate from sloan digital sky survey multicolor imaging data, and theredshift was measured from a spectrum obtained with the hobby-eberly telescope.the slit orientation of this observation {\it by chance} included anotherquasar, approximately one magnitude fainter and having the same redshift as thetarget. this is the third serendipitous discovery of a z &gt; 4 quasar. thedifferences in the relative strengths and profiles of the emission linessuggest that this is a quasar pair and not a gravitational lens. the twoobjects are likely to be physically associated; the projected physicalseparation is approximately 210 $h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc and the redshifts areidentical to $\approx$ 0.01, implying a radial physical separation of 950$h_{50}^{-1}$ kpc or less. the existence of this pair is strong circumstantialevidence that $z \sim 4$ quasars are clustered.

astro-ph;0011472	star formation history and stellar metallicity distribution in a cold  dark matter universe	we study star formation history and stellar metallicity distribution ingalaxies in a lambda cold dark matter universe using a hydrodynamiccosmological simulation. our model predicts star formation rate declining intime exponentially from an early epoch to the present with the time-scale of 6gyr, which is consistent with the empirical madau plot with modest dustobscuration. star formation in l^* galaxies continues intermittently to thepresent also with an exponentially declining rate of a similar time-scale,whereas in small galaxies star formation ceases at an early epoch. the mean ageof the extant stars decreases only slowly with increasing redshift, and exceeds1 gyr at z=3. normal galaxies contain stars with a wide range of metallicityand age: stars formed at z&lt;1 have metallicity of 0.1-1.0 zsun, while old starstake a wide range of values from 10^{-6} zsun to 3.0 zsun. the mean metallicityof normal galaxies is in the range 0.1-1.0 zsun. dwarf galaxies that containonly old stars have a wide range of mean metallicity (10^{-4}-1.0 zsun), but onaverage they are metal deficient compared with normal galaxies.

astro-ph;0102180	evolution of the luminosity function and colors of galaxies in a  lambda-cdm universe	the luminosity function of galaxies is derived from a cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulation of a lambda cold dark matter (cdm) universe with theaid of a stellar population synthesis model. at z=0, the resulting b bandluminosity function has a flat faint end slope of \alpha \approx -1.15 with thecharacteristic luminosity and the normalization in a fair agreement withobservations, while the dark matter halo mass function is steep with a slope of\alpha \approx -2. the colour distribution of galaxies also agrees well withlocal observations. we also discuss the evolution of the luminosity function,and the colour distribution of galaxies from z=0 to 5. a large evolution of thecharacteristic mass in the stellar mass function due to number evolution iscompensated by luminosity evolution; the characteristic luminosity increasesonly by 0.8 mag from z=0 to 2, and then declines towards higher redshift, whilethe b band luminosity density continues to increase from z=0 to 5 (but onlyslowly at z&gt;3).

astro-ph;0105545	galaxy number counts from the sloan digital sky survey commissioning  data	we present bright galaxy number counts in five broad bands ($u', g', r', i',z'$) from imaging data taken during the commissioning phase of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the counts are derived from two independent stripesof imaging scans along the celestial equator, one each toward the north and thesouth galactic cap, covering about 230 and 210 square degrees, respectively. acareful study is made to verify the reliability of the photometric catalog. forgalaxies brighter than $r^* = 16$, the catalog produced by automated softwareis examined against eye inspection of all objects. statistically meaningfulresults on the galaxy counts are obtained in the magnitude range $12 \le r^*\le 21$, using a sample of 900,000 galaxies. the counts from the two stripesdiffer by about 30% at magnitudes brighter than $r^*= 15.5$, consistent with alocal $2\sigma$ fluctuation due to large scale structure in the galaxydistribution. the shape of the number counts-magnitude relation brighter than$r^* = 16$ is well characterized by $n \propto 10^{0.6m}$, the relationexpected for a homogeneous galaxy distribution in a ``euclidean'' universe. inthe magnitude range $ 16 &lt; r^* &lt; 21$, the galaxy counts from both stripes agreevery well, and follow the prediction of the no-evolution model, although thedata do not exclude a small amount of evolution. we use empirically determinedcolor transformations to derive the galaxy number counts in the $b$ and$i_{814}$ bands. we compute the luminosity density of the universe at zeroredshift in the five sdss bands and in the $b$ band. we find ${\cal l}_{b} =2.4 \pm 0.4 \times 10^8l_\odot h $mpc$^{-3}$, for a reasonably wide range ofparameters of the schechter luminosity function in the $b$ band.

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0204383	dynamical confirmation of sdss weak lensing scaling laws	galaxy masses can be estimated by a variety of methods; each applicable indifferent circumstances, and each suffering from different systematicuncertainties. confirmation of results obtained by one technique with analysisby another is particularly important. recent sdss weak lensing measurements ofthe projected-mass correlation function reveal a linear relation between galaxyluminosities and the depth of their dark matter halos (measured on 260 \hinvkpc scales). in this work we use an entirely independent dynamical method toconfirm these results. we begin by assembling a sample of 618 relativelyisolated host galaxies, surrounded by a total of 1225 substantially faintersatellites. we observe the mean dynamical effect of these hosts on the motionsof their satellites by assembling velocity difference histograms. dividing thesample by host properties, we find significant variations in satellite velocitydispersion with host luminosity. we quantify these variations using a simpledynamical model, measuring \mtsd a dynamical mass within 260 \hinv kpc. theappropriateness of this mass reconstruction is checked by conducting a similaranalysis within an n-body simulation. comparison between the dynamical andlensing mass-to-light scalings shows reasonable agreement, providing somequantitative confirmation for the lensing results.

astro-ph;0205243	estimating fixed frame galaxy magnitudes in the sdss	broad-band measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measuredifferent regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. certain astronomicalquestions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies,require transforming these magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. toprepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail insubsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (seds) to broad bandphotometric observations, in the context of the optical observations of thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). linear combinations of four spectral templatescan reproduce the five sdss magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of thephotometry. expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of thecoefficients multiplying the templates is planar, and in fact nearly linear.the resulting reconstructed seds can be used to recover fixed frame magnitudesover a range of redshifts. this process yields consistent results, in the sensethat within each sample the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies arenearly constant with redshift. we compare our results to simpler interpolationmethods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the sdss. the software that generatesthese results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide rangeof galaxy observations.

astro-ph;0210215	the galaxy luminosity function and luminosity density at redshift z=0.1	using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in fiveoptical bandpasses corresponding to the sdss bandpasses shifted to match theirrestframe shape at z=0.1. we denote the bands {0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r},{0.1}{i}, {0.1}{z}, with \lambda_{eff} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111]angstroms respectively. we use a maximum likelihood method which allows for ageneral form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity andnumber evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the fluxlimits of the survey. we find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute abmagnitudes in a mpc^3 of [-14.10 \pm 0.15, -15.18 \pm 0.03, -15.90 \pm 0.03,-16.24 \pm 0.03, -16.56 \pm 0.02] in [{0.1}{u}, {0.1}{g}, {0.1}{r}, {0.1}{i},{0.1}{z}], respectively, using \omega_0 =0.3, \omega_\lambda=0.7, and h=1, andusing petrosian magnitudes. similar results are obtained using sersic modelmagnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the petrosian apertures is not amajor correction. in the {0.1}{r} band, the best fit schechter function to ourresults has \phi_\ast = (1.49 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-2} h^3 mpc^{-3}, m_\ast -5\log_{10} h = -20.44 \pm 0.01, and \alpha = -1.05\pm 0.01. in solarluminosities, the luminosity density in {0.1}{r} is (1.84 \pm 0.04) h 10^8l_{{0.1}{r},\odot} mpc^{-3}. our results are consistent with other estimates ofthe luminosity density, from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey andthe millenium galaxy catalog. they represent a substantial change (\sim 0.5mag) from earlier sdss luminosity density results based on commissioning data,almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosityfunction model.

astro-ph;0211080	photometric redshifts for the sdss early data release	the early data release from the sloan digital sky survey provides one of thelargest multicolor photometric catalogs currently available to the astronomicalcommunity. in this paper we present the first application of photometricredshifts to the $\sim 6$ million extended sources within these data (with 1.8million sources having $r' &lt; 21$). utilizing a range of photometric redshifttechniques, from empirical to template and hybrid techniques, we investigatethe statistical and systematic uncertainties present within the redshiftestimates for the edr data. for $r'&lt;21$ we find that the redshift estimatesprovide realistic redshift histograms with an rms uncertainty in thephotometric redshift relation of 0.035 at $r'&lt;18$ and rising to 0.1 at $r'&lt;21$.we conclude by describing how these photometric redshifts and derivedquantities, such as spectral type, restframe colors and absolute magnitudes,are stored within the sdss database. we provide sample queries for searching onphotometric redshifts and list the current caveats and issues that should beunderstood before using these photometric redshifts in statistical analyses ofthe sdss galaxies.

astro-ph;0212087	average spectra of massive galaxies in the sdss	we combine sloan digital sky survey spectra of 22,000 luminous, red,bulge-dominated galaxies to get high s/n average spectra in the rest-frameoptical and ultraviolet (2600a to 7000a). the average spectra of these massive,quiescent galaxies are early-type with weak emission lines and with absorptionlines indicating an apparent excess of alpha elements over solar abundanceratios. we make average spectra of subsamples selected by luminosity,environment and redshift. the average spectra are remarkable in theirsimilarity. what variations do exist in the average spectra as a function ofluminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family inspectrum space. we present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of thevariation. we measure the properties of the variation with a modified versionof the lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar populationsyntheses. the variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundancedifferences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the dataconsiderably exceeds the current state of the models.

astro-ph;0212405	luminosity function of morphologically classified galaxies in the sloan  digital sky survey	the morphological dependence of the luminosity function is studied using asample containing approximately 1500 bright galaxies classified into hubbletypes by visual inspections for a homogeneous sample obtained from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) northern equatorial stripes. early-type galaxies areshown to have a characteristic magnitude by 0.45 mag brighter than spiralgalaxies in the $r^{\ast}$ band, consistent with the `universal characteristicluminosity' in the $b$ band. the shape of the luminosity function differsrather little among different morphological types: we do not see any symptomsof the sharp decline in the faint end for the luminosity function forearly-type galaxies at least 2 mag fainter than the characteristic magnitude,although the faint end behaviour shows a slight decline ($\alpha\lsim -1$)compared with the total sample. we also show that a rather flat faint end slopefor early-type galaxies is not due to an increasing mixture of the dwarfgalaxies which have softer cores. this means that there are numerous faintearly-type galaxies with highly concentrated cores.

astro-ph;0301005	the sloan digital sky survey: the cosmic spectrum and star-formation  history	we present a determination of the `cosmic optical spectrum' of the universe,i.e. the ensemble emission from galaxies, as determined from the red-selectedsloan digital sky survey main galaxy sample and compare with previous resultsof the blue-selected 2df galaxy redshift survey. broadly we find good agreementin both the spectrum and the derived star-formation histories. if we use apower-law star-formation history model where star-formation rate $\propto(1+z)^\beta$ out to z=1, then we find that $\beta$ of 2 to 3 is still the mostlikely model and there is no evidence for current surveys missing large amountsof star formation at high redshift. in particular `fossil cosmology' of thelocal universe gives measures of star-formation history which are consistentwith direct observations at high redshift. using the photometry of sdss we areable to derive the cosmic spectrum in absolute units (i.e.$ w \aa$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$) at 2--5\aa resolution and find good agreement with publishedbroad-band luminosity densities. for a salpeter imf the best fit stellarmass/light ratio is 3.7--7.5 $\msun/\lsun$ in the r-band (corresponding to$\omstars h = 0.0025$--0.0055) and from both the stellar emission history andthe h$\alpha$ luminosity density independently we find a cosmologicalstar-formation rate of 0.03--0.04 h $\msun$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$ today.

astro-ph;0301029	a low latitude halo stream around the milky way	we present evidence for a ring of stars in the plane of the milky way,extending at least from l = 180 deg to l = 227 deg with turnoff magnitude $g\sim 19.5$; the ring could encircle the galaxy. we infer that the low galacticlatitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of r = 18 +/- 2 kpc fromthe galactic center above the galactic plane, and has r = 20 +/- 2 kpc in theregion sampled below the galactic plane. the evidence includes five hundredsdss spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30 degrees of the plane.the velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found tobe 27 km/s at (l,b) = (198, -27), 22 km/s at (l,b) = (225, 28), 30 km/s at(l,b) = (188, 24), and 30 km/s at (l,b) = (182, 27) degrees. the structurerotates in the same prograde direction as the galactic disk stars, but with acircular velocity of 110+/-25 km/s. the narrow measured velocity dispersion isinconsistent with power law spheroid or thick disk populations. we compare thevelocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars inthe sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocitydispersion of 20 km/s at (l, b) = (165, -55) deg. we estimate a preliminarymetallicity from the ca ii (k) line and color of the turnoff stars of [fe/h] =-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistentwith that of the spheroid population. we interpret our measurements as evidencefor a tidally disrupted satellite of $2 \times 10^7$ to $5 \times 10^8 \rmm_\odot$ which rings the galaxy.

astro-ph;0301305	hdelta-selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i: the catalog	[abridged] we present here a new and homogeneous sample of 3340 galaxiesselected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) based solely on the observedstrength of their hdelta absorption line. these galaxies are commonly known as``post-starburst'' or ``e+a'' galaxies, and the study of these galaxies hasbeen severely hampered by the lack of a large, statistical sample of suchgalaxies. in this paper, we rectify this problem by selecting a sample ofgalaxies which possess an absorption hdelta equivalent width of ew(hdelta_max)- delta ew(hdelta_max) &gt; 4a from 106682 galaxies in the sdss. we have performedextensive tests on our catalog including comparing different methodologies ofmeasuring the hdelta absorption and studying the effects of stellar absorption,dust extinction, emission-filling and measurement error. the measured abundanceof our hdelta-selected (hds) galaxies is 2.6 +/- 0.1% of all galaxies within avolume-limited sample of 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 and m(r*)&lt;-20.5, which is consistent withprevious studies of such galaxies in the literature. we find that only 25 ofour hds galaxies in this volume-limited sample (3.5+/-0.7%) show no evidencefor oii and halpha emission, thus indicating that true e+a (or k+a) galaxiesare extremely rare objects at low redshift, i.e., only 0.09+/-0.02% of allgalaxies in this volume-limited sample are true e+a galaxies. in contrast,89+/-5% of our hds galaxies in the volume-limited sample have significantdetections of the oii and halpha emission lines. we find 27 galaxies in ourvolume-limited hds sample that possess no detectable oii emission, but dohowever possess detectable halpha emission. these galaxies may be dustystar-forming galaxies. we provide the community with this new catalog ofhdelta-selected galaxies to aid in the understanding of these galaxies.

astro-ph;0305093	a large, uniform sample of x-ray emitting agn: selection approach and an  initial catalog from the rosat all-sky and sloan digital sky surveys	many open questions in x-ray astronomy are limited by the relatively smallnumber of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when raresubclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution orcorrelations between wavebands. we describe initial results of a program aimedto ultimately yield 10^4 x-ray source identifications--a sample about an orderof magnitude larger than earlier efforts. the technique employs x-ray data fromthe rosat all-sky survey (rass), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followupfrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical objects in the sdss catalogsare automatically cross-correlated with rass x-ray source positions; thenpriorities for follow-on sdss optical spectra of candidate counterparts areautomatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios forvarious classes of x-ray emitters. sdss parameters for optical morphology,magnitude, colors, plus first radio data, serve as proxies for object class.  initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalogof 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/agn that are probable rassidentifications. most of the ids are new, and only a few percent of the agn arelikely to be random superpositions. the magnitude and redshift ranges of thecounterparts extend over 15&lt;m&lt;21 and 0.03&lt;z&lt;3.6. although most ids are quasarsand sy 1s, a variety of other agn subclasses are also sampled. substantialnumbers of rare agn are found, including more than 130 narrow-line seyfert 1sand 45 bl lac candidates. these results already provide a sizeable set of newids, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate thecapability of the rass/sdss approach to efficiently proceed towards the largesthomogeneously selected/observed sample of x-ray emitting agn. abridged abstract

astro-ph;0305203	the probability distribution function of light in the universe: results  from hydrodynamic simulations	while second and higher order correlations of the light distribution havereceived extensive study, the lowest order probability distribution function(pdf) -- the probability that a unit volume of space will emit a given amountof light -- has received very little attention. we estimate this function withthe aid of hydrodynamic simulations of the lambda cdm model, finding itsignificantly different from the mass density pdf, and not simply related to itby linear bias or any of the other prescriptions commonly adopted. if theoptical light pdf is, in reality, similar to what we find in the simulations,then some measures of omega_m based on mass-to-light ratio and the cosmicvirial theorem will have significantly underestimated omega_m. basically, theproblem is one of selection bias, with galaxy forming regions beingunrepresentative of the dark matter distribution in a way not described bylinear bias. knowledge of the optical pdf and the plausible assumption of alog-normal distribution for the matter pdf will allow one to correct for theseselection biases. we find that this correction (which amounts to 20-30%) bringsthe values of omega_m estimated by using the mass-to-light ratio and the cosmicvirial theorem to the range 0.2-0.3, in better agreement with the wmap resultthan the uncorrected estimates. in addition, the relation between mass andlight pdfs gives us insight concerning the nature of the void phenomenon. inparticular our simulation indicates that 20% of mass is distributed in voids,which occupy 85% of volume in the universe.

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0307074	selection and photometric properties of k+a galaxies	two different simple measurements of galaxy star formation rate withdifferent timescales are compared empirically on $156,395$ fiber spectra ofgalaxies with $r&lt;17.77$ mag taken from the sloan digital sky survey in theredshift range $0.05&lt;z&lt;0.20$: a ratio $\aamp / \kamp$ found by fitting a linearsum of an average old stellar poplulation spectrum (\kamp) and average a-starspectrum (\aamp) to the galaxy spectrum, and the equivalent width (ew) of the$\halpha$ emission line. the two measures are strongly correlated, but there isa small clearly separated population of outliers from the median correlationthat display excess $\aamp /\kamp$ relative to \halpha ew. these ``k+a'' (or``e+a'') galaxies must have dramatically decreased their star-formation ratesover the last $\sim 1$ gyr. the k+a luminosity distribution is very similar tothat of the total galaxy population. the k+a population appears to bebulge-dominated, but bluer and higher surface-brightness than normalbulge-dominated galaxies; it appears that k+a galaxies will fade with time intonormal bulge-dominated galaxies. the inferred rate density for k+a galaxyformation is $\sim 10^{-4} h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim 0.1$.these events are taking place in the field; k+a galaxies don't primarily lie inthe high-density environments or clusters typical of bulge-dominatedpopulations.

astro-ph;0312222	a slow merger history of field galaxies since z~1	using deep infrared observations conducted with the cisco imager on thesubaru telescope, we investigate the field-corrected pair fraction and theimplied merger rate of galaxies in redshift survey fields with hubble spacetelescope imaging. in the redshift interval, 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, the fraction ofinfrared-selected pairs increases only modestly with redshift to 7% +- 6% atz~1. this is nearly a factor of three less than the fraction, 22% +- 8%,determined using the same technique on hst optical images and as measured in aprevious similar study. tests support the hypothesis that optical pairfractions at z~1 are inflated by bright star-forming regions that are unlikelyto be representative of the underlying mass distribution. by determiningstellar masses for the companions, we estimate the mass accretion rateassociated with merging galaxies. at z~1, we estimate this to be 2x10^{9 +-0.2} solar masses per galaxy per gyr. although uncertainties remain, ourresults suggest that the growth of galaxies via the accretion of pre-existingfragments remains as significant a phenomenon in the redshift range studied asthat estimated from ongoing star formation in independent surveys.

astro-ph;0312518	actively star forming elliptical galaxies at low redshifts in the sloan  digital sky survey	we report discovery of actively star forming elliptical galaxies in amorphologically classified sample of bright galaxies at a low redshift obtainedfrom the sloan digital sky survey. the emission lines of these galaxies do notshow the characteristics of active galactic nuclei, and thus their strongh$\alpha$ emission is ascribed to star formation with a rate nearly as high asthat is seen in typical late spiral galaxies. this is taken as evidence againstthe traditional view that all elliptical galaxies formed early and now evolveonly passively. the frequency of such star forming elliptical galaxies is a fewtenths of a percent in the sample, but increases to 3% if we include active s0galaxies. we may identify these galaxies as probable progenitors of so-callede+a galaxies that show the strong balmer absorption feature of a starssuperimposed on an old star population. the approximate match of the abundanceof active elliptical plus s0 galaxies with that of e+a galaxies indicates thatthe duration of such late star formation episodes is of the order of $\gsim 1$gyr. if we interpret these galaxies as new additions to the early-type galaxypopulation, and if we assume a power law for their number evolution, theabundance of early-type galaxies at $z=1$ is about 30% less than that at $z=0$.

astro-ph;0312519	the h alpha luminosity function of morphologically classified galaxies  in the sloan digital sky survey	we present a study of the h$\alpha$ line emission from a sample of 1482optically-selected, morphologically-classified bright galaxies (median redshiftof 0.05) derived from the sloan digital sky survey. the luminosity function iscalculated for each morphological class and for the total sample. theluminosity function fitted with the schechter form gives a slope$\alpha=-1.43\pm 0.10$ for the total sample and the h$\alpha$ luminositydensity is $10^{39.31\pm 0.04{+0.10\atop-0.07}}h$ erg s$^{-1}$mpc$^{-3}$, wherethe first error is statistical and the second is systematic. this value isconsistent with that derived by gallego et al. (1995), but this agreement iscaused by a fortuitous cancellation of their neglect of stellar absorption thataffects the estimate of extinction corrections and a significant sampleincompleteness of emission line galaxies. the fraction of h$\alpha$ emittersmonotonically increases from early (a few % for ellipticals) to late types(100% for irregular galaxies), whereas strong emitters exist in all classes ofmorphological types. we find that 83% of the luminosity density comes fromspiral galaxies, 5% from irregular galaxies, and 9% from early type galaxies; asmall number of morphologically disturbed galaxies contribute by 3%.

astro-ph;0405013	the lyman-alpha forest power spectrum from the sloan digital sky survey	we measure the power spectrum, p_f(k,z), of the transmitted flux in thely-alpha forest using 3035 high redshift quasar spectra from the sloan digitalsky survey. this sample is almost two orders of magnitude larger than anypreviously available data set, yielding statistical errors of ~0.6% and ~0.005on, respectively, the overall amplitude and logarithmic slope of p_f(k,z). thisunprecedented statistical power requires a correspondingly careful analysis ofthe data and of possible systematic contaminations in it. for this purpose wereanalyze the raw spectra to make use of information not preserved by thestandard pipeline. we investigate the details of the noise in the data,resolution of the spectrograph, sky subtraction, quasar continuum, and metalabsorption. we find that background sources such as metals contributesignificantly to the total power and have to be subtracted properly. we alsofind clear evidence for siiii correlations with the ly-alpha forest and suggesta simple model to account for this contribution to the power. while it islikely that our newly developed analysis technique does not eliminate allsystematic errors in the p_f(k,z) measurement below the level of thestatistical errors, our tests indicate that any residual systematics in theanalysis are unlikely to affect the inference of cosmological parameters fromp_f(k,z). these results should provide an essential ingredient for all futureattempts to constrain modeling of structure formation, cosmological parameters,and theories for the origin of primordial fluctuations.

astro-ph;0407061	distributions of galaxy spectral types in the sloan digital sky survey	we perform an objective classification of 170,000 galaxy spectra in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) using the karhunen-lo\`eve (kl) transform. with aboutone-sixth of the total set of galaxy spectra which will be obtained by thesurvey, we are able to carry out the most extensive analysis of its kind todate. the formalism proposed by connolly and szalay is adopted to correct forgappy regions in the spectra, and to derive eigenspectra and eigencoefficients.  from this analysis, we show that this gap-correction formalism leads to aconverging set of eigenspectra and kl-repaired spectra. furthermore, kleigenspectra of galaxies are found to be convergent not only as a function ofiteration, but also as a function of the number of randomly selected galaxyspectra used in the analysis. from these data a set of ten eigenspectra ofgalaxy spectra are constructed, with rest-wavelength coverage 3450-8350angstrom. the eigencoefficients describing these galaxies naturally place thespectra into several classes defined by the plane formed by the first threeeigencoefficients of each spectrum. spectral types, corresponding to differenthubble-types and galaxies with extreme emission lines, are identified for the170,000 spectra and are shown to be complementary to existing spectralclassifications. from a non-parametric classification technique, we find thatthe population of galaxies can be divided into three classes which correspondto early late- through to intermediate late-types galaxies.

astro-ph;0508040	massive coronae of galaxies	there is reason to suspect that about half of the baryons are inpressure-supported plasma in the halos of normal galaxies, drawn in by gravityalong with about half of the dark matter. to be consistent with theobservations this baryonic component, the corona, would have to be hotter thanthe kinetic temperature of the dark matter in the halo so as to produceacceptable central electron densities. we ascribe this hotter plasmatemperature to the addition of entropy prior to and during assembly of thesystem, in an analogy to cluster formation. the plasma cooling time would belonger than the gravitational collapse time but, in the inner parts, shorterthan the hubble time, making the corona thermally unstable to the formation ofa cloudy structure that may be in line with what is indicated by quasarabsorption line systems. the corona of an isolated spiral galaxy would be asource of soft x-ray and recombination radiation, adding to the more commonlydiscussed effects of stars and supernovae. in this picture the mass in thecorona is much larger than the mass in condensed baryons in a spiral galaxy.the corona thus would be a substantial reservoir of diffuse baryons that aresettling and adding to the mass in interstellar matter and stars, so that starformation in isolated spirals will continue well beyond the present epoch.

astro-ph;0508564	photometric covariance in multi-band surveys: understanding the  photometric error in the sdss	in this paper we describe a detailed analysis of the photometricuncertainties present within the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging surveybased on repeat observations of approximately 200 square degrees of the sky. weshow that, for the standard sdss aperture systems (petrocounts, counts_model,psfcounts and cmodel_counts), the errors generated by the sdss photometricpipeline under-estimate the observed scatter in the individual bands. thedegree of disagreement is a strong function of aperture and magnitude (rangingfrom 20% to more than a factor of 2). we also find that the photometry in thefive optical bands can be highly correlated for both point sources andgalaxies, although the correlation for point sources is almost entirely due tovariable objects. without correcting for this covariance the sdss color errorscould be in over-estimated by a factor of two to three. combining theseopposing effects, the sdss errors on the colors differ from the observed colorvariation by approximately 10-20% for most apertures and magnitudes. we providea prescription to correct the errors derived from the sdss photometric pipelineas a function of magnitude and a semi-analytic method for generating theappropriate covariance between the different photometric passbands. given theintrinsic nature of these correlations, we expect that all current and futuremulti-band surveys will also observe strongly covariant magnitudes. the abilityof these surveys to complete their science goals is largely dependent oncolor-based target selection and photometric redshifts; these results show theimportance of spending a significant fraction of early survey operations onre-imaging to empirically determine the photometric covariance of anyobserving/reduction pipeline.

astro-ph;0608635	measuring the matter density using baryon oscillations in the sdss	we measure the cosmological matter density by observing the positions ofbaryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss). we jointly analyse the main galaxies and lrgs in the sdssdr5 sample, using over half a million galaxies in total. the oscillations aredetected with 99.74% confidence (3.0sigma assuming gaussianity) compared to asmooth power spectrum. when combined with the observed scale of the peakswithin the cmb, we find a best-fit value of omega_m=0.256+0.029-0.024 (68%confidence interval), for a flat lambda cosmology when marginalising over thehubble parameter and the baryon density. this value of the matter density isderived from the locations of the baryon oscillations in the galaxy powerspectrum and in the cmb, and does not include any information from the overallshape of the power spectra. this is an extremely clean cosmological measurementas the physics of the baryon acoustic oscillation production is wellunderstood, and the positions of the oscillations are expected to beindependent of systematics such as galaxy bias.

astro-ph;9405014	galaxy mergers and gravitational lens statistics	we investigate the impact of hierarchical galaxy merging on the statistics ofgravitational lensing of distant sources. since no definite theoreticalpredictions for the merging history of luminous galaxies exist, we adopt aparametrized prescription, which allows us to adjust the expected number ofpieces comprising a typical present galaxy at z=0.65. the existence of globalparameter relations for elliptical galaxies and constraints on the evolution ofthe phase space density in dissipationless mergers, allow us to limit thepossible evolution of galaxy lens properties under merging.  we draw two lessons from implementing this lens evolution into statisticallens calculations: (1) the total optical depth to multiple imaging (e.g. ofquasars) is quite insensitive to merging. (2) merging leads to a smaller meanseparation of observed multiple images. because merging does not reducedrastically the expected lensing frequency it cannot make $\lambda$-dominatedcosmologies compatible with the existing lensing observations. a comparisonwith the data from the hst snapshot survey shows that models with little or noevolution of the lens population are statistically favored over strong mergingscenarios. the specific merging scenario proposed by toomre (1977) can berejected (95\% level) by such a comparison. some versions of the scenarioproposed by broadhurst, ellis \&amp; glazebrook (1992), are statisticallyacceptable.

astro-ph;9904299	a study of the b-v colour temperature relation	we attempt to construct a b-v colour temperature relation for stars in theleast model dependent way employing the best modern data. the fit we obtainedwith the form teff = teff((b-v)0,[fe/h],log g) is well constrained and a numberof tests show the consistency of the procedures for the fit. our relationcovers from f0 to k5 stars with metallicity [fe/h] = -1.5 to +0.3 for bothdwarfs and giants. the residual of the fit is 66 k, which is consistent withwhat are expected from the quality of the present data. metallicity and surfacegravity effects are well separated from the colour dependence. dwarfs andgiants match well in a single family of fit, differing only in log g. the fitalso detects the galactic extinction correction for nearby stars with theamount e(b-v) = 0.26 +/-0.03 mag/kpc. taking the newly obtained relation as areference we examine a number of b-v colour temperature relations andatmosphere models available in the literature. we show the presence of asystematic error in the colour temperature relation from synthetic calculationsof model atmospheres; the systematic error across k0 to k5 dwarfs is 0.04-0.05mag in b-v, which means 0.25-0.3 mag in mv for the k star range. we also arguefor the error in the temperature scale used in currently popular stellarpopulation synthesis models; synthetic colours from these models are somewhattoo blue for aged elliptical galaxies. we derive the colour index of the sun(b-v)sun = 0.627 +/-0.018, and discuss that redder colours (e.g., 0.66-0.67)often quoted in the literature are incompatible with the colour-temperaturerelation.

hep-ph;0403149	radiative corrections to neutrino-nucleon quasielastic scattering	full one-loop radiative corrections are calculated for low energyneutrino-nucleon quasi-elastic scattering, $\bar \nu_{e}+p \longrightarrowe^{+} + n$, which involves both fermi and gamow-teller transitions, in thestatic limit of nucleons. the calculation is performed for both angularindependent and dependent parts. we separate the corrections into the outer andinner parts {\` a} la sirlin. the outer part is infrared and ultravioletfinite, and involves the positron velocity. the calculation of the outer partis straightforward, but that of the inner part requires a scrutiny concerningthe continuation of the long-distance hadronic calculation to theshort-distance quark treatment and the dependence on the model of hadronstructure. we show that the logarithmically divergent parts do not depend onthe structure of hadrons not only for the fermi part, but also for thegamow-teller part. this observation enables us to deal with the inner part forthe gamow-teller transition nearly parallel to that for the fermi transition.the inner part is universal to weak charged-current processes and can beabsorbed into the modification of the coupling constants up to the order of theinverse proton mass $o(1/m_{p})$. the resulting $o(\alpha)$ corrections to thedifferential cross section take the form $ [1+\delta_{\rm out}(e)] [(1+\delta_{\rm in}^{\rm f}) &lt; 1 &gt;^2 +g_a^2 (1+\delta_{\rm in}^{\rm gt}) &lt; {\mib\sigma} &gt;^2]$, where $&lt;1 &gt;$ and $&lt;{\mib \sigma}&gt;$ stand for the fermi andgamow-teller matrix elements; the outer correction $\delta_{\rm out}$ ispositron energy ($e$) dependent and takes different functional forms for theangular independent and dependent parts. all factors are explicitly evaluated.
