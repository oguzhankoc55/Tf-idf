0901.0250	radiation pressure and absorption in agn: results from a complete  unbiased sample from swift	outward radiation pressure can exceed the inward gravitational pull on gasclouds in the neighbourhood of a luminous active galactic nucleus (agn). thiscreates a forbidden region for long-lived dusty clouds in the observed columnndensity - eddington fraction plane. (the eddington fraction lambda_edd is theratio of the bolometric luminosity of an agn to the eddington limit for itsblack hole mass.) the swift/bat catalogue is the most complete hard x-rayselected sample of agn and has 97 low redshift agn with measured columndensities n_h and inferred black hole masses. eddington fractions for thesources have been obtained using recent bolometric corrections and the sourceshave been plotted on the n_h - lambda_edd plane. only one source lies in theforbidden region and it has a large value of n_h due to an ionized warmabsorber, for which radiation pressure is reduced. the effective eddingtonlimit for the source population indicates that the high column density cloudsin the more luminous objects lie within the inner few pc, where the centralblack hole provides at least half the mass. our result shows that radiationpressure does affect the presence of gas clouds in the inner galaxy bulge. wediscuss briefly how the n_h - lambda_edd plane may evolve to higher redshift,when feedback due to radiation pressure may have been strong.

0903.3037	the 22-month swift-bat all-sky hard x-ray survey	we present the catalog of sources detected in the first 22 months of datafrom the hard x-ray survey (14--195 kev) conducted with the bat coded maskimager on the \swift satellite. the catalog contains 461 sources detected abovethe 4.8 sigma level with bat. high angular resolution x-ray data for everysource from swift xrt or archival data have allowed associations to be madewith known counterparts in other wavelength bands for over 97% of thedetections, including the discovery of ~30 galaxies previously unknown as agnand several new galactic sources. a total of 266 of the sources are associatedwith seyfert galaxies (median redshift z ~ 0.03) or blazars, with the majorityof the remaining sources associated with x-ray binaries in our galaxy. thisongoing survey is the first uniform all sky hard x-ray survey since heao-1 in1977.  since the publication of the 9-month bat survey we have increased the numberof energy channels from 4 to 8 and have substantially increased the number ofsources with accurate average spectra. the bat 22-month catalog is the productof the most sensitive all-sky survey in the hard x-ray band, with a detectionsensitivity (4.8 sigma) of 2.2e-11 erg/cm2/s (1 mcrab) over most of the sky inthe 14--195 kev band.

0905.0472	the evolution of swift/bat blazars and the origin of the mev background	we use 3 years of data from the swift/bat survey to select a complete sampleof x-ray blazars above 15 kev. this sample comprises 26 flat-spectrum radioquasars (fsrqs) and 12 bl lac objects detected over a redshift range of0.03&lt;z&lt;4.0. we use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15--55kev band, the evolution of blazars. we find that, contrary to the seyfert-likeagns detected by bat, the population of blazars shows strong positiveevolution. this evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous opticalqsos and luminous x-ray selected agns. we also find evidence for anepoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quietagns. we interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion andjet activity. in our sample, the fsrqs evolve strongly, while our best-fitshows that bl lacs might not evolve at all. the blazar population accounts for10-20 % (depending on the evolution of the bl lacs) of the cosmic x-raybackground (cxb) in the 15--55 kev band. we find that fsrqs can explain theentire cxb emission for energies above 500 kev solving the mystery of thegeneration of the mev background. the evolution of luminous fsrqs shows a peakin redshift ($z_c$=4.3$\pm0.5$) which is larger than the one observed in qsosand x-ray selected agns. we argue that fsrqs can be used as tracers of massiveelliptical galaxies in the early universe.

0907.2272	optical--to--x-ray emission in low-absorption agn: results from the  swift-bat 9 month catalogue	(abridged) we present simultaneous optical--to--x-ray spectral energydistributions (seds) from swift's x-ray and uv--optical telescopes (xrt anduvot) for a well-selected sample of 26 low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) agn from theswift/bat 9-month catalogue, the largest well-studied, hard x-ray selectedsurvey of local agn to date. our subsample consists of agn with low intrinsicx-ray absorption (n_h&lt;10^22 cm^-2) and minimal spectral complexity, to moreaccurately recover the intrinsic accretion luminosity in these sources. weperform a correction for host galaxy contamination in all available uvot filterimages to recover the intrinsic agn emission, and estimate intrinsic dustextinction from the resultant nuclear seds. black hole mass estimates aredetermined from the host-galaxy 2mass k-band bulge luminosity. accretion ratesdetermined from our seds are on average low (eddington ratios &lt;~ 0.1) and hardx-ray bolometric corrections cluster at ~10-20, in contrast with the highervalues seen for quasars. an average sed for the 22 low accretion rate(eddington ratio &lt; 0.1) objects is presented, with and without correction forintrinsic extinction. we do not find a correlation of optical--to--x-rayspectral index with eddington ratio, regardless of the optical referencewavelength chosen for defining the spectral index. the low accretion rates andbolometric corrections found for this representative low-redshift sample are ofparticular importance for studies of agn accretion history.

0908.0002	the optx project iii: x-ray versus optical spectral type for agns	we compare the optical spectral types with the x-ray spectral properties fora uniformly selected (sources with fluxes greater than the 3 sigma level andabove a flux limit of f_2-8 kev &gt; 3.5x10^-15 erg/cm2/s), highlyspectroscopically complete (&gt;80% for f_2-8 kev &gt; 10^-14 erg/cm2/s and &gt;60%below) 2-8 kev x-ray sample observed in three chandra fields (clans, clasxs,and the cdf-n) that cover ~1.2 deg^2. for our sample of 645 spectroscopicallyobserved sources, we confirm that there is significant overlap of the x-rayspectral properties, as determined by the effective photon indices, geff,obtained from the ratios of the 0.5-2 kev to 2-8 kev counts, for the differentoptical spectral types. for example, of the broad-line agns (non-broad-lineagns), 20% +/- 3% (33% +/- 4%) have geff&lt;1.2 (geff &gt; 1.2). thus, one cannot usethe x-ray spectral classifications and the optical spectral classificationsequivalently. since it is not understood how x-ray and optical classificationsrelate to the obscuration of the central engine, we strongly advise against amixed classification scheme, as it can only complicate the interpretation ofx-ray agn samples. we confirm the dependence of optical spectral type on x-rayluminosity, and for z&lt;1, we find a similar luminosity dependence of geff.however, this dependence breaks down at higher redshifts due to the highlyredshift-dependent nature of geff. we therefore also caution that anyclassification scheme which depends on geff is likely to suffer from seriousredshift bias.

0910.5256	the power output of local obscured and unobscured agn: crossing the  absorption barrier with swift/bat and iras	the swift/bat 9-month catalogue of active galactic nuclei (agn) provides anunbiased census of local supermassive black hole accretion, and probes to allbut the highest levels of absorption in agn. we explore a method forcharacterising the bolometric output of both obscured and unobscured agn bycombining the hard x-ray data from swift/bat (14-195kev) with the reprocessedir emission as seen with the iras all-sky surveys. this approach bypasses thecomplex modifications to the sed introduced by absorption in the optical, uvand 0.1-10 kev regimes and provides a long-term, average picture of thebolometric output of these sources. we broadly follow the approach of pozzi etal. for calculating the bolometric luminosities by adding nuclear ir and hardx-ray luminosities, and consider different approaches for removing non-nuclearcontamination in the large-aperture iras fluxes. using mass estimates from them_bh-l_bulge relation, we present the eddington ratios \lambda_edd and 2-10 kevbolometric corrections for a subsample of 63 agn (35 obscured and 28unobscured) from the swift/bat catalogue, and confirm previous indications of alow eddington ratio distribution for both samples. importantly, we find atendency for low bolometric corrections (typically 10-30) for the obscured agnin the sample (with a possible rise from ~15 for \lambda_edd&lt;0.03 to ~32 abovethis), providing a hitherto unseen window onto accretion processes in thisclass of agn. this finding is of key importance in calculating the expectedlocal black hole mass density from the x-ray background since it is composed ofemission from a significant population of such obscured agn. analogous studieswith high resolution ir data and a range of alternative models for the torusemission will form useful future extensions to this work.

0911.0675	radial velocity offsets due to mass outflows and extinction in active  galactic nuclei	we present a study of the radial velocity offsets between narrow emissionlines and host galaxy lines (stellar absorption and h i 21-cm emission) inseyfert galaxies with observed redshifts less than 0.043. we find that 35% ofthe seyferts in the sample show [o iii] emission lines with blueshifts withrespect to their host galaxies exceeding 50 km/s, whereas only 6% showredshifts this large, in qualitative agreement with most previous studies. wealso find that a greater percentage of seyfert 1 galaxies show blueshifts thanseyfert 2 galaxies. using hst/stis spatially-resolved spectra of the seyfert 2galaxy ngc 1068 and the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151, we generate geometric modelsof their narrow-line regions (nlrs) and inner galactic disks, and show howthese models can explain the blueshifted [o iii] emission lines in collapsedstis spectra of these two seyferts. we conclude that the combination of massoutflow of ionized gas in the nlr and extinction by dust in the inner disk(primarily in the form of dust spirals) is primarily responsible for thevelocity offsets in seyfert galaxies. more exotic explanations are not needed.we discuss the implications of this result for the velocity offsets found inhigher redshift agn.

0707.2925	swift observations of high-redshift radio-loud quasars	we report on swift observations of four z&gt;2 radio-loud quasars (0212+735,0537-286, 0836+710, and 2149-307), classified as blazars. the sources,well-known emitters at soft-medium x-rays, were detected at &gt;5sigma with thebat experiment in 15-150 kev. no flux variability was detected within the xrtand bat exposures, with the exception of 0836+710 which shows an increase of afactor 4 of the 15-150 kev flux on a timescale of one month. the 0.3-10 kevspectra are well fitted by power law models, with rather hard continua (photonindices gamma_xrt ~1.3-1.5); similarly, the 15-150 kev spectra are described bypower laws with gamma_bat ~1.3-1.8. the xrt data exhibit spectral curvature,which can be modeled either in terms of excess absorption along the line ofsight, or a downward-curved broken power law. in the former case, if the excessn_h is at the rest-frame of the source, columns of n_h^z=(0.3-6)x10^22 cm^-2are measured. modeling of the seds of the four quasars shows that the emissionat the higher frequencies, &gt;~ 10^16 hz, is dominated by the jet, while thesteep optical-to-uv continua, observed with the uvot, can be attributed tothermal emission from the accretion disk. the disk luminosity is between 1% and10% the jet power, similar to other powerful blazars.

1004.5321	mid-infrared properties of the swift burst alert telescope active  galactic nuclei sample of the local universe. i. emission-line diagnostics	we compare mid-infrared emission-line properties, from high-resolutionspitzer spectra of a hard x-ray (14 -- 195 kev) selected sample of nearby (z &lt;0.05) agn detected by the burst alert telescope (bat) aboard swift. theluminosity distribution for the mid-infrared emission-lines, [o iv] 25.89micron, [ne ii] 12.81 micron, [ne iii] 15.56 micron and [ne v] 14.32/24.32micron, and hard x-ray continuum show no differences between seyfert 1 andseyfert 2 populations, however six newly discovered bat agns are under-luminousin [o iv], most likely the result of dust extinction in the host galaxy. theoverall tightness of the mid-infrared correlations and bat fluxes andluminosities suggests that the emission lines primarily arise in gas ionized bythe agn. we also compare the mid-infrared emission-lines in the bat agns withthose from published studies of ulirgs, pg qsos, star-forming galaxies andliners. we find that the bat agn sample fall into a distinctive region whencomparing the [ne iii]/[ne ii] and the [o iv]/[ne iii] ratios. these lineratios are lower in sources that have been previously classified in themid-infrared/optical as agn than those found for the bat agn, suggesting that,in our x-ray selected sample, the agn represents the main contribution to theobserved line emission. these ratios represent a new emission line diagnosticfor distinguishing between agn and star forming galaxies.

1006.3536	discovery of ultra-fast outflows in a sample of broad line radio  galaxies observed with suzaku	we present the results of a uniform and systematic search for blue-shifted fek absorption lines in the x-ray spectra of five bright broad-line radiogalaxies (blrgs) observed with suzaku. we detect, for the first time at x-raysin radio-loud agn, several absorption lines at energies greater than 7 kev inthree out of five sources, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. the lines aredetected with high significance according to both the f-test and extensivemonte carlo simulations. their likely interpretation as blue-shifted fe xxv andfe xxvi k-shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gasoutflowing with mildly relativistic velocities, in the range 0.04-0.15c. a fitwith specific photo-ionization models gives ionization parameters in the rangelog_xi~4-5.6 and column densities of n_h~10^22-10^23 cm^-2. thesecharacteristics are very similar to those of the ultra-fast outflows (ufos)previously observed in radio-quiet agn. their estimated location within~0.01-0.3pc from the central super-massive black hole suggests a likely originrelated with accretion disk winds/outflows. depending on the absorber coveringfraction, the mass outflow rate of these ufos can be comparable to theaccretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fractionof the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power.therefore, these ufos can play a significant role in the expected feedback fromthe agn on the surrounding environment and can give us further clues on therelation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds/jets in bothradio-quiet and radio-loud agn.

1011.5993	multi-wavelength probes of obscuration towards the narrow line region in  seyfert galaxies	we present a study of reddening and absorption towards the narrow lineregions (nlr) in active galactic nuclei (agn) selected from the revisedshapley-ames, 12mu, and swift/burst alert telescope samples. for the sources inhost galaxies with inclinations of b/a &gt; 0.5, we find that mean ratio of [oiii] 5007a, from ground-based observations, and [o iv] 28.59mu, fromspitzer/infrared spectrograph observations, is a factor of 2 lower in seyfert2s than seyfert 1s. the combination of low [o iii]/[o iv] and [o iii] 4363/5007ratios in seyfert 2s suggests more extinction of emission from the nlr than inseyfert 1s. similar column densities of dusty gas, nh ~ several x 10^21 cm^-2,can account for the suppression of both [o iii] 5007a and [o iii] 4363a, ascompared to those observed in seyfert 1s. also, we find that the x-ray lineovii 22.1a is weaker in seyfert 2s, consistent with absorption by the same gasthat reddens the optical emission. using a hubble space telescope/spacetelescope imaging spectrograph slitless spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151, we estimate that only ~ 30% of the [o iii] 5007a comes from within 30 pcof the central source, which is insufficient to account for the low [oiii]/[oiv] ratios in seyfert 2s. if seyfert 2 galaxies have similar intrinsic[oiii] spatial profiles, the external dusty gas must extend further out alongthe nlr, perhaps in the form of nuclear dust spirals that have been associatedwith fueling flows towards the agn.

1101.1115	x-ray reflected spectra from accretion disk models.ii. diagnostic tools  for x-ray observations	we present a comprehensive study of the emission spectra from accretingsources. we use our new reflection code to compute the reflected spectra froman accretion disk illuminated by x-rays. this set of models covers differentvalues of ionization parameter, solar iron abundance and photon index for theilluminating spectrum. these models also include the most complete and recentatomic data for the inner-shell of the iron and oxygen isonuclear sequences. weconcentrate our analysis to the 2-10 kev energy region, and in particular tothe iron k-shell emission lines. we show the dependency of the equivalent width(ew) of the fe k$\alpha$ with the ionization parameter. the maximum value ofthe ew is $\sim 800$ ev for models with log $\xi\sim 1.5$, and decreasesmonotonically as $\xi$ increases. for lower values of $\xi$ the fe k$\alpha$ ewdecreases to a minimum near log $\xi\sim 0.8$. we produce simulated ccdobservations based on our reflection models. for low ionized, reflectiondominated cases, the 2-10 kev energy region shows a very broad, curvingcontinuum that cannot be represented by a simple power-law. we show that inaddition to the fe k-shell emission, there are other prominent features such asthe si and s l$\alpha$ lines, a blend of ar {\sc viii-xi} lines, and the ca{\sc x} k$\alpha$ line. in some cases the s {\sc xv} blends with the he-like sirrc producing a broad feature that cannot be reproduced by a simple gaussianprofile. this could be used as a signature of reflection.

1105.0893	xmm follow-up observations of three swift bat-selected active galactic  nuclei	we present xmm-newton observations of three agn taken as part of a hunt tofind very heavily obscured compton-thick agn. for obscuring columns greaterthan 10^25 cm^-2, agn are only visible at energies below 10 kev viareflected/scattered radiation, characterized by a flat power-law. we thereforeselected three objects (eso 417-g006, iras 05218-1212, and mcg -01-05-047) fromthe swift bat hard x-ray survey catalog with swift x-ray telescope xrt 0.5-10kev spectra with flat power-law indices as candidate compton-thick sources forfollow-up observations with the more sensitive instruments on xmm-newton. thexmm spectra, however, rule out reflection-dominated models based on theweakness of the observed fe k-alpha lines. instead, the spectra are well-fit bya model of a power-law continuum obscured by a compton-thin absorber, plus asoft excess. this result is consistent with previous follow-up observations oftwo other flat-spectrum bat-detected agn. thus, out of the six agn in the22-month bat catalog with apparently flat swift xrt spectra, all five that havehad follow-up observations are not likely compton-thick. we also present newoptical spectra of two of these objects, iras 05218-1212 and mcg -01-05-047.interestingly, though both these agn have similar x-ray spectra, their opticalspectra are completely different, adding evidence against the simplest form ofthe geometric unified model of agn. iras 05218-1212 appears in the optical as aseyfert 1, despite the ~8.5x10^22 cm^-2 line-of-sight absorbing columnindicated by its x-ray spectrum. mcg -01-05-047's optical spectrum shows nosign of agn activity; it appears as a normal galaxy.

1106.0310	uncovering the spectral energy distribution in active galaxies using  high ionization mid-infrared emission lines	the shape of the spectral energy distribution of active galaxies in theeuv--soft x-ray band (13.6 ev to 1 kev) is uncertain because obscuration bydust and gas can hamper our view of the continuum. to investigate the shape ofthe spectral energy distribution in this energy band, we have generated a setof photoionization models which reproduce the small dispersion found incorrelations between high-ionization mid-infrared emission lines in a sample ofhard x-ray selected agn. our calculations show that a broken power-lawcontinuum model is sufficient to reproduce the [ne v]14.32 mm/[neiii], [nev]24.32mm/[o iv]25.89mm and [o iv] 25.89mm/[ne iii] ratios, and does notrequire the addition of a "big bump" euv model component. we constrain theeuv--soft x-ray slope, alpha_i, to be between 1.5 -- 2.0 and derive a best fitof alpha_i ~ 1.9 for seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with previous studies ofintermediate redshift quasars. if we assume a blue bump model, most sources inour sample have derived temperatures between t_{bb}=10^{5.18} k to 10^{5.7} k,suggesting that the peak of this component spans a large range of energiesextending from ~ lambda 600a to lambda 1900a. in this case, the best fittingpeak energy that matches the mid-infrared line ratios of seyfert 1 galaxiesoccurs between ~ lambda 700--1000a. despite the fact that our results do notrule out the presence of an euv bump, we conclude that our power-law modelproduces enough photons with energies &gt; 4 ry to generate the observed amount ofmid-infrared emission in our sample of bat agn.

1110.6226	x-ray spectral variability in ngc 3783	ngc 3783 was observed for approximately 210ks by suzaku and in this timeshowed significant spectral and flux variability at both short (20ks) and long(100ks) time scales. the full observation is found to consist of approximatelysix "spectral periods" where the behaviour of the soft (0.3-1.0kev) and hard(2-10kev) bands are somewhat distinct. using a variety of methods we find thatthe strong warm absorber present in this source does not change on these timescales, confirming that the broad-band variability is intrinsic to the centralsource. the time resolved difference-spectra are well modelled with an absorbedpowerlaw below 10kev, but show an additional hard excess at ~20kev in thelatter stages of the observation. this suggests that, in addition to thevariable powerlaw, there is a further variable component that varies with timebut not monotonically with flux. we show that a likely interpretation is thatthis further component is associated with variations in the reflection fractionor possibly ionization state of the accretion disk a few gravitational radiifrom the black hole.

1111.0908	new insights on the accretion disk-winds connection in radio-loud agns  from suzaku	from the spectral analysis of long suzaku observations of five radio-loudagns we have been able to discover the presence of ultra-fast outflows withvelocities ~0.1c in three of them, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. they areconsistent with being accretion disk winds/outflows. we also performed afollow-up on 3c 111 to monitor its outflow on ~7days time-scales and detectedan anti-correlated variability of a possible relativistic emission line withrespect to blue-shifted fe k features, following a flux increase. this providesthe first direct evidence for an accretion disk-wind connection in an agn. themass outflow rate of these outflows can be comparable to the accretion rate andtheir mechanical power can correspond to a significant fraction of thebolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power. therefore,they can possibly play a significant role in the expected feedback from agnsand can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk andthe formation of winds/jets.

1303.0009	three agn close to the effective eddington limit	the effective eddington limit for dusty gas surrounding agn is lower than thecanonical eddington limit for hydrogen gas. previous results from the swift/bat9-month catalogue suggested that in the overwhelming majority of local agn, thedusty absorbing gas is below this effective eddington limit, implying thatradiation pressure is insufficient to blow away the absorbing clouds. wepresent an analysis of three objects from that sample which were found to beclose to the effective eddington limit (ngc454, 2masx j03565655-4041453 and xssj05054-2348), using newly obtained xmm-newton data. we use the x-ray data tobetter constrain the absorbing column density, and supplement them with xmmoptical monitor (om) data, infrared spitzer and herschel data where availableto construct a broad-band spectral energy distribution to estimate refinedbolometric luminosities and eddington ratios for these three objects. the newxmm-newton observations show all three objects moving away from the regionexpected for short-lived absorption in the n_h-\lambda_{edd} plane into the`long-lived absorption' region. we find our conclusions robust to differentmethods for estimating the bolometric luminosity and eddington ratio.interestingly, 2masx j03565655-4041453 and xss j05054-2348 now exhibit complexx-ray spectra, at variance with previous analyses of their swift/xrt data. wefind evidence for absorption variability in ngc 454 and 2masxj03565655-4041453, perhaps implying that although the radiation pressure fromthe central engine is insufficient to cause clearly detectable outflows, it maycause absorption variations over longer timescales. however, more robust blackhole mass estimates would improve the accuracy of the eddington ratio estimatesfor these objects.

1305.4901	reflection-dominated nuclear x-ray emission in the early-type galaxy eso  565--g019	we present the discovery of a reflection-dominated active galactic nucleus(agn) in the early-type radio-quiet galaxy eso 565--g019 with suzaku andswift/bat. the source x-ray spectrum below 10 kev is characteristic of othercompton-thick (ct) agn, clearly showing an inverted continuum and prodigiousfluorescence iron emission above ~3 kev. a compton shoulder to the neutral fekalpha line also appears to be present. there is evidence for long-term hardx-ray flux variability which we associate with changes in the intrinsic agnpower-law. the increasing sensitivity of ongoing and new hard x-ray surveysmeans that more such reflection-dominated agn ought to be uncovered in the nearfuture. eso 565--g019 is hosted in an early-type galaxy whose morphology hasbeen variously classified as either type e or type s0. only about 20 bona fidect-agn have been identified in the local universe so far, and all exist in hostgalaxies with late hubble types (s0 or later). ct columns of nuclear obscuringgas are uncommon in early-type galaxies in the local universe, so confirmationof the exact morphological class of eso 565--g019 is important. infraredphotometry also shows the presence of large quantities of cool dust in thehost, indicative of significant ongoing star-formation. eso 565--g019 may bethe first identified local example of minor-merger driven ct-agn growth in anearly-type host, or may be the result of interaction with its neighboringgalaxy eso 565--g018 in a wide pair.

1311.4880	what obscures low x-ray-scattering active galactic nuclei?	x-ray surveys have revealed a new class of active galactic nuclei (agn) witha very low observed fraction of scattered soft x-rays, f_scat &lt; 0.5%. based onx-ray modeling these "x-ray new-type", or low observed x-ray scattering(hereafter:"low-scattering") sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried agnwith a high covering factor of gas. in this paper we address the questionswhether the host galaxies of low-scattering agn may contribute to the observedx-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high coveringfactors from the infrared (ir) emission. we find that x-ray low-scattering agnare preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems ascompared to other seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that theline-of-sight toward the agn intersects with high columns of host-galactic gasand dust. moreover, while a detailed analysis of the ir emission oflow-scattering agn eso 103-g35 remains inconclusive, we do not find anyindication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample oflow-scattering agn based on their ir emission. for eso 103-g35, we constrainedthe temperature, mass and location of the ir emitting dust which is consistentwith expectations for the dusty torus. however, a deep silicate absorptionfeature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorberon larger scales within the host galaxy. taking these findings together, wepropose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering agn is not necessarilythe result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference ofhost-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with theline-of-sight. we discuss implications of this hypothesis for x-ray models,high-ionization emission lines, and observed star-formation activity in theseobjects.

1406.7252	ultra-fast outflows in radio-loud active galactic nuclei	recent x-ray observations show absorbing winds with velocities up tomildly-relativistic values of the order of ~0.1c in a limited sample of 6broad-line radio galaxies. they are observed as blue-shifted fe xxv-xxvik-shell absorption lines, similarly to the ultra-fast outflows (ufos) reportedin seyferts and quasars. in this work we extend the search for such fe kabsorption lines to a larger sample of 26 radio-loud agns observed withxmm-newton and suzaku. the sample is drawn from the swift bat 58-month catalogand blazars are excluded. x-ray bright fr ii radio galaxies constitute themajority of the sources. combining the results of this analysis with those inthe literature we find that ufos are detected in &gt;27% of the sources. however,correcting for the number of spectra with insufficient signal-to-noise, we canestimate that the incidence of ufos is this sample of radio-loud agns is likelyin the range f=(50+/-20)%. a photo-ionization modeling of the absorption lineswith xstar allows to estimate the distribution of their main parameters. theobserved outflow velocities are broadly distributed between v_out&lt;1,000 km s^-1and v_out~0.4c, with mean and median values of v_out~0.133c and v_out~0.117c,respectively. the material is highly ionized, with an average ionizationparameter of log\xi~4.5 erg s^-1 cm, and the column densities are larger thann_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. overall, these characteristics are consistent with thepresence of complex accretion disk winds in a significant fraction ofradio-loud agns and demonstrate that the presence of relativistic jets does notpreclude the existence of winds, in accordance with several theoretical models.

1408.5889	herschel far-infrared photometry of the swift burst alert telescope  active galactic nuclei sample of the local universe. i. pacs observations	far-infrared (fir) photometry from the the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory is presented for 313nearby, hard x-ray selected galaxies from the 58-month swift burst alerttelescope (bat) active galactic catalog. the present data do not distinguishbetween the fir luminosity distributions at 70 and 160um for seyfert 1 andseyfert 2 galaxies. this result suggests that if the fir emission is from thenuclear obscuring material surrounding the accretion disk, then it emitsisotropically, independent of orientation. alternatively, a significantfraction of the 70 and 160um could be from star formation, independent of agntype. using a non-parametric test for partial correlation with censored data,we find a statistically significant correlation between the agn intrinsic power(in the 14-195 kev band ) and the fir emission at 70 and 160um for seyfert 1galaxies. we find no correlation between the 14-195 kev and fir luminosities inseyfert 2 galaxies. the observed correlations suggest two possible scenarios:(i) if we assume that the fir luminosity is a good tracer of star formation,then there is a connection between star formation and the agn at sub-kiloparsecscales, or (ii) dust heated by the agn has a statistically significantcontribution to the fir emission. using a spearman rank-order analysis, the14-195 kev luminosities for the seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are weaklystatistically correlated with the f70/f160 ratios.

0804.1147	new indicators for agn power: the correlation between [o iv] lambda  25.89 micron and hard x-ray luminosity for nearby seyfert galaxies	we have studied the relationship between the [o iv] lambda 25.89 micronemission line luminosities, obtained from spitzer spectra, the x-ray continuain the 2-10 kev band, primarily from asca, and the 14-195 kev band obtainedwith the swift/burst alert telescope (bat), for a sample of nearby (z &lt; 0.08)seyfert galaxies. for comparison, we have examined the relationship between the[o iii] 5007, the 2-10 kev and the 14-195 kev luminosities for the same set ofobjects. we find that both the [o iv] and [o iii] luminosities arewell-correlated with the bat luminosities. on the other hand, the [o iii]luminosities are better-correlated with 2-10 kev luminosities than are those of[o iv]. when comparing [o iv] and [o iii] luminosities for the different typesof galaxies, we find that the seyfert 2's have significantly lower [o iii] to[o iv] ratios than the seyfert 1's. we suggest that this is due to morereddening of the narrow line region (nlr) of the seyfert 2's. assuming galacticdust to gas ratios, the average amount of extra reddening corresponds to ahydrogen column density of ~ few times 10^21 cm^-2, which is a small fractionof the x-ray absorbing columns in the seyfert 2's. the combined effects ofreddening and the x-ray absorption are the probable reason why the [o iii]versus 2-10 kev correlation is better than the [o iv] versus 2-10 kev, sincethe [o iv] emission line is much less affected by extinction. overall, we findthe [o iv] to be an accurate and truly isotropic indicator of the power of theagn. this suggests that it can be useful in deconvolving the contribution ofthe agn and starburst to the spectrum of compton-thick and/or x-ray weaksources.

0807.4695	correlations of the ir luminosity and eddington ratio with a hard x-ray  selected sample of agn	we use the swift burst alert telescope (bat) sample of hard x-ray selectedactive galactic nuclei (agn) with a median redshift of 0.03 and the 2mass j andk band photometry to examine the correlation of hard x-ray emission toeddington ratio as well as the relationship of the j and k band nuclearluminosity to the hard x-ray luminosity. the bat sample is almost unbiased bythe effects of obscuration and thus offers the first large unbiased sample forthe examination of correlations between different wavelength bands. we findthat the near-ir nuclear j and k band luminosity is related to the bat (14 -195 kev) luminosity over a factor of $10^3$ in luminosity ($l_{ir} \approxl_{bat}^{1.25}$)and thus is unlikely to be due to dust. we also find that theeddington ratio is proportional to the x-ray luminosity. this new result shouldbe a strong constraint on models of the formation of the broad band continuum.

astro-ph;0002265	hard x-ray spectra of broad-line radio galaxies from the rossi x-ray  timing explorer	we present the results of hard-x-ray observations of four broad-line radiogalaxies (blrgs) with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). the originalmotivation behind the observations was to search for systematic differencesbetween the blrgs and their radio-quiet counterparts, the seyfert galaxies. wedo, indeed, find that the fe k-alpha lines and compton "reflection" components,which are hallmarks of the x-ray spectra of seyferts galaxies, are weaker inblrgs by about a factor of 2. this observational result is in agreement withthe conclusions of other recent studies of these objects. we examine severalpossible explanations for this systematic difference, including beaming of theprimary x-rays away from the accretion disk, a low iron abundance, a smallsolid angle subtended by the disk to the primary x-ray source, and dilution ofthe observed spectrum by beamed x-rays from the jet. we find that a small solidangle subtended by the disk to the primary x-ray source is a viable andappealing explanation, while all others suffer from drawbacks. we interpretthis as an indication of a difference in the inner accretion disk structurebetween seyfert galaxies and blrgs, namely that the inner accretion disks ofblrgs have the form of an ion-supported torus or an advection-dominatedaccretion flow, which irradiates the geometrically thin outer disk.

astro-ph;0006339	the origin of the x-ray and ultraviolet emission in ngc 7469	we present a spectral analysis of a 30d, near-continuous observation of theseyfert 1 galaxy ngc 7469 with rxte. daily integrations show strong spectralchanges during the observation. ourmain result is that we find the x-rayspectral index to be correlated with the uv flux. furthermore, the broad-bandx-ray photon flux is also correlated with the uv continuum. these correlationspoint towards a model in which the x-rays originate via thermal comptonizationof uv seed photons. furthermore, the uv is also correlated with theextrapolation of the x-ray power law into the soft x-ray/euv region. our dataanalysis therefore re-opens the possibility the the uv photons and theirvariability arise from reprocessing, as long as the primary source of heatingis photo-electric absorption in the reprocessor, rather than comptondownscattering, a coherent picture of the x-ray/uv variability can therefore beconstructed whereby absorption and reprocessing of euv/soft x-rays in astandard accretion disk produce a variable seed photon distribution which arein turn up-scattered into the x-ray band. we also find a significantcorrelation between the 2-10 kev flux and the 6.4 kev iron k-line suggestingthat at least some portion of the line originates within ~1 lt day of the x-raycontinuum source. neither the power law photon index nor the compton reflectioncomponent are correlated with the 2-10 kev flux. the latter is not correlatedwith the iron k line flux either. we do find an apparent correlation betweenthe x-ray spectral index and the strength of the compton reflection component.in an appendix we show, however, that this can be produced by a combination ofstatistical and systematic errors. we conclude the apparent variations in thecompton reflection component may be an artifact of these effects.

astro-ph;0010509	on the soft x-ray spectrum of cooling flows	strong evidence for cooling flows has been found in low resolution x-rayimaging and spectra of many clusters of galaxies. however high resolution x-rayspectra of several clusters from the reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) onxmm-newton now show a soft x-ray spectrum inconsistent with a simple coolingflow. the main problem is a lack of the emission lines expected from gascooling below 1--2 kev. lines from gas at about 2--3 kev are observed, even ina high temperature cluster such as a 1835, indicating that gas is cooling downto about 2--3 kev, but is not found at lower temperatures. here we discussseveral solutions to the problem; heating, mixing, differential absorption andinhomogeneous metallicity. continuous or sporadic heating creates furtherproblems, including the targetting of the heat at the cooler gas and also thehigh total energy required. so far there is no clear observational evidence forwidespread heating, or shocks, in cluster cores, except in radio lobes whichoccupy only part of the volume. the implied ages of cooling flows are short, atabout 1 gyr. mixing. or absorption, of the cooling gas are other possibilities.alternatively, if the metals in the intracluster medium are not uniformlyspread but are clumped, then little line emission is expected from the gascooling below 1 kev. the low metallicity part cools without line emissionwhereas the strengths of the soft x-ray lines from the metal-rich gas depend onthe mass fraction of that gas and not on the abundance, since soft x-ray lineemission dominates the cooling function below 2 kev.

astro-ph;0206249	high resolution soft x-ray spectroscopy of m87 with the reflection  grating spectrometers on xmm-newton	we present high-resolution x-ray spectroscopic observations of m87 with thereflection grating spectrometers on xmm-newton. we detect strong k-shell lineemission from n, o, ne, mg, some emission from he-like si, a fully resolved setof fe l-shell emission spectra, and some emission from c. the angular intensitydistributions of the strong emission lines are detectably resolved on scales(15-160) arcsec. the gas in the inner arcmin of m87 has a multi-phasestructure, as indicated by the similarity of the emission line profiles of fe lshell ions with widely separated ionization potentials. the global fe lspectrum is approximately consistent with an isothermal plasma at kt_e ~ 1.8kev, in addition to a component with a temperature distribution appropriate toan isobaric cooling flow, but with a minimum temperature cutoff of kt_min ~ 600ev. the behaviour of this cooling-flow component is qualitatively similar towhat is seen in other cooling flow clusters. finally, we do not find any strongevidence for a spatial variation in abundances due to resonance scatteringredistribution in the inner arcminute of the core.

astro-ph;0307370	chandra observations of point sources in abell 2255	in our search for ``hidden'' agn we present results from a chandraobservation of the nearby cluster abell 2255. eight cluster galaxies areassociated with point-like x-ray emission, and we classify these galaxies basedon their x-ray, radio, and optical properties. at least three are associatedwith active galactic nuclei (agn) with no optical signatures of nuclearactivity, with a further two being potential agn. of the potential agn, onecorresponds to a galaxy with a post-starburst optical spectrum. the remainingthree x-ray detected cluster galaxies consist of two starbursts and anelliptical with luminous hot gas. of the eight cluster galaxies five areassociated with luminous (massive) galaxies and the remaining three lie in muchlower luminosity systems. we note that the use of x-ray to optical flux ratiosfor classification of x-ray sources is often misleading, and strengthen theclaim that the fraction of cluster galaxies hosting an agn based on opticaldata is signficantly lower than the fraction based on x-ray and radio data.

astro-ph;0308238	the changing agn population	we investigate how the fraction of broad-line sources in the agn populationchanges with x-ray luminosity and redshift. we first construct the rest-framehard-energy (2-8 kev) x-ray luminosity function (hxlf) at z=0.1-1 using chandralockman hole-northwest wide-area data, chandra deep field-north 2 ms data,other chandra deep field data, and the asca large sky survey data. we find thatbroad-line agns dominate above 3e43 ergs/s and have a mean luminosity of 1.3e44ergs/s. type ii agns can only become an important component of the x-raypopulation at seyfert-like x-ray luminosities. we then construct z=0.1-0.5 andz=0.5-1 hxlfs and compare them with both the local hxlf measured from heao-1 a2survey data and the z=1.5-3 hxlf measured from soft-energy (0.5-2 kev) chandraand rosat data. we find that the number density of &gt;1e44 ergs/s sources(quasars) steadily declines with decreasing redshift, while the number densityof 1e43-1e44 ergs/s sources peaks at z=0.5-1. strikingly, however, the numberdensity of broad-line agns remains roughly constant with redshift while theiraverage luminosities decline at the lower redshifts, showing another example ofcosmic downsizing.

astro-ph;0309166	intermediate element abundances in galaxy clusters	we present the average abundances of the intermediate elements obtained byperforming a stacked analysis of all the galaxy clusters in the archive of thex-ray telescope asca. we determine the abundances of fe, si, s, and ni as afunction of cluster temperature (mass) from 1--10 kev, and place strong upperlimits on the abundances of ca and ar. in general, si and ni are overabundantwith respect to fe, while ar and ca are very underabundant. the discrepancybetween the abundances of si, s, ar, and ca indicate that the alpha-elements donot behave homogeneously as a single group. we show that the abundances of themost well-determined elements fe, si, and s in conjunction with recenttheoretical supernovae yields do not give a consistent solution for thefraction of material produced by type ia and type ii supernovae at anytemperature or mass. the general trend is for higher temperature clusters tohave more of their metals produced in type ii supernovae than in type ias. theinconsistency of our results with abundances in the milky way indicate thatspiral galaxies are not the dominant metal contributors to the intraclustermedium (icm). the pattern of elemental abundances requires an additional sourceof metals beyond standard snia and snii enrichment. the properties of this newsource are well matched to those of type ii supernovae with very massive,metal-poor progenitor stars. these results are consistent with a significantfraction of the icm metals produced by an early generation of population iiistars.

astro-ph;0309807	constraints on the energy content of the universe from a combination of  galaxy cluster observables	we demonstrate that constraints on cosmological parameters from thedistribution of clusters as a function of redshift (dn/dz) are complementary toaccurate angular diameter distance (d_a) measurements to clusters, and theircombination significantly tightens constraints on the energy density content ofthe universe. the number counts can be obtained from x-ray and/or sz(sunyaev-zel'dovich effect) surveys, and the angular diameter distances can bedetermined from deep observations of the intra-cluster gas using their thermalbremsstrahlung x-ray emission and the sz effect. we combine constraints fromsimulated cluster number counts expected from a 12 deg^2 sz cluster survey andconstraints from simulated angular diameter distance measurements based on thex-ray/sz method assuming a statistical accuracy of 10% in the angular diameterdistance determination of 100 clusters with redshifts less than 1.5. we findthat omega_m can be determined within about 25%, omega_lambda within 20%, and wwithin 16%. we show that combined dn/dz + d_a constraints can be used toconstrain the different energy densities in the universe even in the presenceof a few percent redshift dependent systematic error in d_a. we also addressthe question of how best to select clusters of galaxies for accurate diameterdistance determinations. we show that the joint dn/dz + d_a constraints oncosmological parameters for a fixed target accuracy in the energy densityparameters are optimized by selecting clusters with redshift upper cut--offs inthe range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.

astro-ph;0410149	a deep chandra observation of the groth strip. i. the x-ray data	we present the results of a 200 ks chandra observation of part of the grothstrip region, using the acis-i instrument. we present a relatively simplemethod for the detection of point-sources and calculation of limitingsensitivities, which we argue is at least as sensitive and more self-consistentthan previous methods presented in the literature. 158 distinct x-ray sourcesare included in our point-source catalogue in the acis-i area. the numbercounts show a relative dearth of x-ray sources in this region. for example at aflux limit of 1e-15 (cgs) around 20 per cent more soft band sources aredetected in the hdf-n and almost 50 per cent more in the elais-n1 field, whichwe have analysed by the same method for comparison. we find, however, thatthese differences are consistent with poisson variations at 2 sigmasignificance, and therefore there is no evidence for cosmic variance based onthese number counts alone. we determine the average spectra of the objects andfind a marked difference between the soft-band selected sources, which havegamma=1.9 typical of unobscured agn, and the hard-band selected sources, whichhave gamma=1.0. reassuringly, the sample as a whole has a mean spectrum ofgamma=1.4\pm 0.1, the same as the x-ray background. nonetheless, our resultsimply that the fraction of sources with significant obscuration is only ~25 percent, much less than predicted by standard agn population synthesis models.this is confirmed by direct spectral fitting, with only a handful of objectsshowing evidence for absorption. after accounting for absorption, all objectsare consistent with mean intrinsic spectrum of gamma=1.76 \pm 0.08, verysimilar to local seyferts (abridged).

0808.4154	constraining the agn contribution in a multiwavelength study of seyfert  galaxies	we have studied the relationship between the high- and low-ionization [o iv]lambda 25.89 micron, [ne iii] lambda 15.56 micron and [ne ii] lambda 12.81micron emission lines with the aim of constraining the active galactic nuclei(agn) and star formation contributions for a sample of 103 seyfert galaxies. weused the [o iv] and [ne ii] emission as tracers for the agn power and starformation to investigate the ionization state of the emission-line gas. we findthat seyfert 2 galaxies have, on average, lower [o iv]/[ne ii] ratios thanthose of seyfert 1 galaxies. this result suggests two possible scenarios: 1)seyfert 2 galaxies have intrinsically weaker agn, or 2) seyfert 2 galaxies haverelatively higher star formation rates than seyfert 1 galaxies. we estimate thefraction of [ne ii] directly associated with the agn and find that seyfert 2galaxies have a larger contribution from star formation, by a factor of ~1.5 onaverage, than what is found in seyfert 1 galaxies. using the stellar componentof [ne ii] as a tracer of the current star formation we found similar starformation rates in seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies. we examined the mid- andfar-infrared continua and find that [ne ii] is well correlated with thecontinuum luminosity at 60 micron and that both [ne iii] and [o iv] are bettercorrelated with the 25 micron luminosities than with the continuum at longerwavelengths, suggesting that the mid-infrared continuum luminosity is dominatedby the agn, while the far-infrared luminosity is dominated by star formation.overall, these results test the unified model of agn, and suggest that thedifferences between seyfert galaxies cannot be solely due to viewing angledependence.

astro-ph;0410527	the cosmic evolution of hard x-ray selected active galactic nuclei	we use highly spectroscopically complete deep and wide-area chandra surveysto determine the cosmic evolution of hard x-ray-selected agns. we determinehard x-ray luminosity functions (hxlfs) for all spectral types and forbroad-line agns (blagns) alone. at z&lt;1.2, both are well described by pureluminosity evolution. thus, all agns drop in luminosity by almost an order ofmagnitude over this redshift range. we show that this observed drop is due toagn downsizing. we directly compare our blagn hxlfs with the optical qso lfsand find that the optical qso lfs do not probe faint enough to see the downturnin the blagn hxlfs. we rule out galaxy dilution as a partial explanation forthe observation that blagns dominate the number densities at the higher x-rayluminosities, while optically-narrow agns (fwhm&lt;2000 km/s) dominate at thelower x-ray luminosities by measuring the nuclear uv/optical properties of thechandra sources using the hst acs goods-north data. the uv/optical nuclei ofthe optically-narrow agns are much weaker than expected if they were similar tothe blagns. we therefore postulate the need for a luminosity dependent unifiedmodel. alternatively, the blagns and the optically-narrow agns could beintrinsically different source populations. we cover both interpretations byconstructing composite spectral energy distributions--including long-wavelengthdata from the mir to the submillimeter--by spectral type and by x-rayluminosity. we use these to infer the bolometric corrections (from hard x-rayluminosities to bolometric luminosities) needed to map the accretion history.we determine the accreted supermassive black hole mass density for all spectraltypes and for blagns alone using the observed evolution of the hard x-rayenergy density production rate and our inferred bolometric corrections.

astro-ph;9603091	the x-ray spectral variability of mrk 766	analysis results from asca and rosat observations of the narrow-line seyfert1 galaxy mrk 766 are reported. in the asca observation we observed rapidvariability with a doubling time scale of 1000 seconds. a spectral variabilityevent was observed in which the spectrum softened and hardened above and below~1 kev, respectively, as the flux increased. the spectra could be modeled with5 components: a power law, warm absorber, iron k(alpha) line and soft excesscomponent flux. the spectral variability resulted from a highly significantchange in the intrinsic photon law index from gamma ~1.6 to ~2.0, an increasein the warm absorber ionization, and a marginally significant decrease in thesoft component normalization. a ~100 ev equivalent width narrow iron k(alpha)line was detected in the high state spectrum. spectral hardening during fluxincreases was observed in three rosat observations.  the change in intrinsic photon index and disappearance of the soft excesscomponent in the asca spectra can be explained as a transition from a firstorder pair reprocessed spectrum to a pair cascade brought about by a suddenincrease in the injected electron lorentz factor. the change in the ionizationof the warm absorber, though model dependent, could correspond to the increasein flux at the oxygen edges resulting from the spectral index change. the rosatspectral variability can be interpreted by variable intensity hard power lawand a relatively nonvarying soft component, possibly primary disk emission.these results are compared with those reported from other narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies.

astro-ph;9703039	the luminosity-temperature relation at z=0.4 for clusters of galaxies	we have obtained the first large sample of accurate temperatures for clustersat z&gt;0.14 from asca. we compare the luminosity temperature (l-t) distributionfor these clusters with the low redshift sample of david et al (1993) and findthat there is no evidence for evolution. we also find that the intrinsicvariance in this relation is roughly constant with redshift. additionally,there is no detectable change in the relationship of optical velocitydispersion to x-ray temperature with redshift. most cosmological simulationsdriven primarily by gravity predict substantial changes in the l-t relation dueto the recent rapid growth of clusters. our results are consistent either withmodels in which the cluster core entropy is dominated by pre-heating, or withlow omega models in which cluster structure does not evolve strongly with time.the intrinsic variance in the l-t relation at a fixed redshift can be due avariety of possibilites e.g. a change in the baryonic fraction from cluster tocluster, variation in the fraction of the total energy in the system arisingfrom shocks or supernova heating or variations in the emission measuredistributions in multiphase gas.

astro-ph;9705087	asca observations of type-2 seyfert galaxies: ii. the importance of  x-ray scattering and reflection	we discuss the importance of x-ray scattering and compton reflection intype-2 seyfert galaxies, based upon the analysis of asca observations of 25such sources. consideration of the iron kalpha, [o iii] line and x-rayvariability suggest that ngc 1068, ngc 4945, ngc 2992, mrk 3, mrk 463e and mrk273 are dominated by reprocessed x-rays. we examine the properties of thesesources in more detail.  we find that the iron kalpha complex contains significant contributions fromneutral and high-ionization species of iron. compton reflection, hot gas andstarburst emission all appear to make significant contributions to the observedx-ray spectra.  mrk 3 is the only source in this subsample which does not have a significantstarburst contamination. the asca spectrum below 3 kev is dominated by hotscattering gas with u_x ~ 5, n_h ~ 4 x 10^23 cm^-2. this material is morehighly ionized than the zone of material comprising the warm absorber seen inseyfert~1 galaxies, but may contain a contribution from shock-heated gasassociated with the jet. estimates of the x-ray scattering fraction cover 0.25- 5%. the spectrum above 3 kev appears to be dominated by a compton reflectioncomponent although there is evidence that the primary continuum componentbecomes visible close to 10 kev.

astro-ph;9707078	rosat, asca and osse observations of the broad line radio galaxy 3c120	we present simultaneous observations of the superluminal radio galaxy 3c120performed with the asca and gro (osse) satellites on february-march 1994, aswell as an analysis of all the rosat archival data. the asca spectrum of thisobject can be described by an absorbed (n_h=1.6e^21 cm^-2) power law withphoton index gamma_asca=2 and a very broad sigma&gt;0.8 kev intense iron line(ew&gt;400 ev) at ~ 6 kev. the combined asca--osse data do not exclude thepresence of a narrower (sigma=0.4 kev) and less intense (ew&lt;300 ev) iron lineplus a hard component, corresponding either to reflection from an accretiondisk or to a flatter power law from a jet. however a single power law plusbroad fe line is preferred from a statistical point of view by the asca data.the rosat data yield a column density in excess of the galactic value. thespectral slopes, ranging from gamma_rosat=2.5 to 3.3, are steeper than thatmeasured by asca, suggesting the presence of a soft excess. the 0.1-2 kevpower-law slope is variable and softer at higher intensity. these results showthat the combined soft and hard x-ray spectrum of 3c120 is rather complex. theintrinsic absorption, the soft excess, and the iron line indicate that thex-ray emission from this blazar-like radio galaxy is dominated by aseyfert-like component, at least in the 0.1-10kev energy band. the jetcontribution, if present, becomes important only at higher energies.

astro-ph;9708034	evidence for absorption due to highly-ionized gas in the radio-quiet  quasar pg 1114+445	we present results on the x-ray spectrum of the quasar pg 1114+445 from anasca observation performed in 1996 june, and a rosat observation performed 3years earlier. we show good agreement between all the datasets can be obtainedif the underlying continuum in the 0.2--10 kev band is assumed to be a powerlaw(photon index gamma approx 1.8) absorbed by photoionized material. the ionizedgas imprints deep absorption edges in the observed spectrum &lt;~ 2 kev due toovii and oviii, from which we determine its column density (approx 2e22cm^{-2}) and ionization parameter (ux approx 0.1) to be similar to thatobserved in seyfert-i galaxies. unfortunately these data do not allow anystrong constraints to be placed on the location, or solid angle subtended bythe material at the ionizing source. we also find evidence for absorption inthe fe k-shell band in excess of that predicted from the lower energy features.this implies an fe/o abundance ratio approx 10 times the cosmic value, or anadditional screen of more-highly ionized gas, possibly out-flowing from thenucleus. we briefly compare our results with those obtained from other activegalaxies.

astro-ph;9708046	asca observations of seyfert 1 galaxies: iii. the evidence for  absorption &amp; emission due to photoionized gas	(abridged) we present the results from a detailed analysis of the 0.6 - 10kev spectra of 23 asca observations of 18 objects. we find that in most casesthe underlying continuum can be well-represented by a powerlaw with a photonindex gamma approx 2. however we find strong evidence for photoionized gas inthe line-of-sight to 13/18 objects. we present detailed modelling of this gasbased upon the ion photoionization code. we find the x-ray ionization parameterfor the ionized material is strongly peaked at ux approx 0.1. the columndensities of ionized material are typically in the range n_{h,z} approx10^{21}--10^{23} cm^{-2}, although highly ionized column densities up to10^{24} cm^{-2} cannot be excluded in some cases. we also investigate theimportance of the emission-spectrum from the ionized gas, finding that itsignificantly improves the fit to many sources with an intensity consistentwith material subtending a large solid angle at the central source. a deficitof counts is observed at approx 1 kev in the sources exhibiting the strongestabsorption features. we suggest this is likely to be the signature of a secondzone of (more highly) ionized gas, which might have been seen previously in thedeep fe k-shell edges observed in some ginga observations. we find evidencethat the ionized material in ngc 3227 and mcg-6-30-15 contains embedded dust,whilst there is no such evidence in the other sources

astro-ph;9803051	asca observations of the ionized gas in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3783	we present the results from asca observations of ngc 3783 carried out during1993 and 1996. variability is observed both between the two epochs and withinthe individual observations, the latter due to a non-stationary process.  we find the spectra at both epochs to contain features due to absorption byionized material, predominantly due to ovii and oviii. we find the opacity forsuch material to decrease by a factor approx 2 in the approx 0.7--1.0 kev bandbetween the epochs while the photoionizing flux increases by approx25%. bycomparison with detailed photoionization models we show this behaviour isinconsistent with that expected from a single-zone of photoionized gas. adeficit in the data compared to such models, consistent with excess absorptionby oviii, supports the suggestion that the material consists of two or morezones.  significant fe k-shell emission is also observed during both epochs. we showthis emission is dominated by the asymmetric line profile expected from theinnermost regions of the accretion flow. we find no evidence that the feemission varied in either shape or equivalent width between the two epochs.

astro-ph;9804135	new constraints on the continuum-emission mechanism of agn: intensive  monitoring of ngc 7469 in the x-ray and ultraviolet	we have undertaken near-continuous monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc7469 in the x-ray with rxte over a ~30d baseline. the source shows strongvariability with a root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of ~16 per cent, andpeak-to-peak variations of a factor of order 2. simultaneous data over thisperiod were obtained in the ultraviolet (uv) using iue, making this the mostintensive x-ray uv/x-ray variability campaign performed for any active galaxy.comparison of the continuum light curves reveals very similar amplitudes ofvariability, but different variability characteristics, with the x-rays showingmuch more rapid variations. the data are not strongly correlated at zero lag.the largest absolute value of the correlation coefficient occurs for ananticorrelation between the two bands, with the x-ray variations leading the uvby ~4d. the largest positive correlation is for the ultraviolet to lead thex-rays by ~4d. neither option appears to be compatible with any simpleinterband transfer function. the peak positive correlation at ~4d occursbecause the more prominent peaks in the uv light curve appear to lead those inthe x-rays by this amount. however, the minima of the light curves arenear-simultaneous. these observations provide new constraints on theoreticalmodels of the central regions of active galactic nuclei. models in which theobserved uv emission is produced solely by re-radiation of absorber x-rays areruled out by our data, as are those in which the x-rays are produced solely bycompton upscattering of the observed uv component by a constant distribution ofparticles.

astro-ph;9806392	the x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 3227	(abridged) we present the results from {\it asca} observations of ngc 3227along with those from a {\it rosat} observation. the 0.6--10 kev continuum isconsistent with a powerlaw with $\gamma \sim 1.6$, flatter than that typicallyobserved in seyfert galaxies. fe $k$-shell emission is observed with an ew andprofile typical of seyfert 1 galaxies. the {\it asca} observations in 1993reveal absorption by a screen $n_{h,z}^{ion} \simeq 3\times10^{21} cm^{-2}}$ ofionized material with $u_x \simeq 0.01$. joint analysis of the {\it asca} and{\it rosat} data show an additional screen of neutral material instrinsic tongc 3227 with $n_{h,z}^{neu} \sim $few$\times10^{20} cm^{-2}}$. ngc 3227exhibits spectral variability both within and between the observations, due toshort-term variability in the continuum emission and longer-term variability inthe absorption. time-resolved spectroscopy show the continuum steepened by$\delta \gamma \simeq 0.1$ during a flare of duration $\sim 10^4$s. the columnincreased by a factor of $\sim10$ by the 1995 epoch, while the continuum isconsistent with that observed in 1993. the 1995 data also show evidence thatthe warm absorber allows $\sim$10% of the nuclear emission to escape withoutattenuation.

astro-ph;9812477	rxte hard x-ray observation of a754: constraining the hottest  temperature component and the intracluster magnetic field	abell 754, a cluster undergoing merging, was observed in hard x-rays with therossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) in order to constrain its hottesttemperature component and search for evidence of nonthermal emission.simultaneous modeling of rxte data and those taken with previous missionsyields an average intracluster temperature of $\sim 9$ kev in the 1-50 kevenergy band. a multi-temperature component model derived from numericalsimulations of the evolution of a cluster undergoing a merger produces similarquality of fit, indicating that the emission measure from the very hot gascomponent is sufficiently small that it renders the two modelsindistinguishable. no significant nonthermal emission was detected. however,our observations set an upper limit of $7.1 \times 10^{-14} ergs/(cm^2 s kev)$(90% confidence limit) to the nonthermal emission flux at 20 kev. combiningthis result with the radio synchrotron emission flux we find a lower limit of0.2 $\mu$g for the intracluster magnetic field. we discuss the implications ofour results for the theories of magnetic field amplifications in clustermergers.

astro-ph;9901023	the nature of accreting black holes in nearby galaxy nuclei	we have found compact x-ray sources in the center of 21 (54%) of 39 nearbyface-on spiral and elliptical galaxies with available rosat hri data. rosatx-ray luminosities (0.2 - 2.4 kev) of these compact x-ray sources are ~ 1e37 -1e40 erg/s (with a mean of 3e39 erg/s. the mean displacement between thelocation of the compact x-ray source and the optical photometric center of thegalaxy is ~ 390 pc. the fact that compact nuclear sources were found in nearlyall (five of six) galaxies with previous evidence for a black hole or an agnindicates that at least some of the x-ray sources are accreting supermassiveblack holes. asca spectra of six of the 21 galaxies show the presence of a hardcomponent with relatively steep (gamma approx 2.5) spectral slope. a multicolordisk blackbody model fits the data from the spiral galaxies well, suggestingthat the x-ray object in these galaxies may be similar to a black holecandidate in its soft (high) state. asca data from the elliptical galaxiesindicate that hot (kt approx 0.7 kev) gas dominates the emission. the fact that(for both spiral and elliptical galaxies) the spectral slope is steeper than innormal type 1 agns and that relatively low absorbing columns (n_h approx 1e21/cm2) were found to the power-law component indicates that these objects aresomehow geometrically and/or physically different from agns in normal activegalaxies. the x-ray sources in the spiral and elliptical galaxies may be blackhole x-ray binaries, low-luminosity agns, or possibly young x-ray luminoussupernovae. assuming the sources in the spiral galaxies are accreting blackholes in their soft state, we estimate black hole masses ~ 1e2 - 1e4 solarmasses.

astro-ph;9905365	an x-ray spectral survey of radio-loud agn with asca	we present a uniform and systematic analysis of the 0.6-10 kev x-ray spectraof radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) observed by asca. the sample 10blrgs, 5 qsrs, 9 nlrgs, and 10 rgs. at soft x-rays, about half of the nlrgs andall of the rgs exhibit a thermal plasma component, with a bimodal distributionof temperatures and luminosities, suggesting an origin either in a surroundingcluster or loose group or in a hot corona. at energies above 2 kev, a hardpower-law component is detected in 90% of cases. the power-law photon indicesand luminosities in blrgs, qsrs, and nlrgs are similar, consistent withorientation-based unification schemes. significant excess cold absorption isdetected in most nlrgs, but also in some blrgs and qsrs, which was somewhatunexpected. in contrast to seyfert galaxies, only one object showss thesignature of a warm absorber. the nuclear x-ray luminosity is correlated withthe luminosity of the [o iii] emission line, the fir emission at 12 microns,and the lobe radio power at 5 ghz. the fe k line is detected in 50% of blrgs,one qsr, and a handful of nlrgs. this sample also includes 6 weak line radiogalaxies (wlrgs). their spectra wlrgs can be generally decomposed into a softthermal component with hard absrorbed power-law component, which issignificantly flatter than any other radio-loud agns. their intrinsicluminosities are two orders of magnitude lower than in other sources of thesample. an interesting possibility is that wlrgs represent an extremepopulation of radio galaxies in which the central black hole is accreting at arate well below the eddington rate.

astro-ph;9911340	asca observations of "type 2" liners: evidence for a stellar source of  ionization	we present asca observations of liners without broad h$\alpha$ emission intheir optical spectra. the sample of "type 2" liners consists of ngc 404, 4111,4192, 4457, and 4569. we have detected x-ray emission from all the objectsexcept for ngc 404; among the detected objects are two so-called transitionobjects (ngc 4192 and ngc 4569), which have been postulated to be compositenuclei having both an hii region and a liner component. the images of ngc 4111and ngc 4569 in the soft (0.5-2 kev) and hard (2-7 kev) x-ray bands areextended on scales of several kpc. the x-ray spectra of ngc 4111, ngc 4457 andngc 4569 are well fitted by a two-component model that consists of soft thermalemission with $kt\sim0.65$ kev and a hard component represented by a power law(photon index $\sim$ 2) or by thermal bremsstrahlung emission ($kt\sim$ severalkev). the extended hard x-rays probably come from discrete sources, while thesoft emission most likely originates from hot gas produced by active starformation in the host galaxy. we have found no clear evidence for the presenceof active galactic nuclei (agns) in the sample. if an agn component is theprimary ionization source of the optical emission lines, then it must beheavily obscured with a column density significantly larger than $10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. alternatively, the optical emission could be ionized by a populationof exceptionally hot stars.
