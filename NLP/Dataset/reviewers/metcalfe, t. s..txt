0902.2966	temporal variability of stars and stellar systems	although the sun is our closest star by many orders of magnitude and despitehaving sunspot records stretching back to ancient china, our knowledge of thesun's magnetic field is far from complete. indeed, even now, after decades ofstudy, the most obvious manifestations of magnetic fields in the sun (e.g.sunspots, flares and the corona) are scarcely understood at all. these failuresin spite of intense effort suggest that to improve our grasp of magnetic fieldsin stars and of astrophysical dynamos in general, we must broaden our base ofexamples beyond the sun; we must study stars with a variety of ages, masses,rotation rates, and other properties, so we can test models against as broad arange of circumstances as possible. over the next decade, an array of indirecttechniques will be supplemented by rapidly maturing new capabilities such asgyrochronology, asteroseismology and precision photometry from space, whichwill transform our understanding of the temporal variability of stars andstellar systems. in this white paper we will outline some of the key sciencequestions in this area along with the techniques that could be used to bringnew insights to these questions.

0903.3384	low-energy astrophysics: stimulating the reduction of energy consumption  in the next decade	in this paper we address the consumption of energy by astronomers whileperforming their professional duties. although we find that astronomy uses anegligible fraction of the us energy budget, the rate at which energy isconsumed by an average astronomer is similar to that of a typical high-flyingbusinessperson. we review some of the ways in which astronomers are alreadyacting to reduce their energy consumption. in the coming decades, all citizenswill have to reduce their energy consumption to conserve fossil fuel reservesand to help avert a potentially catastrophic change in the earth's climate. thechallenges are the same for astronomers as they are for everyone: decreasingthe distances we travel and investing in energy-efficient infrastructure. thehigh profile of astronomy in the media, and the great public interest in ourfield, can play a role in promoting energy-awareness to the wider population.our specific recommendations are therefore to 1) reduce travel when possible,through efficient meeting organization, and by investing in high-bandwidthvideo conference facilities and virtual-world software, 2) createenergy-efficient observatories, computing centers and workplaces, powered bysustainable energy resources, and 3) actively publicize these pursuits.

0903.4854	pulsation modes in rapidly rotating stellar models based on the  self-consistent field method	context: new observational means such as the space missions corot and keplerand ground-based networks are and will be collecting stellar pulsation datawith unprecedented accuracy. a significant fraction of the stars in whichpulsations are observed are rotating rapidly.  aims: our aim is to characterise pulsation modes in rapidly rotating stellarmodels so as to be able to interpret asteroseismic data from such stars.  methods: the pulsation code developed in ligni\`eres et al. (2006) and reeseet al. (2006) is applied to stellar models based on the self-consistent field(scf) method (jackson et al. 2004, 2005, macgregor et al. 2007).  results: pulsation modes in scf models follow a similar behaviour to those inuniformly rotating polytropic models, provided that the rotation profile is nottoo differential. pulsation modes fall into different categories, the threemain ones being island, chaotic, and whispering gallery modes, which arerotating counterparts to modes with low, medium, and high l-|m| values,respectively. the frequencies of the island modes follow an asymptotic patternquite similar to what was found for polytropic models. extending thisasymptotic formula to higher azimuthal orders reveals more subtle behaviour asa function of m and provides a first estimate of the average advection ofpulsation modes by rotation. further calculations based on a variationalprinciple confirm this estimate and provide rotation kernels that could be usedin inversion methods. when the rotation profile becomes highly differential, itbecomes more and more difficult to find island and whispering gallery modes atlow azimuthal orders. at high azimuthal orders, whispering gallery modes, andin some cases island modes, reappear.

0704.1275	on the structure and properties of differentially rotating main-sequence  stars in the 1-2 m_sun range	we conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models forchemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass1-2 m_sun. the models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation ofthe self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structurefor a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] relative tononrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminositiesand effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreasedpolar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending onthe degree of differential rotation. for a fixed ratio of the axial rotationrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotationgenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can leadto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 m_sun (2 m_sun) model, afeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. the positions ofdifferentially rotating models for a given mass m in the h-r diagram can beshifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating zams over ranges inluminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval betweenm and about 0.7 m. we briefly note a few of the implications of these results,including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between theproperties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) areduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating sun, (iii) thenuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layersbeneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-likeoscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some1.5-2 m_sun stars.

0905.4889	mode identification in rapidly rotating stars	context: recent calculations of pulsation modes in rapidly rotatingpolytropic models and models based on the self-consistent field method(macgregor et al. 2007) have shown that the frequency spectrum of low degreepulsation modes can be described by an empirical formula similar to tassoul'sasymptotic formula (tassoul 1980), provided that the underlying rotationprofile is not too differential (lignieres &amp; georgeot 2008, reese et al. 2009).  aims: given the simplicity of this asymptotic formula, we investigate whetherit can provide a means by which to identify pulsation modes in rapidly rotatingstars.  methods: we develop a new mode identification scheme which consists inscanning a multidimensional parameter space for the formula coefficients whichyield the best-fitting asymptotic spectra. this mode identification scheme isthen tested on artificial spectra based on the asymptotic formula, on randomfrequencies and on spectra based on full numerical eigenmode calculations forwhich the mode identification is known beforehand. we also investigate theeffects of adding random frequencies to mimic the effects of chaotic modeswhich are also expected to show up in such stars (lignieres &amp; georgeot 2008).

0906.5441	sounding stellar cycles with kepler - i. strategy for selecting targets	the long-term monitoring and high photometric precision of the keplersatellite will provide a unique opportunity to sound the stellar cycles of manysolar-type stars using asteroseismology. this can be achieved by studyingperiodic changes in the amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillation modesobserved in these stars. by comparing these measurements with conventionalground-based chromospheric activity indices, we can improve our understandingof the relationship between chromospheric changes and those taking place deepin the interior throughout the stellar activity cycle. in addition,asteroseismic measurements of the convection zone depth and differentialrotation may help us determine whether stellar cycles are driven at the top orat the base of the convection zone. in this paper, we analyze the precisionthat will be possible using kepler to measure stellar cycles, convection zonedepths, and differential rotation. based on this analysis, we describe astrategy for selecting specific targets to be observed by the keplerasteroseismic investigation for the full length of the mission, to optimizetheir suitability for probing stellar cycles in a wide variety of solar-typestars.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

0708.3703	testing the evolution of the db white dwarf gd 358: first results of a  new approach using asteroseismology	we present a new method that investigates the evolutionary history of thepulsating db white dwarf gd358 using asteroseismology. this is done consideringthe internal c/o profile, which describes the relative abundances of carbon andoxygen from the core of the star to its surface. different evolutionarychannels lead to the generation of different c/o profiles, and these affect thepulsation periods. we used c/o profiles associated with white dwarfs thatevolved through binary evolution channels where the progenitor experienced oneor two episodes of mass loss during one or two common envelope (ce) phases, andtwo profiles from single star evolution. we computed models using thesedifferent profiles and used a genetic algorithm (ga) to optimize the search inthe parameter space in order to find the best-fit to the observed pulsationperiods. we used three-parameter models, adjusting the stellar mass, theeffective temperature, and the helium mass of the external layer. our resultssuggest that binary evolution profiles may provide a better match to thepulsation periods of gd 358. the best-fit to the observations is obtained usinga profile related to an evolutionary history where two episodes of mass losshappen during two ce phases. the best-fit model has a mass close to the meanmass for db white dwarfs found in various works, and a temperature consistentwith uv spectra obtained with the iue satellite.

1010.4329	a precise asteroseismic age and radius for the evolved sun-like star kic  11026764	the primary science goal of the kepler mission is to provide a census ofexoplanets in the solar neighborhood, including the identification andcharacterization of habitable earth-like planets. the asteroseismiccapabilities of the mission are being used to determine precise radii and agesfor the target stars from their solar-like oscillations. chaplin et al. (2010)published observations of three bright g-type stars, which were monitoredduring the first 33.5 days of science operations. one of these stars, thesubgiant kic 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillationfrequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. we have derivedasteroseismic estimates of the properties of kic 11026764 from keplerphotometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. we present theresults of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independentcodes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopicconstraints simultaneously. we determine both the radius and the age of kic11026764 with a precision near 1%, and an accuracy near 2% for the radius and15% for the age. continued observations of this star promise to revealadditional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determinationof its fundamental properties.

1011.3028	constraints of a pulsation frequency on stellar parameters in the  eclipsing spectroscopic binary system: v577 oph	we present a preliminary spectroscopic analysis of the binary system v577oph,observed during the summer of 2007 on the 2.6m not telescope on la palma. wehave obtained time series spectroscopic observations, which show clear binarymotion as well as radial velocity variations due to pulsation in the primarystar. by modelling the radial velocities we determine a full orbital solutionof the system, which yields m_a sin^3 i = 1.562 +/- 0.012 m_solar and m_b sin^3i = 1.461 +/- 0.020 m_solar. an estimate of inclination from photometry yieldsa primary mass of 1.6 m_solar. using this derived mass, and the known pulsationfrequency we can impose a lower limit of 1 gyr on the age of the system, andconstrain the parameters of the oscillation mode. we show that with furtheranalysis of the spectra (extracting the atmospheric parameters), tighterconstraints could be imposed on the age, metallicity and the mode parameters.this work emphasizes the power that a single pulsation frequency can have forconstraining stellar parameters in an eclipsing binary system.

1105.1045	constraining the properties of delta scuti stars using spectroscopic  eclipsing binary systems	many stars exhibit stellar pulsations, favoring them for asteroseismicanalyses. interpreting the oscillations requires some knowledge of theoscillation mode geometry (spherical degree, radial and azimuthal orders). thedelta scuti stars (1.5 - 2.5 m_sol) often show just one or few pulsationfrequencies. although this may promise a successful seismological analysis, wemay not know enough about either the mode or the star to use the oscillationfrequency to improve the determination of the stellar model, or probe thestar's structure. for the observed frequencies to be used successfully asseismic probes of these objects, we need to concentrate on stars for which wecan reduce the number of free parameters in the problem, such as binary systemsor open clusters. we investigate how much our understanding of a delta scutistar is improved when it is in a detached eclipsing binary system instead ofbeing a single field star. we use singular value decomposition to explore theprecision we expect in stellar parameters (mass, age and chemical composition)for both cases. we examine how the parameter uncertainties propagate to theluminosity - effective temperature diagram and determine when the effort ofobtaining a new measurement is justified. we show that for the single star, acorrect identification of the oscillation mode is necessary to produce strongconstraints on the stellar model properties, while for the binary system theobservations without the pulsation mode provide the same or better constraintson the stellar parameters. in the latter case, ...

1211.6650	characterizing two solar-type kepler subgiants with asteroseismology:  kic10920273 and kic11395018	determining fundamental properties of stars through stellar modeling hasimproved substantially due to recent advances in asteroseismology. thanks tothe unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly corotand kepler, invaluable information is extracted from the high-precision stellaroscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possiblestellar models for a given set of classical observations. in this work, we havecharacterized two relatively faint stars, kic10920273 and kic11395018, usingoscillation data from kepler photometry and atmospheric constraints fromground-based spectroscopy. both stars have very similar atmospheric properties;however, using the individual frequencies extracted from the kepler data, wehave determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precisioncompared to that of earlier results. we found that both stars have left themain sequence and characterized them as follows: kic10920273 is aone-solar-mass star (m=1.00 +/- 0.04 m_sun), but much older than our sun(t=7.12 +/- 0.47 gyr), while kic11395018 is significantly more massive than thesun (m=1.27 +/- 0.04 m_sun) with an age close to that of the sun (t=4.57 +/-0.23 gyr). we confirm that the high lithium abundance reported for these starsshould not be considered to represent young ages, as we precisely determinedthem to be evolved subgiants. we discuss the use of surface lithium abundance,rotation and activity relations as potential age diagnostics.

1212.4425	magnetic activity cycles in the exoplanet host star epsilon eridani	the active k2 dwarf epsilon eri has been extensively characterized, both as ayoung solar analog and more recently as an exoplanet host star. as one of thenearest and brightest stars in the sky, it provides an unparalleled opportunityto constrain stellar dynamo theory beyond the sun. we confirm and document the3 year magnetic activity cycle in epsilon eri originally reported by hatzes andcoworkers, and we examine the archival data from previous observations spanning45 years. the data show coexisting 3 year and 13 year periods leading into abroad activity minimum that resembles a maunder minimum-like state, followed bythe resurgence of a coherent 3 year cycle. the nearly continuous activityrecord suggests the simultaneous operation of two stellar dynamos with cycleperiods of 2.95+/-0.03 years and 12.7+/-0.3 years, which by analogy with thesolar case suggests a revised identification of the dynamo mechanisms that areresponsible for the so-called "active" and "inactive" sequences as proposed bybohm-vitense. finally, based on the observed properties of epsilon eri we arguethat the rotational history of the sun is what makes it an outlier in thecontext of magnetic cycles observed in other stars (as also suggested by its lidepletion), and that a jovian-mass companion cannot be the universalexplanation for the solar peculiarities.

1302.3728	asteroseismic determination of obliquities of the exoplanet systems  kepler-50 and kepler-65	results on the obliquity of exoplanet host stars -- the angle between thestellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis -- provide importantdiagnostic information for theories describing planetary formation. here wepresent the first application of asteroseismology to the problem of stellarobliquity determination in systems with transiting planets and sun-like hoststars. we consider two systems observed by the nasa kepler mission which havemultiple transiting small (super-earth sized) planets: the previously reportedkepler-50 and a new system, kepler-65, whose planets we validate in this paper.both stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations. from the asteroseismicanalysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular tothe line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1-sigma levelto lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. we use statistical arguments to showthat coplanar orbits are favoured in both systems, and that the orientations ofthe planetary orbits and the stellar rotation axis are correlated.

1304.2772	stellar ages and convective cores in field main-sequence stars: first  asteroseismic application to two kepler targets	using asteroseismic data and stellar evolution models we make the firstdetection of a convective core in a kepler field main-sequence star, putting astringent constraint on the total size of the mixed zone and showing that extramixing beyond the formal convective boundary exists. in a slightly less massivetarget the presence of a convective core cannot be conclusively discarded, andthus its remaining main-sequence life time is uncertain. our results revealthat best-fit models found solely by matching individual frequencies ofoscillations corrected for surface effects do not always properly reproducefrequency combinations. moreover, slightly different criteria to define whatthe best-fit model is can lead to solutions with similar global properties butvery different interior structures. we argue that the use of frequency ratiosis a more reliable way to obtain accurate stellar parameters, and show that ouranalysis in field main-sequence stars can yield an overall precision of 1.5%,4%, and 10% in radius, mass and age, respectively. we compare our results withthose obtained from global oscillation properties, and discuss the possiblesources of uncertainties in asteroseismic stellar modeling where furtherstudies are still needed.

1305.1132	iota horologi, the first coronal activity cycle in a young solar-like  star	context: the shortest chromospheric (ca ii h&amp;k) activity cycle (1.6 yr) hasbeen recently discovered in the young (~600 myr) solar-like star iota hor.coronal x-ray activity cycles have only been discovered in a few stars otherthan the sun, all of them with an older age and a lower activity level thaniota hor. aims: we intended to find the x-ray coronal counterpart of thechromospheric cycle for i hor. this represents the first x-ray cycle observedin an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in thelife of a solar-like star. methods: we monitored i hor with xmm-newtonobservations spanning almost two years. the spectra of each observation are fitwith two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of thestar. results: we find a cyclic behavior in x-rays very similar to thecontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. the continuous chromospheric monitoringfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,apparently modulated by a longer term trend. the second cycle is disruptedprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaoticvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted againafter slightly more than one cycle. conclusions: we confirm the presence of anactivity cycle of ~1.6 yr in i hor both in x-rays and ca ii h&amp;k. it is likelysubject to the modulation of a longer, not yet constrained second cycle. the1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i hor representsthe most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found. thiscycle is probably representative of the first coronal cycles in the life of asolar-like star, at the age when life started on earth.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

1312.4907	measurement of acoustic glitches in solar-type stars from oscillation  frequencies observed by kepler	for the very best and brightest asteroseismic solar-type targets observed bykepler, the frequency precision is sufficient to determine the acoustic depthsof the surface convective layer and the helium ionization zone. such sharpfeatures inside the acoustic cavity of the star, which we call acousticglitches, create small oscillatory deviations from the uniform spacing offrequencies in a sequence of oscillation modes with the same spherical harmonicdegree. we use these oscillatory signals to determine the acoustic locations ofsuch features in 19 solar-type stars observed by the kepler mission. fourindependent groups of researchers utilized the oscillation frequenciesthemselves, the second differences of the frequencies and the ratio of thesmall and large separation to locate the base of the convection zone and thesecond helium ionization zone. despite the significantly different methods ofanalysis, good agreement was found between the results of these four groups,barring a few cases. these results also agree reasonably well with thelocations of these layers in representative models of the stars. these resultsfirmly establish the presence of the oscillatory signals in the asteroseismicdata and the viability of several techniques to determine the location ofacoustic glitches inside stars.

1312.6997	magnetic activity of f stars observed by kepler	the study of stellar activity is important because it can provide newconstraints for dynamo models, when combined with surface rotation rates andthe depth of the convection zone. we know that the dynamo mechanism, which isbelieved to be the main process to rule the magnetic cycle of solar-like starsat least, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation,convection, and magnetic field. the kepler mission has been collecting data fora large number of stars during 4 years allowing us to investigate magneticstellar cycles. we investigated the kepler light curves to look for magneticactivity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. based on the photometricdata we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magneticactivity of the stars. we selected a sample of 22 solar-like f stars that havea rotation period smaller than 12 days. we performed a time-frequency analysisusing the morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy. we computed the magneticindex s_ph as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index&lt;s_ph&gt; that is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of lengthfive times the rotation period of the star. we defined new indicators to takeinto account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for allthe stars, such as the contrast between high and low activity. we also inferredthe rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background. thisanalysis shows different types of behaviours in the 22 f stars. two stars showbehaviours very similar to magnetic activity cycles. five stars show long-livedspots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. twostars of our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in thetemporal variation of the magnetic proxies. finally the last group of starsshow magnetic activity (with presence of spots) but no sign of cycle.

1403.7155	rotation and magnetism of kepler pulsating solar-like stars. towards  asteroseismically calibrated age-rotation relations	kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observationsprovides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can bestudied for thousands of stars. because many of these old field stars also haveindependently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation andactivity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activityrelations. in particular, age-rotation relations generally lack goodcalibrators at old ages, a problem that this kepler sample of old-field starsis uniquely suited to address. we study the surface rotation and photometricmagnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence andthe subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. therotation period was determined by comparing the results from two differentanalysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of thetime-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function (acf) of the lightcurves. reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing theresults from two different sets of calibrated data and from the twocomplementary analyses. we report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets(excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurementsspan a range of 1 to 100 days. the photometric magnetic activity levels ofthese stars were computed, and for 61.5% of the dwarfs, this level is similarto the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. wedemonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very differentrotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating outdistinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. our sample ofcool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality isconsistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.

0803.1638	whole earth telescope observations of the hot helium atmosphere  pulsating white dwarf ec 20058-5234	we present the analysis of a total of 177h of high-quality opticaltime-series photometry of the helium atmosphere pulsating white dwarf (dbv) ec20058-5234. the bulk of the observations (135h) were obtained during a wetcampaign (xcov15) in july 1997 that featured coordinated observing from 4southern observatory sites over an 8-day period. the remaining data (42h) wereobtained in june 2004 at mt john observatory in nz over a one-week observingperiod. this work significantly extends the discovery observations of thislow-amplitude (few percent) pulsator by increasing the number of detectedfrequencies from 8 to 18, and employs a simulation procedure to confirm thereality of these frequencies to a high level of significance (1 in 1000). thenature of the observed pulsation spectrum precludes identification of uniquepulsation mode properties using any clearly discernable trends. however, wehave used a global modelling procedure employing genetic algorithm techniquesto identify the n, l values of 8 pulsation modes, and thereby obtainasteroseismic measurements of several model parameters, including the stellarmass (0.55 m_sun) and t_eff (~28200 k). these values are consistent with thosederived from published spectral fitting: t_eff ~ 28400 k and log g ~ 7.86. wealso present persuasive evidence from apparent rotational mode splitting fortwo of the modes that indicates this compact object is a relatively rapidrotator with a period of 2h. in direct analogy with the correspondingproperties of the hydrogen (dav) atmosphere pulsators, the stable low-amplitudepulsation behaviour of ec 20058 is entirely consistent with its inferredeffective temperature, which indicates it is close to the blue edge of the dbvinstability strip.

1501.06227	an ancient extrasolar system with five sub-earth-size planets	the chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii lessthan four earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts,which tend to be metal-rich. this implies that small, including earth-size,planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's historywhen metals were more scarce. we report kepler spacecraft observations ofkepler-444, a metal-poor sun-like star from the old population of the galacticthick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets withsizes between those of mercury and venus. we validate this system as a truefive-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailedcharacterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysisof the transit photometry. kepler-444 is the densest star with detectedsolar-like oscillations. we use asteroseismology to directly measure a preciseage of 11.2+/-1.0 gyr for the host star, indicating that kepler-444 formed whenthe universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldestknown system of terrestrial-size planets. we thus show that earth-size planetshave formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8-billion-year history,leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy.the age of kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among thehosts to the first galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint thebeginning of the era of planet formation.

1510.09023	rotation periods and seismic ages of kois - comparison with stars  without detected planets from kepler observations	one of the most difficult properties to derive for stars is their age. forcool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellarages from measured rotation pe- riods and hr diagram positions. these relationshave few calibrators with known ages for old, long rotation period stars. thereis a significant sample of old kepler objects of inter- est, or kois, whichhave both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismicmeasurements from which ages can be accurately derived. in this work wedetermine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating kois to bothcompare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets andenlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars. we use keplerphotometric light curves to derive the stellar surface rotation peri- ods whileages are obtained with asteroseismology using the asteroseismic modeling portalin which individual mode frequencies are combined with high-resolutionspectroscopic pa- rameters. we thus determine surface rotation periods and agesfor 11 planet-hosting stars, all over 2 gyr old. we find that theplanet-hosting stars exhibit a rotational behaviour that is consistent with thelatest age-rotation models and similar to the rotational behaviour of starswithout detected planets. we conclude that these old kois can be used to testand calibrate gyrochronology along with stars not known to host planets.

astro-ph;0502147	an asteroseismic test of diffusion theory in white dwarfs	the helium-atmosphere (db) white dwarfs are commonly thought to be thedescendants of the hotter pg1159 stars, which initially have uniform he/c/oatmospheres. in this evolutionary scenario, diffusion builds a pure he surfacelayer which gradually thickens as the star cools. in the temperature range ofthe pulsating db white dwarfs (t_eff ~ 25,000 k) this transformation is stilltaking place, allowing asteroseismic tests of the theory. we have obtaineddual-site observations of the pulsating db star cbs114, to complement existingobservations of the slightly cooler star gd358. we recover the 7 independentpulsation modes that were previously known, and we discover 4 new ones toprovide additional constraints on the models. we perform objective globalfitting of our updated double-layered envelope models to both sets ofobservations, leading to determinations of the envelope masses and pure hesurface layers that qualitatively agree with the expectations of diffusiontheory. these results provide new asteroseismic evidence supporting one of thecentral assumptions of spectral evolution theory, linking the db white dwarfsto pg1159 stars.

astro-ph;0609051	calibrating the solar dynamo: magnetic activity cycles of southern  sun-like stars	the solar magnetic activity cycle is responsible for periodic episodes ofsevere space weather, which can perturb satellite orbits, interfere withcommunications systems, and bring down power grids. much progress has recentlybeen made in forecasting the strength and timing of this 11-year cycle, using apredictive flux-transport dynamo model (dikpati 2005, dikpati et al. 2006). wecan strengthen the foundation of this model by extending it to matchobservations of similar magnetic activity cycles in other sun-like stars, whichexhibit variations in their ca ii h and k emission on time scales from 2.5 to25 years (baliunas et al. 1995). this broad range of cycle periods is thoughtto reflect differences in the rotational properties and the depth of thesurface convection zone for stars with various masses and ages.asteroseismology is now yielding direct measurements of these quantities forindividual stars, but the most promising asteroseismic targets are in thesouthern sky (alpha cen a, alpha cen b, beta hyi), while the existing activitycycle survey is confined to the north. we are initiating a long-term survey ofca ii h and k emission for a sample of 92 southern sun-like stars to measuretheir magnetic activity cycles and rotational properties, which will ultimatelyprovide independent tests of solar dynamo models.

astro-ph;0702270	the complementary roles of interferometry and asteroseismology in  determining the mass of solar-type stars	how important is an independent diameter measurement for the determination ofstellar parameters of solar-type stars? when coupled with seismic observables,how well can we determine the stellar mass? if we can determine the radius ofthe star to between 1% and 4%, how does this affect the theoreticaluncertainties? interferometry can provide an independent radius determinationand it has been suggested that we should expect at least a 4% precision on sucha measurement for nearby solar-type stars. this study aims to provide bothqualitative and quantitive answers to these questions for a star such as oursun, where seismic information will be available. we show that the importanceof an independent radius measurement depends on the combination of observablesavailable and the size of the measurement errors. it is important fordetermining all stellar parameters and in particular the mass, where a goodradius measurement can even allow us to determine the mass with a precisionbetter than 2%. our results also show that measuring the small frequencyseparation significantly improves the determination of the evolutionary stageand the mixing-length parameter.

astro-ph;9801023	the orbital and absolute magnitude distributions of main belt asteroids	we have developed a model-independent analytical method for debiasing thefour-dimensional (a,e,i,h) distribution obtained in any asteroid observationprogram and have applied the technique to results obtained with the 0.9mspacewatch telescope. from 1992 to 1995 spacewatch observed ~3740 deg^2 nearthe ecliptic and made observations of more than 60,000 asteroids to a limitingmagnitude of v~21. the debiased semi-major axis and inclination distributionsof main belt asteroids in this sample with 11.5&lt;= h &lt;16 match the distributionsof the known asteroids with h &lt;11.5. the absolute magnitude distribution wasstudied in the range 8&lt; h &lt;17.5. we have found that the set of known asteroidsis complete to about absolute magnitudes 12.75, 12.25 and 11.25 in the inner,middle and outer regions of the belt respectively. the number distribution as afunction of absolute magnitude cannot be represented by a single power-law(10^{alpha h}) in any region. we were able to define broad ranges in h in eachpart of the belt where alpha was nearly constant. within these ranges of h theslope does not correspond to the value of 0.5 expected for an equilibriumcascade in self-similar collisions (dohnanyi, 1971). the value of alpha varieswith absolute magnitude and shows a `kink' in all regions of the belt for h~13.this absolute magnitude corresponds to a diameter ranging from about 8.5 to12.5 km depending on the albedo or region of the belt.
