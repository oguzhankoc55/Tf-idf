0706.1518	grb051022: physical parameters and extinction of a prototype dark burst	grb051022 was undetected to deep limits in early optical observations, butprecise astrometry from radio and x-ray showed that it most likely originatedin a galaxy at z~0.8. we report radio, optical, near infra-red and x-rayobservations of grb051022. using the available x-ray and radio data, we modelthe afterglow and calculate the energetics of the afterglow, finding it to bean order of magnitude lower than that of the prompt emission. the broad-bandmodeling also allows us to precisely define various other physical parametersand the minimum required amount of extinction, to explain the absence of anoptical afterglow. our observations suggest a high extinction, at least 2.3magnitudes in the infrared (j) and at least 5.4 magnitudes in the optical (u)in the host-galaxy restframe. such high extinctions are unusual for grbs, andlikely indicate a geometry where our line of sight to the burst passes througha dusty region in the host that is not directly co-located with the burstitself.

0902.2419	discerning the physical origins of cosmological gamma-ray bursts based  on multiple observational criteria: the cases of z=6.7 grb 080913, z=8.3 grb  090423, and some short/hard grbs	(abridged) the two high-redshift gamma-ray bursts, grb 080913 at z=6.7 andgrb 090423 at z=8.3, recently detected by swift appear as intrinsically short,hard grbs. they could have been recognized by batse as short/hard grbs shouldthey have occurred at z &lt;= 1. we perform a more thorough investigation on twophysically distinct types (type i/ii) of cosmological grbs and theirobservational characteristics. we reiterate the definitions of type i/ii grbsand review the observational criteria and their physical motivations. contraryto the traditional approach of assigning the physical category based on thegamma-ray properties (duration, hardness, and spectral lag), we take analternative approach to define the type i and type ii gold samples usingseveral criteria that are more directly related to the grb progenitors, andstudy the properties of the two gold samples and compare them with thetraditional long/soft and short/hard samples. we find that the type ii goldsample reasonably tracks the long/soft population, although it includes severalintrinsically short (shorter than 1s in the rest frame) grbs. the type i goldsample only has 5 grbs, 4 of which are not strictly short but have extendedemission. other short/hard grbs detected in the swift era represent the batseshort/hard sample well, but it is unclear whether all of them belong to type i.we suggest that some (probably even most) high-luminosity short/hard grbsinstead belong to type ii. we suggest that grb 080913 and grb 090423 are morelikely type ii events. we re-emphasize the importance of invoking multipleobservational criteria, and cautiously propose an operational procedure toinfer the physical origin of a given grb with available multiple observationalcriteria, with various caveats laid out.

0903.1258	late-time detections of the x-ray afterglow of grb 060729 with chandra -  the latest detections ever of an x-ray afterglow	we report on 5 chandra observations of the x-ray afterglow of the gamma-rayburst grb 060729 performed between 2007 march and 2008 may. in all fiveobservations the afterglow is clearly detected. the last chandra pointing wasperformed on 2008-may-04, 642 days after the burst - the latest detection of agrb x-ray afterglow ever. a reanalysis of the swift xrt light curve togetherwith the three detections by chandra in 2007 reveals a break at about 1.0 msafter the burst with a slight steepening of the decay slope from alpha = 1.32to 1.61. this break coincides with a significant hardening of the x-rayspectrum, consistent with a cooling break in the wind medium scenario, in whichthe cooling frequency of the afterglow crosses the x-ray band. the last twochandra observations in 2007 december and 2008 may provide evidence for anotherbreak at about one year after the burst. if interpreted as a jet break, thislate-time break implies a jet half opening angle of about 14 degrees for a windmedium. alternatively, this final break may have a spectral origin, in whichcase no jet break has been observed and the half-opening angle of the jet ofgrb 060729 must be larger than about 15 degrees for a wind medium. we comparethe x-ray afterglow of grb 060729 in a wind environment with other bright x-rayafterglows, in particular grbs 061121 and 080319b, and discuss why the x-rayafterglow of grb 060729 is such an exceptionally long-lasting event.

0909.2898	measurements of si hybrid cmos x-ray detector characteristics	the development of hybrid cmos detectors (hcds) for x-ray telescope focalplanes will place them in con- tention with ccds on future satellite missionsdue to their faster frame rates, flexible readout scenarios, lower powerconsumption, and inherent radiation hardness. ccds have been used with greatsuccess on the current generation of x-ray telescopes (e.g. chandra, xmm,suzaku, and swift). however their bucket-brigade read-out architecture, whichtransfers charge across the chip with discrete component readout electronics,results in clockrate limited readout speeds that cause pileup (saturation) ofbright sources and an inherent susceptibility to radiation induced displacementdamage that limits mission lifetime. in contrast, hcds read pixels with lowpower, on-chip multiplexer electronics in a random access fashion. faster framerates achieved with multi-output readout design will allow the nextgeneration's larger effective area telescopes to observe bright sources free ofpileup. radiation damaged lattice sites effect a single pixel instead of anentire row. random access, multi-output readout will allow for novel readoutmodes such as simultaneous bright-source-fast/whole-chip-slow readout. in orderfor hcds to be useful as x-ray detectors, they must show noise and energyresolution performance similar to ccds while retaining advantages inherent tohcds. we will report on readnoise, conversion gain, and energy resolutionmeasurements of an x-ray enhanced teledyne hawaii-1rg (h1rg) hcd and describetechniques of h1rg data reduction.

0912.5177	a deep chandra observation of the oxygen-rich supernova remnant  0540-69.3 in the large magellanic cloud	using our deep ~120 ks chandra observation, we report on the results from ourspatially-resolved x-ray spectral analysis of the "oxygen-rich" supernovaremnant (snr) 0540-69.3 in the large magellanic cloud. we conclusivelyestablish the nonthermal nature of the "arcs" in the east and west boundariesof the snr, which confirms the cosmic-ray electron acceleration in thesupernova shock (b ~ 20-140 microg). we report tentative evidence for feoverabundance in the southern region close to the outer boundary of the snr.while such a detection would be intriguing, the existence of fe ejecta is notconclusive with the current data because of poor photon statistics and limitedplasma models. if it is verified using deeper x-ray observations and improvedplasma models, the presence of fe ejecta, which was produced in the core of thesupernova, near the snr's outer boundary would provide an intriguingopportunity to study the explosive nucleosynthesis and the ejecta mixing inthis young core-collapse snr. there is no evidence of x-ray counterparts forthe optical o-rich ejecta in the central regions of the snr.

1004.0928	five years of mid-infrared evolution of the remnant of sn 1987a: the  encounter between the blast wave and the dusty equatorial ring	we have used the spitzer satellite to monitor the mid-ir evolution of sn1987a over a 5 year period spanning the epochs between days 6000 and 8000 sincethe explosion. the supernova (sn) has evolved into a supernova remnant (snr)and its radiative output is dominated by the interaction of the sn blast wavewith the pre-existing equatorial ring (er). the mid-ir spectrum is dominated byemission from ~180 k silicate dust, collisionally-heated by the hot x-rayemitting gas with a temperature and density of ~5x10^6 k and 3x10^4 cm-3,respectively. the mass of the radiating dust is ~1.2x10^(-6) msun on day 7554,and scales linearly with ir flux. the infrared to soft-x-ray flux ratio isroughly constant with a value of 2.5. gas-grain collisions therefore dominatethe cooling of the shocked gas. the constancy of of this ratio suggests thatvery little grain processing or gas cooling have occurred throughout thisepoch. the shape of the dust spectrum remained unchanged during theobservations while the total flux increased with a time dependence of t^(0.87),t being the time since the first encounter between the blast wave and the er.these observations are consistent with the transitioning of the blast wave fromfree expansion to a sedov phase as it propagates into the main body of the er.

0704.0209	chandra observations of supernova 1987a	we have been monitoring supernova (sn) 1987a with {\it chandra x-rayobservatory} since 1999. we present a review of previous results from our {\itchandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\it chandra} dataobtained in 2006 and 2007. high resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies ofsn 1987a with {\it chandra} reveal that x-ray emission of sn 1987a originatesfrom the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-likedense circumstellar medium (csm) that was produced by the massive progenitor'sequatorial stellar winds before the sn explosion. the blast wave is nowsweeping through dense csm all around the inner ring, and thus sn 1987a israpidly brightening in soft x-rays. at the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 january),x-ray luminosity of sn 1987a is $l_{\rm x}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergss$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 kev band. x-ray emission is described by two-componentplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kt$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 kev. asthe shock front interacts with dense csm all around the inner ring, the x-rayremnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).

0708.2942	a comprehensive analysis of swift/xrt data: iii. jet break candidates in  x-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves	the swift/xrt data of 179 grbs (from 050124 to 070129) and the opticalafterglow data of 57 pre- and post-swift grbs are analyzed, in order tosystematically investigate the jet-like breaks in the x-ray and opticalafterglow lightcurves. we find that not a single burst can be included in the``platinum'' sample, in which the data satisfy all the criteria of a jet break.by releasing one or more requirements to define a jet break, some candidates ofvarious degrees could be identified. in the x-ray band, 42 out of the 103well-sampled x-ray lightcurves have a decay slope of the post-break segment&gt;1.5 (``bronze'' sample), and 27 of them also satisfy the closure relations ofthe forward models (``silver'' sample). the numbers of the ``bronze'' and``silver'' candidates in the optical lightcurves are 27 and 23, respectively.thirteen bursts have well-sampled optical and x-ray lightcurves, but only sevencases are consistent with an achromatic break, but even in these cases only oneband satisfies the closure relations (``gold'' sample). the observed break timein the xrt lightcurves is systematically earlier than that in the opticalbands. all these raise great concerns in interpreting the jet-like breaks asjet breaks and further inferring grb energetics from these breaks. by assumingthat these breaks are jet breaks, we perform a similar analysis as previouswork to calculate the jet opening angle (theta_j) and energetics (e_k) with the``silver'' and ``gold'' jet break candidates. the derived e_k distributionreveals a much larger scatter than the pre-swift sample. a tentativeanti-correlation between theta_j and e_{k,iso} is found for both the pre-swiftand swift grbs, indicating that the e_k could still be quasi-universal, if thebreaks in discussion are indeed jet breaks(abridge).

1012.5703	snr 0104-72.3: a remnant of type ia supernova in a star-forming region?	we report our 110 ks chandra observations of the supernova remnant (snr)0104-72.3 in the small magellanic cloud (smc). the x-ray morphology shows twoprominent lobes along the northwest-southeast direction and a soft faint arc inthe east. previous low resolution x-ray images attributed the unresolvedemission from the southeastern lobe to a be/x-ray star. our high resolutionchandra data clearly shows that this emission is diffuse, shock-heated plasma,with negligible x-ray emission from the be star. the eastern arc ispositionally coincident with a filament seen in optical and infraredobservations. its x-ray spectrum is well fit by plasma of normal smcabundances, suggesting that it is from shocked ambient gas. the x-ray spectraof the lobes show overabundant fe, which is interpreted as emission from thereverse-shocked fe-rich ejecta. the overall spectral characteristics of thelobes and the arc are similar to those of type ia snrs, and we propose that snr0104-72.3 is the first case for a robust candidate type ia snr in the smc. onthe other hand, the remnant appears to be interacting with dense clouds towardthe east and to be associated with a nearby star-forming region. these featuresare unusual for a standard type ia snr. our results suggest an intriguingpossibility that the progenitor of snr 0104-72.3 might have been a white dwarfof a relatively young population.

1201.5056	an x-ray study of supernova remnant n49 and soft gamma-ray repeater  0526-66 in the large magellanic cloud	we report on the results from our deep chandra observation (120 ks) of thesupernova remnant (snr) n49 and soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) 0526-66 in thelarge magellanic cloud. we firmly establish the detection of an ejecta "bullet"beyond the southwestern boundary of n49. the x-ray spectrum of the bullet isdistinguished from that of the main snr shell, showing significantly enhancedsi and s abundances. we also detect an ejecta feature in the eastern shell,which shows metal overabundances similar to those of the bullet. if n49 wasproduced by a core-collapse explosion of a massive star, the detected si-richejecta may represent explosive o-burning or incomplete si-burning products fromdeep interior of the supernova. on the other hand, the observed si/s abundanceratio in the ejecta may favor type ia origin for n49. we refine the sedov ageof n49, tau_sed ~ 4800 yr, with the explosion energy e_0 ~ 1.8 x 10^51 erg. ourblackbody (bb) + power law (pl) model for the quiescent x-ray emission from sgr0526-66 indicates that the pl photon index (gamma ~ 2.5) is identical to thatof psr 1e1048.1-5937, the well-known candidate transition object betweenanomalous x-ray pulsars and sgrs. alternatively, the two-component bb modelimplies x-ray emission from a small (r ~ 1 km) hot spot(s) (kt ~ 1 kev) inaddition to emission from the neutron star's cooler surface (r ~ 10 km, kt ~0.4 kev). there is a considerable discrepancy in the estimated column toward0526-66 between bb+pl and bb+bb model fits. discriminating these spectralmodels would be crucial to test the long-debated physical association betweenn49 and 0526-66.

1302.5435	a super-solar metallicity for the progenitor of kepler's supernova	we have performed deep x-ray observations of the remnant of kepler'ssupernova (sn 1604) as a key project of the suzaku observatory. our main goalis to detect secondary fe-peak elements in the sn ejecta to gain insights intothe type ia supernova explosion mechanism and the nature of the progenitor.here we report our initial results. we made a conclusive detection of x-rayemission lines from highly ionized mn, cr, and ni as well as fe. the observedmn-to-cr line flux ratio is ~0.60, ~30% larger than that measured in tycho'sremnant. we estimate a mn-to-cr mass ratio of ~0.77, which is stronglysuggestive of a large neutron excess in the progenitor star before the onset ofthe thermonuclear runaway. the observed ni-to-fe line flux ratio (~0.03)corresponds to a mass ratio of ~0.06, which is generally consistent with theproducts of explosive si-burning regime in type ia explosion models, and rulesout contamination from the products of neutron-rich nuclear statisticalequilibrium in the shocked ejecta. together with the previously suggestedluminous nature of the explosion, these mass ratios provide strong evidence fora super-solar metallicity in the sn progenitor (~3 z_sun). kepler's supernovawas likely the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf formed in the recentpast that must have exploded through a relatively prompt channel.

astro-ph;0101557	improvement of the spatial resolution of the acis using split pixel  events	the position accuracy of x-ray photons on a ccd detector is generallybelieved to be limited by the ccd pixel size. while this is true in general,the position accuracy for x-ray events which deposit charge in more than onepixel can be better than that of the ccd pixel size. since the positionuncertainty for corner events is much better than the pixel size, we canimprove the chandra acis spatial resolution by selecting only these events.  we have analyzed x-ray images obtained with the chandra acis for sixpoint-like sources observed near the optical axis. the image quality near theoptical axis is characterized by a half power diameter (hpd) of $0.^{\!\!\prime\prime}66$ that is a convolution of the psf of the hrma and the ccd pixel shape($24\,\mu$m square). by considering only corner events the image quality isimproved to $0.^{\!\!\prime \prime}56$ (hpd), which is very close to the imagequality of the hrma alone. we estimated the degradation of the image qualityobtained by using all events, compared to that obtained using only cornerevents, to be $0.^{\!\!\prime \prime}33$, which coincides with that expectedfrom the pixel size. since the fraction of the corner events is relativelysmall, this technique requires correspondingly longer exposure time to achievegood statistics.

astro-ph;0112261	the x-ray spectrum of supernova remnant 1987a	we discuss the x-ray emission observed from supernova remnant 1987a with thechandra x-ray observatory. we analyze a high resolution spectrum obtained in1999 october with the high energy transmission grating (hetg). from thisspectrum we measure the strengths and an average profile of the observed x-raylines. we also analyze a high signal-to-noise ratio ccd spectrum obtained in2000 december. the good statistics (~ 9250 counts) of this spectrum and thehigh spatial resolution provided by the telescope allow us to performspectroscopic analyses of different regions of the remnant. we discuss therelevant shock physics that can explain the observed x-ray emission. the x-rayspectra are well fit by plane parallel shock models with post-shock electrontemperatures of ~ 2.6 kev and ionization ages of ~ 6 x 10^10 cm^3/s. thecombined x-ray line profile has a fwhm of ~ 5000 km/s, indicating a blast wavespeed of ~ 3500 km/s. at this speed, plasma with a mean post-shock temperatureof ~ 17 kev is produced. this is direct evidence for incomplete electron-iontemperature equilibration behind the shock. assuming this shock temperature, weconstrain the amount of collisionless electron heating at the shock front att_e0 / t_s = 0.11 (+0.02,-0.01). we find that the plasma has low metallicity(abundances are ~ 0.1 -- 0.4 solar) and is nitrogen enriched (n/o ~ 0.8 bynumber), similar to that found for the equatorial ring. analysis of the spectrafrom different regions of the remnant reveals slight differences in theparameters of the emitting plasma. the plasma is cooler near the optical spot 1(at position angle ~ 30 degrees) and in the eastern half of the remnant, wherethe bright optical spots are found, than in the western half, consistent withthe presence of slower (~ 500 km/s) shocks entering denser ring material.

astro-ph;0209280	the radial structure of snr n103b	we report on the results from a chandra acis observation of the young,compact, supernova remnant n103b. the unprecedented spatial resolution ofchandra reveals sub-arcsecond structure, both in the brightness and in spectralvariations. underlying these small-scale variations is a surprisingly simpleradial structure in the equivalent widths of the strong si and s emissionlines. we investigate these radial variations through spatially resolvedspectroscopy using a plane-parallel, non-equilibrium ionization model withmultiple components. the majority of the emission arises from components with atemperature of 1 kev: a fully ionized hydrogen component; a high ionizationtimescale (n_e*t &gt; 10^12 s cm^-3) component containing si, s, ar, ca, and fe;and a low ionization timescale (n_e*t ~ 10^{11} s cm^-3) o, ne, and mgcomponent. to reproduce the strong fe kalpha line, it is necessary to includeadditional fe in a hot (&gt; 2 kev), low ionization (n_e*t ~ 10^10.8 s cm^-3)component. this hot fe may be in the form of hot fe bubbles, formed in theradioactive decay of clumps of 56ni. we find no radial variation in theionization timescales or temperatures of the various components. rather, the siand s equivalent widths increase at large radii because these lines, as well asthose of ar and ca, are formed in a shell occupying the outer half of theremnant. a shell of hot fe is located interior to this, but there is a largeregion of overlap between these two shells. in the inner 30% of the remnant,there is a core of cooler, 1 kev fe. we find that the distribution of theejecta and the yields of the intermediate mass species are consistent withmodel prediction for type ia events.

astro-ph;0508321	physical processes shaping grb x-ray afterglow lightcurves: theoretical  implications from the swift xrt observations	(abridged) the swift x-ray telescope (xrt) reveals some interesting featuresof early x-ray afterglows, including a distinct rapidly decaying componentpreceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources, a shallow decaycomponent before the more ``normal'' decay component observed in a goodfraction of grbs (e.g. grb 050128, grb 050315, grb 050319, and grb 050401), andx-ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows (e.g. grb 050406, grb 050502b,grb 050607, and grb 050724). in this paper, we systematically analyze thepossible physical processes that shape the properties of the early x-rayafterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. we suggestthat the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of theprompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the x-ray flares. this provides clearevidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinctcomponents, supporting the internal origin of the grb prompt emission. theshallow decay segment observed in a group of grbs suggests that the forwardshock keeps being refreshed for some time. this might be caused either by along-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell lorentzfactors, or else by the deceleration of a poynting flux dominated flow. x-rayflares suggest that the grb central engine is still active after the promptgamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. in somecases, the central engine activity even extends days after the burst trigger.analyses of early x-ray afterglow data reveal that grbs are indeed highlyrelativistic events. early afterglow data of many bursts, starting from thebeginning of the xrt observations, are consistent with the afterglow emissionfrom an interstellar medium (ism) environment.

astro-ph;0604201	evolutionary status of snr 1987a at the age of eighteen	$\sim$18 yr after the supernova explosion, the blast wave of snr 1987a isentering the main body of the equatorial circumstellar material, which iscausing a dramatic brightening of the remnant. we recently reported theobservational evidence for this event from our {\it chandra} data (park et al.2005b; p05 hereafter). we present here the temporal evolution of the x-rayemitting shock parameters and the detailed description of the spectral andimage analysis of snr 1987a, on which p05 was based. while the remnant becomesbrighter, the softening of the overall x-ray spectrum continues and is enhancedon around day $\sim$6200 (since the explosion). the two-component shock modelindicates that the electron temperatures have been changing for the last$\sim$6 yr. the x-ray spectrum is now described by $kt$ $\sim$ 0.3 kev and 2.3kev thermal plasmas which are believed to characteristically represent theshock-heated density gradient along the boundary between the h{\small ii}region and the dense inner ring. as the blast wave sweeps through the innercircumstellar ring shining in x-rays, we expect that the shock parameterscontinue to change, revealing the density and abundance structure of the innerring. follow-up {\it chandra} observations will thus uncover the past historyof the progenitor's stellar evolution. the origin of the relatively faint hardx-ray emission ($e$ $&gt;$ 3 kev) from snr 1987a is still unclear (thermal vs.nonthermal). considering the continuous brightening of the hard band intensity,as well as the soft band flux, follow-up monitoring observations will also beessential to reveal the origin of the hard x-ray emission of snr 1987a.

astro-ph;0604320	jet breaks in short gamma-ray bursts. ii: the collimated afterglow of  grb 051221a	we report the best evidence to date of a jet break in a short gamma-ray burst(grb) afterglow, using chandra and swift xrt observations of the x-rayafterglow of grb 051221a. the combined x-ray light curve, which has threebreaks, is similar to those commonly observed in swift observations of longgrbs. a flat segment of the light curve at ~0.1 days after the burst representsthe first clear case of strong energy injection in the external shock of ashort grb afterglow. the last break occurs at ~4 days post-burst and breaks toa power-law decay index of ~2. we interpret this as a jet break, with importantimplications for models of short grbs, since it requires collimation of theafterglow into a jet with an initial opening angle ~4-8 degrees and implies atotal jet kinetic energy of e_jet ~(1-5) x 10^{49} erg. combined with the lackof a jet break in grb 050724, this suggests a wide range in jet collimation inshort grbs, with at least some having collimation similar to that found in longgrbs, though with significantly lower jet energies.

astro-ph;0605005	grb 060313: a new paradigm for short-hard bursts?	we report the simultaneous observations of the prompt emission in thegamma-ray and hard x-ray bands by the swift-bat and the konus-wind instrumentsof the short-hard burst, grb 060313. the observations reveal multiple peaks inboth the gamma-ray and hard x-ray bands suggesting a highly variable outflowfrom the central explosion. we also describe the early-time observations of thex-ray and uv/optical afterglows by the swift xrt and uvot instruments. thecombination of the x-ray and uv/optical observations provide the mostcomprehensive lightcurves to date of a short-hard burst at such an early epoch.the afterglows exhibit complex structure with different decay indices andflaring. this behavior can be explained by the combination of a structured jet,radiative loss of energy, and decreasing microphysics parameters occurring in acircum-burst medium with densities varying by a factor of approximately two ona length scale of 10^17 cm. these density variations are normally associatedwith the environment of a massive star and inhomogeneities in its windy medium.however, the mean density of the observed medium (n approximately 10^&amp;#8722;4cm^3) is much less than that expected for a massive star. although the collapseof a massive star as the origin of grb 060313 is unlikely, the merger of acompact binary also poses problems for explaining the behavior of this burst.two possible suggestions for explaining this scenario are: some short burstsmay arise from a mechanism that does not invoke the conventional compact binarymodel, or soft late-time central engine activity is producing uv/optical but nox-ray flaring.

astro-ph;0610004	discovery of a candidate central compact object in the galactic  nonthermal snr g330.2+1.0	we report on the discovery of a pointlike source (cxou j160103.1$-$513353) atthe center of a galactic supernova remnant (snr) g330.2+1.0 with {\it chandrax-ray observatory}. the x-ray spectrum fits a black-body (bb) model with $kt$$\sim$ 0.49 kev, implying a small emission region of $r$ $\sim$ 0.4 km at thedistance of 5 kpc. the estimated x-ray luminosity is $l_x$ $\sim$ 1 $\times$10$^{33}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 1 $-$ 10 kev band. a power law model may alsofit the observed spectrum, but the fit results in a very large photon index,$\gamma$ $\sim$ 5. we find no counterparts at other wavelengths. the x-rayemission was steady over the $\sim$13 hr observation period, showing novariability. while we find marginal evidence for x-ray pulsations ($p$$\approx$ 7.5 s), the presence of a pulsar at the position of this object isnot conclusive with the current data, requiring an independent confirmation.these results are generally consistent with an interpretation of this object asa central compact object associated with snr g330.2+1.0.

astro-ph;0610177	grb radiative efficiencies derived from the swift data: grbs vs. xrfs,  long vs. short	we systematically analyze the prompt emission and the early afterglow data ofa sample of 31 grbs detected by {\em swift} before september 2005, and estimatethe grb radiative efficiency. bat's narrow band inhibits a precisedetermination of the grb spectral parameters, and we have developed a method toestimate these parameters with the hardness ratio information. the shallowdecay component commonly existing in early x-ray afterglows, if interpreted ascontinuous energy injection in the external shock, suggests that the grbefficiency previously derived from the late-time x-ray data were not reliable.we calculate two radiative efficiencies using the afterglow kinetic energy e_kderived at the putative deceleration time t_{dec}) and at the break time (t_b)when the energy injection phase ends, respectively. at t_b xrfs appear to beless efficient than normal grbs. however, when we analyze the data at t_{dec}xrfs are found to be as efficient as grbs. short grbs have similar radiativeefficiencies to long grbs despite of their different progenitors. twenty-twobursts in the sample are identified to have the afterglow cooling frequencybelow the x-ray band. assuming \epsilon_e = 0.1, we find \eta_\gamma(t_b)usually &lt;10% and \eta_\gamma (t_{dec}) varying from a few percents to &gt; 90%.nine grbs in the sample have the afterglow cooling frequency above the x-rayband for a very long time. this suggests a very small \epsilon_b and/or a verylow ambient density n.

astro-ph;0612104	redshift filtering by swift apparent x-ray column density	we remark on the utility of an observational relation between the absorptioncolumn density in excess of the galactic absorption column density, $\deltan_{\rm h} = n_{\rm h, fit} - n_{\rm h, gal}$, and redshift, z, determined fromall 55 swift-observed long bursts with spectroscopic redshifts as of 2006december. the absorption column densities, $n_{\rm h, fit}$, are determinedfrom powerlaw fits to the x-ray spectra with the absorption column density leftas a free parameter. we find that higher excess absorption column densitieswith $\delta n_{\rm h} &gt; 2\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ are only present in burstswith redshifts z$&lt;$2. low absorption column densities with $\delta n_{\rm h} &lt;1\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ appear preferentially in high-redshift bursts. ourinterpretation is that this relation between redshift and excess column densityis an observational effect resulting from the shift of the source rest-frameenergy range below 1 kev out of the xrt observable energy range for highredshift bursts. we found a clear anti-correlation between $\delta n_{\rm h}$and z that can be used to estimate the range of the maximum redshift of anafterglow. a critical application of our finding is that rapid x-rayobservations can be used to optimize the instrumentation used for ground-basedoptical/nir follow-up observations. ground-based spectroscopic redshiftmeasurements of as many bursts as possible are crucial for grb science.

astro-ph;0612121	gamma ray bursts flares detected and observed by the swift satellite	the detection of flares with the swift satellite triggered a lot ofbservational and theoretical interest in these phenomena. as a consequence alarge analysis effort started within the community to characterize thephenomenon and at the same time a variety of theoretical speculations have beenproposed to explain it. in this presentation we discuss part of the results weobtained analyzing a first statistical sample of grbs observed with swift. thefirst goal of this research is very simple: derive those observationalproperties that could distinguish between internal and external shock andbetween an ever active central engine and delayed shocks (refreshing) relatedto a very small initial lorentz bulk factor. we discuss first the method ofanalysis and the morphology evidencing the similarities such flares have withthe prompt emission pulses. we conclude that grb flares are due to internalshocks and leave still open the question of whether or not the central engineis active for a time of the order of 105 seconds after the prompt emission.

astro-ph;0612238	making a short gamma-ray burst from a long one: implications for the  nature of grb 060614	the absence of a supernova accompanying the nearby long grb 060614 poses agreat puzzle about the progenitor of this event and challenges the current grbclassification scheme. this burst displays a short-hard emission episodefollowed by extended soft emission with strong spectral evolution. noticingthat this burst has an isotropic gamma-ray energy only ~8 times that of grb050724, a good candidate of merger-type short grbs, we generate a ``pseudo''burst that is ~8 times less energetic than grb 060614 based on the spectralproperties of grb 060614 and the ep ~ eiso^{1/2} (amati) relation. we find thatthis pseudo-burst would have been detected by batse as a marginalshort-duration grb, and would have properties in the swift bat and xrt bandssimilar to grb 050724. this suggests that grb 060614 is likely a more intenseevent in the traditional short-hard grb category as would be detected by batse.events like grb 060614 that seem to defy the traditional short vs. longclassification of grbs may require modification of our classificationterminology for grbs. by analogy with supernova classifications, we suggestthat grbs be classified into type i (typically short and associated with oldpopulations) and type ii (typically long and associated with youngpopulations). we propose that grb 060614 belongs to type i, and predict thatsimilar events will be detected in elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9910474	nucleosynthesis and mixing in cassiopeia a	we present results from the first light observations of the cassiopeia a (casa) supernova remnant (snr) by the chandra x-ray observatory. the x-ray spectrumvaries on all spatial scales down to the instrumental limit (0.02 pc at thesnr). based on representative spectra from four selected regions we investigatethe processes of nucleosynthesis and mixing in cas a. we make the firstunequivocal identification of iron-rich ejecta produced by explosivesilicon-burning in a young galactic snr. elsewhere in the remnant we seesilicon-rich ejecta from explosive oxygen-burning. remarkably, our study findsthat the fe-rich ejecta lies outside the si-rich material, leading to theconclusion that bulk motions of the ejecta were extensive and energetic enoughin cas a to cause a spatial inversion of a significant portion of the supernovacore during the explosion. it is likely that this inversion was caused by``fe''-rich ejecta emerging in plumes from the rising bubbles in theneutrino-driven convection layer. in addition the radioactive decay energy from$^{56}$ni may have contributed to the subsequent evolution of the material. wehave also discovered faint, well-defined filaments with featureless x-rayspectra that are possibly the sites of cosmic ray acceleration in cas a.

0809.4281	nonthermal x-rays from supernova remnant g330.2+1.0 and the  characteristics of its central compact object	we present results from our x-ray data analysis of the snr g330.2+1.0 and itscco, cxou j160103.1--513353 (j1601). using our xmm-newton and chandraobservations, we find that the x-ray spectrum of j1601 can be described byneutron star atmosphere models (t ~ 2.5--3.7 mk). assuming the distance of d ~5 kpc for j1601 as estimated for snr g330.2+1.0, a small emission region of r ~1--2 km is implied. x-ray pulsations previously suggested by chandra are notconfirmed by the xmm-newton data, and are likely not real. however, our timinganalysis of the xmm-newton data is limited by poor photon statistics, and thuspulsations with a relatively low amplitude (i.e., an intrinsic pulsed-fraction&lt; 40%) cannot be ruled out. our results indicate that j1601 is a cco similar tothat in the cassiopeia a snr.x-ray emission from snr g330.2+1.0 is dominated bypower law continuum (gamma ~ 2.1--2.5) which primarily originates from thinfilaments along the boundary shell. this x-ray spectrum implies synchrotronradiation from shock-accelerated electrons with an exponential roll-offfrequency ~ 2--3 x 10^17 hz. for the measured widths of the x-ray filaments (d~ 0.3 pc) and the estimated shock velocity (v_s ~ a few x 10^3 km s^-1), adownstream magnetic field b ~ 10--50 $\mu$g is derived. the estimated maximumelectron energy e_max ~ 27--38 tev suggests that g330.2+1.0 is a candidate tevgamma-ray source. we detect faint thermal x-ray emission in g330.2+1.0. weestimate a low preshock density n_0 ~ 0.1 cm^-3, which suggests a dominantcontribution from an inverse compton mechanism (than the proton-protoncollision) to the prospective gamma-ray emission. follow-up deep radio, x-ray,and gamma-ray observations will be essential to reveal the details of the shockparameters and the nature of particle accelerations in this snr.

0706.0524	chandra x-ray study of galactic supernova remnant g299.2-2.9	we report on observations of the galactic supernova remnant (snr)g299.2$-$2.9 with the {\it chandra x-ray observatory}. the high resolutionimages with {\it chandra} resolve the x-ray-bright knots, shell, and diffuseemission extending beyond the bright shell. interior to the x-ray shell isfaint diffuse emission occupying the central regions of the snr.spatially-resolved spectroscopy indicates a large foreground absorption($n_{\rm h}$ $\sim$ 3.5 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$), which supports arelatively distant location ($d$ $\sim$ 5 kpc) for the snr. the blast wave isencountering a highly inhomogeneous ambient medium with the densities rangingover more than an order of magnitude ($n_0$ $\sim$ 0.1 $-$ 4 cm$^{-3}$).assuming the distance of $d$ $\sim$ 5 kpc, we derive a sedov age of $\tau$$\sim$ 4500 yr and an explosion energy of $e_0$ $\sim$ 1.6 $\times$ 10$^{50}$ergs. the ambient density structure and the overall morphology suggest thatg299.2$-$2.9 may be a limb-brightened partial shell extending to $\sim$7 pcradius surrounded by fainter emission extending beyond that to a radius of$\sim$9 pc. this suggests the snr exploded in a region of space where there isa density gradient whose direction lies roughly along the line of sight. thefaint central region shows strong line emission from heavy elements of si andfe, which is caused by the presence of the overabundant stellar ejecta there.we find no evidence for stellar ejecta enriched in light elements of o and ne.the observed abundance structure of the metal-rich ejecta supports a type iaorigin for g299.2$-$2.9.

0812.1217	late time observations of grb080319b: jet break, host galaxy and  accompanying supernova	the swift discovered grb080319b was by far the most distant source everobserved at naked eye brightness, reaching a peak apparent magnitude of 5.3 ata redshift of z=0.937. we present our late-time optical (hst, gemini &amp; vlt) andx-ray (chandra) observations, which confirm that an achromatic break occurredin the power-law afterglow light curve at ~11 days post-burst. this most likelyindicates that the gamma-ray burst (grb) outflow was collimated, which for auniform jet would imply a total energy in the jet e_{jet} \gsim 10^{52} erg.our observations also show a late-time excess of red light, which is wellexplained if the grb was accompanied by a supernova (sn), similar to those seenin some other long-duration grbs. the latest observations are dominated bylight from the host and show that the grb took place in a faint dwarf galaxy(r(ab)\approx27.0, rest-frame m_b\approx-17.2). this galaxy is small even bythe standards of other grb hosts, which is suggestive of a low metallicityenvironment. intriguingly, the properties of this extreme event - a small hostand bright supernova - are entirely typical of the very low-luminosity burstssuch as grb980425 and grb060218.
