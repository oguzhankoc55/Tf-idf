0905.1262	the nature of the line profile variability in the spectrum of the  massive binary hd 152219	hd 152219 is a massive binary system with o9.5 iii + b1-2 v/iii componentsand a short orbital period of 4.2 d. its primary component further displaysclear line profile variability (lpv). the primary component being locatedwithin the pulsational instability domain predicted for high-luminosity stars,we previously suggested that the observed lpv could be associated withnon-radial pulsations. the aim of the present work is to determine the natureof the observed lpv in the spectrum of the primary component of hd152219.during a 4-night feros monitoring campaign, we collected a new set of134 high signal-to-noise spectra. these new observations were then used tore-investigate the variability of different line profiles in the spectrum of hd152219. based on the present analysis, we discard the non-radial pulsations andpoint out the rossiter-mclaughlin effect as the cause of the lpv in hd 152219.the upper limit on the amplitude of possible weak pulsations is set at a fewparts per thousand of the continuum level.

0905.1592	early-type stars in the young open cluster ngc 2244 and in the mon ob2  association i. the multiplicity of o-type stars	aims. we present the results obtained from a long-term spectroscopic campaigndevoted to the multiplicity of o-type stars in the young open cluster ngc2244and in the mon ob2 association. methods. our spectroscopic monitoring wasperformed over several years, allowing us to probe different time-scales. foreach star, several spectral diagnostic tools are applied, in order to searchfor line shifts and profile variations. we also measure the projectedrotational velocity and revisit the spectral classification. results. in oursample, several stars were previously considered as spectroscopic binaries,though only a few scattered observations were available. our results now reveala more complex situation. our study identifies two new spectroscopic binaries(hd46149 in ngc2244 and hd46573 in monob2). the first object is a long-perioddouble-lined spectroscopic binary, though the exact value of its period remainsuncertain and the second object is classified as an sb1 system with a period ofabout 10.67 days but the time series of our observations do not enable us toderive a unique orbital solution for this system. we also classify another staras variable in radial velocity (hd46150) and we detect line profile variationsin two rapid rotators (hd46056 and hd46485). conclusions. this spectroscopicinvestigation places a firm lower limit (17%) on the binary fraction of o-starsin ngc2244 and reveals the lack of short-period o+ob systems in this cluster.in addition, a comparison of these new results with two other well-studiedclusters (ngc6231 and ic1805) puts forward possible hints of a relation betweenstellar density and binarity, which could provide constraints on the theoriesabout the formation and early evolution of hot stars.

0911.1557	on the velocity dispersion of young star clusters: super-virial or  binaries?	many young extra-galactic clusters have a measured velocity dispersion thatis too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity, which hasled to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium. most of theseclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 myr because ofobservational constraints. at this age the cluster light is dominated byluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22msun for which (primordial) binarity is high. in this study we investigate towhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of theorbital motions of binaries. we demonstrate that estimates for the dynamicalmass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,exceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with aconstant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. this can bereproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive starpopulation of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 andperiods of ~1000 days. we conclude that binaries play a pivotal role inderiving the dynamical masses of young (~10 myr) moderately massive and compact(&lt;1e5 msun; &gt; 1 pc) star clusters.

0911.5076	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. ii. ages, metallicities, detailed elemental abundances,  and connections to the galactic thick disc	the bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the milky way.most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the bulge comes frombright giant stars. the underlying assumption that giants represent all thestars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, isunder debate. in particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarfstars give a very different picture of the evolution of the bulge from thatgiven by the giant stars. [abridged] we perform a detailed elemental abundanceanalysis of dwarf stars in the galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectrathat were obtained while the stars were optically magnified duringgravitational microlensing events. [abridged] we present detailed elementalabundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the galactic bulge.combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sampleto date of microlensed dwarf stars in the galactic bulge. we find that thestars span the full range of metallicities from [fe/h]=-0.72 to +0.54, and anaverage metallicity of &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicitybased on giant stars in the bulge. furthermore, the stars follow well-definedabundance trends, that for [fe/h]&lt;0 are very similar to those of the localgalactic thick disc. this suggests that the bulge and the thick disc have had,at least partially, comparable chemical histories. at sub-solar metallicitieswe find the bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while atsuper-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. using the new age andabundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possibleformation scenarios for the bulge.

0708.3005	the struve-sahade effect in the optical spectra of o-type binaries i.  main-sequence systems	we present a spectroscopic analysis of four massive binary systems that areknown or are good candidates to display the struve-sahade effect (defined asthe apparent strengthening of the secondary spectrum of the binary when thestar is approaching, and the corresponding weakening of the lines when it isreceding).  we use high resolution optical spectra to determine new orbital solutions andspectral types of hd 165052, hd 100213, hd 159176 and dh cep. as good knowledgeof the fundamental parameters of the considered systems is necessary to examinethe struve-sahade effect. we then study equivalent width variations in thelines of both components of these binaries during their orbital cycle.  in the case of these four systems, variations appear in the equivalent widthsof some lines during the orbital cycle, but the definition given above can anylonger be valid, since it is now clear that the effect modifies the primaryspectrum as much as the secondary spectrum. furthermore, the lines affected,and the way in which they are affected, depend on the considered system. for atleast two of them (hd 100213 and hd 159176) these variations probably reflectthe ellipsoidal variable nature of the system.

1105.1775	the vlt-flames tarantula survey iii: a very massive star in apparent  isolation from the massive cluster r136	vfts 682 is located in an active star-forming region, at a projected distanceof 29 pc from the young massive cluster r136 in the tarantula nebula of thelarge magellanic cloud. it was previously reported as a candidate young stellarobject, and more recently spectroscopically revealed as a hydrogen-richwolf-rayet (wn5h) star. our aim is to obtain the stellar properties, such asits intrinsic luminosity, and to investigate the origin of vfts 682. to thispurpose, we model optical spectra from the vlt-flames tarantula survey with thenon-lte stellar atmosphere code cmfgen, as well as the spectral energydistribution from complementary optical and infrared photometry. we find theextinction properties to be highly peculiar (rv ~4.7), and obtain asurprisingly high luminosity log(l/lsun) = 6.5 \pm 0.2, corresponding to apresent-day mass of ~150msun. the high effective temperature of 52.2 \pm 2.5kkmight be explained by chemically homogeneous evolution - suggested to be thekey process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. lightcurves of theobject show variability at the 10% level on a timescale of years. such changesare unprecedented for classical wolf-rayet stars, and are more reminiscent ofluminous blue variables. finally, we discuss two possibilities for the originof vfts 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profoundimplications for the formation mechanism of massive stars, or (ii) vfts 682 isa slow runaway star that originated from the dense cluster r136, which wouldmake it the most massive runaway known to date.

1208.0825	the vlt-flames tarantula survey. vii. a low velocity dispersion for the  young massive cluster r136	detailed studies of resolved young massive star clusters are necessary todetermine their dynamical state and evaluate the importance of gas expulsionand early cluster evolution. in an effort to gain insight into the dynamicalstate of the young massive cluster r136 and obtain the first measurement of itsvelocity dispersion, we analyse multi-epoch spectroscopic data of the innerregions of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) obtained as part ofthe vlt-flames tarantula survey. following a quantitative assessment of thevariability, we use the radial velocities of non-variable sources to place anupper limit of 6 km/s on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of stars withina projected distance of 5 pc from the centre of the cluster. after accountingfor the contributions of undetected binaries and measurement errors throughmonte carlo simulations, we conclude that the true velocity dispersion islikely between 4 and 5 km/s given a range of standard assumptions about thebinary distribution. this result is consistent with what is expected if thecluster is in virial equilibrium, suggesting that gas expulsion has not alteredits dynamics. we find that the velocity dispersion would be ~25 km/s ifbinaries were not identified and rejected, confirming the importance of themulti-epoch strategy and the risk of interpreting velocity dispersionmeasurements of unresolved extragalactic young massive clusters.

1209.4638	the vlt-flames tarantula survey viii. multiplicity properties of the  o-type star population	aims. we analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive o-type starpopulation. with 360 o-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample ofmassive stars analyzed to date.  methods. we use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identifyspectroscopic binaries. we also use a monte-carlo method to correct forobservational biases.  results. we observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35\pm0.03, whichcorresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significantradial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20km/s. we compute theintrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51\pm0.04. we adopt power-laws to describethe intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f_p ~ (log p)^\pi\ (with0.15 &lt; log p &lt; 3.5) and f_q ~ q^\kappa\ with 0.1 &lt; q=m_2/m_1 &lt; 1.0. thepower-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are \pi = -0.45+/- 0.30 and \kappa = -1.0\pm0.4. the obtained period distribution thus favoursshorter period systems compared to an oepik law. the mass ratio distribution isslightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with arandom sampling of a classical mass function. the binary fraction seems mostlyuniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types andluminosity classes. the binary fraction in the outer region of the field ofview (r &gt; 7.8', i.e. approx117 pc) and among the o9.7 i/ii objects are howeversignificantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations.  conclusions. using simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over50% of the current o star population in 30 dor will exchange mass with itscompanion within a binary system. this shows that binary interaction is greatlyaffecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken intoaccount to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars.

1211.3742	the rotation rates of massive stars: the role of binary interaction  through tides, mass transfer and mergers	rotation is thought to be a major factor in the evolution of massive stars,especially at low metallicity, with consequences for their chemical yields,ionizing flux and final fate. determining the natal rotation-rate distributionof stars is of high priority given its importance as a constraint on theoriesof massive star formation and as input for models of stellar populations in thelocal universe and at high redshift. recently, it has become clear that themajority of massive stars interact with a binary companion before they die. weinvestigate how this affects the distribution of rotation rates.  for this purpose, we simulate a massive binary-star population typical forour galaxy assuming continuous star formation. we find that, because of binaryinteraction, 20^+5_-10% of all massive main-sequence stars have projectedrotational velocities in excess of 200km/s. we evaluate the effect of uncertaininput distributions and physical processes and conclude that the mainuncertainties are the mass transfer efficiency and the possible effect ofmagnetic braking, especially if magnetic fields are generated or amplifiedduring mass accretion and stellar mergers.  the fraction of rapid rotators we derive is similar to that observed. ifindeed mass transfer and mergers are the main cause for rapid rotation inmassive stars, little room remains for rapidly rotating stars that are bornsingle. this implies that spin down during star formation is even moreefficient than previously thought. in addition, this raises questions about theinterpretation of the surface abundances of rapidly rotating stars as evidencefor rotational mixing. furthermore, our results allow for the possibility thatall early-type be stars result from binary interactions and suggest thatevidence for rotation in explosions, such as long gamma-ray bursts, points to abinary origin.

1212.2424	the vlt-flames tarantula survey x: evidence for a bimodal distribution  of rotational velocities for the single early b-type stars	aims: projected rotational velocities (\vsini) have been estimated for 334targets in the vlt-flames tarantula survey that do not manifest significantradial velocity variations and are not supergiants. they have spectral typesfrom approximately o9.5 to b3. the estimates have been analysed to infer theunderlying rotational velocity distribution, which is critical forunderstanding the evolution of massive stars.  methods: projected rotational velocities were deduced from the fouriertransforms of spectral lines, with upper limits also being obtained fromprofile fitting. for the narrower lined stars, metal and non-diffuse heliumlines were adopted, and for the broader lined stars, both non-diffuse anddiffuse helium lines; the estimates obtained using the different sets of linesare in good agreement. the uncertainty in the mean estimates is typically 4%for most targets. the iterative deconvolution procedure of lucy has been usedto deduce the probability density distribution of the rotational velocities.  results: projected rotational velocities range up to approximately 450 \kmsand show a bi-modal structure. this is also present in the inferred rotationalvelocity distribution with 25% of the sample having $0\leq$\ve$\leq$100\,\kmsand the high velocity component having \ve$\sim 250$\,\kms. there is noevidence from the spatial and radial velocity distributions of the twocomponents that they represent either field and cluster populations ordifferent episodes of star formation. be-type stars have also been identified.  conclusions: the bi-modal rotational velocity distribution in our sampleresembles that found for late-b and early-a type stars. while magnetic brakingappears to be a possible mechanism for producing the low-velocity component, wecan not rule out alternative explanations.

1212.4144	the outflow history of two herbig-haro jets in rcw 36: hh 1042 and hh  1043	jets around low- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects (ysos) contain afossil record of the recent accretion and outflow activity of their parentstar-forming systems. we aim to understand whether the accretion/ejectionprocess is similar across the entire stellar mass range of the parent ysos. tothis end we have obtained vlt/x-shooter spectra of hh 1042 and hh 1043, twonewly discovered jets in the massive star-forming region rcw 36. hh 1042 isassociated with the intermediate-mass yso 08576nr292. over 90 emission linesare detected in the spectra. high-velocity (up to 220 km/s) blue- andredshifted emission from a bipolar flow is observed in typical shock tracers.low-velocity emission from the background cloud is detected in nebular tracers,including lines from high ionization species. we applied combined optical andinfrared spectral diagnostic tools in order to derive the physical conditions(density, temperature, and ionization) in the jets. the measured mass outflowrates are mjet ~ 10^-7 msun/yr. we measure a high accretion rate for hh 1042(macc ~ 10^-6 msun/yr) and mjet/macc ~ 0.1, comparable to low-mass sources andconsistent with models for magneto-centrifugal jet launching. the knottedstructure and velocity spread in both jets are interpreted as fossil signaturesof a variable outflow rate. the mean velocities in both lobes of the jets arecomparable, but the variations in mjet and velocity in the two lobes are notsymmetric, suggesting that the launching mechanism on either side of theaccretion disk is not synchronized. for hh 1042, we have constructed aninterpretative physical model with a stochastic or periodic outflow rate and adescription of a ballistic flow as its constituents. the knotted structure andvelocity spread can be reproduced qualitatively with the model, indicating thatthe outflow velocity varies on timescales on the order of 100 yr.

1304.3457	three-dimensional orbits of the triple-o stellar system hd 150136	context. hd 150136 is a triple hierarchical system and a non-thermal radioemitter. it is formed by an o3-3.5 v + o5.5-6 v close binary and a more distanto6.5-7 v tertiary. so far, only the inner orbital properties have been reliablyconstrained.  aims. to quantitatively understand the non-thermal emission process, accurateknowledge of the physical and orbital properties of the object is crucial.here, we aim to investigate the orbital properties of the wide system and toconstrain the inclinations of the inner and outer binaries, and with these theabsolute masses of the system components.  methods. we used the pionier combiner at the very large telescopeinterferometer to obtain the very first interferometric measurements of hd150136. we combined the interferometric observations with new and existing highresolution spectroscopic data to derive the orbital solution of the outercompanion in the three-dimensional space.  results. the wide system is clearly resolved by pionier, with a projectedseparation on the plane of the sky of about 9 milli-arcsec. the best-fitorbital period, eccentricity, and inclination are 8.2 yr, 0.73 and 108 degr. weconstrain the masses of the three stars of the system to 63 +/- 10, 40 +/- 6,and 33 +/- 12 msun for the o3-3.5 v, o5.5-6 v and o6.5-7 v components.  conclusions. the dynamical masses agree within errors with the evolutionarymasses of the components. future interferometric and spectroscopic monitoringof hd 150136 should allow one to reduce the uncertainties to a few per centonly and to accurately constrain the distance to the system. this makes hd150136 an ideal system to quantitatively test evolutionary models of high-massstars as well as the physics of non-thermal processes occurring in o-typesystems.

1304.4591	r144 revealed as a double-lined spectroscopic binary	r144 is a wn6h star in the 30 doradus region. it is suspected to be a binarybecause of its high luminosity and its strong x-ray flux, but no periodicitycould be established so far. here, we present new xshooter multi-epochspectroscopy of r144 obtained at the eso very large telescope (vlt). we detectvariability in position and/or shape of all the spectral lines. we measureradial velocity variations with an amplitude larger than 250 km/s in niv and nvlines. furthermore, the niii and nv line doppler shifts are anti-correlated andthe niv lines show a double-peaked profile on six of our seven epochs. we thusconclude that r144 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. possible orbitalperiods range from 2 to 6 months, although a period up to one year is allowedif the orbit is highly eccentric. we estimate the spectral types of thecomponents to be wn5-6h and wn6-7h, respectively. the high luminosity of thesystem (log lbol/lsun ~ 6.8) suggests a present-day total mass content in therange of about 200 to 300 msun, depending on the evolutionary stage of thecomponents. this makes r144 the most massive binary identified so far, with atotal mass content at birth possibly as large as 400 msun. we briefly discussthe presence of such a massive object 60 pc away from the r136 cluster core inthe context of star formation and stellar dynamics.

1308.3238	rcw36: characterizing the outcome of massive star formation	massive stars play a dominant role in the process of clustered starformation, with their feedback into the molecular cloud through ionizingradiation, stellar winds and outflows. the formation process of massive starsis poorly constrained because of their scarcity, the short formation timescaleand obscuration. by obtaining a census of the newly formed stellar population,the star formation history of the young cluster and the role of the massivestars within it can be unraveled. we aim to reconstruct the formation historyof the young stellar population of the massive star-forming region rcw 36. westudy several dozens of individual objects, both photometrically andspectroscopically, look for signs of multiple generations of young stars andinvestigate the role of the massive stars in this process. we obtain a censusof the physical parameters and evolutionary status of the young stellarpopulation. using a combination of near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy weestimate ages and masses of individual objects. we identify the population ofembedded young stellar objects (yso) by their infrared colors and emission linespectra. rcw 36 harbors a stellar population of massive and intermediate-massstars located around the center of the cluster. class 0/i and ii sources arefound throughout the cluster. the central population has a median age of 1.1+/- 0.6 myr. of the stars which could be classified, the most massive ones aresituated in the center of the cluster. the central cluster is surrounded byfilamentary cloud structures; within these, some embedded and accreting ysosare found. our age determination is consistent with the filamentary structureshaving been shaped by the ionizing radiation and stellar winds of the centralmassive stars. the formation of a new generation of stars is ongoing, asdemonstrated by the presence of embedded protostellar clumps, and two exposedjets.

1309.2929	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xii. rotational velocities of the single  o-type stars	aims. using ground based multi-object optical spectroscopy obtained in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we aim to establish the(projected) rotational velocity distribution for a sample of 216 presumablysingle o-type stars in 30 doradus (30 dor).  methods. we measured projected rotational velocities, \vrot, by means of afourier transform method and a profile fitting method applied on a set ofisolated spectral lines. we also used an iterative deconvolution procedure toinfer the probability density, $\rm{p(\veq)}$, of the equatorial rotationalvelocity, \veq.  results. the distribution of \vrot\ shows a two-component structure: a peakaround 80 \kms\ and a high-velocity tail extending up to $\sim$600 \kms. thisstructure is also present in the inferred distribution $\rm{p(\veq)}$ witharound 80% of the sample having 0 $&lt;$ \veq\, $\leq\, 300$ \kms\ and the other20% distributed in the high-velocity region.  conclusions. most of the stars in our sample rotate with a rate less than20%\ of their break-up velocity. for the bulk of the sample, mass-loss in astellar wind and/or envelope expansion is not efficient enough to significantlyspin down these stars within the first few myr of evolution. the presence of asizeable population of fast rotators is compatible with recent populationsynthesis computations that investigate the influence of binary evolution onthe rotation rate of massive stars. despite the fact that we have excludedstars that show significant radial velocity variations, our sample may haveremained contaminated by post-interaction binary products. the fact that thehigh-velocity tail may be preferentially (and perhaps even exclusively),populated by post-binary interaction products, has important implications forthe evolutionary origin of systems that produce gamma-ray bursts.

1310.2849	on the nature of wo stars: a quantitative analysis of the wo3 star dr1  in ic 1613	context. oxygen sequence wolf-rayet (wo) stars are thought to represent thefinal evolutionary stage of the most massive stars. the characteristic strong ovi emission possibly originates from an enhanced oxygen abundance in thestellar wind. alternatively, the o vi emission can be caused by the hightemperature of these stars, in which case the wo stars are the high-temperatureextension of the more common carbon sequence wolf-rayet (wc) stars. aims. byconstraining the physical properties and evolutionary status of dr1, a wo starin the low-metallicity local group dwarf galaxy ic 1613 and one of only twoobjects of its class known in a smc-like metallicity environment, we aim toinvestigate the nature of wo stars and their evolutionary connection with wcstars. methods. we use the non-lte atmosphere code cmfgen to model the observedspectrum of dr1 and to derive its stellar and wind parameters. we compare ourvalues with other studies of wc and wo stars, as well as with the predictionsof evolutionary models. we also model the surrounding nebula using thephoto-ionization code cloudy. results. the oxygen and carbon abundances that weobtain are comparable to values found for wc stars. the temperature andluminosity are, however, higher than those of wc stars. dr1 is embedded in thehottest known h ii region in the local group. the nebular properties can beconsistently reproduced by cloudy models adopting dr1 as central ionizingsource. conclusions. comparison of the abundances and temperature of dr1 withcore helium-burning models show that dr1 is currently well into the second halfof helium burning. if the properties of dr1 are representative for the woclass, it would imply that wo stars are the high-temperature andhigh-luminosity extension of the wc stars, and do not necessarily represent alater evolutionary stage.

1312.3650	the incidence of stellar mergers and mass gainers among massive stars	because the majority of massive stars are born as members of close binarysystems, populations of massive main-sequence stars contain stellar mergers andproducts of binary mass transfer. we simulate populations of massive starsaccounting for all major binary evolution effects based on the most recentbinary parameter statistics and extensively evaluate the effect of modeluncertainties.  assuming constant star formation, we find that $8^{+9}_{-4}\,\%$ of a sampleof early type stars to be the product of a merger resulting from a close binarysystem. in total we find that $30^{+10}_{-15}\,\%$ of massive main-sequencestars are the product of binary interaction.  we show that the commonly adapted approach to minimize the effects ofbinaries on an observed sample by excluding systems detected as binariesthrough radial velocity campaigns can be counterproductive. systems withsignificant radial velocity variations are mostly pre-interaction systems.excluding them substantially enhances the relative incidence of mergers andbinary products in the non radial velocity variable sample.  this poses a challenge for testing single stellar evolutionary models. italso raises the question of whether certain peculiar classes of stars, such asmagnetic o-stars, are the result of binary interaction and it emphasizes theneed to further study the effect of binarity on the diagnostics that are usedto derive the fundamental properties (star-formation history, initial massfunction, mass to light ratio) of stellar populations nearby and at highredshift.

1409.1822	rotational velocities of single and binary o-type stars in the tarantula  nebula	rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars, affectingtheir evolution, chemical yields, ionizing photon budget, and final fate. wedetermined the projected rotational velocity, $v_e\sin i$, of $\sim$330 o-typeobjects, i.e. $\sim$210 spectroscopic single stars and $\sim$110 primaries inbinary systems, in the tarantula nebula or 30 doradus (30\,dor) region. theobservations were taken using vlt/flames and constitute the largest homogeneousdataset of multi-epoch spectroscopy of o-type stars currently available. themost distinctive feature of the $v_e\sin i$ distributions of thepresumed-single stars and primaries in 30 dor is a low-velocity peak at around100\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$. stellar winds are not expected to have spun-down thebulk of the stars significantly since their arrival on the main sequence andtherefore the peak in the single star sample is likely to represent the outcomeof the formation process. whereas the spin distribution of presumed-singlestars shows a well developed tail of stars rotating more rapidly than300\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$, the sample of primaries does not feature such ahigh-velocity tail. the tail of the presumed-single star distribution isattributed for the most part -- and could potentially be completely due -- tospun-up binary products that appear as single stars or that have merged. thiswould be consistent with the lack of such post-interaction products in thebinary sample, that is expected to be dominated by pre-interaction systems. thepeak in this distribution is broader and is shifted toward somewhat higher spinrates compared to the distribution of presumed-single stars. systems displayinglarge radial velocity variations, typical for short period systems, appearmostly responsible for these differences.

[...] thesouthern massive stars at high angular resolution survey (smash+) was designedto fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey ofgalactic massive stars. we observed 117 o-type stars with vlti/pionier and 162o-type stars with naco/sam, respectively probing the separation ranges 1-45 and30-250mas and brightness contrasts of delta h &lt; 4 and delta h &lt; 5. takingadvantage of naco's field-of-view, we further uniformly searched for visualcompanions in an 8''-radius down to delta h = 8. this paper describes theobservations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 newcompanions in the separation range from 1mas to 8'' and presents the catalog ofdetections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen knownlong-period spectroscopic binaries.  excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96objects in our main sample (dec &lt; 0 deg; h&lt;7.5) were observed both with pionierand naco/sam. the fraction of these stars with at least one resolved companionwithin 200mas is 0.53. accounting for known but unresolved spectroscopic oreclipsing companions, the multiplicity fraction at separation &lt; 8'' increasesto f_m = 0.91 +/- 0.03. the fraction of luminosity class v stars that have abound companion reaches 100% at 30mas while their average number of physicallyconnected companions within 8'' is f_c = 2.2 +/- 0.3. this demonstrates thatmassive stars form nearly exclusively in multiple systems. additionally, thenine non-thermal (nt) radio emitters observed by smash+ are all resolved [...]

1410.0934	the properties of ten o-type stars in the low-metallicity galaxies ic  1613, wlm and ngc 3109	massive stars likely played an important role in the reionization of theuniverse, and the formation of the first black holes. massive stars inlow-metallicity environments in the local universe are reminiscent of theirhigh redshift counterparts. in a previous paper, we reported on indicationsthat the stellar winds of low-metallicity o stars may be stronger thanpredicted, which would challenge the current paradigm of massive starevolution. in this paper, we aim to extend our initial sample of six o stars inlow-metallicity environments by four. we aim to derive their stellar and windparameters, and compare these to radiation-driven wind theory and stellarevolution models. we have obtained intermediate-resolution vlt/x-shooterspectra of our sample of stars. we derive the stellar parameters by fittingsynthetic fastwind line profiles to the vlt/x-shooter spectra using a geneticfitting algoritm. we compare our parameters to evolutionary tracks and obtainevolutionary masses and ages. we also investigate the effective temperatureversus spectral type calibration for smc and lower metallicities. finally, wereassess the wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. the derived parameters ofour target stars indicate stellar masses that reach values of up to 50$m_{\odot}$. the wind strengths of our stars are, on average, stronger thanpredicted from radiation-driven wind theory and reminiscent of stars with anlmc metallicity. we discuss indications that the iron content of the hostgalaxies is higher than originally thought and is instead smc-like. we findthat the discrepancy with theory is lessened, but remains significant for thishigher metallicity. this may imply that our current understanding of the windproperties of massive stars, both in the local universe as well as at cosmicdistances, remains incomplete.

1412.2705	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xix. b-type supergiants - atmospheric  parameters and nitrogen abundances to investigate the role of binarity and  the width of the main sequence	tlusty non-lte model atmosphere calculations have been used to determineatmospheric parameters and nitrogen (n) abundances for 34 single and 18 binaryb-type supergiants (bsgs). the effects of flux contribution from an unseensecondary were considered for the binary sample. we present the firstsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of bsgs across thetheoretical terminal age main sequence (tams). to account for the distributionof effective temperatures of the bsgs it may be necessary to extend the tams tolower temperatures. this is consistent with the derived distribution of massdiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and n abundances,provided that stars cooler than this temperature are post rsg objects. for thebsgs in the tarantula and previous flames surveys, most have small vsini. about10% have larger vsini (&gt;100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no nenhancement. all the cooler bsgs have low vsini of &lt;70km/s and high n abundanceestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blueloop may be important. a lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the smallsample size. single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, canaccount for the n enhancement in both the single and binary samples. thedetailed distribution of n abundances in the single and binary samples may bedifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. thefirst comparative study of single and binary bsgs has revealed that the mainsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending toteff=20000k. some marginal differences in single and binary atmosphericparameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standardevolution for some of the sample. this sample as a whole has implications forseveral aspects of our understanding of the evolution of bsgs. full abstract inpaper

1501.03794	the evolution of rotating very massive stars with lmc composition	we present a dense model grid with tailored input chemical compositionappropriate for the large magellanic cloud. we use a one-dimensionalhydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport ofangular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute ourdetailed models. we calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of70-500 msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. we find our rapidrotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotatingmodels. above 160 msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through massloss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent ofthe initial rotation rate. surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slowerrotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.for models above 150 mzams, and for models in the whole considered mass rangelater on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity ofthese models to their eddington limit. this leads to a maximum zero-age mainsequence surface temperature of 56000 k, at 180 msun, and to an evolution ofstars in the mass range 50-100 msun to the regime of luminous blue variables inthe hr diagram with high internal eddington factors. inflation also leads todecreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution ofstars above 180 msun. the cool surface temperatures due to the envelopeinflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars atlmc metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. thecorresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive lmc stars to producelong-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lowermasses.

1501.07239	molecfit: a general tool for telluric absorption correction. i. method  and application to eso instruments	context: the interaction of the light from astronomical objects with theconstituents of the earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluricabsorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. correcting for these lines,mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies onobservations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to thescience targets, therefore using precious observing time. aims: we presentmolecfit, a tool for correcting for telluric absorption lines based onsynthetic modelling of the earth's atmospheric transmission. molecfit isversatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-basedtelescopes and instruments. methods: molecfit combines a publicly availableradiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, andvarious kernels to model the instrument line spread function. the atmosphericprofiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representativeof a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and ofdynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, andhumidity. we discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability,and its limitations. we also show examples of telluric line correction onspectra obtained with a suite of eso very large telescope (vlt) instruments.results: compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best resultsfor temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatoryinto account. as a result, the standard deviation of the residuals aftercorrection of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2% of thecontinuum. conclusion: molecfit is able to accurately model and correct fortelluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions.(abridged)

1501.07265	molecfit: a general tool for telluric absorption correction ii.  quantitative evaluation on eso-vlt x-shooter spectra	context: absorption by molecules in the earth's atmosphere strongly affectsground-based astronomical observations. the resulting absorption line strengthand shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e.pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved.usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (tss)are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescopetime. we have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetictransmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges ofthe observed spectra of scientific objects. these spectra are calculated bymeans of the radiative transfer code lblrtm and an atmospheric model. in thisway, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performedwithout any additional calibration observations of tss. aims: we evaluate thequality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set ofarchival eso-vlt x-shooter visible and near-infrared spectra. methods: thanksto the wavelength coverage from the u to the k band, x-shooter is well suitedto investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respectto the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of thecode, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles.these investigations are based on two figures of merit, i_off and i_res, thatdescribe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of thecorrections. we also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correctionachieved with moelcfit to the classical method based on a telluric standardstar.

1503.00930	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xx. the nature of the x-ray bright  emission line star vfts 399	the stellar population of the 30 doradus star-forming region in the largemagellanic cloud contains a subset of apparently single, rapidly rotatingo-type stars. the physical processes leading to the formation of this cohortare currently uncertain. one member of this group, the late o-type star vfts399, is found to be unexpectedly x-ray bright for its bolometric luminosity -in this study we aim to determine its physical nature and the cause of thisbehaviour. we find vfts 399 to be an aperiodic photometric variable with anapparent near-ir excess. its optical spectrum demonstrates complex emissionprofiles in the lower balmer series and select hei lines - taken together thesesuggest an oebe classification. the highly variable x-ray luminosity is toogreat to be produced by a single star, while the hard, non-thermal naturesuggests the presence of an accreting relativistic companion. finally, thedetection of periodic modulation of the x-ray lightcurve is most naturallyexplained under the assumption that the accretor is a neutron star. vfts 399appears to be the first high-mass x-ray binary identified within 30 dor.comparison of the current properties of vfts 399 to binary-evolution modelssuggests a progenitor mass in excess of 25msun for the putative neutron star,which may host a magnetic field comparable in strength to those of magnetars.vfts 399 is now the second member of the cohort of rapidly rotating `single'o-type stars in 30 dor to show evidence of binary interaction resulting inspin-up, suggesting that this may be a viable evolutionary pathway for theformation of a subset of this stellar population.

1507.02286	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xxi. stellar spin rates of o-type  spectroscopic binaries	the initial distribution of spin rates of massive stars is a fingerprint oftheir elusive formation process. it also sets a key initial condition forstellar evolution and is thus an important ingredient in stellar populationsynthesis. so far, most studies have focused on single stars. most o stars arehowever found in multiple systems. by establishing the spin-rate distributionof a sizeable sample of o-type spectroscopic binaries and by comparing thedistributions of binary sub-populations with one another as well as with thatof presumed single stars in the same region, we aim to constrain the initialspin distribution of o stars in binaries, and to identify signatures of thephysical mechanisms that affect the evolution of the massive stars spin rates.we use ground-based optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of thevlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts) to establish the projected equatorialrotational velocities (\vrot) for components of 114 spectroscopic binaries in30 doradus. the \vrot\ values are derived from the full-width at half-maximum(fwhm) of a set of spectral lines, using a fwhm vs. \vrot\ calibration that wederive based on previous line analysis methods applied to single o-type starsin the vfts sample. the overall \vrot\ distribution of the primary starsresembles that of single o-type stars in the vfts, featuring a low-velocitypeak (at $\vrot &lt; 200$ kms) and a shoulder at intermediate velocities ($200 &lt;\vrot &lt; 300$ kms). the distributions of binaries and single stars howeverdiffer in two ways. first, the main peak at $\vrot \sim$100 kms is broader andslightly shifted toward higher spin rates in the binary distribution comparedto that of the presumed-single stars. second, the \vrot distribution ofprimaries lacks a significant population of stars spinning faster than 300 kmswhile such a population is clearly present in the single star sample.

1507.03591	b fields in ob stars (bob): detection of a strong magnetic field in the  o9.7 v star hd54879	the number of magnetic stars detected among massive stars is small;nevertheless, the role played by the magnetic field in stellar evolution cannotbe disregarded. links between line profile variability, enhancements/depletionsof surface chemical abundances, and magnetic fields have been identified forlow-mass b-stars, but for the o-type domain this is almost unexplored. based onfors2 and harps spectropolarimetric data, we present the first detection of amagnetic field in hd54879, a single slowly rotating o9.7 v star. using twoindependent and different techniques we obtained the firm detection of asurface average longitudinal magnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about600 g, in modulus. a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the star with thestellar atmosphere code fastwind results in an effective temperature and asurface gravity of 33000$\pm1000$ k and 4.0$\pm0.1$ dex. the abundances ofcarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium are found to be slightly lowerthan solar, but compatible within the errors. we investigate line-profilevariability in hd54879 by complementing our spectra with spectroscopic datafrom other recent ob-star surveys. the photospheric lines remain constant inshape between 2009 and 2014, although h$\alpha$ shows a variable emission. theh$\alpha$ emission is too strong for a standard o9.7 v and is probably linkedto the magnetic field and the presence of circumstellar material. its normalchemical composition and the absence of photospheric line profile variationsmake hd54879 the most strongly magnetic, non-variable single o-star detected todate.

1509.08940	discovery of the massive overcontact binary vfts 352: evidence for  enhanced internal mixing	the contact phase expected to precede the coalescence of two massive stars ispoorly characterized due to the paucity of observational constraints. here wereport on the discovery of vfts 352, an o-type binary in the 30 doradus region,as the most massive and earliest spectral type overcontact system known todate. we derived the 3d geometry of the system, its orbital period $p_{\rmorb}=1.1241452(4)$ d, components' effective temperatures -- $t_1=42\,540\pm280$k and $t_2=41\,120\pm290$ k -- and dynamical masses -- $m_1=28.63\pm0.30m_{\odot}$ and $m_2 = 28.85\pm0.30 m_{\odot}$. compared to single-starevolutionary models, the vfts 352 components are too hot for their dynamicalmasses by about 2700 and 1100 k, respectively. these results can be explainednaturally as a result of enhanced mixing, theoretically predicted to occur invery short-period tidally-locked systems. the vfts 352 components are two ofthe best candidates identified so far to undergo this so-called chemicallyhomogeneous evolution. the future of vfts 352 is uncertain. if the two starsmerge, a very rapidly rotating star will be produced. instead, if the starscontinue to evolve homogeneously and keep shrinking within their roche lobes,coalescence can be avoided. in this case, tides may counteract the spin down bywinds such that the vfts 352 components may, at the end of their life, fulfillthe requirements for long gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitors in the collapsarscenario. independently of whether the vfts 352 components become grbprogenitors, this scenario makes vfts 352 interesting as a progenitor of ablack hole binary, hence as a potential gravitational wave source through blackhole-black hole merger.

astro-ph;0402412	a phase-resolved xmm-newton campaign on the colliding wind binary hd  152248	we report the first results of an xmm-newton monitoring campaign of the ngc6231 open cluster in the sco ob1 association. this first paper focuses on themassive colliding wind binary hd 152248, which is the brightest x-ray source ofthe cluster. the campaign, with a total duration of 180 ksec, was split intosix separate observations, following the orbital motion of hd 152248. the x-rayflux from this system presents a clear, asymmetric modulation with the phaseand ranges from 0.73 to 1.18 10-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the [0.5-10.0 kev] energyband. the maximum of the emission is reached slightly after apastron. the epicspectra are quite soft and peak around 0.8-0.9 kev. we characterize their shapeusing several combinations of mekal models and power-law spectra and we detectsignificant spectral variability in the [0.5-2.5 kev] energy band. we alsoperform 2-d hydrodynamical simulations using different sets of parameters thatclosely reproduce the physical and orbital configuration of the hd 152248system at the time of the six xmm-newton pointings. this allows a directconfrontation of the model predictions with the constraints deduced from thex-ray observations of the system. we show that the observed variation of theflux can be explained by a variation of the x-ray emission from the collidingwind zone, diluted by the softer x-ray contribution of the two o-type stars ofthe system. our simulations also reveal that the interaction region of hd152248 should be highly unstable, giving rise to shells of dense gas that areseparated by low density regions. finally, we perform a search for short-termvariability in the light curves of the system and we show that trends arepresent within several of the 30 ksec exposures of our campaign. further, mostof these trends are in good .

astro-ph;0406230	quasi-simultaneous xmm-newton and vla observation of the non-thermal  radio emitter hd\168112 (o5.5iii(f^+))	we report the results of a multiwavelength study of the non-thermal radioemitter hd168112 (o5.5iii(f^+)). the detailed analysis of twoquasi-simultaneous xmm-newton and vla observations reveals strong variabilityof this star both in the x-ray and radio ranges. the x-ray observationsseparated by five months reveal a decrease of the x-ray flux of ~30%. the radioemission on the other hand increases by a factor 5-7 between the twoobservations obtained roughly simultaneously with the xmm-newton pointings. thex-ray data reveal a hard emission that is most likely produced by a thermalplasma at kt ~2-3 kev while the vla data confirm the non-thermal status of thisstar in the radio waveband. comparison with archive x-ray and radio dataconfirms the variability of this source in both wavelength ranges over a yetill defined time scale. the properties of hd168112 in the x-ray and radiodomain point towards a binary system with a significant eccentricity and anorbital period of a few years. however, our optical spectra reveal nosignificant changes of the star's radial velocity suggesting that if hd168112is indeed a binary, it must be seen under a fairly low inclination.

astro-ph;0411461	ngc 6231: x-ray properties of the early-type star population	based on a deep xmm-newton observation of the young open cluster ngc 6231, wederive the main x-ray properties of its early-type star population. among the610 x-ray sources detected in the field, 42 are associated with early-typestars. we investigate their $l_\mathrm{x} / l_\mathrm{bol}$ relationship and weconfirm the clear dichotomy between o- and b-type stars. the cut-off linebetween the two behaviours occurs at $l_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$as previously proposed by \citet{bsc97}. the distinction between single andbinary stars is not clear cut, except for the colliding wind system hd 152248.the x-ray detected b-stars in ngc 6231 appear to be more luminous thanpredicted from the \citeauthor{bsc97} relation. though this suggests a bimodaldistribution of the b-star x-ray emission, we caution however that theseresults might be biased by detection limits. finally we investigate the x-rayvariability of the detected sources and we find that about 40% of the x-rayemitters in the field of view present consistent signs of variability in theepic instruments. this fraction is much larger than previously thought. aboutone third of the early-type stars population, either singles or binaries,further shows variability. these variations do not seem to be exclusivelyrelated to binarity and could thus not be systematically interpreted in theframework of a wind-wind collision phenomenon.

astro-ph;0503096	optical spectroscopy of x-mega targets in the carina nebula - v. the  spectroscopic binary hd93161a and its visual companion hd93161b	we present the analysis of an extensive set of high resolution spectroscopicobservations of hd93161, a visual binary with a separation of 2 arcsec. hd93161a is a spectroscopic binary, with both components clearly detected throughoutthe orbit. the primary star is most probably of spectral type o8v, while thesecondary is likely an o9v. we obtain the first orbital solution for thissystem, characterized by a period of 8.566\pm0.004 days. the minimum masses ofthe primary and secondary stars are 22.2\pm0.6 m_sol and 17.0\pm0.4 m_solrespectively. these values are quite large, suggesting a high inclination ofthe orbit. the second object, hd93161 b, displays an o6.5v((f)) spectral typeand is thus slightly hotter than its neighbour. this star is at first sightsingle but presents radial velocity variations. we finally study hd93161 in thex-ray domain. no significant variability is detected. the x-ray spectrum iswell described by a 2t model with kt_1~0.3kev and kt_2~0.7kev. the x-rayluminosity is rather moderate, without any large emission excess imputable to awind interaction.

astro-ph;0509542	the massive binary cpd-41degr7742 ii. optical light curve and x-ray  observations	in the first paper of this series, we presented a detailed high-resolutionspectroscopic study of cpd - 41degr7742, deriving for the first time an orbitalsolution for both components of the system. in this second paper, we focus onthe analysis of the optical light curve and on recent xmm-newton x-rayobservations. in the optical, the system presents two eclipses, yielding aninclination i ~ 77degr. combining the constraints from the photometry with theresults of our previous work, we derive the absolute parameters of the system.we confirm that the two components of cpd - 41degr7742 are main sequence stars(o9 v + b1-1.5 v) with masses (m_1 ~ 18 msol and m_2 ~ 10 msol) and respectiveradii (r_1 ~ 7.5 rsol and r_2 ~ 5.4 rsol) close to the typical values expectedfor such stars. we also report an unprecedented set of x-ray observations thatalmost uniformly cover the 2.44-day orbital cycle. the x-ray emission from cpd- 41degr7742 is well described by a two-temperature thermal plasma model withenergies close to 0.6 and 1.0 kev, thus slightly harder than typical early-typeemission. the x-ray light curve shows clear signs of variability. the emissionlevel is higher when the primary is in front of the secondary. during the highemission state, the system shows a drop of its x-ray emission that almostexactly matches the optical eclipse. we interpret the main features of thex-ray light curve as the signature of a wind-photosphere interaction, in whichthe overwhelming primary o9 star wind crashes into the secondary surface.alternatively the light curve could result from a wind-wind interaction zonelocated near the secondary star surface. as a support to our interpretation, weprovide a phenomenological geometric model that qualitatively reproduces theobserved modulations of the x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0510822	cpd-41deg7742: an unusual wind interaction	we summarize the results of a multiwavelength observing campaign on themassive eclipsing binary cpd-41deg7742, another remarkable object in the youngopen cluster ngc 6231. our campaign relies on high resolution echellespectroscopy, narrow-band optical photometry, and xmm-newton x-rayobservations. combined with the spectroscopic analysis, the light curveanalysis provides a direct measurement of the masses and sizes of the systemcomponents. however, the most outstanding results come from the xmm-newtonobservations. our 180 ks campaign towards ngc 6231, and cpd-41deg7742, providesan unprecedented phase coverage of such a close early-type binary. the epic-moslight curves almost fully cover the 2.4 day period of the system and thebrightness of the object is sufficient to yield a time resolution as tight as 1ks. the x-ray flux presents clear variations along the orbit, that we interpretas the signature of an unusual wind interaction. we indeed expect that, in thiso+b system, the dominant primary wind crashes into the secondary surface,leading to a wind-photosphere interaction. as a strong support to ourinterpretation, we provide a geometrical model that associates an extra x-rayemission to the secondary inner surface. though quite simple, the present modelmatches the main features of the x-ray light curve.

astro-ph;0511700	an exceptional x-ray view of the young open cluster ngc 6231: what  xmm-newton has taught us	considered as the core of the sco ob1 association, the young open cluster ngc6231 harbours a rich o-type star population. in 2001, the xmm-newton satellitetargeted the cluster for a nominal duration of about 180 ks. thanks to thedetector sensitivity, the epic cameras provided an unprecedented x-ray view ofngc 6231, revealing about 600 point-like sources. in this contribution, wereview the main results that have been obtained thanks to this unprecedenteddata set. concerning the o-type stars, we present the latest developmentsrelated to the so-called 'canonical' lx-lbol relation. the dispersion aroundthis relation might actually be much smaller than previously thought. in ourdata set, the sole mechanism that yields a significant deviation from thisscheme is wind interaction. it is also the sole mechanism that induces asignificant variation of the early-type star x-ray flux. in a second part ofthis contribution, we probe the properties of the optically faint x-raysources. most of them are believed to be low mass pre-main sequence stars.their analysis provides direct insight into the star formation history of thecluster.

astro-ph;0603783	an xmm-newton view of the young open cluster ngc 6231 -- i. the  catalogue	this paper is the first of a series dedicated to the x-ray properties of theyoung open cluster ngc 6231. our data set relies on an xmm-newton campaign of anominal duration of 180 ks and reveals that ngc 6231 is very rich in the x-raydomain too. indeed, 610 x-ray sources are detected in the present field ofview, centered on the cluster core. the limiting sensitivity of our survey isapproximately 6e-15 erg/s/cm^2 but clearly depends on the location in the fieldof view and on the source spectrum. using different existing catalogues, over85% of the x-ray sources could be associated with at least one optical and/orinfrared counterpart within a limited cross-correlation radius of 3 arcsec atmaximum. the surface density distribution of the x-ray sources presents aslight n-s elongation. once corrected for the spatial sensitivity variation ofthe epic instruments, the radial profile of the source surface density is welldescribed by a king profile with a central density of about 8 sources perarcmin^2 and a core radius close to 3.1arcmin. the distribution of the x-raysources seems closely related to the optical source distribution. the expectednumber of foreground and background sources should represent about 9% of thedetected sources, thus strongly suggesting that most of the observed x-rayemitters are physically belonging to ngc 6231. finally, beside a few bright butsoft objects -- corresponding to the early-type stars of the cluster -- most ofthe sources are relatively faint (~5e-15 erg/s/cm^2) with an energydistribution peaked around 1.0-2.0 kev.

astro-ph;0607486	an xmm-newton view of the young open cluster ngc 6231 -- ii. the ob star  population	in this second paper, we pursue the analysis of the 180 ks xmm-newtoncampaign towards the young open cluster ngc 6231 and we focus on its rich obstar population. we present a literature-based census of the ob stars in thefield of view with more than one hundred objects, among which 30% can beassociated with an x-ray source. all the o-type stars are detected in the x-raydomain as soft and reasonably strong emitters. in the 0.5-10.0 kev band, theirx-ray luminosities scale with their bolometric luminosities as $\logl_\mathrm{x} - \log l_\mathrm{bol}=-6.912\pm0.153$. such a scaling law holds inthe soft (0.5-1.0 kev) and intermediate (1.0-2.5 kev) bands but breaks down inthe hard band. while the two colliding wind binaries in our sample clearlydeviate from this scheme, the remaining o-type objects show a very limiteddispersion (40% or 20% according to whether `cool' dwarfs are included or not),much smaller than that obtained from previous studies. at our detectionthreshold and within our sample, the sole identified mechanism that producessignificant modulations in the o star x-ray emission is related to windinteraction. the intrinsic x-ray emission of non-peculiar o-type stars seemsthus constant for a given star and the level of its x-ray emission isaccurately related to the its luminosity or, equivalently, to its windproperties. among b-type stars, the detection rate is only about 25% in thesub-type range b0-b4 and remains mostly uniform throughout the differentsub-populations while it drops significantly at later sub-types. the associatedx-ray spectra are harder than those of o-type stars. our analysis pointstowards the detected emission being associated with a physical pms companion&gt;...

astro-ph;0701574	constraining the fundamental parameters of the o-type binary  cpd-41degr7733	using a set of high-resolution spectra, we studied the physical and orbitalproperties of the o-type binary cpd-41 7733, located in the core of \ngc. wereport the unambiguous detection of the secondary spectral signature and wederive the first sb2 orbital solution of the system. the period is 5.6815 +/-0.0015 d and the orbit has no significant eccentricity. cpd-41 7733 probablyconsists of stars of spectral types o8.5 and b3. as for other objects in thecluster, we observe discrepant luminosity classifications while usingspectroscopic or brightness criteria. still, the present analysis suggests thatboth components display physical parameters close to those of typical o8.5 andb3 dwarfs. we also analyze the x-ray light curves and spectra obtained duringsix 30 ks xmm-newton pointings spread over the 5.7 d period. we find nosignificant variability between the different pointings, nor within theindividual observations. the cpd-41 7733 x-ray spectrum is well reproduced by athree-temperature thermal mekal model with temperatures of 0.3, 0.8 and 2.4kev. no x-ray overluminosity, resulting e.g. from a possible wind interaction,is observed. the emission of cpd-41 7733 is thus very representative of typicalo-type star x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0703104	an xmm-newton view of the young open cluster ngc 6231 iii. optically  faint x-ray sources	we discuss the properties of the x-ray sources with faint opticalcounterparts in the very young open cluster ngc 6231. from their positions inthe h-r diagram, we find that the bulk of these objects probably consists oflow-mass pre-main sequence stars with masses in the range 0.3 to 3.0m$_{\odot}$. the age distribution of these objects indicates that low-mass starformation in ngc 6231 started more than 10 myr ago and culminated in astarburst-like event about 1 to 4 myr ago when the bulk of the low-mass pmsstars as well as the massive cluster members formed. we find no evidence for aspatial age gradient that could point towards a sequential star formationprocess. only a few x-ray sources have counterparts with a reddening exceedingthe average value of the cluster or with infrared colours indicating thepresence of a moderate near-ir excess. the x-ray spectra of the brightest pmssources are best fitted by rather hard thermal plasma models and a significantfraction of these sources display flares in their light curve. the x-raybrightest flaring sources have decay times between 2 and 16 ks. the x-rayselected pms stars in ngc 6231 have $\log{l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol}}$ values thatincrease strongly with decreasing bolometric luminosity and can reach asaturation level ($\log{l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol}} \sim -2.4$) for non-flaringsources and even more extreme values during flares.
