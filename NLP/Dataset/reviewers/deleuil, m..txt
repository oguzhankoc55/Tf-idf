0901.4618	photospheric activity and rotation of the planet-hosting star  corot-exo-4a	the space experiment corot has recently detected a transiting hot jupiter inorbit around a moderately active f-type main-sequence star (corot-exo-4a). thisplanetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of9.202 days, the second longest one among the transiting planets known to date.we study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during anuninterrupted sequence of optical observations of 58 days. our approach isbased on a maximum entropy spot modelling technique extensively tested bymodelling the variation of the total solar irradiance. it assumes that stellaractive regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspotsand solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellarrotation. the modelling of the light curve of corot-exo-4a reveals three mainactive longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotatequasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet. the differentrotation rates of the active longitudes are interpreted in terms of surfacedifferential rotation and a lower limit of 0.057 \pm 0.015 is derived for itsrelative amplitude. the enhancement of activity observed close to thesubplanetary longitude suggests a magnetic star-planet interaction, althoughthe short duration of the time series prevents us from drawing definiteconclusions.

0903.1829	noise properties of the corot data: a planet-finding perspective	in this short paper, we study the photometric precision of stellar lightcurves obtained by the corot satellite in its planet finding channel, with aparticular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.together with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms anattempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of thecorot planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.  after pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variationsand outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first threecorot runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter toisolate signal on the timescales of interest. the bevhaiour of the noise on 2htimescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in r-magnitude,ranging from 0.1mmag at r=11.5 to 1mmag at r=16, which is close to thepre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise dueto residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. there is evidence for a slightdegradation of the performance over time. we find clear evidence for enhancedvariability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identifiedas likely giants from their r-magnitude and b-v colour, which representapproximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of aquilaand monoceros respectively. on the other hand, median correlated noise levelsover 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.

0907.1653	the secondary eclipse of corot-1b	the transiting planet corot-1b is thought to belong to the pm-class ofplanets, in which the thermal emission dominates in the optical wavelengths. wepresent a detection of its secondary eclipse in the corot white channel data,whose response function goes from ~400 to ~1000 nm. we used two differentfiltering approaches, and several methods to evaluate the significance of adetection of the secondary eclipse. we detect a secondary eclipse centeredwithin 20 min at the expected times for a circular orbit, with a depth of0.016+/-0.006%. the center of the eclipse is translated in a 1-sigma upperlimit to the planet's eccentricity of ecosomega&lt;0.014. under the assumption ofa zero bond albedo and blackbody emission from the planet, it corresponds to at_{corot}=2330 +120-140 k. we provide the equilibrium temperatures of theplanet as a function of the amount of reflected light. if the planet is inthermal equilibrium with the incident flux from the star, our results imply aninefficient transport mechanism of the flux from the day to the night sides.

0909.4797	identification of variable stars in corot's first main observing field  (lrc1)	the corot space mission will monitor several target fields for up to 150 daysto perform asteroseismology and to search for extrasolar planets by photometrictransits. variable stars in the target fields are important objects foradditional scientific studies but can also disturb the search for planetarytransits. a variability characterization of the target fields prior to corotobservations is therefore important for two reasons: to find interestingvariable stars to monitor further and to make an analysis of the impact of thevariable stars on detecting extrasolar planet transits with corot. the berlinexoplanet search telescope (best) is a small wide-angle telescope dedicated tohigh-precision photometry. it has observed a 9 square degree field of viewcentered at (alpha, delta)=(19h00m00.0s, +00deg01'55.2") (j2000.0) over 98nights to search for variable stars in the surroundings of the first long-runtarget field (lrc1) of the corot space mission. in this data set we identified92 periodic variable stars, 86 of which are new discoveries and 6 of which areknown from the general catalogue of variable stars (gcvs). for five of the gcvsstars, variability could not be confirmed. forty-three of the 92 detectedperiodic variable stars are identified as eclipsing binaries. we have evaluatedthe completeness of our survey for eclipsing binaries by comparing it to theexpected fraction of eclipsing binaries based on hipparcos observations. fromthis evaluation we show that the best data set presented here has acompleteness of 20%-30% for periods longer than 1 day and is complete relativeto hipparcos for short-period binaries.

0911.3585	transit timing analysis of corot-1b	corot, the pioneer space-based transit search, steadily provides thousands ofhigh-precision light curves with continuous time sampling over periods of up to5 months. the transits of a planet perturbed by an additional object are notstrictly periodic. by studying the transit timing variations (ttvs), additionalobjects can be detected in the system.  a transit timing analysis of corot-1b is carried out to constrain theexistence of additional planets in the system.  we used data obtained by an improved version of the corot data pipeline(version 2.0). individual transits were fitted to determine the mid-transittimes, and we analyzed the derived $o-c$ diagram. n-body integrations were usedto place limits on secondary planets.  no periodic timing variations with a period shorter than the observationalwindow (55 days) are found. the presence of an earth-mass trojan is not likely.a planet of mass greater than $\sim 1$ earth mass can be ruled out by thepresent data if the object is in a 2:1 (exterior) mean motion resonance withcorot-1b. considering initially circular orbits: (i) super-earths (less than 10earth-masses) are excluded for periods less than about 3.5 days, (ii)saturn-like planets can be ruled out for periods less than about 5 days, (iii)jupiter-like planets should have a minimum orbital period of about 6.5 days.

1005.3208	improved stellar parameters of corot-7	accurate parameters of the host stars of exoplanets are important for theinterpretation of the new planet systems that continue to emerge. the corotsatellite recently discovered a transiting rocky planet with a density similarto the inner planets in our solar system, a so-called super earth. this planetis orbiting a relatively faint g9v star called corot-7, and we wish to refineits physical properties, which are important for the interpretation of theproperties of the planet system. we used spectra from harps@eso-3.6m anduves@vlt-8.2m. from the analysis of fe-1 and fe-2 lines we determine teff, logg and microturbulence. we use the balmer lines to constrain teff and pressuresensitive mg-1b and ca lines to constrain log g. from the analysis we findteff=5250+-60k, log g = 4.47+-0.05, [m/h]=+0.12+-0.06, and vsini = 1.1 km/s. wecompared the l/m ratio with isochrones to constrain the evolutionary status.using the age estimate of 1.2-2.3 gyr based on stellar activity, we determinethe mass and radius 0.91+-0.03 msun and 0.82+-0.04 rsun. with these updatedconstraints we fitted the corot transit light curve for corot-7b. we revise theplanet radius to be slightly smaller, r = 1.58+-0.10 rearth, and the densitybecomes higher, rho = 7.2+-1.8 g/cm3. the host star corot-7 is a slowlyrotating, metal rich, unevolved type g9v star. the star is relatively faint(v=11.7) and its fundamental parameters can only be determined through indirectmethods. our methods rely on detailed spectral analyses that depend on theadopted model atmospheres. from the analysis of spectra of stars withwell-known parameters with similar parameters to corot-7 (the sun and alpha cenb) we demonstrate that our methods are robust within the claimed uncertainties.therefore our methods can be reliably used in subsequent analyses of similarexoplanet host stars.

1110.2384	planetary transit candidates in the corot lra01 field	context: corot is a pioneering space mission whose primary goals are stellarseismology and extrasolar planets search. its surveys of large stellar fieldsgenerate numerous planetary candidates whose lightcurves have transit-likefeatures. an extensive analytical and observational follow-up effort isundertaken to classify these candidates. aims: the list of planetary transitcandidates from the corot lra01 star field in the monoceros constellationtowards the galactic anti-center is presented. the corot observations of lra01lasted from 24 october 2007 to 3 march 2008. methods: 7470 chromatic and 3938monochromatic lightcurves were acquired and analysed. instrumental noise andstellar variability were treated with several filtering tools by differentteams from the corot community. different transit search algorithms wereapplied to the lightcurves. results: fifty-one stars were classified asplanetary transit candidates in lra01. thirty-seven (i.e., 73 % of allcandidates) are "good" planetary candidates based on photometric analysis only.thirty-two (i.e., 87 % of the "good" candidates) have been followed-up. at thetime of this writing twenty-two cases have been solved and five planets havebeen discovered: three transiting hot-jupiters (corot-5b, corot-12b, andcorot-21b), the first terrestrial transiting planet (corot-7b), and anotherplanet in the same system (corot-7c, detected by radial velocity survey only).evidences of another non-transiting planet in the corot-7 system, namelycorot-7d, have been recently found.

1110.5462	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates. v. the three hot  jupiters koi-135b, koi-204b and koi-203b (alias kepler-17b)	we report the discovery of two new transiting hot jupiters, koi-135b andkoi-204b, that were previously identified as planetary candidates by borucki etal. 2011, and, independently of the kepler team, confirm the planetary natureof kepler-17b, recently announced by desert et al. 2011. radial-velocitymeasurements, taken with the sophie spectrograph at the ohp, and keplerphotometry (q1 and q2 data) were used to derive the orbital, stellar andplanetary parameters. koi-135b and koi-204b orbit their parent stars in 3.02and 3.25 days, respectively. they have approximately the same radius,rp=1.20+/-0.06 r_jup and 1.24+/-0.07 r_jup, but different masses mp=3.23+/-0.19m_jup and 1.02+/-0.07 m_jup. as a consequence, their bulk densities differ by afactor of four, rho_p=2.33+/-0.36 g.cm^-3 (koi-135b) and 0.65+/-0.12 g.cm-3(koi-204b). our sophie spectra of kepler-17b, used both to measure theradial-velocity variations and determine the atmospheric parameters of the hoststar, allow us to refine the characterisation of the planetary system. inparticular we found the radial-velocity semi-amplitude and the stellar mass tobe respectively slightly smaller and larger than desert et al. these twoquantities, however, compensate and lead to a planetary mass fully consistentwith desert et al.: our analysis gives mp=2.47+/-0.10 m_jup and rp=1.33+/-0.04r_jup. we found evidence for a younger age of this planetary system, t&lt;1.8 gyr,which is supported by both evolutionary tracks and gyrochronology. finally, weconfirm the detection of the optical secondary eclipse and found also thebrightness phase variation with the q1 and q2 kepler data. the latter indicatesa low redistribution of stellar heat to the night side (&lt;16% at 1-sigma), ifthe optical planetary occultation comes entirely from thermal flux. thegeometric albedo is a_g&lt;0.12 (1-sigma).

1112.1035	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxi. corot-19b: a low  density planet orbiting an old inactive f9v-star	observations of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance to ourunderstanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can bedetermined. the corot space mission allows us to achieve a very highphotometric accuracy. by combining corot data with high-precision radialvelocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. we reportthe discovery of corot-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactivef9v-type star with a period of four days. after excluding alternative physicalconfigurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radiusand mass of the planet by combining corot photometry with high-resolutionspectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs sophie, harps, fies, andsandiford. to improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observedadditional transits with the trappist and euler telescopes. using harps spectraobtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between thespin of the star and the orbit of the planet. we find that the host star ofcorot-19b is an inactive f9v-type star close to the end of its main-sequencelife. the host star has a mass m*=1.21+/-0.05 msun and radius r*=1.65+/-0.04rsun. the planet has a mass of mp=1.11+/-0.06 mjup and radius of rp=1.29+/-0.03rjup. the resulting bulk density is only rho=0.71+/-0.06 gcm-3, which is muchlower than that for jupiter. the exoplanet corot-19b is an example of a giantplanet of almost the same mass as jupiter but a 30% larger radius.

1203.1143	multi-object spectroscopy of stars in the corot fields i: early-type  stars in the corot-fields ira01, lra01, lra02	observations of giant stars indicate that the frequency of giant planets ismuch higher for intermediate-mass stars than for solar-like stars. up to nowall known planets of giant stars orbit at relatively far distances from theirhost stars. it is not known whether intermediate-mass stars also had manyclose-in planets when they were on the main sequence, which were then engulfedwhen the star became a giant star. to understand the formation and evolution ofplanets it is therefore important to find out whether main-sequence stars ofintermediate-mass have close-in planets or not. a survey for transiting planetsof intermediate-mass stars would be ideal to solve this question, because thedetection of transiting planets is not affected by the rapid rotation of thesestars. as a first step for an efficient survey we need to identifyintermediate-mass stars in the corot-fields, which can then be used as an inputlist. to compile the input list we derived the spectral types of essentiallyall o, b and a stars down to 14.5 mag in the corot fields ira01, lra01, lra02taken with the multi-object spectrograph aaomega. we determined the spectraltypes by comparing the spectra with template spectra from a library. in totalwe identify 1856 a and b stars that have been observed with corot. given thenumber of planets that have been detected in these fields amongst late-typestars, we estimate that there are one to four transiting planets ofintermediate-mass stars waiting to be discovered. our survey not only allows usto carry out a dedicated planet search programme but is also essential for anytypes of studies of the light curves of early-type stars in the corot database.we also show that it would be possible to extend the survey to all fields thatcorot has observed using photometrically determined spectral types.

1206.0601	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates vii. a false-positive  rate of 35% for kepler close-in giant exoplanet candidates	the false-positive probability (fpp) of kepler transiting candidates is a keyvalue for statistical studies of candidate properties. a previous investigationof the stellar population in the kepler field has provided an estimate for thefpp of less than 5% for most of the candidates. we report here the results ofour radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 kepler candidates with atransit depth greater than 0.4%, orbital period less than 25 days and host starbrighter than kepler magnitude 14.7. we used the sophie spectrograph mounted onthe 1.93-m telescope at the observatoire de haute-provence to establish thenature of the transiting candidates. in this sample, we found five undilutedeclipsing binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and ninenew transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets. theremaining 13 candidates were not followed-up or remain unsolved due to photonnoise limitation or lack of observations. from these results we computed thefpp for kepler close-in giant candidates to be 34.8% \pm 6.5%. we aimed toinvestigate the variation of the fpp for giant candidates with the longerorbital periods and found that it should be constant for orbital periodsbetween 10 and 200 days. this significant disagrees with the previousestimates. we discuss the reasons for this discrepancy and the possibleextension of this work toward smaller planet candidates. finally, taking thefalse-positive rate into account, we refined the occurrence rate of hotjupiters from the kepler data.

1206.2165	multi-object spectroscopy of stars in the corot fields ii: the stellar  population of the corot fields ira01, lra01, lra02, and lra06	with now more than 20 exoplanets discovered by corot, it has often beenconsidered strange that so many of them are orbiting f-stars, and so few ofthem k or m-stars. although transit search programs are mostly sensitive toshort-period planets, they are ideal for verifying these results. to determinethe frequency of planets as a function of stellar mass, we also have tocharacterize the sample of stars that was observed. we study the stellarcontent of the corot-fields ira01, lra01 (=lra06), and lra02 by determining thespectral types of 11466 stars. we used spectra obtained with the multi-objectspectrograph aaomega and derived the spectral types by using template spectrawith well-known parameters. we find that 34.8+/-0.7% of the stars observed bycorot in these fields are f-dwarfs, 15.1+/-0.5% g-dwarfs, and 5.0+/-0.3%k-dwarfs. we conclude that the apparent lack of exoplanets of k- and m-stars isexplained by the relatively small number of these stars in the observed sample.we also show that the apparently large number of planets orbiting f-stars issimilarly explained by the large number of such stars in these fields. ourstudy also shows that the difference between the sample of stars that corotobserves and a sample of randomly selected stars is relatively small, and thatthe yield of corot specifically is the detection one hot jupiter amongst2100+/-700 stars. we conclude that transit search programs can be used to studythe relation between the frequency of planets and the mass of the host stars,and that the results obtained so far generally agree with those of radialvelocity programs.

1207.1715	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates vi. an additional  companion in the koi-13 system	we report the discovery of a new stellar companion in the koi-13 system.koi-13 is composed by two fast-rotating a-type stars of similar magnitude. oneof these two stars hosts a transiting planet discovered by kepler. we obtainednew radial velocity measurements using the sophie spectrograph at theobservatoire de haute-provence that revealed an additional companion in thissystem. this companion has a mass between 0.4 and 1 msun and orbits one of thetwo main stars with a period of 65.831 \pm 0.029 days and an eccentricity of0.52 \pm 0.02. the radial velocities of the two stars were derived using amodel of two fast-rotating line profiles. from the residuals, we found a hintof the stellar variations seen in the kepler light curve with an amplitude ofabout 1.41 km/s and a period close to the rotational period. this signalappears to be about three order of magnitude larger than expected for stellaractivity. from the analysis of the residuals, we also put a 3-sigma upper-limiton the mass of the transiting planet koi-13.01 of 14.8 mjup and 9.4 mjup,depending on which star hosts the transit. we found that this new companion hasno significant impact on the photometric determination of the mass of koi-13.01but is expected to affect precise infrared photometry. finally, using dynamicalsimulations, we infer that the new companion is orbiting around koi-13b whilethe transiting planet candidate is expected to orbit koi-13a. thus, thetransiting planet candidate koi-13.01 is orbiting the main component of ahierarchical triple system.

1210.3221	from corot 102899501 to the sun. a time evolution model of chromospheric  activity on the main sequence	using a model based on the rotational modulation of the visibility of activeregions, we analyse the high-accuracy corot lightcurve of the active young starcorot102899501. spectroscopic follow-up observations are used to derive itsfundamental parameters. we compare its chromospheric activity level with amodel of chrosmospheric activity evolution established by combiningrelationships between the r'hk index and the rossby number with a recent modelof stellar rotation evolution on the main sequence. we measure the spotcoverage of the stellar surface as a function of time, and find evidence for atentative increase from 5-14% at the beginning of the observing run to 13-29%35 days later. a high level of magnetic activity on corot102899501 iscorroborated by a strong emission in the balmer and ca ii hk lines (logr'hk ~-4). the starspots used as tracers of the star rotation constrain the rotationperiod to 1.625+/-0.002 days and do not show evidence for differentialrotation. the effective temperature (teff=5180+/-80 k), surface gravity(logg=4.35+/-0.1), and metallicity ([m/h]=0.05+/-0.07 dex) indicate that theobject is located near the evolutionary track of a 1.09+/-0.12 m_sun pre-mainsequence star at an age of 23+/-10 myrs. this value is consistent with the"gyro-age" of about 8-25 myrs, inferred using a parameterization of the stellarrotation period as a function of colour index and time established for thei-sequence of stars in stellar clusters. we conclude that the high magneticactivity level and fast rotation of corot102899501 are manifestations of itsstellar youth consistent with its estimated evolutionary status and with thedetection of a strong li i 6707.8 a absorption line in its spectrum. we arguethat a magnetic activity level comparable to that observed on corot102899501could have been present on the sun at the time of planet formation.

1301.0111	characterisation of the galactic thin disc with corot targets	we use kinematical and chemical properties of 754 corot stars to characterisethe stellar populations of the milky way disc in three beams close the galacticplane. from the atmospheric parameters derived in gazzano et al. (2010) withthe matisse algorithm, we derived stellar distances using isochrones. combiningthese data with proper motions, we provide the complete kinematical descriptionof stars in three corot fields. finally, we used kinematical criteria toidentify the galactic populations in our sample and study theircharacteristics, particularly their chemistry. comparing our kinematics withthe besancon galactic model, we show that, within 3-sigma, simulated andobserved kinematical distributions are in good agreement. we study thecharacteristics of the thin disc, finding a correlation that is significant ata value of 2-sigma between the v-velocity component and the metallicity for twodifferent radial distance bins (8-9kpc and 9-10kpc; but not for the most innerbin 7-8kpc, probably because of the uncertainties in the abundances) whichcould be interpreted as radial migration evidence. we also measured a radialmetallicity gradient value of -0.097+/-0.015dex/kpc with giant stars, and-0.053+/-0.015dex/kpc with dwarfs. finally, we identified metal-rich stars withpeculiar high [alpha/fe] values in the directions pointing to the inner part ofthe galaxy. applying the same methodology to the planet-hosting stars detectedby corot shows that they mainly belong to the thin disc population with normalchemical and kinematical properties.

1307.1660	high angular resolution imaging and infrared spectroscopy of corot  candidates	studies of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance forunderstanding the nature of planets outside our solar system because theirmasses, diameters, and bulk densities can be measured. an important part oftransit-search programmes is the removal of false-positives. the criticalquestion is how many of the candidates that passed all previous tests are falsepositives. for our study we selected 25 corot candidates that have already beenscreened against false-positives using detailed analysis of the light curvesand seeing-limited imaging, which has transits that are between 0.7 and 0.05%deep. we observed 20 candidates with the adaptive optics imager naco and 18with the high-resolution infrared spectrograph crires. we found previouslyunknown stars within 2 arcsec of the targets in seven of the candidates. all ofthese are too faint and too close to the targets to have been previouslydetected with seeing-limited telescopes in the optical. our study thus leads tothe surprising results that if we remove all candidates excluded by thesophisticated analysis of the light-curve, as well as carrying out deep imagingwith seeing-limited telescopes, still 28-35% of the remaining candidates arefound to possess companions that are bright enough to be false-positives. giventhat the companion-candidates cluster around the targets and that the j-kcolours are consistent with physical companions, we conclude that thecompanion-candidates are more likely to be physical companions rather thanunrelated field stars.

0802.1584	magnetic cycles of the planet-hosting star taubootis	we have obtained new spectropolarimetric observations of the planet-hostingstar taubootis, using the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters at thecanada-france-hawaii telescope and telescope bernard-lyot. with this data set,we are able to confirm the presence of a magnetic field at the surface oftauboo and map its large-scale structure over the whole star. the overallpolarity of the magnetic field has reversed with respect to our previousobservation (obtained a year before), strongly suggesting that tauboo isundergoing magnetic cycles similar to those of the sun. this is the first timethat a global magnetic polarity switch is observed in a star other than thesun; we speculate that the magnetic cycle period of tauboo is much shorter thanthat of the sun.  our new data also allow us to confirm the presence of differential rotationfrom the latitudinal shearing that the magnetic structure is undergoing. thedifferential rotation surface shear that tauboo experiences is found to be 6 to10 times larger than that of the sun. we propose that the short magnetic cycleperiod is due to the strong level of differential rotation. with a rotationperiod of 3.0 and 3.9 d at the equator and pole respectively, tauboo appears asthe first planet-hosting star whose rotation (at intermediate latitudes) issynchronised with the orbital motion of its giant planet (period 3.3 d).assuming that this synchronisation is not coincidental, it suggests that thetidal effects induced by the giant planet can be strong enough to force thethin convective enveloppe (though not the whole star) into corotation and thusto play a role in the activity cycle of tauboo.

1406.1270	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission: xxvi. corot-24: a  transiting multi-planet system	we present the discovery of a candidate multiply-transiting system, the firstone found in the corot mission. two transit-like features with periods of 5.11and 11.76d are detected in the corot light curve, around a main sequence k1vstar of r=15.1. if the features are due to transiting planets around the samestar, these would correspond to objects of 3.7$\pm$0.4 and 5.0$\pm$0.5 r_earthrespectively. several radial velocities serve to provide an upper limit of 5.7m_earth for the 5.11~d signal, and to tentatively measure a mass of28$^{+11}_{-11}$ m_earth for the object transiting with a 11.76~d period. thesemeasurements imply low density objects, with a significant gaseous envelope.the detailed analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data serve toestimate the probability that the observations are caused by transitingneptune-sized planets as $&gt;$26$\times$ higher than a blend scenario involvingonly one transiting planet, and $&gt;$900$\times$ higher than a scenario involvingtwo blends and no planets. the radial velocities show a long term modulationthat might be attributed to a 1.5 m_jup planet orbiting at 1.8~a.u. from thehost, but more data are required to determine the precise orbital parameters ofthis companion.

1406.6172	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates xii. koi-1257 b: a  highly eccentric three-month period transiting exoplanet	in this paper we report a new transiting warm giant planet: koi-1257 b. itwas first detected in photometry as a planet-candidate by the ${\it kepler}$space telescope and then validated thanks to a radial velocity follow-up withthe sophie spectrograph. it orbits its host star with a period of 86.647661 d$\pm$ 3 s and a high eccentricity of 0.772 $\pm$ 0.045. the planet transits themain star of a metal-rich, relatively old binary system with stars of mass of0.99 $\pm$ 0.05 msun and 0.70 $ \pm $ 0.07 msun for the primary and secondary,respectively. this binary system is constrained thanks to a self-consistentmodelling of the ${\it kepler}$ transit light curve, the sophie radialvelocities, line bisector and full-width half maximum (fwhm) variations, andthe spectral energy distribution. however, future observations are needed toconfirm it. the pastis fully-bayesian software was used to validate the natureof the planet and to determine which star of the binary system is the transithost. by accounting for the dilution from the binary both in photometry and inradial velocity, we find that the planet has a mass of 1.45 $ \pm $ 0.35 mjup,and a radius of 0.94 $ \pm $ 0.12 rjup, and thus a bulk density of 2.1 $ \pm $1.2 g.cm$^{-3}$. the planet has an equilibrium temperature of 511 $\pm$ 50 k,making it one of the few known members of the warm-jupiter population. theharps-n spectrograph was also used to observe a transit of koi-1257 b,simultaneously with a joint amateur and professional photometric follow-up,with the aim of constraining the orbital obliquity of the planet. however, therossiter-mclaughlin effect was not clearly detected, resulting in poorconstraints on the orbital obliquity of the planet.

1407.1044	planets and stellar activity: hide and seek in the corot-7 system	since the discovery of the transiting super-earth corot-7b, severalinvestigations have yielded different results for the number and masses ofplanets present in the system, mainly owing to the star's high level ofactivity. we re-observed corot-7 in january 2012 with both harps and corot, sothat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometricdata. this allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's lightcurve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression ofconvective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. to account foractivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have aphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in theradial-velocity model, which we treat as a gaussian process with the samecovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the lightcurve. our model was incorporated into a monte carlo markov chain in order tomake a precise determination of the orbits of corot-7b and corot-7c. we measurethe masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08mearth, respectively. the density of corot-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(rp/1.58rearth)^(-3) g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. we searchfor evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with aperiod close to 9 days. we are not able to confirm the existence of a planetwith this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellarrotation at around 7.9 days. using bayesian model selection we find that amodel with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.

1407.8099	revisiting the transits of corot-7b at a lower activity level	corot-7b, the first super-earth with measured radius discovered, has openedthe new field of rocky exoplanets characterisation. to better understand thisinteresting system, new observations were taken with the corot satellite.during this run 90 new transits were obtained in the imagette mode. these wereanalysed together with the previous 151 transits obtained in the discovery runand harps radial velocity observations to derive accurate system parameters. adifference is found in the posterior probability distribution of the transitparameters between the previous corot run (lra01) and the new run (lra06). wepropose this is due to an extra noise component in the previous corot runsuspected to be transit spot occultation events. these lead to the mean transitshape becoming v-shaped. we show that the extra noise component is dominant atlow stellar flux levels and reject these transits in the final analysis. weobtained a planetary radius, $r_p= 1.585\pm0.064\,r_{\oplus}$, in agreementwith previous estimates. combining the planetary radius with the new massestimates results in a planetary density of $ 1.19 \pm 0.27\, \rho_{\oplus}$which is consistent with a rocky composition. the corot-7 system remains anexcellent test bed for the effects of activity in the derivation of planetaryparameters in the shallow transit regime.

1410.5248	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates. xiii. koi-189 b and  koi-686 b: two very low-mass stars in long-period orbits	we present the radial-velocity follow-up of two kepler planetary transitingcandidates (koi-189 and koi-686) carried out with the sophie spectrograph atthe observatoire de haute provence. these data promptly discard these objectsas viable planet candidates and show that the transiting objects are in theregime of very low-mass stars, where a strong discrepancy between observationsand models persists for the mass and radius parameters. by combining the sophiespectra with the kepler light curve and photometric measurements found in theliterature, we obtain a full characterization of the transiting companions,their orbits, and their host stars. the two companions are in significantlyeccentric orbits with relatively long periods (30 days and 52.5 days), whichmakes them suitable objects for a comparison with theoretical models, since theeffects invoked to understand the discrepancy with observations are weaker forthese orbital distances. koi-189 b has a mass m = 0.0745 +/- 0.0033 msun and aradius r = 0.1025 +/- 0.0024 rsun. the density of koi-189 b is significantlylower than expected from theoretical models for a system of its age. we explorepossible explanations for this difference. koi-189 b is the smallesthydrogen-burning star with such a precise determination of its fundamentalparameters. koi-686 b is larger and more massive (m = 0.0915 +/- 0.0043 msun; r= 0.1201 +/- 0.0033 rsun), and its position in the mass-radius diagram agreeswell with theoretical expectations.

1411.3934	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates xiv. a joint  photometric, spectroscopic, and dynamical analysis of the kepler-117 system	as part of our follow-up campaign of kepler planets, we observed kepler-117with the sophie spectrograph at the observatoire de haute-provence. thisf8-type star hosts two transiting planets in non-resonant orbits. the planets,kepler-117 b and c, have orbital periods $\simeq 18.8$ and $\simeq 50.8$ days,and show transit-timing variations (ttvs) of several minutes. we performed acombined markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) fit on transits, radial velocities,and stellar parameters to constrain the characteristics of the system. weincluded the fit of the ttvs in the mcmc by modeling them with dynamicalsimulations. in this way, consistent posterior distributions were drawn for thesystem parameters. according to our analysis, planets b and c have notablydifferent masses ($0.094 \pm 0.033$ and $1.84 \pm 0.18$ m$_{\rm j}$) and loworbital eccentricities ($0.0493 \pm 0.0062$ and $0.0323 \pm 0.0033$). theuncertainties on the derived parameters are strongly reduced if the fit of thettvs is included in the combined mcmc. the ttvs allow measuring the mass ofplanet b, although its radial velocity amplitude is poorly constrained.finally, we checked that the best solution is dynamically stable.

0804.4761	molecular hydrogen in the circumstellar environments of herbig ae/be  stars probed by fuse	we observed molecular hydrogen around a sample of pre-main sequence stars inorder to better characterize their gaseous cs environments. we analyzed thefuse (far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer) spectra of a sample of herbigae/be stars (haebes) covering a broad spectral range, including themain-sequence a5 star beta-pictoris. to better diagnose the origin of thedetected h2 and its excitation conditions, we used a model of aphotodissociation region. our analysis demonstrates that the excitation of h2is clearly different around most of the haebes compared to the interstellarmedium. moreover, the characteristics of h2 around herbig ae and be stars giveevidence for different excitation mechanisms. for the most massive stars of oursample (b8 to b2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a modelof photodissociation regions (pdr). our results favor an interpretation interms of large cs envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which thestars were formed. on the other hand, the group of ae stars (later than b9type) known to possess disks is more inhomogeneous. in most cases, when cs h2is detected, the lines of sight do not pass through the disks. the excitationconditions of h2 around ae stars cannot be reproduced by pdr models andcorrespond to warm and/or hot excited media very close to the stars. inaddition, no clear correlation has been found between the ages of the stars andthe amount of circumstellar h2. our results suggest structural differencesbetween herbig ae and be star environments. herbig be stars do evolve fasterthan ae stars, and consequently, most herbig be stars are younger than ae onesat the time we observe them. it is thus more likely to find remnants of theirparent cloud around them.

1505.02663	pastis: bayesian extrasolar planet validation ii. constraining exoplanet  blend scenarios using spectroscopic diagnoses	the statistical validation of transiting exoplanets proved to be an efficienttechnique to secure the nature of small exoplanet signals which cannot beestablished by purely spectroscopic means. however, the spectroscopic diagnosesare providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellarcontaminants. in this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects themeasurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as function of theparameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implementedinto the pastis planet-validation software. we find particular cases for whicha blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation.it might also produce a bisector variation anti-correlated with the radialvelocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. in those cases, the full widthhalf maximum variation provides complementary constraints. these results can beused to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radialvelocity planets. we review all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in theliterature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. weestimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. based onthat, we recommend the use of bigauss which is the most sensitive diagnosis tomonitor line-profile asymmetry. in this paper, we also investigate thesensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop aformalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. finally, weapply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of hd16702, anunresolved face-on binary which exhibits bisector variations.

1508.06596	absolute masses and radii determination in multiplanetary systems  without stellar models	the masses and radii of extrasolar planets are key observables forunderstanding their interior, formation and evolution. while transit photometryand doppler spectroscopy are used to measure the radii and masses respectivelyof planets relative to those of their host star, estimates for the true valuesof these quantities rely on theoretical models of the host star which are knownto suffer from systematic differences with observations. when a system iscomposed of more than two bodies, extra information is contained in the transitphotometry and radial velocity data. velocity information (finitespeed-of-light, doppler) is needed to break the newtonian $mr^{-3}$ degeneracy.we performed a photodynamical modelling of the two-planet transiting systemkepler-117 using all photometric and spectroscopic data available. wedemonstrate how absolute masses and radii of single-star planetary systems canbe obtained without resorting to stellar models. limited by the precision ofavailable radial velocities (38 $ms^{-1}$), we achieve accuracies of 20 percent in the radii and 70 per cent in the masses, while simulated 1 $ms^{-1}$precision radial velocities lower these to 1 per cent for the radii and 2 percent for the masses. since transiting multi-planet systems are common, thistechnique can be used to measure precisely the mass and radius of a largesample of stars and planets. we anticipate these measurements will becomecommon when the tess and plato mission provide high-precision light curves of alarge sample of bright stars. these determinations will improve our knowledgeabout stars and planets, and provide strong constraints on theoretical models.

1511.00643	sophie velocimetry of kepler transit candidates xvii. the physical  properties of giant exoplanets within 400 days of period	while giant extrasolar planets have been studied for more than two decadesnow, there are still some open questions such as their dominant formation andmigration process, as well as their atmospheric evolution in different stellarenvironments. in this paper, we study a sample of giant transiting exoplanetsdetected by the kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days. we firstdefined a sample of 129 giant-planet candidates that we followed up with thesophie spectrograph (ohp, france) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign. thisallow us to unveil the nature of these candidates and to measure afalse-positive rate of 54.6 +/- 6.5 % for giant-planet candidates orbitingwithin 400 days of period. based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, wethen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges oforbital periods. the overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 daysis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. we recover, for the first time in the kepler data, thedifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.comparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate ofgiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer periodplanets. we also derive a first measurement on the occurrence rate of browndwarfs in the brown-dwarf desert with a value of 0.29 +/- 0.17 %. finally, wediscuss the physical properties of the giant planets in our sample. we confirmthat giant planets receiving a moderate irradiation are not inflated but wefind that they are in average smaller than predicted by formation and evolutionmodels. in this regime of low-irradiated giant planets, we find a possiblecorrelation between their bulk density and the iron abundance of the host star,which needs more detections to be confirmed.

0807.3767	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission iv: corot-exo-4b: a  transiting planet in a 9.2 day synchronous orbit	corot, the first space-based transit search, provides ultra-high precisionlight curves with continuous time-sampling over periods, of up to 5 months.this allows the detection of transiting planets with relatively long periods,and the simultaneous study of the host star's photometric variability. in thisletter, we report on the discovery of the transiting giant planet corot-exo-4band use the corot light curve to perform a detailed analysis of the transit andto determine the stellar rotation period. the corot light curve waspre-processed to remove outliers and correct for orbital residuals andartefacts due to hot pixels on the detector. after removing stellar variabilityaround each transit, the transit light curve was analysed to determine thetransit parameters. a discrete auto-correlation function method was used toderive the rotation period of the star from the out-of-transit light curve. wederive periods for the planet's orbit and star's rotation of 9.20205 +/-0.00037 and 8.87 +/- 1.12 days respectively, consistent with a synchronisedsystem. we also derive the inclination, i = 90.00 -0.085 +0.000 in degrees, theratio of the orbital distance to the stellar radius, a/r_s = 17.36 -0.25 +0.05,and the planet to star radius ratio r_p/r_s = 0.1047 -0.0022 +0.0041. wediscuss briefly the coincidence between the orbital period of the planet andthe stellar rotation period and its possible implications for the system'smigration and star-planet interaction history.

astro-ph;0103084	fuse and hst stis observations of hot and cold gas in the ab aurigae  system	we present the first observations of a herbig ae star with a circumstellardisk by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse), as well as asimultaneous observation of the star obtained with the hubble space telescopespace telescope imaging spectrograph (stis). the spectra of ab aurigae showemission and absorption features arising from gasses that have a wide range intemperature, from hot ovi emission to cold molecular hydrogen and coabsorption. emissions from the highly ionized species ovi and ciii present inthe fuse spectrum are redshifted, while absorption features arising fromlow-ionization species like oi, ni, and siii are blueshifted and showcharacteristic stellar wind line-profiles. we find the total column density ofmolecular hydrogen toward ab aur from the fuse apectrum, n(h_2) = (6.8 +/- 0.5)x 10^19 cm^-2. the gas kinetic temperature of the molecular hydrogen derivedfrom the ratio n(j=1)/n(j=0) is 65 +/- 4 k. the column density of the coobserved in the stis spectrum is n(co) = (7.1 +/- 0.5) x 10^13 cm^-2, giving aco/h_2 ratio of (1.04 +/- 0.11) x 10^-6. we also use the stis spectrum to findthe column density of hi, permitting us to calculate the total column densityof hydrogen atoms, the fractional abundance of h_2, and the gas-to-dust ratio.

astro-ph;0111154	fuse observations of possible infalling planetesimals in the 51 ophiuchi  circumstellar disk	we present the first observations of the circumstellar (cs) disk system 51ophiuchi with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer. we detect severalabsorption lines arising from the unusual metastable atomic species ni (2d), ni(2p), and sii (2d). these levels lie 1.8 - 3.6 ev above the ground level andhave radiative decay lifetimes of 2 days or less, indicating that the linesarise from warm cs gas. the high s/n fuse spectra, obtained six days apart,also show time-variable absorption features arising from ni, nii, oi (1d), andfeiii, which are redshifted with respect to the stellar velocity. the resolvedredshifted absorption extends over many tens of km/s (40 for ni, 100 for nii,65 for oi, and 84 for feiii). we calculate column densities for all thevariable infalling cs gasses, using the apparent optical depth method. thefeiii and nii infalling gasses must be produced through collisional ionization,and the ionization fraction of nitrogen suggests a gas temperature between20000 and 34000 k. the infalling gas shows a peculiar, non-solar composition,with nitrogen and iron more abundant than carbon. we also set upper limits onthe line-of-sight column densities of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide.these observations strengthen the connection between 51 oph and the olderdebris-disk system beta pictoris, and indicate that there may be infallingplanetesimals in the 51 oph system.

astro-ph;0506276	fuse observations of molecular hydrogen on the line of sight towards  hd141569a	we present an analysis of the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse)spectrum of hd141569a, a transitional object known to possess a circumstellardisk. we observe two components of gas at widely different temperatures alongthe line of sight. we detect cold h2, which is thermalized up to j=2 at akinetic temperature of 51k. such low temperatures are typical of the diffuseinterstellar medium. since the line of sight to hd141569a does not pass throughits disk, it appears that we are observing the cold h2 in a low extinctionenvelope associated with the high galactic latitude dark cloud complex l134n,which is in the same direction and at nearly the same distance as hd141569a.the column densities of the higher j-levels of h2 suggest the presence of warmgas along the line of sight. the excitation conditions do not seem to beconsistent with what is generally observed in diffuse interstellar clouds. theobserved radial velocity of the gas implies that the uv spectral lines weobserve are likely interstellar in origin rather than circumstellar, althoughour absorption line study does not definitely rule out the possibility that thewarm gas is close to the star. the discovery of such warm gas along the line ofsight may provide evidence for turbulent phenomena in the dark cloud l134n.

astro-ph;0701608	could we identify hot ocean-planets with corot, kepler and doppler  velocimetry?	planets less massive than about 10 mearth are expected to have no massiveh-he atmosphere and a cometary composition (50% rocks, 50% water, by mass)provided they formed beyond the snowline of protoplanetary disks. due to inwardmigration, such planets could be found at any distance between their formationsite and the star. if migration stops within the habitable zone, this willproduce a new kind of planets, called ocean-planets. ocean-planets typicallyconsist in a silicate core, surrounded by a thick ice mantle, itself covered bya 100 km deep ocean. the existence of ocean-planets raises importantastrobiological questions: can life originate on such body, in the absence ofcontinent and ocean-silicate interfaces? what would be the nature of theatmosphere and the geochemical cycles ?  in this work, we address the fate of hot ocean-planets produced whenmigration ends at a closer distance. in this case the liquid/gas interface candisappear, and the hot h2o envelope is made of a supercritical fluid. althoughwe do not expect these bodies to harbor life, their detection andidentification as water-rich planets would give us insight as to the abundanceof hot and, by extrapolation, cool ocean-planets.

astro-ph;0703725	doppler search for exoplanet candidates and binaries in a corot field  using a multi-fiber spectrograph	the discovery of the short-period giant exoplanet population, the so-calledhot jupiter population, and their link to brown dwarfs and low-mass starschallenges the conventional view of planet formation and evolution. we tookadvantage of the multi-fiber facilities giraffe and flames-uves (vlt) toperform the first large radial velocity survey using a multi-fiberspectrograph, aiming at detecting planetary and brown dwarfs candidates andbinaries. we observed during 5 consecutive half-nights 816 stars selectedwithin one of the exoplanet field of the space mission corot. we computed theradial velocities of these stars and shown that a systematic error of 30 ms$^{-1}$ has been reached over 5 consecutive nights. over the whole sample thedoppler measurements allowed us to identify a sample of 50 binaries, 9 activeor blended binary stars, 5 unsolved cases and 14 exoplanets and brown dwarfcandidates. further higher precision doppler measurements are now necessary toconfirm and better characterize these candidates. this study demonstrates theefficiency of such a multi-fiber approach for large radial velocity surveys insearch for exoplanets as well as the follow-up of transiting exoplanetcandidates of existing and future programs like the corot space mission.

0810.0919	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission vi. corot-exo-3b: the  first secure inhabitant of the brown-dwarf desert	context. the corot space mission routinely provides high-precisionphotometric measurements of thousands of stars that have been continuouslyobserved for months.  aims. the discovery and characterization of the first very massive transitingplanetary companion with a short orbital period is reported.  methods. a series of 34 transits was detected in the corot light curve of anf3v star, observed from may to october 2007 for 152 days. the radius wasaccurately determined and the mass derived for this new transiting, thanks tothe combined analysis of the light curve and complementary ground-basedobservations: high-precision radial-velocity measurements, on-off photometry,and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations.  results. corot-exo-3b has a radius of 1.01+-0.07 rjup and transits around itsf3-type primary every 4.26 days in a synchronous orbit. its mass of 21.66+-1.0mjup, density of 26.4+-5.6 g cm^-3, and surface gravity of log g = 4.72 clearlydistinguish it from the regular close-in planet population, making it the mostintriguing transiting substellar object discovered so far.  conclusions. with the current data, the nature of corot-exo-3b is ambiguous,as it could either be a low-mass brown-dwarf or a member of a new class of"superplanets". its discovery may help constrain the evolution of close-inplanets and brown-dwarfs better. finally, corot-exo-3b confirms the trend thatmassive transiting giant planets (m &gt;= 4 mjup) are found preferentially aroundmore massive stars than the sun.

0811.4674	oscillating red giants in the corot exo-field: asteroseismic mass and  radius determination	context. observations and analysis of solar-type oscillations in red-giantstars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of openquestions yet to be explored. although stochastic oscillations have previouslybeen detected in red giants from both radial velocity and photometricmeasurements, those data were either too short or had sampling that was notcomplete enough to perform a detailed data analysis of the variability. thequality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the corot satellite isnecessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in redgiants. we have analyzed continuous photometric time-series of about 11 400relatively faint stars obtained in the exofield of corot during the first 150days long-run campaign from may to october 2007. we find several hundred starsshowing a clear power excess in a frequency and amplitude range expected forred-giant pulsators. in this paper we present first results on a sub-sample ofthese stars. aims. knowing reliable fundamental parameters like mass and radiusis essential for detailed asteroseismic studies of red-giant stars. as thecorot exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or onlyweak) constraints on the star's location in the h-r diagram. we therefore aimto extract information about such fundamental parameters solely from theavailable time series. methods. we model the convective background noise andthe power excess hump due to pulsation with a global model fit and deducereliable estimates for the stellar mass and radius from scaling relations forthe frequency of maximum oscillation power and the characteristic frequencyseparation.
