0704.1113	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: wind properties and evolution of  hot massive stars in the lmc	[abridged] we have studied the optical spectra of 28 o- and early b-typestars in the large magellanic cloud, 22 of which are associated with the youngstar-forming region n11. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code fastwind with thegenetic-algorithm optimisation routine pikaia. results for stars in the lh9 andlh10 associations of n11 are consistent with a sequential star formationscenario, in which activity in lh9 triggered the formation of lh10. our samplecontains four stars of spectral type o2, of which the hottest is found to be~49-54 kk (cf. ~45-46 kk for o3 stars). the masses of helium-enriched dwarfsand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotatingevolutionary tracks. we interpret this as evidence for efficientrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and toan increase of the stellar luminosity. this result is consistent with findingsfor smc stars by mokiem et al. for bright giants and supergiants no suchmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly(or non-)rotating objects. stellar mass-loss properties were found to beintermediate to those found in massive stars in the galaxy and the smc, andcomparisons with theoretical predictions at lmc metallicity yielded goodagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 &lt; log l/l(sun) &lt;6.1.

0903.1754	a third red supergiant rich cluster in the scutum-crux arm	we aim to characterise the properties of a third massive, red supergiantdominated galactic cluster. to accomplish this we utilised a combination ofnear/mid-ir photometry and spectroscopy to identify and classify the propertiesof cluster members, and statistical arguments to determine the mass of thecluster. we found a total of 16 strong candidates for cluster membership, forwhich formal classification of a subset yields spectral types from k3-m4 ia andluminosities between log(l/l_sun)~4.5-4.8 for an adopted distance of 6+/-1 kpc.for an age in the range of 16-20 myr, the implied mass is 2-4x10^4 m_sun,making it one of the most massive young clusters in the galaxy. this discoverysupports the hypothesis that a significant burst of star formation occurred atthe base of scutum-crux arm between 10-20 myr ago, yielding a stellar complexcomprising at least ~10^5m_sun of stars (noting that since the clusteridentification criteria rely on the presence of rsgs, we suspect that the truestellar yield will be significantly higher). we highlight the apparent absenceof x-ray binaries within the star formation complex and finally, given thephysical association of at least two pulsars with this region, discuss theimplications of this finding for stellar evolution and the production andproperties of neutron stars.

0903.2288	on the massive star content of the nearby dwarf irregular wolf-rayet  galaxy ic 4662	aims: we investigate the massive stellar content of the nearby dwarfirregular wolf-rayet galaxy ic 4662, and consider its global star formingproperties in the context of other metal-poor galaxies, the smc, ic 10 and ngc1569. methods: very large telescope/fors2 imaging and spectroscopy plusarchival hubble space telescope/acs imaging datasets permit us to spatiallyidentify the location, number and probable subtypes of wolf-rayet stars withinthis galaxy. we also investigate suggestions that a significant fraction of theionizing photons of the two giant hii regions a1 and a2 lie deeply embeddedwithin these regions. results: wolf-rayet stars are associated with a number ofsources within ic 4662-a1 and a2, plus a third compact hii region to the northwest of a1 (a1-nw).several sources appear to be isolated, single (or binary)luminous nitrogen sequence wr stars, while extended sources are clusters whosemasses exceed the orion nebula cluster by, at most, a factor of two. ic 4662lacks optically visible young massive, compact clusters that are common inother nearby dwarf irregular galaxies. a comparison between radio andhalpha-derived ionizing fluxes of a1 and a2 suggests that 30-50% of their totallyman continuum fluxes lie deeply embedded within these regions. conclusions:the star formation surface density of ic 4662 is insufficient for this galaxyto qualify as a starburst galaxy, based upon its photometric radius, r_25. ifinstead, we were to adopt the v-band scale length r_d from hunter &amp; elmegreen,ic 4662 would comfortably qualify as a starburst galaxy, since its starformation intensity would exceed 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2.

0909.3815	a vlt/flames survey for massive binaries in westerlund 1: i. first  observations of luminous evolved stars	multiwavelength observations of the young massive cluster westerlund 1 haverevealed evidence for a large number of ob supergiant and wolf-rayet binaries.however, in most cases these findings are based on secondary binarycharacteristics such as hard x-ray emission and/or non-thermal radio spectraand hence provide little information on binary properties such as mass ratioand orbital period. to overcome this shortcoming we have initiated a longtemporal baseline, vlt/flames+giraffe multi-epoch radial velocity survey thatwill provide the first direct constraints on these parameters. this studypresents first results from twenty of the most luminous supergiant stars inwd1. statistically significant radial velocity changes are detected in ~60% oftargets. w43a is identified as a short-period binary, while w234 and thenewly-identified cluster member w3003 are probable binaries and w2a is a strongbinary candidate. the cool hypergiants w243 and w265 display photosphericpulsations, while a number of early-mid b supergiants display radial velocitychanges that we cannot distinguish between orbital or photospheric motion inour initial short-baseline survey. when combined with existing observations, wefind 30% of our sample to be binary (6/20) while additional candidate binariessupport a binary fraction amongst wd1 supergiants in excess of ~40% [abridged]

0909.3818	the binary nature of the galactic centre x-ray source cxogc  j174536.1-285638	x-ray and near-ir surveys of the central 2x0.8 degrees of the galactic centrehave revealed a population of x-ray bright massive stars. however, the natureof the emission, originating in a wind collision zone or via accretion onto acompact object, is uncertain. in order to address this we investigated thenature of the luminous x-ray source cxogc j174536.1-285638. an analysis of thenear-ir spectrum with a non-lte model atmosphere code demonstrated that it wasan highly luminous wn9h star, for which comparison to evolutionary trackssuggests an age of 2-2.5myr and an initial mass of ~110msun. the x-rayproperties of cxogc j174536.1-285638 resemble those of 3 of the wn9h starswithin the arches cluster and in turn other very massive wnlh colliding windbinaries. simple analytical arguments demonstrate consistency between the x-rayemission and a putative wn9h+mid o v-iii binary. however, we may not exclude ahigh mass x-ray binary interpretation, which, if correct, would provide aunique insight into the (post-sn) evolution of extremely massive stars.irrespective of the nature of the secondary, cxogc j174536.1-285638 adds to thegrowing list of known and candidate wnlh binaries. of the subset of wnlh starssubject to a radial velocity survey, we find a lower limit to the binaryfraction of ~45%; of interest for studies of massive stellar formation, giventhat they currently possess the highest dynamically determined masses of anytype of star.

0909.4160	bolometric luminosity variations in the luminous blue variable afgl2298	we characterise the variability in the physical properties of the luminousblue variable afgl2298 between 1989-2008. in conjunction with published datafrom 1989-2001, we have undertaken a long term (2001-2008) near-irspectroscopic and photometric observational campaign for this star and utilisea non-lte model atmosphere code to interpret these data. we find afgl2298 tohave been highly variable during the two decades covered by the observationaldatasets. photometric variations of &gt;1.6 mag have been observed in the jhkwavebands; however, these are not accompanied by correlated changes in near-ircolour. non-lte model atmosphere analysis of 4 epochs of k band spectroscopyobtained between 2001-7 suggests that the photometric changes were driven byexpansion and contraction of the stellar photosphere accompanied bycomparatively small changes in the stellar temperature. unclumped mass lossrates throughout this period were modest and directly comparable to those ofother highly luminous lbvs. however, the bolometric luminosity of afgl2298appears to have varied by at least a factor of ~2 between 1989-2008, with itbeing one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy during maximum. comparisonto other lbvs that have undergone non bolometric luminosity conserving`eruptions' shows such events to be heterogeneous, with afgl2298 the leastextreme example. these results - and the diverse nature of both the quiescentlbvs and associated ejecta - may offer support to the suggestion that more thanone physical mechanism is responsible for such behaviour.

0708.2042	the empirical metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate of o- and  early b-type stars	[abridged] we present a comprehensive study of the metallicity dependence ofthe mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. assuminga power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, mdot \propto z^{m}, andadopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity,v_inf \propto z^{0.13} (leitherer et al.), we find m = 0.83 +/- 0.16 fornon-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation(wlr) for stars more luminous than 10^{5.2} lsun. within the errors, thisresult agrees with the prediction of m = 0.69 +/- 0.10 from vink et al. for thehigh luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than thepredictions, implying wind clumping factors in their line-forming regions of~4. for lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengthscannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis ofuv lines. in the low-luminosity domain the galactic wlr is found to be muchsteeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between uvmass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of l ~10^{4.75} lsun, the origin of which is unknown. we emphasize that even if thecurrent mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result ofwind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent ofmetallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remaincorrect.

1102.3363	the evolution and masses of the neutron star and donor star in the high  mass x-ray binary oao 1657-415	we report near-infrared radial velocity measurements of the recentlyidentified donor star in the high mass x-ray binary system oao 1657-415obtained in the h band using isaac on the vlt. cross-correlation methods wereemployed to construct a radial velocity curve with a semi-amplitude of $22.1\pm 3.5$ km s$^{-1}$. combined with other measured parameters of this systemthis provides a dynamically determined neutron star mass of $1.42 \pm 0.26m$_{\odot}$ and a mass of $14.3 \pm 0.8 m$_{\odot}$ for the ofpe/wn9 highlyevolved donor star. oao 1657-415 is an eclipsing high mass x-ray binary pulsarwith the largest eccentricity and orbital period of any within its class. ofthe ten known eclipsing x-ray binary pulsars oao 1657-415 becomes the ninthwith a dynamically determined neutron star mass solution and only the second inan eccentric system. furthermore, the donor star in oao 1657-415 is much morehighly evolved than the majority of the supergiant donors in other high massx-ray binaries (hmxbs), joining a small but growing list of hmxbs donors withextensive hydrogen depleted atmospheres. considering the evolutionarydevelopment of oao 1657-415, we have estimated the binding energy of theenvelope of the mass donor and find that there is insufficient energy for theremoval of the donor's envelope via spiral-in, ruling out a common envelopeevolutionary scenario. with its non-zero eccentricity and relatively largeorbital period the identification of a definitive evolutionary pathway foroao1657-415 remains problematic, we conclude by proposing two scenarios whichmay account for oao1657-415 current orbital configuration.

1105.0776	a vlt/flames survey for massive binaries in westerlund 1. iii. the wc9d  binary w239 and implications for massive stellar evolution	there is growing evidence that a treatment of binarity amongst ob stars isessential for a full theory of stellar evolution. however the binary propertiesof massive stars - frequency, mass ratio and orbital separation - are stillpoorly constrained. in order to address this shortcoming we have undertaken amultiepoch spectroscopic study of the stellar population of the young massivecluster westerlund 1. in this paper we present an investigation into the natureof the dusty wolf-rayet star and candidate binary w239. we determined anorbital period of only 5.05 days - making it one of the most compact wcbinaries yet identified - while we interpret a significant near-ir flarebetween 2004-6 as evidence for a third massive stellar component in the systemin a wide eccentric orbit. the presence of a near-ir excess characteristic ofhot dust at every epoch is consistent with the expectation that the subset ofpersistent dust forming wc stars are short period binaries. in conjunction withprevious results, the simultaneous presence of both short period wolf-rayetbinaries and cool hypergiants within wd 1 provides compelling evidence for abifurcation in the post-main sequence evolution of massive stars due tobinarity. short period o+ob binaries will evolve directly to the wolf-rayetphase, either due to an episode of binary mediated mass loss or via chemicallyhomogenous evolution. conversely, long period binaries and single stars willinstead undergo a red loop across the hr diagram via a cool hypergiant phase.future analysis of the full spectroscopic dataset for wd 1 will constrain theproportion of massive stars experiencing each pathway; hence quantifying theimportance of binarity in massive stellar evolution up to and beyond supernovaand the resultant production of relativistic remnants and x-ray binaries.[abridged]

1203.3303	ic 4663: the first unambiguous [wn] wolf-rayet central star of a  planetary nebula	we report on the serendipitous discovery of the first central star of aplanetary nebula (pn) that mimics the helium- and nitrogen-rich wn sequence ofmassive wolf-rayet (wr) stars. the central star of ic 4663 (pn g346.2-08.2) isdominated by broad he ii and n v emission lines which correspond to a [wn3]spectral type. unlike previous [wn] candidates, the surrounding nebula isunambiguously a pn. at an assumed distance of 3.5 kpc, corresponding to astellar luminosity of 4000 lsun, the v=16.9 mag central star remains 4-6 magfainter than the average luminosity of massive wn3 stars even out to animprobable d=8 kpc. the nebula is typical of pne with an elliptical morphology,a newly discovered asymptotic giant branch (agb) halo, a relatively lowexpansion velocity (v_exp=30 km/s) and a highly ionised spectrum with anapproximately solar chemical abundance pattern. the [wn3] star is hot enough toshow ne vii emission (t_*=140+/-20 kk) and exhibits a fast wind (v_infty=1900km/s), which at d=3.5 kpc would yield a clumped mass loss rate of mdot = 1.8 x10^-8 msun/yr with a small stellar radius (r_*=0.11 rsun). its atmosphereconsists of helium (95%), hydrogen (&lt;2%), nitrogen (0.8%), neon (0.2%) andoxygen (0.05%) by mass. such an unusual helium-dominated composition cannot beproduced by any extant scenario used to explain the h-deficiency of post-agbstars. the o(he) central stars share a similar composition and the discovery ofic 4663 provides the first evidence for a second he-rich/h-deficient post-agbevolutionary sequence [wn]-&gt;o(he). this suggests there is an alternativemechanism responsible for producing the majority of h-deficient post-agb starsthat may possibly be expanded to include other he-rich/h-deficient stars suchas r coronae borealis stars and am canum venaticorum stars. the origin of theunusual composition of [wn] and o(he) central stars remains unexplained.

1208.0825	the vlt-flames tarantula survey. vii. a low velocity dispersion for the  young massive cluster r136	detailed studies of resolved young massive star clusters are necessary todetermine their dynamical state and evaluate the importance of gas expulsionand early cluster evolution. in an effort to gain insight into the dynamicalstate of the young massive cluster r136 and obtain the first measurement of itsvelocity dispersion, we analyse multi-epoch spectroscopic data of the innerregions of 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) obtained as part ofthe vlt-flames tarantula survey. following a quantitative assessment of thevariability, we use the radial velocities of non-variable sources to place anupper limit of 6 km/s on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of stars withina projected distance of 5 pc from the centre of the cluster. after accountingfor the contributions of undetected binaries and measurement errors throughmonte carlo simulations, we conclude that the true velocity dispersion islikely between 4 and 5 km/s given a range of standard assumptions about thebinary distribution. this result is consistent with what is expected if thecluster is in virial equilibrium, suggesting that gas expulsion has not alteredits dynamics. we find that the velocity dispersion would be ~25 km/s ifbinaries were not identified and rejected, confirming the importance of themulti-epoch strategy and the risk of interpreting velocity dispersionmeasurements of unresolved extragalactic young massive clusters.

1209.4638	the vlt-flames tarantula survey viii. multiplicity properties of the  o-type star population	aims. we analyze the multiplicity properties of the massive o-type starpopulation. with 360 o-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample ofmassive stars analyzed to date.  methods. we use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identifyspectroscopic binaries. we also use a monte-carlo method to correct forobservational biases.  results. we observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35\pm0.03, whichcorresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significantradial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20km/s. we compute theintrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51\pm0.04. we adopt power-laws to describethe intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f_p ~ (log p)^\pi\ (with0.15 &lt; log p &lt; 3.5) and f_q ~ q^\kappa\ with 0.1 &lt; q=m_2/m_1 &lt; 1.0. thepower-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are \pi = -0.45+/- 0.30 and \kappa = -1.0\pm0.4. the obtained period distribution thus favoursshorter period systems compared to an oepik law. the mass ratio distribution isslightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with arandom sampling of a classical mass function. the binary fraction seems mostlyuniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types andluminosity classes. the binary fraction in the outer region of the field ofview (r &gt; 7.8', i.e. approx117 pc) and among the o9.7 i/ii objects are howeversignificantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations.  conclusions. using simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over50% of the current o star population in 30 dor will exchange mass with itscompanion within a binary system. this shows that binary interaction is greatlyaffecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken intoaccount to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars.

1308.3412	the vlt-flames tarantula survey - xi. a census of the hot luminous stars  and their feedback in 30 doradus	we compile the first comprehensive census of hot luminous stars in the 30doradus (30 dor) star forming region of the lmc. the census extends to a radiusof 10arcmin (150pc) from the central cluster, r136. stars were selectedphotometrically and combined with the latest spectral types. 1145 candidate hotluminous stars were identified of which &gt;700 were considered genuine early typestars that contribute to feedback. we assess the spectroscopic completeness tobe 85% in outer regions (&gt;5pc) but fall to 35% in the vicinity of r136, givinga total of 500 hot luminous stars with spectroscopy. stellar calibrations andmodels were used to obtain their physical parameters before integrated valueswere compared to global observations and the population synthesis code,starburst99. the 31 w-r and of/wn stars made large contributions to the totalionising and wind luminosities of ~40% and ~50%, respectively. stars withminit&gt;100msun also showed high contributions to the global feedback, ~25% inboth cases. such massive stars are not accounted for by the current starburst99code, which underestimated the ionising and wind luminosities of r136 byfactors of ~2 and ~9, respectively. the census inferred a sfr of0.073+/-0.04msun/yr for 30 dor, typically higher than results from popular sfrcalibrations. however, it remained consistent with a far-uv luminosity tracerand a combined halpha and mid-infrared tracer, but only after correcting forhalpha extinction. the global ionising output exceeded measurements from theassociated gas and dust, suggesting ~6(+55/-6)% of ionising photons escape theregion. when studying very luminous star forming regions, it is thereforeessential to include the most massive stars to ensure a reliable energy budget.if 30 dor is typical of other large star forming regions, estimates of the sfrwill be underpredicted if this escape fraction is not accounted for.(abridged)

0802.0815	a downward revision to the distance of the 1806-20 cluster and  associated magnetar from gemini near-infrared spectroscopy	we present h- and k-band spectroscopy of ob and wolf-rayet (wr) members ofthe milky way cluster 1806-20 (g10.0-0.3), to obtain a revised cluster distanceof relevance to the 2004 giant flare from the sgr 1806-20 magnetar. from gnirsspectroscopy obtained with gemini south, four candidate ob stars are confirmedas late o/early b supergiants, while we support previous mid wn and late wcclassifications for two wr stars. based upon an absolute ks-band magnitudecalibration for b supergiants and wr stars, and near-ir photometry from niri atgemini north plus archival vlt/isaac datasets, we obtain a cluster distancemodulus of 14.7+/-0.35 mag. the known stellar content of the 1806-20 clustersuggests an age of 3-5 myr, from which theoretical isochrone fits infer adistance modulus of 14.7+/-0.7 mag. together, our results favour a distancemodulus of 14.7+/-0.4 mag (8.7^+1.8_-1.5 kpc) to the 1806-20 cluster, which issignificantly lower than the nominal 15 kpc distance to the magnetar. for ourpreferred distance, the peak luminosity of the december 2004 giant flare isreduced by a factor of three to 7 x 10^46 erg/s, such that the contamination ofbatse short gamma ray bursts (grb's) from giant flares of extragalacticmagnetars is reduced to a few percent. we infer a magnetar progenitor mass of~48^+20_-8 msun, in close agreement with that obtained recently for themagnetar in westerlund 1.

1407.1837	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xvii. physical and wind properties of  massive stars at the top of the main sequence	the evolution and fate of very massive stars (vms) is tightly connected totheir mass-loss properties. their initial and final masses differ significantlyas a result of mass loss. vms have strong stellar winds and extremely highionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanicaland radiative feedback in giant hii regions. however, how vms mass-lossproperties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. in theframework of the vlt-flames tarantula survey (vfts), we explore the mass-losstransition region from optically thin o to denser wnh star winds, therebytesting theoretical predictions. to this purpose we select 62 o, of, of/wn, andwnh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses andluminosities known. we perform a spectral analysis of optical vfts as well asnear-infrared vlt/sinfoni data using the non-lte radiative transfer code cmfgento obtain stellar and wind parameters. for the first time, we observationallyresolve the transition between optically thin o and optically thick wnh starwinds. our results suggest the existence of a kink between both mass-lossregimes, in agreement with recent mc simulations. for the optically thickregime, we confirm the steep dependence on the eddington factor from previoustheoretical and observational studies. the transition occurs on the ms near aluminosity of 10^6.1lsun, or a mass of 80...90msun. above this limit, we findthat - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with f = 0.1) - windmass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currentlyadopted in stellar evolution calculations. we also show that this results insubstantial helium surface enrichment. based on our spectroscopic analyses, weare able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for vms known to date,confirming the pivotal role of vms in ionising and shaping their environments.

0803.4262	the blue supergiant sher 25 and its intriguing hourglass nebula	the blue supergiant sher 25 is surrounded by an asymmetric, hourglass-shapedcircumstellar nebula. its structure and dynamics have been studied previouslythrough high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, and it appears dynamicallysimilar to the ring structure around sn 1987a. here we present long-slitspectroscopy of the circumstellar nebula around sher 25, and of the backgroundnebula of the host cluster ngc 3603. we perform a detailed nebular abundanceanalysis to measure the gas-phase abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, neonand argon. the oxygen abundance in the circumstellar nebula (12 + log[o/h] =8.61 +/- 0.13 dex) is similar to that in the background nebula (8.56 +/- 0.07),suggesting the composition of the host cluster is around solar. however, weconfirm that the circumstellar nebula is very rich in nitrogen, with anabundance of 8.91 +/- 0.15, compared to the background value of 7.47 +/- 0.18.a new analysis of the stellar spectrum with the fastwind model atmosphere codesuggests that the photospheric nitrogen and oxygen abundances in sher 25 areconsistent with the nebular results. while the nitrogen abundances are high,when compared to stellar evolutionary models they do not unambiguously confirmthat the star has undergone convective dredge-up during a previous redsupergiant phase. we suggest that the more likely scenario is that the nebulawas ejected from the star while it was in the blue supergiant phase. the star'sinitial mass was around 50 m_sun, which is rather too high for it to have had aconvective envelope stage as a red supergiant. rotating stellar models thatlead to mixing of core-processed material to the stellar surface during coreh-burning can quantitatively match the stellar results with the nebulaabundances.

1412.2705	the vlt-flames tarantula survey xix. b-type supergiants - atmospheric  parameters and nitrogen abundances to investigate the role of binarity and  the width of the main sequence	tlusty non-lte model atmosphere calculations have been used to determineatmospheric parameters and nitrogen (n) abundances for 34 single and 18 binaryb-type supergiants (bsgs). the effects of flux contribution from an unseensecondary were considered for the binary sample. we present the firstsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of bsgs across thetheoretical terminal age main sequence (tams). to account for the distributionof effective temperatures of the bsgs it may be necessary to extend the tams tolower temperatures. this is consistent with the derived distribution of massdiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and n abundances,provided that stars cooler than this temperature are post rsg objects. for thebsgs in the tarantula and previous flames surveys, most have small vsini. about10% have larger vsini (&gt;100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no nenhancement. all the cooler bsgs have low vsini of &lt;70km/s and high n abundanceestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blueloop may be important. a lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the smallsample size. single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, canaccount for the n enhancement in both the single and binary samples. thedetailed distribution of n abundances in the single and binary samples may bedifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. thefirst comparative study of single and binary bsgs has revealed that the mainsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending toteff=20000k. some marginal differences in single and binary atmosphericparameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standardevolution for some of the sample. this sample as a whole has implications forseveral aspects of our understanding of the evolution of bsgs. full abstract inpaper

1501.03794	the evolution of rotating very massive stars with lmc composition	we present a dense model grid with tailored input chemical compositionappropriate for the large magellanic cloud. we use a one-dimensionalhydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport ofangular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute ourdetailed models. we calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of70-500 msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. we find our rapidrotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotatingmodels. above 160 msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through massloss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent ofthe initial rotation rate. surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slowerrotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.for models above 150 mzams, and for models in the whole considered mass rangelater on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity ofthese models to their eddington limit. this leads to a maximum zero-age mainsequence surface temperature of 56000 k, at 180 msun, and to an evolution ofstars in the mass range 50-100 msun to the regime of luminous blue variables inthe hr diagram with high internal eddington factors. inflation also leads todecreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution ofstars above 180 msun. the cool surface temperatures due to the envelopeinflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars atlmc metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. thecorresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive lmc stars to producelong-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lowermasses.

astro-ph;0004081	the gamma velorum binary system. ii. wr stellar parameters and the  photon loss mechanism	in this paper we derive stellar parameters for the wolf-rayet star in thegamma velorum binary system (wr11), from a detailed non-lte model of itsoptical and infrared spectra. compared to the study of schaerer et al., theparameters of the wc8 star are revised to a hotter effective temperature(teff~57kk),a higher luminosity (log(l/lsun = 5.00), and a lower mass loss rate(log(mdot / msun/yr) = -5.0 - using a 10% clumping filling factor). thesechanges lead to a significant decrease in wind efficiency number, from 144 to7, so that the driving mechanism of the wind of this wr star may be simplyradiation pressure on lines. the derived spectroscopic luminosity is found tobe 40% lower than that derived by de marco &amp; schmutz through themass-luminosity relationship for wr stars (log(l/lsun = 5.2). the paperfurthermore presents a comparison of the independently-developed modellingprograms, cmfgen and isa-wind . overall, there seems to be very reasonableagreement between the derived parameters for wr11, except for the carboncontent, which is 2 times higher for cmfgen (c/he=0.15 vs. 0.06, by number).thecomparison also confirms a disparity in the predicted flux at lambda&lt;$400a,found by crowther et al., which will have effects on several nebular linestrengths.  the paper also presents the first independent check of the photon lossmechanism proposed by schmutz. we conclude that, not only is it important toinclude very many lines to realistically model line blanketing, but inparticular those ones that critically interact with strong resonance lines(e.g. heii lambda303.78). the inclusion of these latter lines may significantlyalter the wind ionization structure.

astro-ph;0206257	revised stellar temperatures for magellanic cloud o supergiants from  fuse and vlt-uves spectroscopy	we have undertaken quantitative analysis of four lmc and smc o4--9.7 extremesupergiants using far-ultraviolet fuse, ultraviolet iue/hstand optical vlt uvesspectroscopy. extended, non-lte model atmospheres that allow for the consistenttreatment of line blanketing are used to analyse wind &amp; photospheric spectralfeatures simultaneously. using halpha to constrain dm/dt, hei-ii photosphericlines reveal t_eff's which are systematically (5-7.5kk) &amp; substantially(15-20%) lower than previously derived from unblanketed, plane-parallel,non-lte photospheric studies. we have confidence in these revisions, sincederived t_eff's generally yield consistent fits across the entire 912-7000angobserved spectral range. in particular, we are able to resolve previousuv-optical t_eff discrepancies. `of' classification criteria are directlylinked to (strong) nitrogen enrichment (via niii 4097) &amp; (weak) carbondepletion (via ciii 4647-51), providing evidence for mixing of unprocessed andcno processed material at their stellar surfaces. oxygen abundances are moredifficult to constrain, except via oii lines in the o9.7 supergiant for whichit is also found to be somewhat depleted. the effect of wind clumping is alsoinvestigated, for which pv 1118-28 potentially provides a useful diagnostic ino-star winds. revised stellar properties affect existing calibrations of (i)lyman continuum photons - a factor of two lower for the o4 supergiant; and (ii)kinetic energy released into the ism by o supergiants. our results also haveimportance for the calibration of the wind momentum-luminosity relationship forob stars.

astro-ph;0207334	physical parameters of the high-mass x-ray binary 4u1700-37	we present the results of a detailed non-lte analysis of the uv and opticalspectrum of the o6.5iaf+ star hd153919 - the mass donor in the high-mass x-raybinary 4u1700-37. given the eclipsing nature of the system these results allowus to determine the most likely masses of both components of the binary viamonte carlo simulations. these suggest a mass for hd153919 of 58+/-11m_sun -implying the initial mass of the companion was rather high (&gt;60 m_sun). themost likely mass for the compact companion is found to be 2.44+/-0.27m_sun,with only 3.5 per cent of the trials resulting in a mass less than 2.0m_sun andnone less than 1.65m_sun. our observational data is inconsistent with thecanonical neutron star mass and the lowest black hole mass observed (&gt;4.4m_sun;nova vel). significantly changing observational parameters can force thecompact object mass into either of these regimes but this results in the o-starmass changing by factors of greater than 2, well beyond the limits determinedfrom its evolutionary state and surface gravity. the low mass of the compactobject implies that it is difficult to form high mass black holes through boththe case a &amp; b mass transfer channels and, if the compact object is a neutronstar, would significantly constrain the high density nuclear eos

astro-ph;0404231	quantitative studies of the far-uv, uv and optical spectra of late o and  early b-type supergiants in the magellanic clouds	we present quantitative studies of 8 late o and early b-type supergiants inthe magellanic clouds using far-ultraviolet fuse, ultraviolet iue/hst andoptical vlt-uves spectroscopy. temperatures, mass-loss rates and cno abundancesare obtained using the non-lte, spherical, line-blanketed model atmosphere codeof hillier &amp; miller (1998). we support recent results for lower temperatures ofob-type supergiants as a result of stellar winds and blanketing, which amountsto ~2000 k at b0 ia. in general, h$\alpha$ derived mass-loss rates areconsistent with uv and far-uv spectroscopy, although from consideration of thesiv $\lambda\lambda$1063-1073 doublet, clumped winds are preferred overhomogenous models. av 235 (b0 iaw) is a notable exception, which has anunusually strong h$\alpha$ profile that is inconsistent with the other balmerlines and uv wind diagnostics. we also derive cno abundances for our sample,revealing substantial nitrogen enrichment, with carbon and oxygen depletion.our results are supported by comparison with the galactic supergiant hd 2905(bc0.7 ia) for which near-solar cno abundances are obtained. this bolstersprevious suggestions that ``normal'' ob-type supergiants exhibit atmosphericcompositions indicative of partical cno processing.

astro-ph;0504342	on the massive stellar population of the super star cluster westerlund 1	we present new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the younggalactic open cluster westerlund 1 (wd 1) that reveal a unique population ofmassive evolved stars. we identify ~200 cluster members and presentspectroscopic classifications for ~25% of these. we find that all stars soclassified are unambiguously post-main sequence objects, consistent with anapparent lack of an identifiable main sequence in our photometric data to v~20.we are able to identify rich populations of wolf rayet stars, ob supergiantsand short lived transitional objects. of these, the latter group consists ofboth hot (luminous blue variable and extreme b supergiants) and cool (yellowhypergiant and red supergiant) objects - we find that half the known galacticpopulation of yhgs resides within wd1. we obtain a mean v-m_v ~25 mag from thecluster yellow hypergiants, implying a main sequence turnoff at or below m_v=-5 (o7 v or later). based solely on the masses inferred for the 53spectroscopically classified stars, we determine an absolute minimum mass of\~1.5 x 10^3 msun for wd 1. however, considering the complete photometricallyand spectroscopically selected cluster population and adopting a kroupa imf weinfer a likely mass for wd 1 of ~10^5 msun, noting that inevitable sourceconfusion and incompleteness are likely to render this an underestimate. assuch, wd 1 is the most massive compact young cluster yet identified in thelocal group, with a mass exceeding that of galactic centre clusters such as thearches and quintuplet. indeed, the luminosity, inferred mass and compact natureof wd 1 are comparable with those of super star clusters - previouslyidentified only in external galaxies - and is consistent with expectations fora globular cluster progenitor.

astro-ph;0509408	a neutron star with a massive progenitor in westerlund 1	we report the discovery of an x-ray pulsar in the young, massive galacticstar cluster westerlund 1. we detected a coherent signal from the brightestx-ray source in the cluster, cxo j164710.2-455216, during two chandraobservations on 2005 may 22 and june 18. the period of the pulsar is 10.6107(1)s. we place an upper limit to the period derivative of pdot&lt;2e-10 s/s, whichimplies that the spin-down luminosity is edot&lt;3e33 erg/s. the x-ray luminosityof the pulsar is l_x = 3(+10,-2)e33 (d/5 kpc)^2 erg/s, and the spectrum can bedescribed by a kt = 0.61+/-0.02 kev blackbody with a radius of r_bb =0.27+/-0.03 (d/5 kpc}) km. deep infrared observations reveal no counterpartwith k&lt;18.5, which rules out binary companions with m&gt;1 msun. taken together,the properties of the pulsar indicate that it is a magnetar. the rarity of slowx-ray pulsars and the position of cxo j164710.2-455216 only 1.6' from the coreof westerlund 1 indicates that it is a member of the cluster with &gt;99.97%confidence. westerlund 1 contains 07v stars with initial masses m_i=35 msun and&gt;50 post-main-sequence stars that indicate the cluster is 4+/-1 myr old.therefore, the progenitor to this pulsar had an initial mass m_i&gt;40 msun. thisis the most secure result among a handful of observational limits to the massesof the progenitors to neutron stars.

astro-ph;0602188	on the reliability of civ 1549 as an abundance indicator for high  redshift star-forming galaxies	we reconsider the use of the equivalent width of civ 1549, ew(civ), as anindicator of the oxygen abundance in star-forming galaxies, as proposed byheckman et al. for nearby starbursts. we refine the local calibration ofew(civ) vs. log (o/h) by using a restricted wavelength window which minimisesblending with interstellar absorption lines. when applied to the stellarcomponent only of the complex civ 1549 features in two high redshift galaxieswith good quality spectra, ms1512-cb58 (z = 2.7268) and q1307-bm1163 (z =1.4105), the local calibration gives values of the oxygen abundance which arein good agreement with other metallicity determinations based on nebularemission and interstellar absorption lines. our main conclusion is that forthis method to give reliable results at high redshifts, it should only be usedon data of sufficiently high spectral resolution (r &gt; 1000) for stellar andinterstellar civ components to be clearly separated. oxygen abundances will besystematically overestimated if the local calibration is applied to spectra ofhigh-z galaxies obtained with the low resolving powers (r ~ 200-300) of manycurrent wide field surveys. it will also be necessary to understand better thecauses of the scatter in the local relation, before we can be confident ofinferences from it at high z.

astro-ph;0605100	the massive star population in the giant hii region tol89 in ngc5398	we present new high spectral resolution vlt/uves spectroscopy and archivalhst/stis imaging and spectroscopy of the giant hii region tol89 in ngc5398.  from optical and uv hst images, we find that the star-forming complex as awhole contains at least seven young compact massive clusters. we resolve thetwo brightest optical knots, a and b, into five individual young massiveclusters along our slit, a1-4 and b1 respectively. from starburst99 (leithereret al.) uv spectral modelling, and nebular h beta equivalent widths in theoptical, we derive ages that are consistent with the formation of two separateburst events, of ~4+/-1 myr and &lt;3 myr for knots a (a1-4) and b (b1). an lmcmetallicity is measured for both knots, while nebular heii 4686 is observed inknot b and perhaps in knot a. we detect underlying broad wings on the strongestnebular emission lines indicating velocities up to 600 km/s. we estimate thatthere are ~95 early wn stars and ~35 early wc stars in tol89-a, using empiricaltemplate spectra of lmc wr stars from crowther and hadfield. remarkably, wealso detect ~ three mid wns in the smallest (mass) cluster in tol89-a, a4. fromthe strength of nebular h beta, we obtain n(o) ~690 and 2800 for knots a and b.we also employ a complementary approach using starburst99 models, in which theo star content is inferred from the stellar continuum, and the wr population isobtained from spectral synthesis of optical wr features using the grids fromsmith et al. we find reasonable agreement between the two methods for the ostar content and the n(wr)/n(o) ratio but find that the wr subtype distributionis in error in the starburst99 models, with far too few wn stars beingpredicted. we attribute this failure to the neglect of rotational mixing inevolutionary models.

astro-ph;0606403	the vlt-flames survey of massive stars: mass loss and rotation of  early-type stars in the smc	we have studied the optical spectra of a sample of 31 o- and early b-typestars in the small magellanic cloud, 21 of which are associated with the youngmassive cluster ngc 346. stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method. comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that accountfor stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars arebest represented by an age of 1-3 myr. the present day v_sini distribution ofthe 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotationalvelocity (v_r) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity ofabout 160-190 km/s and an effective half width of 100-150 km/s. the v_rdistribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. ifpredictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive starswithin the environment of the smc are correct, the young age of the clusterimplies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initialrotational velocity distribution. the location in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement withevolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring v_r.the mass loss rates of the smc objects having luminosities of log l/l_sun &gt; 5.4are in excellent agreement with predictions. however, for lower luminositystars the winds are too weak to determine m_dot accurately from the opticalspectrum. two of three spectroscopically classified vz stars from our sampleare located close to the theoretical zero age main sequence, as expected.

astro-ph;0606717	properties of galactic b supergiants	physical and wind properties of galactic b supergiants are presented basedupon non-lte line blanketed model atmospheres, including sher 25 toward the ngc3603 cluster. we compare halpha derived wind densities with recent results forsmc b supergiants and generally confirm theoretical expectations for strongerwinds amongst galactic supergiants. mid b supergiant winds are substantiallyweaker than predictions from current radiatively driven wind theory, a problemwhich is exacerbated if winds are already clumped in the halpha line formingregion. we find that the so-called `bistability jump' at b1 (teff ~ 21kk) fromlamers et al. is rather a more gradual downward trend. cno elementalabundances, including sher 25, reveal partially processed material at theirsurfaces. in general, these are in good agreement with evolutionary predictionsfor blue supergiants evolving redward accounting for rotational mixing. a fewcases, including hd 152236 (zeta^1 sco), exhibit strongly processed materialwhich is more typical of luminous blue variables. our derived photospheric[n/o] ratio for sher~25 agrees with that for its ejecta nebula, although ahigher degree of cno processing would be expected if the nebula originatedduring a red supergiant phase, as is suspected for the ring nebula ejected bythe b supergiant progenitor of sn 1987a, sk-69 202. sher 25 has an inferred ageof ~5myr in contrast with ~2myr for hd 97950, the ionizing cluster of ngc 3603.sher 25 may be a foreground object or close binary evolution could beresponsible for its unusual location in the h-r diagram.

astro-ph;0608076	wolf-rayet populations at high metallicity	observed properties of wolf-rayet stars at high metallicity are reviewed.wolf-rayet stars are more common at higher metallicity, as a result of strongermass-loss during earlier evolutionary phases with late wc subtypes signaturesof solar metallicity or higher. similar numbers of early (wc4-7) and late(wc8-9) stars are observed in the solar neighbourhood, whilst late subtypesdominate at higher metallicities, such as westerlund 1 in the inner milky wayand in m83. the observed trend to later wc subtype within metal-richenvironments is intimately linked to a metallicity dependence of wr stars, inthe sense that strong winds preferentially favour late subtypes. this hasrelevance to (a) the upper mass limit in metal-rich galaxies such as ngc 3049,due to softer ionizing fluxes from wr stars at high metallicity; (b)evolutionary models including a wr metallicity dependence provide a bettermatch to the observed n(wc)/n(wn) ratio. the latter conclusion partially restsupon the assumption of constant line luminosities for wr stars, yetobservations and theoretical atmospheric models reveal higher line fluxes athigh metallicity.

astro-ph;9908200	wolf-rayet nebulae as tracers of stellar ionizing fluxes: i. m1-67	we use wr124 (wn8h) and its associated nebula m1-67, to test theoreticalnon-lte models for wolf-rayet (wr) stars. lyman continuum ionizing fluxdistributions derived from a stellar analysis of wr124, are compared withnebular properties via photo-ionization modelling. our study demonstrates thesignificant role that line blanketing plays in affecting the lyman ionizingenergy distribution of wr stars, of particular relevance to the study of hiiregions containing young stellar populations.  we confirm previous results that non-line blanketed wr energy distributionsfail to explain the observed nebular properties of m1-67, such that thepredicted ionizing spectrum is too hard. a line blanketed analysis of wr124 iscarried out using the method of hillier &amp; miller (1998), with stellarproperties in accord with previous results, except that the inclusion ofclumping in the stellar wind reduces its wind performance factor to onlyapprox2. the ionizing spectrum of the line blanketed model is much softer thanfor a comparable temperature unblanketed case, such that negligible flux isemitted with energy above the hei 504 edge. photo-ionization modelling,incorporating the observed radial density distribution for m1-67 revealsexcellent agreement with the observed nebular electron temperature, ionizationbalance and line strengths. an alternative stellar model of wr124 iscalculated, following the technique of de koter et al. (1997), augmented toinclude line blanketing following schmutz et al. (1991). good consistency isreached regarding the stellar properties of wr124, but agreement with thenebular properties of m1-67 is somewhat poorer than for the hillier &amp; millercode.
