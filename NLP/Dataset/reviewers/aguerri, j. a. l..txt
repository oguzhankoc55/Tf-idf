0901.2346	the population of barred galaxies in the local universe i. detection and  characterisation of bars	(abridge) bars are very common in the centre of the disc galaxies, and theydrive the evolution of their structure. a volume-limited sample of 2106 discgalaxies extracted from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 was studiedto derive the bar fraction, length, and strength as a function of themorphology, size, local galaxy density, light concentration, and colour of thehost galaxy. the bars were detected using the ellipse fitting method andfourier analysis method. the ellipse fitting method was found to be moreefficient in detecting bars in spiral galaxies. the fraction of barred galaxiesturned out to be 45%. a bar was found in 29% of the lenticular galaxies, in 55%and 54% of the early- and late-type spirals, respectively. the bar length(normalised by the galaxy size) of late-type spirals is shorter than inearly-type or lenticular ones. a correlation between the bar length and galaxysize was found with longer bars hosted by larger galaxies. the bars of thelenticular galaxies are weaker than those in spirals. moreover, the unimodaldistribution of the bar strength found for all the galaxy types argues againsta quick transition between the barred and unbarred statues. there is nodifference between the local galaxy density of barred and unbarred galaxies.besides, neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated with thelocal density of the galaxy neighbourhoods. in contrast, a statisticalsignificant difference between the central light concentration and colour ofbarred and unbarred galaxies was found. bars are mostly located in lessconcentrated and bluer galaxies. these results indicate that the properties ofbars are strongly related to those of their host galaxies, but do not depend onthe local environment.

0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0903.2861	the host in blue compact galaxies: structural properties and scaling  relations	we have characterized the underlying stellar host in a sample of 28 bluecompact galaxies (bcgs), by fitting their 2d light distributions. theirstructural parameters were related with galaxy properties such as colours andgas content. these properties were also compared with those of other galaxytypes. all the bcg hosts but one show low sersic indexes (0.5 &lt; n &lt; 2), withmean effective radius &lt;$r_{e,b}$&gt;=1.11$\pm$0.74 kpc, and mean surfacebrightness &lt;$\mu_{e,b}$&gt; = 22.59$\pm$0.68 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. host effectiveradii scale linearly with their luminosity, while n and $\mu_{\rm e}$ do not.in addition, host colours and structural parameters are not linearlycorrelated. overall,the flux enhancement caused by the starburst is about 0.8mag while their b-r colours decrease by about 0.2 mag. galaxies with moreluminous and extended hosts show larger and luminous starburst components. bcghosts show b-r=0.95$\pm$0.26 in median. overall, bcg hosts are more compact (bya factor ~2) and have higher central surface brightnesses (by about ~2 mag)than dis and most des. bcg hosts and dis are indistinguishable in the b-bandtully-fisher relation (tfr). we found that about 50-60 % of the galaxies aremore underluminous than those late-type discs with the same circular velocity.this feature is more important when luminosities are converted into stellarmasses, while it tends to diminish when the hi gas mass is added. deviationsamong host masses for a given circular velocity from the stellar tfr correlatewith their hi mass-to-luminosity ratio, whereas deviations from the gas+stellartfr, do not. overall, our findings suggest that the baryonic mass in bcgs tendsto normal values but bcgs tend to be inefficient producing stars, especiallytoward the low-mass, gas-rich and bluest hosts, in a similar way to dis.

0904.2150	search for blue compact dwarf galaxies during quiescence ii:  metallicities of gas and stars, ages, and star-formation rates	we examine the metallicity and age of a large set of sdss/dr6 galaxies thatmay be blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies during quiescence (qbcds).theindividual spectra are first classified and then averaged to reduce noise. themetallicity inferred from emission lines (tracing ionized gas) exceeds by ~0.35dex the metallicity inferred from absorption lines (tracing stars). such asmall difference is significant according to our error budget estimate. thesame procedure was applied to a reference sample of bcds, and in this case thetwo metallicities agree, being also consistent with the stellar metallicity inqbcds. chemical evolution models indicate that the gas metallicity of qbcds istoo high to be representative of the galaxy as a whole, but it can represent asmall fraction of the galactic gas, self enriched by previous starbursts. theluminosity weighted stellar age of qbcds spans the whole range between 1 and 10gyr, whereas it is always smaller than 1 gyr for bcds. our stellar ages andmetallicities rely on a single stellar population spectrum fitting procedure,which we have specifically developed for this work using the stellar librarymiles.

0704.1579	a study of catalogued nearby galaxy clusters in the sdss-dr4: i. cluster  global properties	we have selected a sample of 88 nearby (z&lt;0.1) galaxy clusters from thesdss-dr4 with redshift information for the cluster members. we have derivedglobal properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,velocity dispersion, and virial radii. cluster galaxies have been grouped intwo families according to their $u-r$ colours. the total sample consists of10865 galaxies. as expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned tobe early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the clustercentre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. thebrightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show thesmallest velocity dispersions. early-type galaxies also show constant velocitydispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in theoutermost regions. in contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasingvelocity dispersions profiles. no correlation has been found between thefraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as clustervelocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. in contrast, we found correlationbetween the x-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. these resultsindicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits thanearly-type ones. their star formation seems to be independent of the clusterglobal properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.these observational results suggest that the global environment could beimportant for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster($\sigma &gt; 800$ km s$^{-1}$). however, the local environment could play a keyrole in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.

1002.0583	which galaxies host bars and disks? a study of the coma cluster	we present a study of the bar fraction in the coma cluster galaxies based ona sample of $\sim 190$ galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 6 (sdss-dr6) and observed with the hubble space telescope (hst)advanced camera for survey (acs). the unprecedented resolution of the hst-acsimages allow us to explore the presence of bars, detected by visualclassification, throughout a luminosity range of 9 magnitudes ($-23 \lesssim$m$_{r} \lesssim -14$), permitting us to study the poor known region of dwarfgalaxies. we find that bars are hosted by galaxies in a tight range of bothluminosities ($-22 \lesssim$ m$_{r} \lesssim -17$) and masses ($10^{9} \lesssim{\cal m_{*}}/{\cal m}_{\sun} \lesssim 10^{11}$). this result holds whencomparing with a sample of bright/massive field galaxies. in addition, we findthat the bar fraction does not vary significantly when going from the center tothe cluster outskirts, implying that cluster environment plays a second orderrole in bar formation/evolution. the shape of the bar fraction distributionwith respect to both luminosity and mass is well matched by the luminositydistribution of disk galaxies in coma, indicating that bars are good tracers ofcold stellar disks. we discuss the implications of our results for theformation and evolution scenarios of bars and disks.

1002.3076	evolution of blue e/s0 galaxies from z~1: merger remnants or disk  rebuilding galaxies?	studying outliers from the bimodal distribution of galaxies in the color-massspace, such as morphological early-type galaxies residing in the blue cloud,can help to better understand the physical mechanisms that lead galaxymigrations in this space. in this paper we study the evolution of theproperties of 210 m*/msol&gt;10^10 blue e/s0s between z~1.4 and z~0.2 in thecosmos field with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos 10krelease. we first observe that the threshold mass, defined at z=0 in previousstudies as the mass below which the population of blue early-type galaxiesstarts to be abundant relative to passive e/s0s, evolves from log(m*/msol)~10.1at z~0.3 to log(m*/msol)~10.9 at z~1. second, there seems to be a turn-overmass in the nature of blue e/s0 galaxies. above log(m*/msol)~10.8 blue e/s0resemble to merger remnants probably migrating to the red-sequence in atime-scale of ~3 gyr. below this mass, they seem to be closer to normallate-type galaxies as if they were the result of minor mergers which triggeredthe central star-formation and built a central bulge component or were(re)building a disk from the surrounding gas, suggesting that they are movingback or staying in the blue-cloud. this turn-over mass does not seem to evolvesignificantly from z~1 in contrast with the threshold mass and therefore doesnot seem to be linked with the relative abundance of blue e/s0s.

1003.3186	automatic unsupervised classification of all sdss/dr7 galaxy spectra	using the 'k-means' cluster analysis algorithm, we carry out an unsupervisedclassification of all galaxy spectra in the seventh and final sloan digital skysurvey data release (sdss/dr7). except for the shift to restframe wavelengths,and the normalization to the g-band flux, no manipulation is applied to theoriginal spectra. the algorithm guarantees that galaxies with similar spectrabelong to the same class. we find that 99 % of the galaxies can be assigned toonly 17 major classes, with 11 additional minor classes including the remaining1%. the classification is not unique since many galaxies appear in betweenclasses, however, our rendering of the algorithm overcomes this weakness with atool to identify borderline galaxies. each class is characterized by a templatespectrum, which is the average of all the spectra of the galaxies in the class.these low noise template spectra vary smoothly and continuously along asequence labeled from 0 to 27, from the reddest class to the bluest class. ourautomatic spectroscopic k-means-based (ask) classification separates galaxiesin colors, with classes characteristic of the red sequence, the blue cloud, aswell as the green valley. when red sequence galaxies and green valley galaxiespresent emission lines, they are characteristic of agn activity. blue galaxyclasses have emission lines corresponding to star formation regions. we findthe expected correlation between spectroscopic class and hubble type, but thisrelationship exhibits a high intrinsic scatter. several potential uses of theask classification are identified and sketched, including fast determination ofphysical properties by interpolation, classes as templates in redshiftdeterminations, and target selection in follow-up works (we find classes ofseyfert galaxies, green valley galaxies, as well as a significant number ofoutliers). the ask classification is publicly accessible through variouswebsites.

1004.5496	the faber-jackson relation for early-type galaxies: dependence on the  magnitude range	we take a sample of early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-dr7, $\sim$ 90 000 galaxies) spanning a range of approximately 7 $mag$ inboth $g$ and $r$ filters and analyse the behaviour of the faber-jacksonrelation parameters as functions of the magnitude range. we calculate theparameters in two ways: i) we consider the faintest (brightest) galaxies ineach sample and we progressively increase the width of the magnitude intervalby inclusion of the brighter (fainter) galaxies(increasing-magnitude-intervals), and ii) we consider narrow-magnitudeintervals of the same width ($\delta m = 1.0$ $mag$) over the whole magnituderange available (narrow-magnitude-intervals). our main results are that: i) inboth increasing and narrow-magnitude-intervals the faber-jackson relationparameters change systematically, ii) non-parametric tests show that thefluctuations in the values of the slope of the faber-jackson relation are notproducts of chance variations. we conclude that the values of the faber-jacksonrelation parameters depend on the width of the magnitude range and theluminosity of galaxies within the magnitude range. this dependence is caused,to a great extent by the selection effects and because the geometrical shape ofthe distribution of galaxies on the $m - \log (\sigma_{0})$ plane depends onluminosity. we therefore emphasize that if the luminosity of galaxies or thewidth of the magnitude range or both are not taken into consideration whencomparing the structural relations of galaxy samples for different wavelengths,environments, redshifts and luminosities, any differences found may bemisinterpreted.

1005.4688	thin discs, thick dwarfs and the effects of stellar feedback	we investigate the role of stellar mass in shaping the intrinsic thickness ofgalaxy discs by determining the probability distribution of apparent axisratios (b/a) for two different samples that probe the faint end of the galaxyluminosity function. we find that the b/a distribution has a characteristic'u-shape' and identify a limiting mass m_* ~ 2x10^9 m_sun below which low-massgalaxies start to be systematically thicker. this tendency holds for very faint(m_b ~ -8) dwarfs in the local volume, which are essentially spheroidalsystems. we argue that galaxy shape is the result of the complex interplaybetween mass, specific angular momentum and stellar feedback effects. thus, theincreasing importance of turbulent motions in lower mass galaxies leads to theformation of thicker systems, a result supported by the latest hydrodynamicalsimulations of dwarf galaxy formation and other theoretical expectations. wediscuss several implications of this finding, including the formation of barsin faint galaxies, the deprojection of hi line profiles and simulations ofenvironmental effects on the dwarf galaxy population.

1006.5449	structural properties of disk galaxies. ii. intrinsic shape of bulges	(abridged) the structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148unbarred s0-sb galaxies were analyzed to derive the intrinsic shape of theirbulges. we developed a new method to derive the intrinsic shape of bulges basedon the geometrical relationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes ofbulges and disks. the equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of bulgeswere obtained from the length of the apparent major and minor semi-axes of thebulge, twist angle between the apparent major axis of the bulge and the galaxyline of nodes, and galaxy inclination. we found that the intrinsic shape iswell constrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. alarge fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (b/a&lt;0.9).this fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or medianequatorial ellipticity, respectively. most are flattened along their polar axis(c&lt;(a+b)/2). the distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. thisbimodality is driven by bulges with sersic index n&gt;2, or equivalently, by thebulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio b/t&gt;0.3. in particular, bulgeswith n\leq2 and with b/t\leq0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, andfewer prolate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect tobulges with n&gt;2 and with b/t&gt;0.3, respectively. according to predictions of thenumerical simulations of bulge formation, bulges with n\leq2, which show a highfraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and haveb/t\leq0.3, could be the result of dissipational minor mergers. both majordissipational and dissipationless mergers seem to be required to explain thevariety of shapes found for bulges with n&gt;2 and b/t&gt;0.3.

1007.3264	evolution of bcgs structural parameters in the last $\sim$6 gyr:  feedback processes versus merger events	we present results on the evolution in the last 6 gyr of the structuralparameters of two samples of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). the nearbysample of bcgs consist on 69 galaxies from the wings survey spanning a redshiftrange of 0.04$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.07. the intermediate redshift (0.3$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.6) sample isformed by 20 bcgs extracted from the hubble space telescope archive. bothsamples have similar spatial resolution and their host clusters have similarx-ray luminosities. we report an increase in the size of the bcgs fromintermediate to local redshift. however, we do not detect any variation in thes\'ersic shape parameter in both samples. these results are proved to be robustsince the observed tendencies are model independent. we also obtain significantcorrelations between some of the bcgs parameters and the main properties of thehost clusters. more luminous, larger and centrally located bcgs are located inmore massive and dominant galaxy clusters. these facts indicate that the hostgalaxy cluster has played an important role in the formation of their bcgs. wediscuss the possible mechanisms that can explain the observed evolution of thestructural parameters of the bcgs. we conclude that the main mechanisms thatcan explain the increase in size and the non-evolution in the s\'ersic shapeparameter of the bcgs in the last 6 gyr are feedback processes. this resultdisagrees with semi-analytical simulation results supporting that mergingprocesses are the main responsible for the evolution of the bcgs until thepresent epoch.

1012.5757	the intrinsic shape of bulges	the structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred s0-sbgalaxies were derived using the gasp2d algorithm and then analyzed to derivethe intrinsic shape of their bulges. we developed a new method to derive theintrinsic shape of bulges based on photometric data and on the geometricalrelationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of bulges and disks.the method is conceived as completely independent of the studied class ofobjects, and it can be applied whenever a triaxial ellipsoid embedded in anaxisymmetric component is considered. we found that the intrinsic shape is wellconstrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. alarge fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (b/a&lt;0.9).this fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or medianequatorial ellipticity, respectively. most of them are flattened along theirpolar axis. the distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. thisbimodality is driven by bulges with sersic index n&gt;2, or equivalently, by thebulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio b/t&gt;0.3. bulges with n&lt;2 andwith b/t&lt;0.3 follow a similar distribution, which is different from that ofbulges with n&gt;2 and with b/t&gt;0.3. in particular, bulges with n&lt;2 and withb/t&lt;0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric)bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, and fewer prolate axisymmetric(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect to bulges with n&gt;2 and withb/t&gt;0.3, respectively. according to the numerical simulations of bulgeformation, bulges with n&lt;2, which show a high fraction of oblate axisymmetric(or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and have b/t&lt;0.3, could be the result ofdissipational minor mergers. both major dissipational and dissipationlessmergers seem to be required to explain the variety of shapes found for bulgeswith n&gt;2 and b/t&gt;0.3.

1101.2447	fossil groups origins: i. rx j105453.3+552102 a very massive and relaxed  system at z~0.5	the most accepted scenario for the origin of fossil groups (fgs) is that theyare galaxy associations in which the merging rate was fast and efficient. thesesystems have assembled half of their mass at early epoch of the universe,subsequently growing by minor mergers. they could contain a fossil record ofthe galaxy structure formation. we have started a project in order tocharacterize a large sample of fgs. in this paper we present the analysis ofthe fossil system rx j105453.3+552102. optical deep images were used forstudying the properties of the brightest group galaxy and for computing thephotometric luminosity function of the group. we have also performed a detaildynamical analysis of the system based on redshift data for 116 galaxies. thisgalaxy system is located at z=0.47, and shows a quite large line-of-sightvelocity dispersion \sigma_{v}~1000 km/s. assuming the dynamical equilibrium,we estimated a virial mass of m ~ 10^{15} h_{70} m_{\odot}. no evidence ofsubstructure was found within 1.4 mpc radius. we found a statisticallysignificant departure from gaussianity of the group members velocities in themost external regions of the group. this could indicate the presence ofgalaxies in radial orbits in the external region of the group. we also foundthat the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of m_{r}~ -19.5 galaxies. the brightest group galaxy shows low sersic parameter (n~2)and a small peculiar velocity. indeed, our accurate photometry shows that thedifference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies is 1.9 magin the r-band, while the classical definition of fgs is based on a magnitudegap of 2. we conclude that this fossil system does not follow the empiricaldefinition of fgs. nevertheless, it is a massive, old and undisturbed galaxysystem with little infall of l^{*} galaxies since its initial collapse.

1104.4864	relationship between hubble type and spectroscopic class in local  galaxies	we compare the hubble type and the spectroscopic class of the galaxies withspectra in sdss/dr7. as it is long known, elliptical galaxies tend to be redwhereas spiral galaxies tend to be blue, however, this relationship presents alarge scatter, which we measure and quantify in detail. we compare theautomatic spectroscopic k-means based classification (ask) with most of thecommonly used morphological classifications. all of them provide consistentresults. given a spectral class, the morphological type wavers with a standarddeviation between 2 and 3 t types, and the same large dispersion characterizesthe variability of spectral classes fixed the morphological type. thedistributions of hubble types given an ask class are very skewed -- theypresent long tails that go to the late morphological types for the redgalaxies, and to the early morphological types for the blue spectroscopicclasses. the scatter is not produced by problems in the classification, and itremains when particular subsets are considered. a considerable fraction of thered galaxies are spirals (40--60 %), but they never present very late hubbletypes (sd or later). even though red spectra are not associated withellipticals, most ellipticals do have red spectra: 97 % of the ellipticals inthe morphological catalog by nair &amp; abraham, used here for reference, belong toask 0, 2 or 3. it contains only a 3 % of blue ellipticals. the galaxies in thegreen valley class (ask~5) are mostly spirals, and the agn class (ask 6)presents a large scatter of hubble types from e to sd. from redshift 0.25 tonow the galaxies redden from ask 2 to ask 0, as expected from the passiveevolution of their stellar populations. two of the ask classes (1 and 4) gatheredge-on spirals, a property of interest in studies requiring knowing theintrinsic shape of a galaxy (e.g., weak lensing calibration).

1105.5826	a minor merger origin for stellar inner discs and rings in spiral  galaxies	recent observations show that inner discs and rings (ids and irs, henceforth)are not preferably found in barred galaxies, a fact that points to therelevance of formation mechanisms different to the traditional bar-originscenario. in contrast, the role of minor mergers in the formation of theseinner components (ics), while often invoked, is still poorly understood. wehave investigated the capability of minor mergers to trigger the formation ofids and irs in spiral galaxies through collisionless n-body simulations. wehave run a battery of minor mergers in which both primary and secondary aremodelled as disc-bulge-halo galaxies with realistic density ratios. a detailedanalysis of the morphology, structure, and kinematics of the ics resulting fromthe minor merger has been carried out. all the simulated minor mergers developthin ics out of satellite material, supported by rotation. a wide morphologicalzoo of ics has been obtained (including ids, irs, pseudo-rings, nested ids,spiral patterns, and combinations of them), but all with structural andkinematical properties similar to observations. the existence of the resultingics can be deduced through the features that they imprint in the isophotalprofiles and kinemetric maps of the final remnant, as in many real galaxies.the realistic density ratios used in the present models make the satellites toexperience more efficient orbital circularization and disruption than inprevious studies. combined with the disc resonances induced by the encounter,these processes give place to highly aligned co- and counter-rotating ics inthe remnant centre. therefore, minor mergers are an efficient mechanism to formrotationally-supported stellar ics in spiral galaxies, neither requiring strongdissipation nor the development of noticeable bars (abridged).

1107.4000	wavelength calibration for osiris/gtc* tunable filters	osiris (optical system for imaging and low resolution integratedspectroscopy) is the first light instrument of the gran telescopio canarias(gtc). it provides a flexible and competitive tunable filter (tf). since it isbased on a fabry-perot interferometer working in collimated beam, the tftransmission wavelength depends on the position of the target with respect tothe optical axis. this effect is non-negligible and must be accounted for inthe data reduction. our paper establishes a wavelength calibration for osiristf with the accuracy required for spectrophotometric measurements using thefull field of view (fov) of the instrument. the variation of the transmissionwavelength $\lambda(r)$ across the fov is well described by$\lambda(r)=\lambda(0)/\sqrt{1+(r/f_2)^2}$, where $\lambda(0)$ is the centralwavelength, $r$ represents the physical distance from the optical axis, and$f_2=185.70\pm0.17\,$mm is the effective focal length of the camera lens. thisnew empirical calibration yields an accuracy better than 1\,\aa\ across theentire osiris fov ($\sim$8\arcmin$\times$8\arcmin), provided that the positionof the optical axis is known within 45 $\mu$m ($\equiv$ 1.5 binned pixels). wesuggest a calibration protocol to grant such precision over long periods, uponre-alignment of osiris optics, and in different wavelength ranges. thiscalibration differs from the calibration in osiris manual which, nonetheless,provides an accuracy $\lesssim1$\aa\, for $r\lesssim 2\arcmin$.

1107.6017	the intrinsic dispersion of the faber-jackson relation for early-type  galaxies as function of the mass and redshift	aims. recently it has been reported that the intrinsic dispersion at constantmagnitude of the structural relations from early-type galaxies is a useful toolto study the universality of these structural relations, that is to say, tostudy whether the structural relations depend on luminosity, wavelength,redshift and/or environment. in this work we study the intrinsic dispersion ofthe faber-jackson relation as function of the luminosity, mass and redshift.  methods. we use a sample of approximately 90 000 early-type galaxies from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss-dr7) spanning a magnitude range of 7 $mag$ inboth $g$ and $r$ filters. we calculate the intrinsic dispersion of thefaber-jackson relation at approximately constant magnitude and compare this atdifferent luminosities, masses and redshifts.  results. the main results are the following: i) the intrinsic dispersion ofthe faber-jackson relation depends on the luminosity, mass and redshift. ii)the distribution for brighter and more massive galaxies has smaller intrinsicdispersion than that for fainter and less massive galaxies. iii) thedistribution of bright and massive galaxies at higher redshift has smallerintrinsic dispersion than those similar galaxies at low redshift.  conclusions. comparisons of the results found in this work with recentstudies from the literature make us conclude that the intrinsic dispersion ofthe faber-jackson relation could depend on the history of galaxies, in otherwords, the intrinsic dispersion could depend on the number and nature oftransformation events that have affected the galaxies along their life times,such as collapse, accretion, interaction and merging.

1109.0235	systematic search for extremely metal poor galaxies in the sloan digital  sky survey	we carry out a systematic search for extremely metal poor (xmp) galaxies inthe spectroscopic sample of sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7(dr7). the xmp candidates are found by classifying all the galaxies accordingto the form of their spectra in a region 80aa wide around halpha. due to thedata size, the method requires an automatic classification algorithm. we usek-means. our systematic search renders 32 galaxies having negligible [nii]lines, as expected in xmp galaxy spectra. twenty one of them have beenpreviously identified as xmp galaxies in the literature -- the remaining elevenare new. this was established after a thorough bibliographic search thatyielded only some 130 galaxies known to have an oxygen metallicity ten timessmaller than the sun (explicitly, with 12+log(o/h) &lt;= 7.65). xmp galaxies arerare; they represent 0.01% of the galaxies with emission lines in sdss/dr7.although the final metallicity estimate of all candidates remains pending,strong-line empirical calibrations indicate a metallicity about one-tenthsolar, with the oxygen metallicity of the twenty one known targets being12+log(o/h)= 7.61 +- 0.19. since the sdss catalog is limited in apparentmagnitude, we have been able to estimate the volume number density of xmpgalaxies in the local universe, which turns out to be (1.32 +- 0.23) x 10^-4mpc^-3. the xmp galaxies constitute 0.1% of the galaxies in the local volume,or some 0.2% considering only emission line galaxies. all but four of ourcandidates are blue compact dwarf galaxies (bcds), and 24 of them have eithercometary shape or are formed by chained knots.

1110.0465	fossil groups origins ii. unveiling the formation of the brightest group  galaxies through their scaling relations	(abridged) fossil systems are galaxy associations dominated by a relativelyisolated, bright elliptical galaxy, surrounded by a group of smaller galaxieslacking l* objects. we analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structuralproperties of a sample of 20 bggs present in fgs in order to better understandtheir formation mechanisms. their surface-brightness distribution was fitted toa sersic profile using the gasp2d algorithm. then, the standard scalingrelations were derived for the first time for these galaxies and compared withthose of normal ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies in non-fossilsystems. the bggs presented in this study represent a subset of the mostmassive galaxies in the universe. we found that their ellipticity profiles arecontinuously increasing with the galactocentric radius. our fossil bcgs followclosely the fundamental plane described by normal ellipticals. however, theydepart from both the log \sigma_0 vs. log l_{k_{s}} and log r_{\rm e} vs. logl_{k_{s}} relations described by intermediate mass ellipticals. this occurs inthe sense that our bggs have larger effective radii and smaller velocitydispersions than those predicted by these relations. we also found that moreelliptical galaxies systematically deviate from the previous relations whilemore rounder object do not. no similar correlation was found with the sersicindex. the derived scaling relations can be interpreted in terms of theformation scenario of the bggs. because our bggs follow the fundamental planetilt but they have larger effective radii than expected for intermediate massellipticals, we suggest that they only went through dissipational mergers in aearly stage of their evolution and then assembled the bulk of their massthrough subsequent dry mergers, contrary to previous claims that bggs in fgswere formed mainly by the merging of gas-rich galaxies.

1111.0962	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey: i. survey  presentation	we present here the calar alto legacy integral field area (califa) survey,which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction.we summarizethe survey goals and design, including sample selection and observationalstrategy.we also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs(june/july 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemesand general characteristics of the reduced data. this survey is obtainingspatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of$\sim600$ galaxies in the local universe (0.005&lt; z &lt;0.03). califa has beendesigned to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the followingquantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas:distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematicproperties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. califa uses the ppakintegral field unit (ifu), with a hexagonal field-of-view of$\sim1.3\sq\arcmin'$, with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointingdithering scheme. the optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000{\aa}, using two overlapping setups (v500 and v1200), with differentresolutions: r\sim850 and r\sim1650, respectively. califa is a legacy survey,intended for the community. the reduced data will be released, once the qualityhas been guaranteed. the analyzed data fulfill the expectations of the originalobserving proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratoryanalysis.  we conclude from this first look at the data that califa will be an importantresource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the local universe.

1111.1718	constraining the formation of inner bars. photometry, kinematics and  stellar populations in ngc 357	double-barred galaxies are common in the local universe, with approximatelyone third of barred spirals hosting an smaller, inner bar. nested bars havebeen proposed as a mechanism for transporting gas to the very central regionsof the galaxy, trigger star formation and contribute to the growth of thebulge. to test this idea, we perform for the first time a detailed analysis ofthe photometry, kinematics and stellar populations of a double-barred galaxy:ngc 357. we find that this galaxy is either hosting a pseudobulge or aclassical bulge together with an inner disc. we compare the relative meanluminosity-weighted age, metallicity and alpha-enhancement between the(pseudo)bulge, inner bar and outer bar, finding that the three structures arenearly coeval and old. moreover, the bulge and inner bar present the samemetallicity and overabundance, whereas the outer bar tends to be lessmetal-rich and more alpha-enhanced. these results point out that, rather thanthe classical secular scenario in which gas and star formation play a majorrole, the redistribution of the existing stars is driving the formation of theinner structures.

1201.2409	dissecting the morphological and spectroscopic properties of galaxies in  the local universe: i. elliptical galaxies	we revisit the scaling relations and star-forming histories of localelliptical galaxies using a novel selection method applied to the sloan digitalsky survey dr7. we combine two probability-based automated spectroscopic andmorphological classifications of about 600000 galaxies with z&lt;0.25 to isolatetrue elliptical galaxies. our sample selection method does not introduceartificial cuts in the parameters describing the galaxy but instead itassociates to every object a weight measuring the probability of being in agiven spectro-morphological class. thus the sample minimizes the selectionbiases. we show that morphologically defined ellipticals are basicallydistributed in 3 spectral classes, which dominate at different stellar masses.the bulk of the population (about 50%) is formed by a well defined class ofgalaxies with old stellar populations that formed their stars at very earlyepochs in a short episode of star formation. they dominate the scalingrelations of elliptical galaxies known from previous works and represent thecanonical elliptical class. at the low mass end, we find a population ofslightly larger ellipticals, with smaller velocity dispersions at fixed stellarmass, which seem to have experienced a more recent episode of star formationprobably triggered by gas-rich minor mergers. the high mass end tends to bedominated by a third spectral class, slightly more metal rich and with moreefficient stellar formation than the reference class. this third classcontributes to the curvature of the mass-size relation at high masses reportedin previous works. our method is therefore able to isolate typical spectra ofelliptical galaxies following different evolutive pathways.

1202.0511	the ionized gas in the califa early-type galaxies i. mapping two  representative cases: ngc 6762 and ngc 5966	as part of the califa survey, we conducted a thorough 2d analysis of theionized gas in two e/s0 galaxies, ngc6762 and ngc5966, aiming to shed light onthe nature of their warm ionized ism. we present optical ifs obtained with thepmas/ppak spectrophotometer. to recover the nebular lines, we subtracted theunderlying stellar continuum from the observed spectra using the starlightcode. in ngc6762, the ionized gas and stellar emission display similarmorphologies, while the emission line morphology is elongated in ngc5966,spanning ~6 kpc, and is oriented roughly orthogonal to the major axis of thestellar continuum ellipsoid. whereas gas and stars are kinematically aligned inngc6762, the gas is kinematically decoupled from the stars in ngc5966. adecoupled rotating disk or an ionization cone are two possible interpretationsof the elongated ionized gas structure in ngc5966. the latter would be thefirst ionization cone of such a dimension detected within a weak emission-linegalaxy. both galaxies have weak emission-lines relative to the continuum[ew(ha)&lt; 3 a] and have low excitation, log([oiii]5007/hb) &lt; 0.5. based onoptical diagnostic ratios([oiii]5007/hb,[nii]6584/ha,[sii]6717,6731/ha,[oi]6300/ha), both objectscontain a liner nucleus and an extended liner-like gas emission. the emissionline ratios do not vary significantly with radius or aperture, which indicatesthat the nebular properties are spatially homogeneous. the gas emission inngc6762 can be best explained by photoionization by pagb stars without the needof invoking any other excitation mechanism. in the case of ngc5966, thepresence of a nuclear ionizing source seems to be required to shape theelongated gas emission feature in the ionization cone scenario, althoughionization by pagb stars cannot be ruled out.(abridged)

1202.1929	bar pattern speed evolution over the last 7 gyr	the tumbling pattern of a bar is the main parameter characterising itsdynamics. from numerical simulations, its evolution since bar formation istightly linked to the dark halo in which the bar is formed through dynamicalfriction and angular momentum exchange. observational measurements of the barpattern speed with redshift can restrict models of galaxy formation and barevolution. we aim to determine, for the first time, the bar pattern speedevolution with redshift based on morphological measurements. we have selected asample of 44 low inclination ringed galaxies from the sdss and cosmos surveyscovering the redshift range 0 &lt;z&lt; 0.8 to investigate the evolution of the barpattern speed. we have derived morphological ratios between the deprojectedouter ring radius (r_{ring}) and the bar size (r_{bar}). this quantity isrelated to the parameter {\cal r}=r_{cr}/r_{bar} used for classifiying bars inslow and fast rotators, and allow us to investigate possible differences withredshift. we obtain a similar distribution of $r$ at all redshifts. we do notfind any systematic effect that could be forcing this result. the resultsobtained here are compatible with both, the bulk of the bar population (~70%)being fast-rotators and no evolution of the pattern speed with redshift. weargue that if bars are long-lasting structures, the results presented hereimply that there has not been a substantial angular momentum exchange betweenthe bar and halo, as predicted by numerical simulations. in consequence, thismight imply that the discs of these high surface-brightness galaxies aremaximal.

1202.3397	quasi-stellar objects in the alhambra survey. i. photometric redshift  accuracy based on a 23 optical-nir filter photometry	we characterize the ability of the alhambra survey to assign accuratephoto-z's to blagn and qsos based on their alhambra very-low-resolutionoptical-nir spectroscopy. a sample of 170 spectroscopically identified blagnand qsos have been used together with a library of templates (including sedsfrom agn, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23photometric data points provided by alhambra in the optical and nir (20medium-band optical filters plus the standard jhks). we find that the alhambraphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classificationfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of thesurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(sloan)~24.0). thederived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recentresults in other cosmological fields. the fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainlycaused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and theintrinsic variability of the blagn/qso population. a small fraction of outliersmay have an incorrectly assigned spectroscopic redshift. the definition of thealhambra survey in terms of the number of filters, filter properties, areacoverage and depth is able to provide photometric redshifts for blagn/qsos witha precision similar to any previous survey that makes use of medium-bandoptical photometry. in agreement with previous literature results, our analysisalso reveals that, in the 0&lt;z&lt;4 redshift interval, very accurate photo-z can beobtained without the use of near-ir broadband photometry at the expense of aslight increase of outliers. the nir importance is expected to increase athigher redshifts (z&gt;4). these results are relevant for the design of futureoptical follow-ups of surveys with a large fraction of blagn, as it is the casefor x-rays or radio surveys.

0710.5466	structural properties of disk galaxies i. the intrinsic ellipticity of  bulges	(abridged) a variety of formation scenarios was proposed to explain thediversity of properties observed in bulges. studying their intrinsic shape canhelp in constraining the dominant mechanism at the epochs of their assembly.the structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred s0--sbgalaxies were derived in order to study the correlations between bulges anddisks as well as the probability distribution function (pdf) of the intrinsicequatorial ellipticity of bulges. it is presented a new fitting algorithm(gasp2d) to perform the two-dimensional photometric decomposition of galaxysurface-brightness distribution. this was assumed to be the sum of thecontribution of a bulge and disk component characterized by elliptical andconcentric isophotes with constant (but possibly different) ellipticity andposition angles. bulge and disk parameters of the sample galaxies were derivedfrom the j-band images which were available in the two micron all sky survey.the pdf of the equatorial ellipticity of the bulges was derived from thedistribution of the observed ellipticities of bulges and misalignments betweenbulges and disks. strong correlations between the bulge and disk parameterswere found. about 80% of bulges in unbarred lenticular andearly-to-intermediate spiral galaxies are not oblate but triaxial ellipsoids.their mean axial ratio in the equatorial plane is &lt;b/a&gt; = 0.85. there is notsignificant dependence of their pdf on morphology, light concentration, andluminosity. the interplay between bulge and disk parameters favors scenarios inwhich bulges assembled from mergers and/or grew over long times through disksecular evolution. but all these mechanisms have to be tested against thederived distribution of bulge intrinsic ellipticities.

1203.1842	flux calibrated emission line imaging of extended sources using  gtc/osiris tunable filters	we investigate the utility of the tunable filters (tfs) for obtaining fluxcalibrated emission line maps of extended objects such as galactic nebulae andnearby galaxies, using the osiris instrument at the 10.4-m gtc. despite arelatively large field of view of osiris (8'x8'), the change in the wavelengthacross the field (~80 ang) and the long-tail of tunable filter (tf) spectralresponse function, are hindrances for obtaining accurate flux calibratedemission-line maps of extended sources. the purpose of this article is todemonstrate that emission-line maps useful for diagnostics of nebula can begenerated over the entire field of view of osiris, if we make use oftheoretically well-understood characteristics of tfs. we have successfullygenerated the flux-calibrated images of the nearby, large late-type spiralgalaxy m101 in the emission lines of halpha, [nii]6583, [sii]6716 and[sii]6731. we find that the present uncertainty in setting the centralwavelength of tfs (~1 ang), is the biggest source of error in the emission-linefluxes. by comparing the halpha fluxes of hii regions in our images with thefluxes derived from halpha images obtained using narrow-band filters, weestimate an error of ~11% in our fluxes. the flux calibration of the images wascarried out by fitting the sdss griz magnitudes of in-frame stars with thestellar spectra from the sdss spectral database. this method resulted in anaccuracy of 3% in flux calibration of any narrow-band image, which is as goodas, if not better, to that is feasible using the observations ofspectrophotometric standard stars. thus time-consuming calibration images neednot be taken. a user-friendly script under the iraf environment was developedand is available on request.

1205.3176	globular cluster systems as tracers of environmental effects on virgo  early-type dwarfs	early-type dwarfs (des) are by far the most abundant galaxy population innearby clusters. whether these objects are primordial, or the recentend-products of the different physical mechanisms that can transform galaxiesonce they enter these high-density environments, is still a matter of debate.here we present a novel approach to test these scenarios by comparing theproperties of the globular cluster systems (gcss) of virgo des and theirpotential progenitors with simple predictions from gravitational andhydrodynamical interaction models. we show that low-mass (mstar &lt; 2e8 msun) deshave gcss consistent with being the descendants of gas-stripped late-typedwarfs. on the other hand, higher mass des have properties -including the highmass specific frequencies of their gcss and their concentrated spatialdistribution within virgo- incompatible with a recent, environmentally-drivenevolution. they mostly comprise nucleated systems, but also des with recentstar formation and/or disc features. bright, nucleated des appear to be apopulation that has long resided within the cluster potential well, but havesurprisingly managed to retain very rich and spatially extended gcss - possiblyan indication of high total masses. our analysis does not favour violentevolutionary mechanisms that result in significant stellar mass losses, butmore gentle processes involving gas removal by a combination of internal andexternal factors, and highlights the relevant role of initial conditions.additionally, we briefly comment on the origin of luminous cluster s0s.

1211.1007	the nature and nurture of bars and disks	the effects that interactions produce on galaxy disks and how they modify thesubsequent formation of bars need to be distinguished to fully understand therelationship between bars and environment. to this aim we derive the barfraction in three different environments ranging from the field to virgo andcoma clusters, covering an unprecedentedly large range of galaxy luminosities(or, equivalently, stellar masses). we confirm that the fraction of barredgalaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity. we also show that thedifference between the bar fraction distributions as a function of galaxyluminosity (and mass) in the field and coma cluster are statisticallysignificant, with virgo being an intermediate case. the fraction of barredgalaxies shows a maximum of about 50% at $m_r\,\simeq\,-20.5$ in clusters,whereas the peak is shifted to $m_r\,\simeq\,-19$ in the field. we interpretthis result as a variation of the effect of environment on bar formationdepending on galaxy luminosity. we speculate that brighter disk galaxies arestable enough against interactions to keep their cold structure, thus, theinteractions are able to trigger bar formation. for fainter galaxies theinteractions become strong enough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formationand even destroying the disks. finally, we point out that the controversyregarding whether the bar fraction depends on environment could be resolved bytaking into account the different luminosity ranges probed by the galaxysamples studied so far.

1211.2802	the impact of galaxy harassment on the globular cluster systems of  early-type cluster dwarf galaxies	the dynamics of globular cluster systems (gcss) around galaxies are oftenused to assess the total enclosed mass, and even to constrain the dark matterdistribution. the globular cluster system of a galaxy is typically assumed tobe in dynamical equilibrium within the potential of the host galaxy. howevercluster galaxies are subjected to a rapidly evolving and, at times, violentlydestructive tidal field. we investigate the impact of the harassment on thedynamics of gcs surrounding early type cluster dwarfs, using numericalsimulations. we find that the dynamical behaviour of the gcs is stronglyinfluenced by the fraction of bound dark matter f_{dm} remaining in the galaxy.only when f_{dm} falls to ~15%, do stars and gcs begin to be stripped. stillthe observed gc velocity dispersion can be used to measure the true enclosedmass to within a factor of 2, even when f_{dm} falls as low as ~3%. this ispossible partly because unbound gcs quickly separate from the galaxy body.however even the distribution of {\it{bound}} gcs may spatially expand by afactor of 2-3. once f_{dm} falls into the &lt;3% regime, the galaxy is close tocomplete disruption, and gcs dynamics can no longer be used to reliablyestimate the enclosed mass. in this regime, the remaining bound gcs mayspatially expand by a factor of 4 to 8. it may be possible to test if a galaxyis in this regime by measuring the dynamics of the stellar disk. we demonstratethat if a stellar disk is rotationally supported, it is likely that a galaxyhas sufficient dark matter, that the dynamics of the gcs can be used toreliably estimate the enclosed mass.

1212.4143	no evidence for a dependence of the mass size relation of early-type  galaxies on environment in the local universe	the early--type galaxy (etg) mass--size relation has been largely studied tounderstand how these galaxies have assembled their mass. one key observationalresult of the last years is that massive galaxies increased their size by afactor of a few at fixed stellar mass from $z\sim2$. hierarchical models favorminor mergers as a plausible driver of this size growth. some of these models,predict a significant environmental dependence in the sense that galaxiesresiding in more massive halos tend to be larger than galaxies in lower masshalos, at fixed stellar mass and redshift. at present, observational results ofthis environmental dependence have been contradictory. in this paper we revisitthis issue in the local universe, by investigating how the sizes of massiveetgs depend on large-scale environment using an updated and accurate sample ofetgs in different environments - field, group, clusters - from the sloandigital sky survey dr7. our analysis does not show any significantenvironmental dependence of the sizes of central and satellites etgs at fixedstellar mass at $z\sim0$. the size-mass relation of early-type galaxies at$z\sim0$ seems to be universal, i.e., independent of the mass of the host haloand of the position of the galaxy in that halo (central or satellite). theresult is robust to different galaxy selections based on star formation,morphology or central density. in fact, considering our observational errorsand the size of the sample, any size ratio larger than $30-40%$ between massivegalaxies ($log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$) living in clusters and in the field can beruled out at $3\sigma$ level.

1301.1686	the relation between bar formation, galaxy luminosity, and environment	we derive the bar fraction in three different environments ranging from thefield to virgo and coma clusters, covering an unprecedentedly large range ofgalaxy luminosities (or, equivalently, stellar masses). we confirm that thefraction of barred galaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity. we also showthat the difference between the bar fraction distributions as a function ofgalaxy luminosity (and mass) in the field and coma cluster are statisticallysignificant, with virgo being an intermediate case. we interpret this result asa variation of the effect of environment on bar formation depending on galaxyluminosity. we speculate that brighter disk galaxies are stable enough againstinteractions to keep their cold structure, thus, the interactions are able totrigger bar formation. for fainter galaxies the interactions become strongenough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formation and even destroying thedisks. finally, we point out that the controversy regarding whether the barfraction depends on environment could be resolved by taking into account thedifferent luminosity ranges of the galaxy samples studied so far.

1304.1644	aperture corrections for disk galaxy properties derived from the califa  survey. balmer emission lines in spiral galaxies	this work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxyproperties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. we focus onsome indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiralgalaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. wehave used 104 spiral galaxies from the califa survey for which 2d spectroscopywith complete spatial coverage is available. from the 3d cubes we have derivedgrowth curves of the most conspicuous balmer emission lines (halpha, hbeta) forcircular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus afterremoving the underlying stellar continuum. we find that the halpha flux(f(halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radiusshowing low dispersion around the median value. from this analysis, we deriveaperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshiftintervals. once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, thef(halpha)/f(hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towardsthe absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. aperturecorrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval[0.3,2.5]r_50. finally, the halpha equivalent width (ew(halpha)) growth curveincreases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion forsmall apertures. this large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperturecorrections for this quantity. in addition, this result suggests thatseparating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed ew(halpha)through small apertures is likely to result in low ew(halpha) star-forminggalaxies begin classified as quiescent.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.5117	the alhambra survey: discovery of a faint qso at z = 5.41	we aim to illustrate the potentiality of the advanced large, homogeneousarea, medium-band redshift astronomical (alhambra) survey to investigate thehigh redshift universe through the detection of quasi stellar objects (qsos) atredshifts larger than 5. the search for z&gt;5 qsos candidates was done by fittingan extensive library of spectral energy distributions --including active andnon-active galaxy templates as well as stars-- to the photometric database ofthe alhambra survey (composed of 20 optical medium-band plus the 3 broad-bandjhks filters). our selection over ~1 square degree of alhambra data (~1/4 ofthe total area covered by the survey), combined with gtc/osiris spectroscopy,has yielded the identification of an optically faint qso at very high redshift(z = 5.41). the qso has an absolute magnitude of ~-24 at the 1450{\aa}continuum, a bolometric luminosity of ~2x10^46 erg/s and an estimated blackhole mass of ~10^8 msolar. this qso adds itself to a reduced number of known uvfaint sources at these redshifts. the preliminary derived space density iscompatible with the most recent determinations of the high-z qso luminosityfunctions (qlf). this new detection shows how alhambra, as well as forthcomingwell designed photometric surveys, can provide a wealth of information on theorigin and early evolution of this kind of objects.

1311.3280	the alhambra survey: evolution of galaxy clustering since $z \sim 1$	we study the clustering of galaxies as function of luminosity and redshift inthe range $0.35 &lt; z &lt; 1.25$ using data from the advanced large homogeneous areamedium band redshift astronomical (alhambra) survey. the alhambra data used inthis work cover $2.38 \mathrm{deg}^2$ in 7 independent fields, after applying adetailed angular selection mask, with accurate photometric redshifts, $\sigma_z\lesssim 0.014 (1+z)$, down to $i_{\rm ab} &lt; 24$. given the depth of thesurvey, we select samples in $b$-band luminosity down to $l^{\rm th} \simeq0.16 l^{*}$ at $z = 0.9$. we measure the real-space clustering using theprojected correlation function, accounting for photometric redshiftsuncertainties. we infer the galaxy bias, and study its evolution withluminosity. we study the effect of sample variance, and confirm earlier resultsthat the cosmos and elais-n1 fields are dominated by the presence of largestructures. for the intermediate and bright samples, $l^{\rm med} \gtrsim0.6l^{*}$, we obtain a strong dependence of bias on luminosity, in agreementwith previous results at similar redshift. we are able to extend this study tofainter luminosities, where we obtain an almost flat relation, similar to thatobserved at low redshift. regarding the evolution of bias with redshift, ourresults suggest that the different galaxy populations studied reside in haloescovering a range in mass between $\log_{10}[m_{\rmh}/(h^{-1}\mathrm{m}_{\odot})] \gtrsim 11.5$ for samples with $l^{\rm med}\simeq 0.3 l^{*}$ and $\log_{10}[m_{\rm h}/(h^{-1}\mathrm{m}_{\odot})] \gtrsim13.0$ for samples with $l^{\rm med} \simeq 2 l^{*}$, with typical occupationnumbers in the range of $\sim 1 - 3$ galaxies per halo.

1311.3941	the effects of spatial resolution on integral field spectrograph surveys  at different redshifts. the califa perspective	over the past decade, 3d optical spectroscopy has become the preferred toolfor understanding the properties of galaxies and is now increasingly used tocarry out galaxy surveys. low redshift surveys include sauron, diskmass,atlas3d, pings and venga. at redshifts above 0.7, surveys such as massiv, sins,glace, and images have targeted the most luminous galaxies to study mainlytheir kinematic properties. the on-going califa survey ($z\sim0.02$) is thefirst of a series of upcoming integral field spectroscopy (ifs) surveys withlarge samples representative of the entire population of galaxies. othersinclude sami and manga at lower redshift and the upcoming kmos surveys athigher redshift. given the importance of spatial scales in ifs surveys, thestudy of the effects of spatial resolution on the recovered parameters becomesimportant. we explore the capability of the califa survey and a hypotheticalhigher redshift survey to reproduce the properties of a sample of objectsobserved with better spatial resolution at lower redshift. using a sample ofpings galaxies, we simulate observations at different redshifts. we then studythe behaviour of different parameters as the spatial resolution degrades withincreasing redshift.

1401.4993	the alhambra survey: an empirical estimation of the cosmic variance for  merger fraction studies based on close pairs	our goal is to estimate empirically, for the first time, the cosmic variancethat affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. we compute themerger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc &lt;= rp &lt;=50h^-1 kpc and dv &lt;= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of thealhambra survey. we study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v asthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. we develop a maximumlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion dueto the observational errors (including the poisson shot noise term). the cosmicvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of thepopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume v_c. we find asignificant dependence on neither the search radius used to define closecompanions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellarmass) of the samples. we provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance withn_1, n_2, and v_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} v_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on closepairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

1403.0588	fossil groups origins iii. characterization of the sample and  observational properties of fossil systems	(abridged) fossil systems are group- or cluster-sized objects whoseluminosity is dominated by a very massive central galaxy. in the current colddark matter scenario, these objects formed hierarchically at an early epoch ofthe universe and then slowly evolved until present day. that is the reason whythey are called {\it fossils}. we started an extensive observational program tocharacterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range ofphysical properties. deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate andoptical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\sim$ 1200 galaxies. thisnew dataset was completed with sdss dr7 archival data to obtain robust clustermembership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. for eachsystem, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies($\delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\delta m_{14}$)within 0.5 $r_{{\rm 200}}$. we consider fossil systems those with $\deltam_{12} \ge 2$ mag or $\delta m_{14} \ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. we findthat 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. their observationalproperties agree with those of non-fossil systems. both follow the samecorrelations, but fossils are always extreme cases. in particular, they hostthe brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosedin the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. finally,we confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. combining our results withothers in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systemsformed due to mergers of $l^\ast$ galaxies. the large magnitude gap is aconsequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore itis an evolutionary effect. moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate inour sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.

1403.0590	fossil groups origins iii. the relation between optical and x-ray  luminosities	this study is part of the fossil groups origin (fogo) project which aims atcarrying out a systematic and multiwavelength study of a large sample of fossilsystems. here we focus on the relation between the optical luminosity (lopt)and x-ray luminosity (lx). out of a sample of 28 candidate fossil systems, weconsider a sample of 12 systems whose fossil classification has been confirmedby a companion study. they are compared with the complementary sample of 16systems whose fossil nature is not confirmed and with a subsample of 102 galaxysystems from the rass-sdss galaxy cluster survey. fossil and normal systemsspan the same redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 and have the same lx distribution. foreach fossil system, the lx in the 0.1-2.4 kev band is computed using data fromthe rosat all sky survey. for each fossil and normal system we homogeneouslycompute lopt in the r-band within the characteristic cluster radius, using datafrom the sdss dr7. we sample the lx-lopt relation over two orders of magnitudein lx. our analysis shows that fossil systems are not statisticallydistinguishable from the normal systems both through the 2d ks test and the fitof the lx-lopt relation. the optical luminosity of the galaxy system doesstrongly correlate with the x-ray luminosity of the hot gas component,independently of whether the system is fossil or not. we conclude that ourresults are consistent with the classical "merging scenario" of the brightestgalaxy formed via merger/cannibalism of other group galaxies, with conservationof the optical light. we find no evidence for a peculiar state of the hotintracluster medium.

1405.5222	kinematic alignment of non-interacting califa galaxies: quantifying the  impact of bars on stellar and ionised gas velocity field orientations	we present 80 stellar and ionised gas velocity maps from the calar altolegacy integral field area (califa) survey in order to characterize thekinematic orientation of non-interacting galaxies. the study of galaxies inisolation is a key step towards understanding how fast-external processes, suchas major mergers, affect kinematic properties in galaxies. we derived theglobal and individual (projected approaching and receding sides) kinematicposition angles (pas) for both the stellar and ionised gas line-of-sightvelocity distributions. when compared to the photometric pa, we find thatmorpho-kinematic differences are smaller than 22 degrees in 90% of the samplefor both components; internal kinematic misalignments are generally smallerthan 16 degrees. we find a tight relation between the global stellar andionised gas kinematic pa consistent with circular-flow pattern motions in bothcomponents. this relation also holds generally in barred galaxies across thebar and galaxy disk scales. our findings suggest that even in the presence ofstrong bars, both the stellar and the gaseous components tend to follow thegravitational potential of the disk. as a result, kinematic orientation can beused to assess the degree of external distortions in interacting galaxies.

1407.1841	deep spectroscopic luminosity function of abell 85: no evidence for a  steep upturn of the faint-end slope	we present a new deep determination of the spectroscopic lf within the virialradius of the nearby and massive abell\,85 (a85) cluster down to the dwarfregime (m* + 6) using vlt/vimos spectra for $\sim 2000$ galaxies with m$_r \leq21$ mag and $\langle \mu_{e,r} \rangle \leq 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. theresulting lf from 438 cluster members is best modelled by a double schechterfunction due to the presence of a statistically significant upturn at thefaint-end. the amplitude of this upturn ($\alpha_{f} = -1.58^{+0.19}_{-0.15}$),however, is much smaller than that of the sdss composite photometric cluster lfby popesso et al. 2006, $\alpha_{f} \sim$ -2. the faint-end slope of the lf ina85 is consistent, within the uncertainties, with that of the field. the redgalaxy population dominates the lf at low luminosities, and is the mainresponsible for the upturn. the fact that the slopes of the spectroscopic lfsin the field and in a cluster as massive as a85 are similar suggests that thecluster environment does not play a major role in determining the abundance oflow-mass galaxies.

1407.2939	califa: a diameter-selected sample for an integral field spectroscopy  galaxy survey	we describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties ofthe galaxy sample used by the calar alto legacy integral field area survey(califa), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral fieldspectroscopy. the califa "mother sample" was selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) dr7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with anr-band isophotal major axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 &lt; z&lt; 0.03. the mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observedin the course of the califa survey. the selection of targets for observationsis based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of themother sample. by comparison with a large set of sdss galaxies, we find thatthe califa sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19&gt; mr &gt; -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4msun. inparticular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to anysignificant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or smallgalaxies. only below luminosities of mr = -19 (or stellar masses &lt; 10^9.7msun)is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially ofnearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form &lt; 10% of the fullsample. we estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities andsizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimatesfrom the full sdss when accounting for large-scale structure. we also present anumber of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the califasample. we explore different ways of characterizing the environments of califagalaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from thefield to genuine clusters. we finally consider the expected incidence of activegalactic nuclei among califa galaxies.

1408.5765	ionized gas kinematics of galaxies in the califa survey i: velocity  fields, kinematic parameters of the dominant component, and presence of  kinematically distinct gaseous systems	this work provides an overall characterization of the kinematic behavior ofthe ionized gas of the galaxies included in the calar alto legacy integralfield area (califa), offering kinematic clues to potential users of this surveyfor including kinematical criteria for specific studies. from the first 200galaxies observed by califa, we present the 2d kinematic view of the 177galaxies satisfying a gas detection threshold. after removing the stellarcontribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radialvelocity of the dominant gaseous component. the main kinematic parameters weredirectly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internalmotions. evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with differentkinematics were detected by using [oiii] profiles. most objects in the sampleshow regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarelyconsistent with simple coplanar circular motions. 35% of the objects presentevidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers largerthan the original spaxel radii. only 17% of the objects in the sample exhibitkinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of thevelocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclearactivity. early-type galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematicmisaligments. there is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profilessuggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components atdifferent distances from the nucleus. this work constitutes the firstdetermination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in thecalifa survey. the derived velocity fields, the reported kinematicpeculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseouscomponents might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies forspecific studies.

1409.1142	the alhambra survey: accurate merger fractions by pdf analysis of  photometric close pairs	our goal is to develop and test a novel methodology to compute accurate closepair fractions with photometric redshifts. we improve the current methodologiesto estimate the merger fraction f_m from photometric redshifts by (i) using thefull probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the sources in redshiftspace, (ii) including the variation in the luminosity of the sources with z inboth the selection of the samples and in the luminosity ratio constrain, and(iii) splitting individual pdfs into red and blue spectral templates to dealrobustly with colour selections. we test the performance of our new methodologywith the pdfs provided by the alhambra photometric survey. the merger fractionsand rates from the alhambra survey are in excellent agreement with those fromspectroscopic work, both for the general population and for red and bluegalaxies. with the merger rate of bright (m_b &lt;= -20 - 1.1z) galaxies evolvingas (1+z)^n, the power-law index n is larger for blue galaxies (n = 2.7 +- 0.5)than for red galaxies (n = 1.3 +- 0.4), confirming previous results.integrating the merger rate over cosmic time, we find that the average numberof mergers per galaxy since z = 1 is n_m = 0.57 +- 0.05 for red galaxies andn_m = 0.26 +- 0.02 for blue galaxies. our new methodology exploitsstatistically all the available information provided by photometric redshiftcodes and provides accurate measurements of the merger fraction by close pairsonly using photometric redshifts. current and future photometric surveys willbenefit of this new methodology.

1409.2876	secular- and merger-built bulges in barred galaxies	(abridged) we study the incidence, as well as the nature, of composite bulgesin a sample of 10 face-on barred galaxies to constrain the formation andevolutionary processes of the central regions of disk galaxies. we analyze themorphological, photometric, and kinematic properties of each bulge. then, byusing a case-by-case analysis we identify composite bulges and classify everycomponent into a classical or pseudobulge. in addition, bar-related boxy/peanut(b/p) structures were also identified and characterised. we find only threegalaxies hosting a single-component bulge (two pseudobulges and one classicalbulge). we find evidence of composite bulges coming in two main types based ontheir formation: secular-built and merger- and secular-built. we callsecular-built to composite bulges made of entirely by structures associatedwith secular processes such as pseudo bulges, central disks, or b/p bulges. wefind four composite bulges of this kind in our sample. on the other hand,merger- and secular-built bulges are those where structures with differentformation paths coexist within the same galaxy, i.e., a classical bulgecoexisting with a secular-built structure (pseudobulge, central disk, or b/p).three bulges of this kind were found in the sample. we remark on the importanceof detecting kinematic structures such as sigma-drops to identify compositebulges. a large fraction (80%) of galaxies were found to host sigma-drops orsigma-plateaus in our sample revealing their high incidence in barred galaxies.the high frequency of composite bulges in barred galaxies points towards acomplex formation and evolutionary scenario. moreover, the evidence forcoexisting merger- and secular-built bulges reinforce this idea. we discuss howthe presence of different bulge types, with different formation histories andtimescales, can constrain current models of bulge formation.

1501.05498	bar pattern speeds in califa galaxies: i. fast bars across the hubble  sequence	the bar pattern speed ($\omega_{\rm b}$) is defined as the rotationalfrequency of the bar, and it determines the bar dynamics. several methods havebeen proposed for measuring $\omega_{\rm b}$. the non-parametric methodproposed by tremaine \&amp; weinberg (1984; tw) and based on stellar kinematics isthe most accurate. this method has been applied so far to 17 galaxies, most ofthem sb0 and sba types. we have applied the tw method to a new sample of 15strong and bright barred galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological typesfrom sb0 to sbbc. combining our analysis with previous studies, we investigate32 barred galaxies with their pattern speed measured by the tw method. theresulting total sample of barred galaxies allows us to study the dependence of$\omega_{\rm b}$ on galaxy properties, such as the hubble type. we measured$\omega_{\rm b}$ using the tw method on the stellar velocity maps provided bythe integral-field spectroscopy data from the califa survey. integral-fielddata solve the problems that long-slit data present when applying the twmethod, resulting in the determination of more accurate $\omega_{\rm b}$. inaddition, we have also derived the ratio $\cal{r}$ of the corotation radius tothe bar length of the galaxies. according to this parameter, bars can beclassified as fast ($\cal{r}$ $&lt; 1.4$) and slow ($\cal{r}$&gt;1.4). for all thegalaxies, $\cal{r}$ is compatible within the errors with fast bars. we cannotrule out (at 95$\%$ level) the fast bar solution for any galaxy. we have notobserved any significant trend between $\cal{r}$ and the galaxy morphologicaltype. our results indicate that independent of the hubble type, bars have beenformed and then evolve as fast rotators. this observational result willconstrain the scenarios of formation and evolution of bars proposed bynumerical simulations.

1504.02232	on the morphology of dust lanes in galactic bars	the aim of our study is to use dynamical simulations to explore the influenceof two important dynamical bar parameters, bar strength and bar pattern speed,on the shape of the bar dust lanes. to quantify the shape of the dust lanes wehave developed a new systematic method to measure the dust lane curvature.previous numerical simulations have compared the curvature of bar dust laneswith the bar strength, predicting a relation between both parameters which hasbeen supported by observational studies but with a large spread. we take intoaccount the bar pattern speed to explore, simultaneously, the effect of bothparameters on the dust lane shape. to that end, we separate our galactic barsin fast bars $\left(1 &lt; \mathcal{r} &lt; 1.4 \right)$ and slow bars$\left(\mathcal{r} &gt; 1.4 \right)$, obtaining, as previous simulations, aninverse relation between the dust lane curvature and the bar strength for fastbars. for the first time, we extend the study to slow bars, finding a constantcurvature as a function of the bar strength. as a result, we conclude that weakbars with straight dust lanes are candidates for slow bars. finally, we haveanalysed a pilot sample of ten s$^4$g galaxies, obtaining dust lane curvatureslying within the range covered by the simulations.

1506.03819	tracing kinematic (mis)alignments in califa merging galaxies: stellar  and ionized gas kinematic orientations at every merger stage	we present spatially resolved stellar and/or ionized gas kinematic propertiesfor a sample of 103 interacting galaxies, tracing all merger stages: closecompanions, pairs with morphological signatures of interaction, and coalescedmerger remnants. we compare our sample with 80 non-interacting galaxies. wemeasure for the stellar and the ionized gas components the major (projected)kinematic position angles (pa$_{\mathrm{kin}}$, approaching and receding)directly from the velocity fields with no assumptions on the internal motions.this method allow us to derive the deviations of the kinematic pas from astraight line ($\delta$pa$_{\mathrm{kin}}$). around half of the interactingobjects show morpho-kinematic pa misalignments that cannot be found in thecontrol sample. those misalignments are present mostly in galaxies withmorphological signatures of interaction. alignment between the kinematic sidesfor both samples is similar, with most of the galaxies displaying smallmisalignments. radial deviations of the kinematic pa from a straight line inthe stellar component measured by $\delta$pa$_{\mathrm{kin}}$ are large forboth samples. however, for a large fraction of interacting galaxies the ionizedgas $\delta$pa$_{\mathrm{kin}}$ is larger than typical values derived fromisolated galaxies (48%), making this parameter a good indicator to trace theimpact of interaction and mergers in the internal motions of galaxies. bycomparing the stellar and ionized gas kinematic pa, we find that 42% (28/66) ofthe interacting galaxies have misalignments larger than 16 degrees, compared to10% from the control sample. our results show the impact of interactions in theinternal structure of galaxies as well as the wide variety of their velocitydistributions. this study also provides a local universe benchmark forkinematic studies in merging galaxies at high redshift.

1506.04157	the califa survey across the hubble sequence: spatially resolved stellar  population properties in galaxies	this paper characterizes the radial structure of stellar populationproperties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on 300 galaxies from thecalifa survey. the sample covers a wide range of hubble types, and galaxystellar mass. we apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellarmass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, andmass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our targetgalaxies. to study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individualradial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. we confirm thatmore massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and lessreddened by dust. additionally, we find that these trends are preservedspatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. deviations from theserelations appear correlated with hubble type: earlier types are more compact,older, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching isrelated to morphology, but not driven by mass. negative gradients of ages areconsistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest agesgradients in sb-sbc galaxies. further, the mean stellar ages of disks andbulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late typespirals hosting younger disks. the gradients in stellar mass surface densitydepend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are morecentrally concentrated. there is a secondary correlation in the sense that atthe same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. we find mildlynegative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxyevolution in isolation. the largest gradients occur in sb galaxies. overall weconclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass,while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependentprocesses.

1507.05846	the impact from survey depth and resolution on the morphological  classification of galaxies	we consistently analyse for the first time the impact of survey depth andspatial resolution on the most used morphological parameters for classifyinggalaxies through non-parametric methods: abraham and conselice-bershadyconcentration indices, gini, m20 moment of light, asymmetry, and smoothness.three different non-local datasets are used, alhambra and sxds (examples ofdeep ground-based surveys), and cosmos (deep space-based survey). we used asample of 3000 local, visually classified galaxies, measuring theirmorphological parameters at their real redshifts (z ~ 0). then we simulatedthem to match the redshift and magnitude distributions of galaxies in thenon-local surveys. the comparisons of the two sets allow to put constraints onthe use of each parameter for morphological classification and evaluate theeffectiveness of the commonly used morphological diagnostic diagrams. allanalysed parameters suffer from biases related to spatial resolution and depth,the impact of the former being much stronger. when including asymmetry andsmoothness in classification diagrams, the noise effects must be taken intoaccount carefully, especially for ground-based surveys. m20 is significantlyaffected, changing both the shape and range of its distribution at allbrightness levels.we suggest that diagnostic diagrams based on 2 - 3 parametersshould be avoided when classifying galaxies in ground-based surveys,independently of their brightness; for cosmos they should be avoided forgalaxies fainter than f814 = 23.0. these results can be applied directly tosurveys similar to alhambra, sxds and cosmos, and also can serve as anupper/lower limit for shallower/deeper ones.

1508.02861	the alhambra survey : estimation of the clustering signal encoded in the  cosmic variance	the relative cosmic variance ($\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source ofuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cellstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and theirunderlying dark-matter distribution. our goal is to test the significance ofthe clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the alhambrasurvey. we measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selectedwith $b-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z &lt; 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion inthe number density distribution derived from the 48 alhambra subfields. wecompare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the darkmatter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. this provides anestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. the galaxy bias from the cosmic variance isin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlationfunction analysis in alhambra. this holds for different redshift bins, for redand blue subsamples, and for several $b-$band luminosity selections. we findthat $b$ increases with the $b-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expectedfrom previous work. moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than bluegalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. our resultsdemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in alhambra is due to theclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affectingpencil-beam surveys. in addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxybias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

0805.4232	the bright galaxy population of five medium redshift clusters. i.  color-magnitude relation, blue fractions and visual morphology	using data of five clusters of galaxies within the redshift range 0.15 $\leq$z $\leq$ 0.25, imaged with the nordic optical telescope (not) in the central$\approx$ 1 mpc$^2$ in very good seeing conditions, we have performed anexhaustive inspection of their bright galaxy population. that range ofredshift, where only a small amount of data with the required resolution andquality is available, is particularly important for the understanding of theformation and evolution of clusters of galaxies. we have inspected thecolor-magnitude relation (cmr) for those clusters and measured the bluefraction of galaxies in their cores to check for evidence of evolution as foundin other works. moreover, the visual classification of the galaxy morphologyhas been performed and the morphology-radius relation has been examined we havenot found signs of evolution neither in the slope of the cmr nor in the bluefraction of galaxies. a diversity of situations regarding those parameters andin the morphological mixing has been noticed, with two out of five clusterscontaining a dominant late-type core population. the cluster a1878 stands outas some of its properties differ from those of the other clusters in thesample.  no clear signs of evolution appear in our analysis. the data support the viewthat the morphology and the stellar content of the galaxies in our clustershave been already settled at z $\sim$ 0.2. only the fraction of interactinggalaxies in the clusters appear to be larger than in clusters like comaalthough the number of clusters in the sample is small to give a definitiveconclusion.

1511.02854	fossil group origins vii. galaxy substructures in fossil systems	fossil groups are expected to be the final product of galaxy merging withingalaxy groups. in simulations, they are predicted to assemble their mass athigh redshift. this early formation allows for the innermost $m^\ast$ galaxiesto merge into a massive central galaxy. then, they are expected to maintaintheir fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scalestructure. in this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightestgalaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status.as a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamicallyrelaxed. in order to examine the dynamical status of these systems, wesystematically analyze, for the first time, the presence of galaxysubstructures in a sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems withredshift $z \le 0.25$. we apply a number of tests in order to investigate thesubstructure in fossil systems in the two-dimensional space of projectedpositions out to $r_{200}$. moreover, for a subsample of 5 systems with atleast 30 spectroscopically-confirmed members we also analyze the substructurein the velocity and in the three-dimensional velocity-position spaces.additionally, we look for signs of recent mergers in the regions around thecentral galaxies. we find that an important fraction of fossil systems showsubstructure. the fraction depends critically on the adopted test, since eachtest is more sensible to a particular type of substructure. our interpretationof the results is that fossil systems are not, in general, as relaxed asexpected from simulations. our sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossilsystems need to be extended in order to compute an accurate fraction, but ourconclusion is that it is similar to the fraction of substructure detected innon-fossil clusters. this abstract is truncated.

1512.06153	molecular gas in low-metallicity starburst galaxies: scaling relations  and the co-to-h$_2$ conversion factor	we study the molecular content and the star formation efficiency of 21 bluecompact dwarfs (bcds). we present co(1-0) and (2-1) observations, furthersupplemented with additional co measurements and multiwavelength ancillary datafrom the literature. we find the co luminosity to be correlated with thestellar and hi masses, sfr tracers, the size of the starburst and itsmetallicity. bcds appear offset from the schmidt-kennicutt (sk) law, showingextremely low ($\lesssim$0.1 gyr) h2 and h2+hi depletion timescales. thedeparture from the sk law is smaller when considering h2+hi rather than h2only, and is larger for bcds with lower metallicity and higher specific sfr.thus, the molecular fraction and h2 depletion timescale of bcds is found to bestrongly correlated with metallicity. using this and assuming that theempirical correlation found between the specific sfr and galaxy-averaged h2depletion timescale of more metal-rich galaxies extends to lower masses, wederive a metallicity-dependent co-to-h2 conversion factor $\alpha_{co, z}\propto (z/z_{\odot})^{-y}$, with $y=1.5(\pm 0.3)$ in qualitative agreementwith previous determinations, dust-based measurements, and recent modelpredictions. our results suggest that in vigorously star-forming dwarfs thefraction of h2 traced by co decreases by a factor of about 40 from $z \simz_{\odot}$ to $z \sim 0.1 z_{\odot}$, leading to a strong underestimation ofthe h2 mass in metal-poor systems when a galactic $\alpha_{co, mw}$ isconsidered. adopting $\alpha_{co, z}$ we find that departures from the sk laware partially resolved. our results suggest that starbursting dwarfs haveshorter depletion gas timescales and lower molecular fractions compared tonormal late-type disc galaxies even accounting for the molecular gas not tracedby co emission in metal-poor environments, raising additional constraints tomodel predictions (abridged).

astro-ph;0104311	quantitative morphology of the intermediate-redshift galaxy cluster  abell 2443 from ground-based imaging -- evidence for a galaxy concentration  index correlation with cluster density	we present broad-band photometry and provide a quantitative analysis of thestructure of galaxies in the inner region of the abell cluster 2443 (z~0.1).the galaxy parameters have been derived by fitting a two-component model(sersic r^{1/n} bulge and exponential disk) to a magnitude-limited sample.using a new method of analysis which takes into account the effects of seeingon the structural parameters and considers the ellipticity as an activeparameter, we avoid systematic errors arising from assumptions of circularsymmetry. 76% of the sample galaxies were classified with these models, therest were morphologically peculiar. for the spiral galaxies, the relationbetween n and b/d is consistent with the trend observed in nearby field galaxysamples. the sersic index n (which can be considered as a concentration index)of the elliptical galaxies is correlated with the local surface density of thecluster. monte carlo simulations were used to check the reliability of themethod and determine the magnitude selection criteria.

astro-ph;0110522	intracluster planetary nebulae in virgo: photometric selection,  spectroscopic validation and cluster depth	we have imaged an empty area of 34'x34' one and a half degree north of thevirgo cluster core to survey for intracluster planetary nebula candidates. wehave implemented and tested a fully automatic procedure for the selection ofemission line objects in wide-field images, based on the on-off technique fromciardullo and jacoby. freeman et al. have spectroscopically confirmed a sampleof intracluster planetary nebulae in one virgo field. we use the photometricand morphological properties of this sample to test our selection procedure. inour newly surveyed virgo field, 75 objects were identified as best candidatesfor intracluster pne.  the luminosity function of the spectroscopically confirmed pne shows abrighter cut-off than the planetary nebula luminosity function for the innerregions of m87. such a brighter cut-off is also observed in the newly surveyedfield and indicates a smaller distance modulus, implying that the front end ofthe virgo cluster is closer to us by a significant amount: 14% closer (2.1 mpc)than m87 for the spectroscopic field, using the pn luminosity function distanceof 14.9 mpc to m87, and 19% closer (2.8 mpc) than m87 for the newly surveyedfield. independent distance indicators (tully-fisher relation for virgo spiralsand surface brightness fluctuations for virgo ellipticals) agree with thesefindings.  from these two virgo cluster fields there is no evidence that the surfaceluminosity density for the diffuse stellar component in the cluster decreaseswith radius. the luminosity surface density of the diffuse stellar populationis comparable to that of the galaxies.

astro-ph;0201485	triaxial stellar systems following the r^{1/n} luminosity law: an  analytical mass-density expression, gravitational torques and the bulge/disc  interplay	we have investigated the structural and dynamical properties of triaxialstellar systems whose surface brightness profiles follow the r^{1/n} luminositylaw - extending the analysis of ciotti (1991) who explored the properties ofspherical r^{1/n} systems. a new `analytical' expression that accuratelyreproduces the spatial (i.e. deprojected) luminosity density profiles (error &lt;0.1%) is presented for detailed modelling of the sersic family of luminosityprofiles. we evaluate both the symmetric and the non--axisymmetric componentsof the gravitational potential and force, and compute the torques as a functionof position. for a given triaxiality, stellar systems with smaller values of nhave a greater non-axisymmetric gravitational field component. we also explorethe strength of the non-axisymmetric forces produced by bulges with differing nand triaxiality on systems having a range of bulge-to-disc ratios. theincreasing disc-to-bulge ratio with increasing galaxy type (decreasing n) isfound to heavily reduce the amplitude of the non-axisymmetric terms, andtherefore reduce the possibility that triaxial bulges in late-type systems maybe the mechanism or perturbation for nonsymmetric structures in the disc. usingseeing-convolved r^{1/n}-bulge plus exponential-disc fits to the k-band datafrom a sample of 80 nearby disc galaxies, we probe the relations between galaxytype, sersic index n and the bulge-to-disc luminosity ratio. these relationsare shown to be primarily a consequence of the relation between n and the totalbulge luminosity. in the k-band, the trend of decreasing bulge-to-discluminosity ratio along the spiral hubble sequence is predominantly, althoughnot entirely, a consequence of the change in the total bulge luminosity; thetrend between the total disc luminosity and hubble type is much weaker.

astro-ph;0310527	quantitative morphology of galaxies in the core of the coma cluster	we present a quantitative morphological analysis of 187 galaxies in a regioncovering the central 0.28 square degrees of the coma cluster. structuralparameters from the best-fitting sersic r^{1/n} bulge plus, where appropriate,exponential disc model, are tabulated here. this sample is complete down to amagnitude of r=17 mag. by examining the edwards et al. (2002) compilation ofgalaxy redshifts in the direction of coma, we find that 163 of the 187 galaxiesare coma cluster members, and the rest are foreground and background objects.for the coma cluster members, we have studied differences in the structural andkinematic properties between early- and late-type galaxies, and between thedwarf and giant galaxies. analysis of the elliptical galaxies revealscorrelations among the structural parameters similar to those previously foundin the virgo and fornax clusters. comparing the structural properties of thecoma cluster disc galaxies with disc galaxies in the field, we find evidencefor an environmental dependence: the scale lengths of the disc galaxies in comaare 30% smaller. a kinematical analysis shows marginal differences between thevelocity distributions of ellipticals with sersic index n&lt;2 (dwarfs) and thosewith n&gt;2 (giants); the dwarf galaxies having a greater (cluster) velocitydispersion. finally, our analysis of all 421 background galaxies reveals anon-uniform distribution in redshift with contrasts in density ~3,characterized by a void extending from ~10,000 to ~20,000 km s^{-1}, and twodense and extended structures centred at ~20,000 and ~47,000 km s^{-1}.

astro-ph;0502420	intracluster stars in the virgo cluster core	we have investigated the properties of the diffuse light in the virgo clustercore region, based on the detection of intracluster planetary nebulae (pne) infour fields. we eliminate the bias from misclassified faint continuum objects,using improved monte carlo simulations, and the contaminations by high redshiftly$\alpha$ galaxies, using the ly$\alpha$ luminosity function in blank fields.recent spectroscopic observations confirm that our photometric pn samples arewell-understood. we find that the diffuse stellar population in the virgo coreregion is inhomogeneous on scales of 30'-90': there exist significantfield-to-field variations in the number density of pne and the inferred amountof intracluster light, with some empty fields, some fields dominated byextended virgo galaxy halos, and some fields dominated by the true intraclustercomponent. there is no clear trend with distance from m87. the mean surfaceluminosity density, its rms variation, and the mean surface brightness ofdiffuse light in our 4 fields are $\sigma_b = 2.7 x 10^{6}$ l$_{b\odot}$arcmin$^{-2}$, ${rms} = 2.1 \times 10^{6}$ l$_{b\odot}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, and$\bar{\mu}_{b}=29.0$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ respectively. our results indicate thatthe virgo cluster is a dynamically young environment, and that the intraclustercomponent is associated at least partially with local physical processes likegalaxy interactions or harassment. we also argue, based on kinematic evidence,that the so-called 'over-luminous' pne in the halo of m84 are dynamicallyassociated with this galaxy, and must thus be brighter than and part of adifferent stellar population from the normal pn population in ellipticalgalaxies.

0811.2228	on the origin of dwarf elliptical galaxies: the fundamental plane	early-type dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxies observed inthe universe. the origin of this kind of systems is still not well understood.the aim of this paper is to investigate whether the different locations ofdwarf galaxies with respect to ellipticals in the face-on view of thefundamental plane could be due to the transformation of bright disc galaxies inlow-mass systems by harassment. we have run high-resolution n-body numericalsimulations to test the tidal stripping scenario of the de galaxies. thepresent simulations modelled several individual tidal stripping events oninitial disc-like galaxy models with different bulge-to-disc mass ratios. tidalstripping is a very efficient mechanism for removing stars and dark matterparticles from galaxies. the particles of the disc and halo components wereeasily stripped, while the bulge not. thus, the scale length of the discs were40-50% shorter than the initial ones. prograde tidal interactions create tidalfeatures like stable bars in the discs of the galaxies. after several tidalinteractions the galaxy remnants looks like a dwarf spheroidal system.simulated galaxies with initial large b/d ratios are closer to the face-on viewof the fundamental plane defined by bright e and bulges of early-type galaxies.nevertheless, galaxies with initial small b/d ratio are located, after fourfast tidal encounters, at the position of de galaxies in the face-on view ofthe fundamental plane. we conclude that fast galaxy-galaxy interactions areefficient mechanisms for transforming bright galaxies in dwarf ones. indeed,the different location observed between es and des in the face-on view of thefundamental plane can be explained by the formation of dwarf galaxies byharassment of late-type bright ones.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
