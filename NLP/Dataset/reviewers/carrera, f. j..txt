0904.3024	high-precision multi-band measurements of the angular clustering of  x-ray sources	in this paper we present the two-point angular correlation function of thex-ray source population of 1063 xmm-newton observations at high galacticlatitudes, comprising up to ~30000 sources over a sky area of 125.5 sq. deg, inthree energy bands: 0.5-2 (soft), 2-10 (hard), and 4.5-10 (ultrahard) kev. wehave measured the angular clustering of our survey and find significantpositive clustering signals in the soft and hard bands, and a marginalclustering detection in the ultrahard band. we find dependency of theclustering strength on the flux limit and no significant differences in theclustering properties between sources with high hardness ratios and those withlow hardness ratios. our results show that obscured and unobscured objectsshare similar clustering properties and therefore they both reside in similarenvironments, in agreement with the unified model of agn. we deprojected theangular clustering parameters via limber's equation to compute their typicalspatial lengths. from that we have inferred the typical mass of the dark matterhaloes in which agn at redshifts of ~1 are embedded. the short agn lifetimesderived suggest that agn activity might be a transient phase that can beexperienced several times by a large fraction of galaxies throughout theirlives.

0905.4439	the bolometric luminosity of type 2 agn from extinction-corrected  [oiii]: no evidence for eddington-limited sources	there have been recent claims that a significant fraction of type 2 agnaccrete close or even above the eddington limit. in type 2 agn the bolometricluminosity (l_b) is generally inferred from the [oiii] emission line luminosity(l_oiii). the key issue, in order to estimate the bolometric luminosity inthese agn, is therefore to know the bolometric correction to be applied tol_oiii. a complication arises from the fact that the observed l_oiii isaffected by extinction, likely due to dust within the narrow line region. theextinction-corrected [oiii] luminosity (l^c_oiii) is a better estimator of thenuclear luminosity than l_oiii. however, so far only the bolometric correctionto be applied to the uncorrected l_oiii has been evaluated. this paper isdevoted to estimate the bolometric correction c_oiii=l_b/l^c_oiii in order toderive the eddington ratios for the type 2 agn in a sample of sdss objects. wehave collected from the literature 61 sources with reliable estimate of bothl^c_oiii and x-ray luminosities (l_x). to estimate c_oiii, we combined theobserved correlation between l^c_oiii and l_x with the x-ray bolometriccorrection. we found, contrary to previous studies, a linear correlationbetween l^c_oiii and l_x. we estimated c_oiii using the luminosity-dependentx-ray bolometric correction of marconi et al. (2004), and we found a mean valueof c_oiii in the luminosity ranges log l_oiii=38-40, 40-42, and 42-44 of 87,142 and 454 respectively. we used it to calculate the eddington ratiodistribution of type 2 sdss agn at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.4 and we found that these sourcesare not accreting near their eddington limit, contrary to previous claims.

0906.1974	unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies: the case of "naked" agn	hawkins (2004) reported on a class of "naked" agn characterized by strongamplitude optical brightness variability and the complete absence of broademission lines in the optical spectrum. the variability suggests that thenucleus is seen directly, however the absence of broad lines contradicts thesimple formulation of unified models for agn. we present the results ofquasi-simultaneous spectroscopic observations with xmm-newton and ntt (lasilla) of two "naked" agn. we confirm the "naked" nature of q2131-427 for whichno broad emission line components have been detected in the optical spectrumand its x-ray spectrum shows no signs of intrinsic absorption. the optical andx-ray mismatch in this source cannot be ascribed to a high nuclear dust-to-gasratio and a compton thick nature is ruled out on the basis of the highf(x)/f([oiii]) ratio. the broad line region (blr) may be completely absent inthis source, possibly as a consequence of its low eddington ratio. on the otherhand, the optical spectrum of q2130-431 shows h(alpha) and h(beta) broademission line components, revealing the presence of a blr. a mild x-rayabsorption is expected in intermediate type 1.8 seyfert galaxies likeq2130-431, however we put a very low upper limit on the column density (&lt; 2 x10^(20) cm^(-2)), also the low balmer decrement suggests that the blr itselfdoes not suffer from reddening. we propose that in this object the blr isintrinsically weak, making a case of "true" intermediate seyfert galaxy. wealso report on the x-ray detection of the abell 3783 galaxy cluster in thexmm-newton field-of-view of the q2131-427 observation.

0912.2965	the xmm-newton wide angle survey (xwas): the x-ray spectrum of type-1  agn	we discuss the broad band x-ray properties of one of the largest samples ofx-ray selected type-1 agn to date (487 objects in total), drawn from thexmm-newton wide angle survey. the objects cover 2-10 kev luminosities from~10^{42}-10^{45} erg s^{-1} and are detected up to redshift ~4. we constrainthe overall properties of the broad band continuum, soft excess and x-rayabsorption, along with their dependence on the x-ray luminosity and redshiftand we discuss the implications for models of agn emission. we constrained themean spectral index of the broad band x-ray continuum to &lt;gamma&gt;=1.96+-0.02with intrinsic dispersion sigma=0.27_{-0.02}^{+0.01}. the continuum becomesharder at faint fluxes and at higher redshifts and luminosities. the dependenceof gamma with flux is likely due to undetected absorption rather than tospectral variation. we found a strong dependence of the detection efficiency ofobjects on the spectral shape which can have a strong impact on the measuredmean continuum shapes of sources at different redshifts and luminosities. wedetected excess absorption in ~3% of our objects, with column densities ~a fewx10^{22} cm^{-2}. the apparent mismatch between the optical classification andx-ray properties of these objects is a challenge for the standard agnunification model. we found that the fraction of objects with detected softexcess is ~36%. using a thermal model, we constrained the soft excess meantemperature and intrinsic dispersion to &lt;kt&gt;~100 ev and sigma~34 ev. the originof the soft excess as thermal emission from the accretion disk or comptonscattered disk emission is ruled out on the basis of the temperatures detectedand the lack of correlation of the measured temperature with the x-rayluminosity (abridged).

1002.0723	a revision of the x-ray absorption nature of the balqsos	broad absorption line quasars (balqsos) are key objects for studying thestructure and emission/absorption properties of agn. however, despite theirfundamental importance, the properties of balqsos are still not wellunderstood. in order to investigate the x-ray nature of these sources, as wellas the correlations between x-ray and rest-frame uv properties, we compile alarge sample of 88 balqsos observed by xmm-newton. we performed a full x-rayspectral analysis on a sample of 39 sources with higher x-ray spectral quality,and an approximate hr analysis on the remaining sources. using availableoptical spectra, we calculate the balnicity index and investigate thedependence between this optical parameter and different x-ray properties.  using the neutral absorption model, we found that 36% of our balqsos have nh&lt; 5x10^21 cm^-2, lower than the expected x-ray absorption for such objects.however, when we used a physically-motivated model for the x-ray absorption inbalqsos, i.e. ionized absorption, \sim 90% of the objects are absorbed. theabsorption properties also suggest that lobals may be physically differentobjects from hibals. in addition, we report on a correlation between theionized absorption column density and bal parameters. there is evidence (at 98%level) that the amount of x-ray absorption is correlated with the strength ofhigh-ionization uv absorption. this correlation, not previously reported, canbe naturally understood in virtually all balqso models, as driven by the totalamount of gas mass flowing towards the observer.

1003.0800	spectral energy distribution of hyper-luminous infrared galaxies	the relationship between star formation and super-massive black hole growthis central to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (hlirgs) are unique laboratories toinvestigate the connection between starburst (sb) and active galactic nuclei(agn), since they exhibit extreme star formation rates, and most of them showevidence of harbouring powerful agn. our previous x-ray study of a sample of 14hlirgs shows that the x-ray emission of most hlirgs is dominated by agnactivity. to improve our estimate of the relative contribution of the agn andsb emission to its total bolometric output, we have built broad band spectralenergy distributions (seds) for these hlirgs, and we have fitted empirical agnand sb templates to these seds. in broad terms, most sources are well fittedusing this method, and we found agn and sb contributions similar to thoseobtained by previous studies of hlirgs. we have classified the hlirgs seds intwo groups, named class a and class b. class a hlirgs show a flat sed from theoptical to the infrared energy range. three out of seven class a sources can bemodelled with a pure luminosity-dependent qso template, while the rest of themrequire a type 1 agn template and a sb template. the sb component is dominantin three out of four class a objects. class b hlirgs show seds with a prominentand broad ir bump. these sources can not trivially be modelled with acombination of pure agn and pure sb, they require templates of compositeobjects, suggesting that &gt;50% of their emission comes from stellar formationprocesses. we propose that our sample is actually composed by three differentpopulations: very luminous qso, young galaxies going through their maximal starformation period and the high luminosity tail of ulirg population distribution.

1003.2166	an excess of star-forming galaxies in the fields of high-redshift qsos	we present submillimetre and mid-infrared imaging observations of five fieldscentred on quasi-stellar objects (qsos) at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.8. all 5 qsos were detectedpreviously at submillimetre wavelengths. at 850 (450) um we detect 17 (11)submillimetre galaxies (smgs) in addition to the qsos. the total area mapped at850 um is ~28 arcmin^2 down to rms noise levels of 1-2 mjy/beam, depending onthe field. integral number counts are computed from the 850 um data using thesame analytical techniques adopted by `blank-field' submillimetre surveys. wefind that the `qso-field' counts show a clear excess over the blank-fieldcounts at deboosted flux densities of 2-4 mjy; at higher flux densities thecounts are consistent with the blank-field counts. robust mid-infraredcounterparts are identified for all four submillimetre detected qsos and ~60per cent of the smgs. the mid-infrared colours of the qsos are similar to thoseof the local ulirg/agn mrk 231 if placed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 whilst most of the smgs havecolours very similar to those of the local ulirg arp 220 at 1&lt;z&lt;3. mid-infrareddiagnostics therefore find no strong evidence that the smgs host buried agnalthough we cannot rule out such a possibility. taken together our resultssuggest that the qsos sit in regions of the early universe which are undergoingan enhanced level of major star-formation activity, and should evolve to becomesimilarly dense regions containing massive galaxies at the present epoch.finally, we find evidence that the level of star-formation activity inindividual galaxies appears to be lower around the qsos than it is around morepowerful radio-loud agn at higher redshifts.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1101.2757	a strongly starforming group: three massive galaxies associated with a  qso	we present here photometric redshift confirmation of the presence of largescale structure around the z=1.82 qso rxj0941, which shows an overdensity ofsubmm sources. radio imaging confirms the presence of the submm sources andpinpoints their likely optical-nir counterparts. four of the five submm sourcespresent in this field (including the qso) have counterparts with redshiftscompatible with z=1.82. we show that our photometric redshifts are robustagainst the use of different spectral templates. we have measured the galaxystellar mass of the submm galaxies from their rest-frame k-band luminosityobtaining log(m*/msun)~11.5+-0.2, slightly larger than the schechter mass ofpresent day galaxies, and hence indicating that most of the stellar mass isalready formed. we present optical-to-radio spectral energy distributions(seds) of the five scuba sources. the emission of rxj0941 is dominated byreprocessed agn emission in the observed mir range, while the starburstcontribution completely dominates in the submm range. the seds of the otherthree counterparts are compatible with a dominant starburst contribution above~24um, with star formation rates sfr~2000msun/yr, central dust masseslog(mdust/msun)~9+-0.5 and hence central gas masses log(mgas/msun)~10.7. thereis very little room for an agn contribution. from x-ray upper limits and theobserved 24um flux, we derive a maximum 2-10kev x-ray luminosity of 1e44 erg/sfor any putative agn, even if they are heavily obscured. this in turn points torelatively small black holes with log(mbh/msun)&lt;~8 and hence stellar-to-blackhole mass ratios about one order of magnitude higher than those observed in thepresent universe: most of their central black hole masses are still to beaccreted. local stellar-to-black hole masses ratios can be reached if ~1.3% ofthe available nuclear gas mass is accreted.

0709.2077	the xmm large scale structure survey: optical vs. x-ray classifications  of active galactic nuclei and the unified scheme	our goal is to characterize agn populations by comparing their x-ray andoptical classifications. we present a sample of 99 spectroscopically identifiedx-ray point sources in the xmm-lss survey which are significantly detected inthe [2-10] kev band, and with more than 80 counts. we performed an x-rayspectral analysis for all of these 99 x-ray sources. introducing the fourfoldpoint correlation coefficient, we find only a mild correlation between thex-ray and the optical classifications, as up to 30% of the sources havediffering x-ray and optical classifications: on one hand, 10% of the type 1sources present broad emission lines in their optical spectra and strongabsorption in the x-rays. these objects are highly luminous agn lying at highredshift and thus dilution effects are totally ruled out, their discrepantnature being an intrinsic property. their x-ray luminosities and redshiftsdistributions are consistent with those of the unabsorbed x-ray sources withbroad emission lines. on the other hand, 25/32 are moderate luminosity agn,which are both unabsorbed in the x-rays and only present narrow emission linesin their optical spectra. the majority of them have an optical spectrum whichis representative of the host galaxy. we finally infer that dilution of the agnby the host galaxy seems to account for their nature. 5/25 have been defined asseyfert 2. in conclusion, most of these 32 discrepant cases can be accountedfor by the standard agn unified scheme, as its predictions are not met for only12% of the 99 x-ray sources. abridged

1104.2173	the x-ray spectral properties of the agn population in the xmm-newton  bright serendipitous survey	we present here a detailed x-ray spectral analysis of the agn belonging tothe xmm-newton bright survey (xbs) that comprises more than 300 agn up toredshift ~ 2.4. we performed an x-ray analysis following two differentapproaches: by analyzing individually each agn x-ray spectrum and byconstructing average spectra for different agn types. from the individualanalysis, we find that there seems to be an anti correlation between thespectral index and the sources' hard x-ray luminosity, such that the averagephoton index for the higher luminosity sources (&gt; 10e44 erg/s) is significantlyflatter than the average for the lower luminosity sources. we also find thatthe intrinsic column density distribution agrees with agn unified schemes,although a number of exceptions are found (3% of the whole sample), which aremuch more common among optically classified type 2 agn. we also find that theso-called "soft-excess", apart from the intrinsic absorption, constitutes theprincipal deviation from a power-law shape in agn x-ray spectra and it clearlydisplays different characteristics, and likely a different origin, forunabsorbed and absorbed agn. regarding the shape of the average spectra, wefind that it is best reproduced by a combination of an unabsorbed (absorbed)power law, a narrow fe kalpha emission line and a small (large) amount ofreflection for unabsorbed (absorbed) sources. we do not significantly detectany relativistic contribution to the line emission and we compute an upperlimit for its equivalent width (ew) of 230 ev at the 3 sigma confidence level.finally, by dividing the type 1 agn sample into high- and low-luminositysources, we marginally detect a decrease in the narrow fe kalpha line ew and inthe amount of reflection as the luminosity increases, the "so-called"iwasawa-taniguchi effect.

0704.2971	the xmm-ssc survey of hard-spectrum xmm-newton sources 1: optically  bright sources	we present optical and x-ray data for a sample of serendipitous xmm-newtonsources that are selected to have 0.5-2 kev vs 2-4.5 kev x-ray hardness ratioswhich are harder than the x-ray background. the sources have 2-4.5 kev x-rayflux &gt;= 10^-14 cgs, and in this paper we examine a subsample of 42 opticallybright (r &lt; 21) sources; this subsample is 100 per cent spectroscopicallyidentified. all but one of the optical counterparts are extragalactic, and weargue that the single exception, a galactic m star, is probably a coincidentalassociation. the x-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws(21.8 &lt; log nh &lt; 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed agn. the majorityof the sources show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra,implying that they are type-2 agn. only a small fraction of the sources (7/42)show broad optical emission lines, and all of these have nh &lt; 10^23 cm^-2. thisimplies that ratios of x-ray absorption to optical/uv extinction equivalent to&gt; 100 times the galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in agn absorbers (at most afew percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-lineqsos. seven objects appear to have an additional soft x-ray component inaddition to the heavily absorbed power law. we consider the implications of ourresults in the light of the agn unified scheme. we find that the softcomponents in narrow-line objects are consistent with the unified schemeprovided that &gt; 4 per cent of broad-line agn have ionised absorbers thatattenuate their soft x-ray flux by &gt;50 per cent. in at least one of the x-rayabsorbed, broad-line agn in our sample the x-ray spectrum requires an ionisedabsorber, consistent with this picture.

1205.1929	mining the herschel-atlas: submillimeter-selected blazars in equatorial  fields	the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) provides anunprecedented opportunity to search for blazars at sub-mm wavelengths. wecross-matched the first radio source catalogue with the 11655 sources brighterthan 35 mjy at 500{\mu}m in the \sim 135 square degrees of the sky covered bythe h-atlas equatorial fields at 9 h and 15 h, plus half of the field at 12 h.we found that 379 of the h-atlas sources have a first counterpart within 10arcsec, including 8 catalogued blazars (plus one known blazar that was found atthe edge of one the h-atlas maps). to search for additional blazar candidateswe have devised new diagnostic diagrams and found that known blazars occupy aregion of the log(s500{\mu}m/s350{\mu}m) vs. log(s500{\mu}m/s1.4ghz) planeseparated from that of the other sub-mm sources with radio counterparts. usingthis diagnostic we have selected 12 further candidates that turn out to bescattered in the (r-z) vs. (u-r) plane or in the wise colour-colour diagramproposed by massaro et al. (2012), where known blazars are concentrated in welldefined strips. this suggests that the majority of them either are not blazarsor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. asignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forminggalaxies. this finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in planck545 and 857 ghz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passiveellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novelprospect on blazar properties. based on an inspection of the availablephotometric data, including the wise all-sky survey, the unpublished vikingsurvey and new radio observations, we tentatively estimate that there are 11blazars with synchrotron flux density s500{\mu}m &gt; 35mjy over the consideredarea. this result already allows us to constrain blazar evolution models.

1205.6995	the x-ray luminous galaxies optically classified as star forming are  mostly narrow line seyfert 1s	we aim to characterize the nature of galaxies whose optical emission linediagnostics are consistent with star formation, but whose x-ray propertiesstrongly point towards the presence of an agn. understanding these sources isof particular importance in assessing the completeness of agn samples derivedfrom large galaxy surveys, selected solely on the basis of their opticalspectral properties.we construct a large sample of 211 nelgs, which have fwhmshb emission line &lt;1200 km/s from the sdss-dr7 galaxy spectroscopic catalogue,for which we are able to construct a classical diagnostic diagram, [oiii]/hbversus [nii]/ha (hence z&lt;0.4), and that are also detected in the hard energyband and present in the 2xmm catalogue. this sample offers a large database bywhich to investigate potential mismatches between optical diagnostics and x-rayemission. among these 211 objects, which based on our selection criteria areall at z&lt;0.4, we find that 145 galaxies are diagnosed as agns, having 2-10 kevx-ray luminosities that span a wide range, from 10^40 erg/s to above 10^44erg/s. out of the remaining 66 galaxies, which are instead diagnosed as sf, wefind a bimodal distribution in which 28 have x-ray luminosities in excess of10^42 erg/s, large t (&gt;1), and large x/o ratio (&gt;0.1), while the rest areconsistent with being simply sf galaxies. those 28 galaxies exhibit thebroadest hb line fwhms, from ~300 to 1200 km/s, and their x-ray spectrum issteeper than average and often displays a soft excess. we therefore concludethat the population of x-ray luminous nelgs with optical lines consistent withthose of a starforming galaxy (which represent 19% of our whole sample) islargely dominated by nls1s. the occurrence of such sources in the overalloptically selected sample is small (&lt;2%), hence the contamination of opticallyselected galaxies by nls1s is very small.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1208.2530	using the bright ultra-hard xmm-newton survey to define an ir selection  of luminous agn based on wise colours	we present a highly complete and reliable mid-infrared (mir) colour selectionof luminous agn candidates using the 3.4, 4.6, and 12 um bands of the wisesurvey. the mir colour wedge was defined using the wide-angle bright ultra-hardxmm-newton survey (buxs), one of the largest complete flux-limited samples ofbright (f(4.5-10 kev)&gt;6x10^{-14} erg cm^-2 s^-1) "ultra-hard" (4.5-10 kev)x-ray selected agn to date. buxs includes 258 objects detected over a total skyarea of 44.43 deg^2 of which 251 are spectroscopically identified andclassified, with 145 being type-1 agn and 106 type-2 agn. our technique isdesigned to select objects with red mir power-law spectral energy distributions(sed) in the three shortest bands of wise and properly accounts for the errorsin the photometry and deviations of the mir seds from a pure power-law. thecompleteness of the mir selection is a strong function of luminosity. at l(2-10kev)&gt;10^{44} erg s^-1, where the agn is expected to dominate the mir emission,97.1_{-4.8}^{+2.2}% and 76.5_{-18.4}^{+13.3}% of the buxs type-1 and type-2 agnmeet the selection. our technique shows one of the highest reliability andefficiency of detection of the x-ray selected luminous agn population with wiseamongst those in the literature. in the area covered by the buxs survey ourselection identifies 2755 agn candidates detected with snr&gt;5 in the threeshorter wavelength bands of wise with 38.5% having a detection at 2-10 kevx-ray energies. we also analyzed the possibility of including the 22um wiseband to select agn candidates, but neither the completeness nor the reliabilityof the selection improves. this is likely due to both the significantlyshallower depth at 22um compared with the first three bands of wise andstar-formation contributing to the 22um emission at the wise 22um sensitivity.

1209.0916	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s ii. a 9-20 kev selection of heavily  obscured active galaxies at z&gt;1.7	we present results on a search of heavily obscured active galaxies z&gt;1.7using the rest-frame 9-20 kev excess for x-ray sources detected in the deepxmm-cdfs survey. out of 176 sources selected with the conservative detectioncriteria (&gt;8 sigma) in the first source catalogue of ranalli et al., 46 objectslie in the redshift range of interest with the median redshift z~2.5. theirtypical rest-frame 10-20 kev luminosity is 1e+44 erg/s, as observed. amongoptically faint objects that lack spectroscopic redshift, four were found to bestrongly absorbed x-ray sources, and the enhanced fe k emission or absorptionfeatures in their x-ray spectra were used to obtain x-ray spectroscopicredshifts. using the x-ray colour-colour diagram based on the rest-frame 3-5kev, 5-9 kev, and 9-20 kev bands, seven objects were selected for their 9-20kev excess and were found to be strongly absorbed x-ray sources with columndensity of nh &gt; 0.6e+24 cm-2, including two possible compton thick sources.while they are emitting at quasar luminosity, ~3/4 of the sample objects arefound to be absorbed by nh &gt; 1e+22 cm-2. a comparison with local agn at thematched luminosity suggests an increasing trend of the absorbed source fractionfor high-luminosity agn towards high redshifts.

1302.5329	the xmm-newton wide angle survey (xwas)	this programme is aimed at obtaining one of the largest x-ray selectedsamples of identified active galactic nuclei to date in order to characterisesuch a population at intermediate fluxes, where most of the universe'saccretion power originates. we present the xmm-newton wide angle survey (xwas),a new catalogue of almost a thousand x-ray sources spectroscopically identifiedthrough optical observations. a sample of x-ray sources detected in 68xmm-newton pointed observations was selected for optical multi-fibrespectroscopy. optical counterparts and corresponding photometry of the x-raysources were obtained from the supercosmos sky survey. candidates forspectroscopy were initially selected with magnitudes down to r~21, withpreference for x-ray sources having a flux f(0.5-4.5 kev) &gt;10^-14 erg s^-1cm^-2. optical spectroscopic observations performed at the anglo australiantelescope two degree field were analysed, and the derived spectra wereclassified based on optical emission lines. we have identified through opticalspectroscopy 940 x-ray sources over ~11.8 deg^2 of the sky. source populationsin our sample can be summarised as 65% broad line active galactic nuclei(blagn), 16% narrow emission line galaxies (nelgs), 6% absorption line galaxies(algs) and 13% stars. an active nucleus is likely to be present also in thelarge majority of the x-ray sources spectroscopically classified as nelgs oralgs. sources lie in high-galactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg) xmm-newton fieldsmainly in the southern hemisphere. due to the large parameter space in redshift(0 &lt; z &lt; 4.25) and flux (10^-15 &lt; f(0.5-4.5 kev) &lt; 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2)covered by the xwas this work provides an excellent resource to further studysubsamples and particular cases. the overall properties of the extragalacticobjects are presented in this paper.

1302.6479	the xmm-newton ssc survey of the galactic plane	many different classes of x-ray sources contribute to the galactic landscapeat high energies. although the nature of the most luminous x-ray emitters isnow fairly well understood, the population of low-to-medium x-ray luminosity(lx = 10^27-10^34 erg/s) sources remains much less studied, our knowledge beingmostly based on the observation of local members. the advent of wide field andhigh sensitivity x-ray telescopes such as xmm-newton now offers the opportunityto observe this low-to-medium lx population at large distances. we report onthe results of a galactic plane survey conducted by the xmm-newton surveyscience centre (ssc). beyond its astrophysical goals, this survey aims atgathering a representative sample of identified x-ray sources at low latitudethat can be used later on to statistically identify the rest of theserendipitous sources discovered in the milky way. the survey is based on 26xmm-newton observations, obtained at |b| &lt; 20 deg, distributed over a largerange in galactic longitudes and covering a summed area of 4 deg2. the fluxlimit of our survey is 2 x 10-15 erg/cm^2/s in the soft (0.5 - 2 kev) band and1 x 10^-14 erg/cm^2/s in the hard (2 - 12 kev) band. we detect a total of 1319individual x-ray sources. using optical follow-up observations supplemented bycross-correlation with a large range of multi-wavelength archival catalogues weidentify 316 x-ray sources. this constitutes the largest group ofspectroscopically identified low latitude x-ray sources at this flux level. themajority of the identified x-ray sources are active coronae with spectral typesin the range a - m at maximum distances of ~ 1 kpc. the number of identifiedactive stars increases towards late spectral types, reaching a maximum at k.(abridged)

1304.5717	the xmm-newton deep survey in the chandra deep field south. iii. point  source catalogue and number counts in the hard x-rays	(abridged) the xmm-newton survey in the chandra deep field south (xmm-cdfs)aims at detecting and studying the spectral properties of a significant numberof obscured and compton-thick agn. the large effective area of xmmin the 2--10and 5--10 kev bands, coupled with a 3.45 ms nominal exposure time, allows us tobuild clean samples in both bands, and makes the xmm-cdfs the deepest xmmsurvey currently published in the 5--10 kev band. the large multi-wavelengthand spectroscopic coverage of the cdfs area allows for an immediate andabundant scientific return. we present the data reduction of the xmm-cdfsobservations, the method for source detection in the 2--10 and 5--10kev bands,and the resulting catalogues. a number of 339 and 137 sources are listed in theabove bands with flux limits of 6.6e-16 and 9.5e-16 erg/s/cm^2, respectively.the flux limits at 50% of the maximum sky coverage are 1.8e-15 and 4.0e-15erg/s/cm^2, respectively. the catalogues have been cross-correlated with thechandra ones: 315 and 130 identifications have been found with alikelihood-ratio method, respectively. a number of 15 new sources, previouslyundetected by chandra, is found; 5 of them lie in the 4 ms area. redshifts,either spectroscopic or photometric, are available for ~92% of the sources. thenumber counts in both bands are presented and compared to other works. thesurvey coverage has been calculated with the help of two extensive sets ofsimulations, one set per band. the simulations have been produced with anewly-developed simulator, written with the aim of the most carefulreproduction of the background spatial properties. we present a detaileddecomposition of the xmm background into its components: cosmic, particle, andresidual soft protons.

1305.0564	studying the relationship between x-ray emission and accretion in agns  using the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	we study the link between the x-ray emission in radio-quiet agns and theaccretion rate on the central supermassive black hole using a statisticallywell-defined and representative sample of 71 type 1 agns extracted from thexmm-newton bright serendipitous survey. we search and quantify the statisticalcorrelations between some fundamental parameters that characterize the x-rayemission, i.e. the x-ray spectral slope, and the x-ray "loudness", and theaccretion rate, both absolute and normalized to the eddington luminosity(eddington ratio). we parametrize the x-ray loudness using three differentquantities: the bolometric correction, the two-point spectral index and thedisk/corona luminosity ratio. we find that the x-ray spectral index depends onthe normalized accretion rate while the "x-ray loudness" depends on both thenormalized and the absolute accretion rate. the dependence on the eddingtonratio, in particular, is probably induced by the x-ray spectral slope-eddingtonratio correlation. the two proxies usually adopted in the literature toquantify the x-ray loudness of an agn, i.e. the bolometric correction and thetwo-point spectral index, behave differently, with the bolometric correctionbeing more sensitive to the eddington ratio and the two-point spectral indexhaving a stronger dependence with the absolute accretion. the explanation ofthis result is likely related to the different sensitivity of the twoparameters to the x-ray spectral index.

1305.7237	uncovering obscured luminous agn with wise	mateos et al. (2012) presented a highly reliable and efficient mid-infrared(mir) colour-based selection technique for luminous active galactic nuclei(agn) using the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) survey. here weevaluate the effectiveness of this technique to identify obscured agn missed inx-ray surveys. to do so we study the wise properties of agn independentlyselected in hard x-ray and optical surveys. we use the largest catalogue of 887[o iii]{\lambda}5007-selected type 2 quasars (qso2s) at z&lt;0.83 in theliterature from the sloan digital sky survey, and the 258 hard (&gt;4.5 kev)x-ray-selected agn from the bright ultrahard xmm-newton survey (buxs). thefraction of sdss qso2s in our infrared agn selection region (wedge) increaseswith the agn luminosity, reaching 66.1+4.5_4.7% at the highest [o iii]luminosities in the sample. this fraction is substantially lower than for thebuxs type 1 agn (96.1+3.0_6.3%), but consistent, within the uncertainties, withthat for the buxs type 2 agn (75.0+14.1_19.1%) with the same luminosity. thesdss qso2s appear to reside in more luminous (massive) hosts than the buxs agn,due to the tight magnitude limits applied in the sdss spectroscopic targetselection. since host galaxy dilution can reduce substantially theeffectiveness of mir-based techniques, this may explain the lower fraction ofsdss qso2s in the wise agn wedge. the fraction of sdss qso2s identified ascompton-thick candidates that fall in the wedge is consistent with the fractionof all sdss qso2s in that zone. at the agn luminosities involved in thecomparison, compton-thick and compton-thin sdss qso2s have similar wise colourdistributions. we conclude that at high luminosities and z&lt;1 our mir techniqueis very effective at identifying both compton-thin and compton-thick agn.

1307.1471	the xmm-newton deep survey in the cdf-s vi. obscured agn selected as  infrared power-law galaxies	accretion onto smbh is believed to occur mostly in obscured agn. such objectsare proving rather elusive in surveys of distant galaxies, including those atx-ray energies. our main goal is to determine whether the revised irac criteriaof donley et al. (2012) (objects with an ir power-law spectral shape), areeffective at selecting x-ray type-2 agn. we present the results from the x-rayspectral analysis of 147 agn selected by cross-correlating the highest spectralquality ultra-deep xmm-newton and the spitzer/irac catalogues in the cdf-s.consequently it is biased towards sources with high s/n x-ray spectra. in orderto measure the amount of intrinsic absorption in these sources, we adopt asimple x-ray spectral model that includes a power-law modified by intrinsicabsorption and a possible soft x-ray component. we find 21/147 sources to beheavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities donot allow us to confirm their compton-thick nature without resorting toadditional criteria. although ir power-law galaxies are less numerous in oursample than ir non-power-law galaxies (60 versus 87 respectively), we find thatthe fraction of absorbed (n_{h} &gt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}) agn is significantly higher(at about 3 sigma level) for ir-power-law sources ($\sim$2/3) than for thosesources that do not meet this ir selection criteria ($\sim$1/2). this behaviouris particularly notable at low luminosities, but it appears to be present,although with a marginal significance, at all luminosities. we thereforeconclude that the ir power-law method is efficient in finding x-ray-absorbedsources. we would then expect that the long-sought dominant population ofabsorbed agn is abundant among ir power-law spectral shape sources not detectedin x-rays.

0803.1440	x-ray absorption in distant type ii qsos	we present the results of the x-ray spectral analysis of anxmm-newton-selected type ii qso sample with z&gt;0.5 and 0.5-10 kev flux of 0.3-33x 10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2. the distribution of absorbing column densities in typeii qsos is investigated and the dependence of absorption on x-ray luminosityand redshift is studied.  we inspected 51 spectroscopically classified type ii qso candidates from thexmm-newton marano field survey, the xmm-newton-2df wide angle survey (xwas),and the axis survey to set-up a well-defined sample with secure optical type iiidentifications. fourteen type ii qsos were classified and an x-ray spectralanalysis performed. since most of our sources have only ~40 x-ray counts(pn-detector), we carefully studied the fit results of the simulated x-rayspectra as a function of fit statistic and binning method. we determined thatfitting the spectra with the cash-statistic and a binning of minimum one countper bin recovers the input values of the simulated x-ray spectra best. above100 pn counts, the free fits of the spectrum's slope and absorbing hydrogencolumn density are reliable.  we find only moderate absorption (n_h=(2-10) x 10^22 cm^-2) and no obvioustrends with redshift and intrinsic x-ray luminosity. in a few cases acompton-thick absorber cannot be excluded. two type ii objects with no x-rayabsorption were discovered. we find no evidence for an intrinsic separationbetween type ii agn and high x-ray luminosity type ii qso in terms ofabsorption. the stacked x-ray spectrum of our 14 type ii qsos shows no ironk-alpha line. in contrast, the stack of the 8 type ii agn reveals a veryprominent iron k-alpha line at an energy of ~ 6.6 kev and an ew ~ 2 kev.

1406.6009	relativistic reflection in the average x-ray spectrum of agn in the  v\'eron-cetty &amp; v\'eron catalogue	the x-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (agn) unveil properties of matteraround the super massive black hole (smbh). we investigate the x-ray spectra ofagn focusing on compton reflection and fluorescence, important processes ofinteraction between primary radiation and circum-nuclear material. unresolvedemission lines (most notably the fe line) in the x-ray spectra of agn indicatethat this material is located far away from the smbh. contributions from theinner accretion disk, affected by relativistic effects, have also been detectedin several cases.  we studied the average x-ray spectrum of a sample of 263 x-ray unabsorbed agnthat yield 419023 counts in the 2-12 kev rest-frame band distributed among 388xmm-newton spectra. we fitted the average spectrum using a (basically)unabsorbed power law (primary radiation). from second model that represents theinteraction of the primary radiation with matter located far away from thesmbh, we found that it was very significantly detected. finally, we added acontribution from interaction with neutral material in the accretion disk closeto the central smbh, which is therefore smeared by relativistic effects, whichimproved the fit at 6 sigma. the reflection factors are 0.65 for the accretiondisk and 0.25 for the torus. replacing the neutral disk-reflection withlow-ionisation disk reflection, also relativistically smeared, fits the dataequally well, suggesting that we do not find evidence for a significantionisation of the accretion disk.  we detect distant neutral reflection in the average spectrum of unabsorbedagn with z=0.8. adding the disk-reflection component associated with arelativistic fe line improves the data description at 6 sigma confidence level,suggesting that both reflection components are present. the disk-reflectioncomponent accounts for about 70 % of the total reflected flux.

1408.7037	the xmm-newton bright survey sample of absorbed quasars: x-ray and  accretion properties	although absorbed quasars are extremely important for our understanding ofthe energetics of the universe, the main physical parameters of their centralengines are still poorly known. in this work we present and study a completesample of 14 quasars (qsos) that are absorbed in the x-rays (column densitynh&gt;4x10^21 cm-2 and x-ray luminosity l(2-10 kev)&gt;10^44 ergs/s; xqso2) belongingto the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey (xbs). from the analysis of theirultraviolet-to-mid-infrared spectral energy distribution we can separate thenuclear emission from the host galaxy contribution, obtaining a measurement ofthe fundamental nuclear parameters, like the mass of the central supermassiveblack hole and the value of eddington ratio, lambda_edd. comparing theproperties of xqso2s with those previously obtained for the x-ray unabsorbedqsos in the xbs, we do not find any evidence that the two samples are drawnfrom different populations. in particular, the two samples span the same rangein eddington ratios, up to lambda_edd=0.5; this implies that our xqso2spopulate the "forbidden region" in the so-called "effective eddington limitparadigm". a combination of low grain abundance, presence of stars inwards ofthe absorber, and/or anisotropy of the disk emission, can explain this result.

1412.1250	traces of co-evolution in high z x-ray selected and submm-luminous qsos	we present a detailed study of a x -ray selected sample of 5 submillimeterbright qsos at $z\sim2$, where the highest rates of star formation (sf) andfurther growth of black holes (bh) occur. therefore, this sample is a greatlaboratory to investigate the co-evolution of star formation and agn. wepresent here the analysis of the spectral energy distributions (sed) of the 5qsos, including new data from herschel pacs and spire. both agn components(direct and reprocessed) and like star formation (sf) are needed to model itssed. from the sed and their uv-optical spectra we have estimated the mass ofthe black hole ($m_{bh} = 10^9 - 10^{10} m_{sun}$) and bolometric luminositiesof agn ($l_{bol} = (0.8-20) \times 10^{13} l_{sun}$). these objects show veryhigh luminosities in the far infrared range (at the h/ulirg levels) and veryhigh rates of sf (sfr = 400-1400 $m_{sun}$/y). known their current sfr andtheir bh masses, we deduce that their host galaxies must be already verymassive, or would not have time to get to the local relation between bh massand bulge. finally, we found evidence of a possible correlation between thecolumn density of ionized gas detected in x-rays ($nh_{ion}$) and sfr, whichwould provide a link between agn and sf processes.

1501.01444	exploring the active galactic nuclei population with extreme x-ray to  optical flux ratios (fx/fo &gt;50)	the cosmic history of the growth of supermassive black holes in galacticcenters parallels that of star-formation in the universe. however, an importantfraction of this growth occurs inconspicuously in obscured objects, whereultraviolet/optical/near-infrared emission is heavily obscured by dust. sincethe x-ray flux is less attenuated, a high x-ray-to-optical flux ratio (fx/fo)is expected to be an efficient tool to find out these obscured accretingsources. we explore here via optical spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy andinfrared photometry the most extreme cases of this population (those with fx/fo&gt;50, exo50 sources hereafter), using a well defined sample of seven x-raysources extracted from the 2xmm catalogue. five exo50 sources (about 70 percentof the sample) in the bright flux regime explored by our survey (f(2-10 kev) &gt;1.5e-13 cgs) are associated with obscured agn (nh &gt; 1.0e22 cm-2), spanning aredshift range between 0.75 and 1 and characterised by 2-10 kev intrinsicluminosities in the qso regime (e.g. well in excess to 1.0e44 cgs). we did notfind compelling evidence of compton thick agn. overall the exo50 type 2 qsos donot seem to be different from standard x-ray selected type 2 qsos in terms ofnuclear absorption; a very high agn/host galaxy ratio seems to play a majorrole in explaining their extreme properties. interestingly three out of fiveexo50 type 2 qso objects can be classified as extreme dust obscured galaxies(edogs), suggesting that a very high agn/host ratios (along with the largeamount of dust absorption) could be the natural explanation also for a part ofthe edog population. the remaining two exo50 sources are classified as bl lacobjects, having rather extreme properties, and which are good candidates fortev emission.

1501.02095	submm-bright x-ray absorbed qsos at z~2: insights into the co-evolution  of agn and star-formation	we have assembled a sample of 5 x-ray-absorbed and submm-luminous type 1 qsosat $z \sim 2$ which are simultaneously growing their central black holesthrough accretion and forming stars copiously. we present here the analysis oftheir rest-frame uv to submm spectral energy distributions (seds), includingnew herschel data. both agn (direct and reprocessed) and star formation (sf)emission are needed to model their seds. from the seds and their uv-opticalspectra we have estimated the masses of their black holes $m_{bh}\sim10^{9}-10^{10}\,m_{\odot}$, their intrinsic agn bolometric luminosities$l_{bol}\sim(0.8 - 20)\times 10^{13} l_{\odot}$, eddington ratios$l_{bol}/l_{edd}\sim 0.1 - 1.1$ and bolometric corrections$l_{bol}/l_{x,2-10}\sim 30 - 500$. these values are common among optically andx-ray-selected type 1 qsos (except for rx~j1249), except for the bolometriccorrections, which are higher. these objects show very high far-infraredluminosities $l_{fir}\sim$ (2 - 8)$\times10^{12}\,m_{\odot}$ and star formationrates sfr$\sim 1000 m_{\odot}/$y. from their $l_{fir}$ and the shape of theirfir-submm emission we have estimated star-forming dust masses of $m_{dust}\sim10^9\,m_\odot$. we have found evidence of a tentative correlation between thegas column densities of the ionized absorbers detected in x-ray (n$_{h_{ion}}$)and $sfr$. our computed black hole masses are amongst the most massive known.

1501.04335	revisiting the relationship between 6 {\mu}m and 2-10 kev continuum  luminosities of agn	we have determined the relation between the agn luminosities at rest-frame 6{\mu}m associated to the dusty torus emission and at 2-10 kev energies using acomplete, x-ray flux limited sample of 232 agn drawn from the bright ultra-hardxmm-newton survey. the objects have intrinsic x-ray luminosities between 10^42and 10^46 erg/s and redshifts from 0.05 to 2.8. the rest-frame 6 {\mu}mluminosities were computed using data from the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer and are based on a spectral energy distribution decomposition into agnand galaxy emission. the best-fit relationship for the full sample isconsistent with being linear, l_6 {\mu}m $\propto$ l_2-10 kev^0.99$\pm$0.032,with intrinsic scatter, ~0.35 dex in log l_6 {\mu}m. the l_6 {\mu}m/l_2-10 kevluminosity ratio is largely independent on the line-of-sight x-ray absorption.assuming a constant x-ray bolometric correction, the fraction of agn bolometricluminosity reprocessed in the mid-ir decreases weakly, if at all, with the agnluminosity, a finding at odds with simple receding torus models. type 2 agnhave redder mid-ir continua at rest-frame wavelengths &lt;12 {\mu}m and areoverall ~1.3-2 times fainter at 6 {\mu}m than type 1 agn at a given x-rayluminosity. regardless of whether type 1 and type 2 agn have the same ordifferent nuclear dusty toroidal structures, our results imply that the agnemission at rest-frame 6 {\mu}m is not isotropic due to self-absorption in thedusty torus, as predicted by agn torus models. thus, agn surveys at rest-frame6 {\mu}m are subject to modest dust obscuration biases.

0805.1919	the cosmological properties of agn in the xmm-newton hard bright survey	(abridged) we investigate here the xlf of absorbed (nh between 4e21 and e24cm-2) and unabsorbed (nh &lt; 4e21 cm-2) agn, the fraction of absorbed agn as afunction of lx (and z), the intrinsic nh distribution of the agn population,and the xlf of compton thick (nh &gt; e24 cm-2) agn. to carry out thisinvestigation we have used the xmm-newton hard bright serendipitous sample(hbss) a complete sample of bright x-ray sources (fx &gt; 7e-14 cgs) at highgalactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg) selected in the 4.5-7.5 kev energy band. thehbss sample is now almost completely identified (97% spectroscopic id) and itcan be safely used for a statistical investigation. the hbss contains 62 agnout of which 40 are unabsorbed (or marginally absorbed; nh &lt; 4e21 cm-2) and 22are absorbed (nh between 4e21 and e24 cm-2). absorbed and unabsorbed agn arecharacterized by two different xlf with the absorbed agn population beingdescribed by a steeper xlf, if compared with the unabsorbed ones, at allluminosities. the intrinsic fraction f of absorbed agn with l(2-10 kev) &gt; 3e42cgs is 0.57+/-0.11; we find that f decreases with the intrinsic luminosity, andprobably, increases with the redshift. our data are consistent with a flat lognh distribution for nh between e20 and e24 cm-2. finally, by comparing theresults obtained here with those obtained using an optically selected sample ofagn we derive, in an indirect way, the xlf of compton thick agn. the densityratio between compton thick agn (nh &gt; e24 cm-2) and compton thin agn (nh &lt; e24cm-2) decreases from 1.08+/-0.44 at lx e43 cgs to 0.23+/-0.15 at lx e45 cgs.

1506.03083	infrared identification of hard x-ray sources in the galaxy	the nature of the low- to intermediate-luminosity (lx$\,\sim 10^{32-34}$ ergs$^{-1}$) source population revealed in hard band (2-10 kev) x-ray surveys ofthe galactic plane is poorly understood. to overcome such problem wecross-correlated the xmm-newton 3xmm-dr4 survey with the infrared 2mass andglimpse catalogues. we identified reliable x-ray-infrared associations for 690sources. we selected 173 sources having hard x-ray spectra, typical of hardx-ray high-mass stars (kt$\,&gt;\,5\,$kev), and 517 sources having soft x-rayspectra, typical of active coronae. about $18\,\%$ of the soft sources areclassified in the literature: $\sim\,91\%$ as stars, with a minor fraction ofwr stars. roughly $15\,\%$ of the hard sources are classified in theliterature: $\sim\,68\%$ as high-mass x-ray stars single or in binary systems(wr, be and hmxbs), with a small fraction of g and b stars. we carried outinfrared spectroscopic pilot observations at the william herschel telescope forfive hard x-ray sources. three of them are high-mass stars with spectral typeswn7-8h, ofpe/wn9 and be, and lx$\sim\,10^{32}-10^{33}$erg s$^{-1}$. one sourceis a colliding-wind binary, while another source is a colliding-wind binary ora supergiant fast x-ray transient in quiescence. the be star is a likely$\gamma$-cas system. the nature of the other two x-ray sources is uncertain.the distribution of hard x-ray sources in the parameter space made of x-rayhardness ratio, infrared colours and x-ray-to-infrared flux ratio suggests thatmany of the unidentified sources are new $\gamma$-cas analogues, wrs and low lxhmxbs. however, the nature of the x-ray population with ks $\geq$ 11 andaverage x-ray-to-infrared flux ratio remains unconstrained.

1509.05413	the xmm deep survey in the cdf-s. ix. an x-ray outflow in a luminous  obscured quasar at z~1.6	in active galactic nuclei (agn)-galaxy co-evolution models, agn winds andoutflows are often invoked to explain why super-massive black holes andgalaxies stop growing efficiently at a certain phase of their lives. they arecommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. evidence ofultra-fast (v&gt;0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of agn has beencollected in the past decade by sensitive x-ray observations for sizablesamples of agn, mostly at low redshift. here we present ultra-deep xmm-newtonand chandra spectral data of an obscured (nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsicallyluminous (l2-10kev~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named pid352) at z~1.6 (derivedfrom the x-ray spectral analysis) in the chandra deep field-south. the sourceis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observedenergies of e~2-3 kev. while the emission line is interpreted as being due toneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorptionfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (fexxv, fexxvi) with anoutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionizationmodels. the mass outflow rate - ~2 msun/yr - is similar to the source accretionrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,corresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. pid352 represents oneof the few cases where indications of x-ray outflowing gas have been observedat high redshift thus far. this wind is powerful enough to provide feedback onthe host galaxy.

0705.2985	elusive agn in the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	aims: we investigate here the nature of all the sources (35 in total) in thexbs survey (which is 86% optically identified) showing an optical spectrumdominated by the light from the host galaxy with no evidence (or littleevidence) for the presence of an agn. methods: we use the x-ray spectralanalysis to assess the presence of an agn in these sources and to characterizeits properties. results: we detect agn activity in 33 out of 35 sources. theremaining 2 sources are the ones with the lowest x-ray luminosity in the sample(l[2-10kev]&lt;10^41 erg s^-1) and their x-ray emission could be produced withinthe host galaxy. we find that the ``recognition problem'' for agn is verycritical in the low-luminosity regime (at least 60% of the agn withl[2-10kev]&lt;10^43 erg s^-1 are elusive) becoming negligible for high x-rayluminosities (~1.5% of elusive agn with l[2-10kev]&gt;10^44 erg s^-1). thisproblem affects mostly absorbed agn (~40% of type~2 agn in the survey areelusive) but also a significant fraction of unabsorbed agn (8%). conclusions:we find that the simplest explanations of why these 33 (or most of them) agnsare elusive are two: at low x-ray luminosities (&lt;10^43 erg s^-1) the mostimportant reason is the intrinsically low agn/galaxy contrast (opticaldilution) while at high luminosities (&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) it is due to the opticalabsorption (in the compton-thin regime, i.e. nh&lt;10^24 cm^-2). alternativehypotheses, like the presence of compton-thick sources, bl lac objects or``non-standard'' agn (e.g. with alpha_ox&lt;1 or with weak/absorbed narrow lineregion) are not supported by the data although we cannot exclude the presencein the sample of a few sources of these types.

0705.3596	an xmm-newton study of hyper-luminous infrared galaxies	hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (hlirgs) are the most luminous persistentobjects in the universe. they exhibit extremely high star formation rates, andmost of them seem to harbour an agn. they are unique laboratories toinvestigate utmost star formation, and its connection to super-massive blackhole growth. x-ray studies of hlirgs have the potential to unravel the agncontribution to the bolometric output from these bright objects.  we have selected a sample of 14 hlirgs observed by xmm-newton (type 1, type 2agn and starburst), 5 of which are candidates to be compton-thick objects. thisis the first time that a systematic study of this type of objects is carriedout in the x-ray spectral band. their x-ray spectral properties have beencorrelated with their ir luminosities, estimated by iras, iso and sub-mm data.  the x-ray spectra of hlirgs present heterogeneous properties. all our x-raydetected hlirgs (10) have agn-dominated x-ray spectra. the hard x-rayluminosity of 8 of them is consistent with a pure agn contribution, while inthe remaining 2 sources both an agn and a starburst seem to contribute to theoverall emission. we found soft excess emission in 5 sources. in one of them itis consistent with a pure starburst origin, while in the other 4 sources it isconsistent with an agn origin. the observed x-ray emission is systematicallybelow the one expected for a standard local qso of the same ir luminosity,suggesting the possible presence of absorption in type 2 objects and/or adeparture from a standard spectral energy distribution of qso. thex-ray-to-ir-luminosity ratio is constant with redshift, indicating similarevolutions for the agn and starburst component, and that their respective powersources could be physically related.

astro-ph;0006347	a survey of hard spectrum rosat sources 1: x-ray source catalogue	we present a catalogue of 147 serendipitous x-ray sources selected to havehard spectra (alpha &lt; 0.5) from a survey of 188 rosat fields. such sources mustbe the dominant contributors to the x-ray background at faint fluxes. we haveused monte carlo simulations to verify that our technique is very efficient atselecting hard sources: the survey has &gt; 10 times as much effective area tohard sources as it has to soft sources above a 0.5 - 2 kev flux level of 10^-14erg/cm^2/s. the distribution of best fit spectral slopes of the hard sourcessuggests that a typical rosat hard source in our survey has a spectral slopealpha ~0. the hard sources have a steep number flux relation (dn/ds proptos^-gamma with a best fit value of gamma = 2.72 +- 0.12) and make up about 15%of all 0.5 - 2 kev sources with s &gt; 10^-14 erg/cm^2/s. if their n(s) continuesto fainter fluxes, the hard sources will comprise ~ 40% of sources with 510^-15 &lt; s &lt; 10^-14. the population of hard sources can therefore account forthe harder average spectra of rosat sources with s &lt; 10^-14. they probably makea strong contribution to the x-ray background at faint fluxes and could be thesolution to the x-ray background spectral paradox.

astro-ph;0011242	the variable xmm-newton spectrum of markarian 766	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 766 was observed for 60 ks withthe xmm-newton observatory. the source shows a complex x-ray spectrum. the 2-10kev spectrum can be adequately represented by a power law and broad fe kaemission. between 0.7 and 2 kev the spectrum is harder and exhibits a fluxdeficit with respect to the extrapolated medium energy slope. below 0.7 kev,however, there is a strong excess of emission. the rgs spectrum shows anedge-like feature at 0.7 kev; the energy of this feature is inconsistent withthat expected for an ovii edge from a warm absorber. markarian 766 varies by afactor of ~ 2 in overall count rate in the epic and rgs instruments on atimescale of a few thousand seconds, while no significant flux changes areobserved in the ultraviolet with the om. the x-ray variability is spectrallydependent with the largest amplitude variability occurring in the 0.4-2 kevband. the spectral variability can be explained by a change in flux and slopeof the medium energy continuum emission, superimposed on a less variable (orconstant) low energy emission component.

astro-ph;0103055	a survey of hard spectrum rosat sources 2: optical identification of  hard sources	we have surveyed 188 rosat pspc fields for x-ray sources with hard spectra(alpha&lt;0.5); such sources must be major contributors to the x-ray background atfaint fluxes. in this paper we present optical identifications for 62 of thesesources: 28 agn which show broad lines in their optical spectra (blagn), 13narrow emission line galaxies (nelgs), 5 galaxies with no visible emissionlines, 8 clusters and 8 galactic stars. the blagn, nelgs and galaxies havesimilar distributions of x-ray flux and spectra. their rosat spectra areconsistent with their being agn obscured by columns of 20.5&lt;log(nh/cm^2)&lt;23.the hard spectrum blagn have a distribution of x-ray to optical ratios which issimilar to that found for agn from soft x-ray surveys (1&lt;alpha_ox&lt;2). however,a relatively large proportion (15%) of the blagn, nelgs and galaxies are radioloud. this could be because the radio jets in these objects produceintrinsically hard x-ray emission, or if their hardness is due to absorption,it could be because radio loud objects are more x-ray luminous than radio quietobjects. the 8 hard sources identified as clusters of galaxies are thebrightest, and softest group of sources and hence clusters are unlikely to bean important component of the hard, faint population. we propose that blagn arelikely to constitute a significant fraction of the faint, hard, 0.5 - 2 kevpopulation and could be important to reproducing the shape of the x-raybackground, because they are the most numerous type of object in our sample(comprising almost half the identified sources), and because all our highredshift (z&gt;1) identified hard sources have broad lines.

astro-ph;0202102	submillimeter evidence for the coeval growth of massive black holes and  galaxy bulges	the correlation, found in nearby galaxies, between black hole mass andstellar bulge mass implies that the formation of these two components must berelated. here we report submillimeter photometry of eight x--ray absorbedactive galactic nuclei which have luminosities and redshifts characteristic ofthe sources that produce the bulk of the accretion luminosity in the universe.the four sources with the highest redshifts are detected at 850 microns, withflux densities between 5.9 and 10.1 millijanskies, and hence are ultraluminousinfrared galaxies. interpreting the submillimeter flux as emission from dustheated by starbursts, these results suggest that the majority of stars inspheroids were formed at the same time as their central black holes built upmost of their mass by accretion, accounting for the observed demography ofmassive black holes in the local universe. the skewed rate of submillimeterdetection with redshift is consistent with a high redshift epoch of starformation in radio quiet active galactic nuclei, similar to that seen in radiogalaxies.

astro-ph;0402098	a filamentary structure of massive star-forming galaxies associated with  an x-ray absorbed qso at z=1.8	the genesis of spheroids is central to our understanding of galaxy formation-- they are relatively simple systems, containing about half the stellar massof the universe. a major subset of spheroids, massive elliptical galaxies, arepreferentially found in clusters where they exhibit old, coeval stellarpopulations suggesting that they formed synchronously at early epochs. here wereport scuba submillimeter imaging of a region around a z=1.8 x-ray selectedqso. the image reveals a remarkable 400 kiloparsec long chain of galaxies eachwith an obscured star-formation rate sufficiently high to build a massivespheroid in less than 1 gyr. the large over-density of these galaxies relativeto expectations for a random field implies they probably reside in a structureassociated with the qso. we suggest that this star formation is associated withgalaxy mergers or encounters within the filament, such as those predicted bythe popular hierarchical model of galaxy formation. our observations suggestthat strong absorption in the x-ray spectra of qsos at high-redshifts mayresult from a veil of gas thrown up by a merger or merger-induced activity,rather than an orientation-dependent obscuring torus. it is argued that thesesystems are the precursors of elliptical galaxies found today in the coreregions of all rich galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0412390	x-ray spectra of xmm-newton serendipitous medium flux sources	we report on the results of a detailed analysis of the x-ray spectralproperties of a large sample of sources detected serendipitously with thexmm-newton observatory in 25 selected fields. the survey covers a total solidangle of ~3.5 deg2 and contains 1137 sources with ~10e-15 &lt; s0.5-10 &lt; 10e-12erg cm-2 s-1. we find evidence for hardening of the average x-ray spectra ofthe sources towards fainter fluxes. we interpret this as indicating a higherdegree of photoelectric absorption amongst the fainter population. absorptionis detected at 95% confidence in 20% of the sources, but it could certainly bepresent in many other sources below our detection capabilities. for broad lineagns (blagns), we detect absorption in ~10% of the sources with columndensities in the range 10e21 - 10e22 cm-2. the fraction of absorbed narrowemission line galaxies (nelgs, most with intrinsic x-ray luminosities &gt;10e43erg s-1, and therefore classified as type 2 agns) is significantly higher(40%), with a hint of moderately higher columns. we do not find evidence for aredshift evolution of the underlying power law index of blagns, which staysroughly constant at gamma ~1.9, with intrinsic dispersion of 0.4. a smallfraction (~7%) of blagns and nelgs require the presence of a soft excess, thatwe model as a black body with temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 kev.comparing our results on absorption to popular x-ray background synthesismodels, we find absorption in only ~40% of the sources expected. this is due toa deficiency of heavily absorbed sources (with nh ~10e22 - 10e24 cm-2) in oursample in comparison with the models. we therefore conclude that the synthesismodels require some revision in their specific parameters.

astro-ph;0503181	tentative detection of warm intervening gas towards pks 0548-322 with  xmm-newton	we present the results of a long (~93 ksec) xmm-newton observation of thebright bl-lac object pks 0548-322 (z=0.069). our reflection gratingspectrometer (rgs) spectrum shows a single absorption feature at an observedwavelength lambda=23.33 a, which we interpret as ovi ka absorption at z=0.058,i.e., ~3000 km/s from the background object. the observed equivalent width ofthe absorption line ~30 ma, coupled with the lack of the correspondingabsorption edge in the epic pn data, implies an ovi column density ~ 2 10^{16}cm-2 and turbulence with a doppler velocity parameter b&gt;100 km/s. within thelimitations of our rgs spectrum, no ovii or ov ka absorption are detected.under the assumption of ionisation equilibrium by both collisions and theextragalactic background, this is only marginally consistent if the gastemperature is ~250,000 k, with significantly lower or higher values beingexcluded by our limits on ov or ovii. if confirmed, this would be the firstx-ray detection of a large amount of intervening warm absorbing gas through oviabsorption. the existence of such a high column density absorber, much strongerthan any previously detected one in ovi, would place stringent constraints onthe large-scale distribution of baryonic gas in the universe.

astro-ph;0503618	submillimetre photometry of x-ray absorbed qsos: their formation and  evolutionary status	we present an analysis of the submillimetre/x-ray properties of 19 x-rayabsorbed, compton-thin quasi-stellar objects (qsos) selected to haveluminosities and redshifts which represent the peak of cosmic qso activity.i.e. ~l* objects at 1&lt;z&lt;3. of these, we present new data for 11 objects notpreviously observed at submillimetre wavelengths and additional data for afurther 3. the detection rate is 42 per cent, much higher than typicallyreported for samples of qsos. detection statistics show (at the 3-4 sigmalevel) that this sample of absorbed qsos has a higher submillimetre output thana matched sample of unabsorbed qsos. we argue that the far-infrared luminosityis produced by massive star formation. in this case, the correlation foundbetween far-infrared luminosity and redshift can be interpreted as cosmologicalevolution of the star-formation rate in the qso host galaxies. since thesubmillimetre luminous phase is confined to z&gt;1.5, the high star formationrates are consistent with a scenario in which the qsos evolve to become localluminous elliptical galaxies.  combining these results with previously published data for x-ray unabsorbedqsos and submillimetre-selected galaxies we propose the following evolutionarysequence: the forming galaxy is initially far-infrared luminous but x-ray weaksimilar to the sources discovered by the submillimetre common-user bolometerarray; as the black hole and spheroid grow with time a point is reached whenthe central qso becomes powerful enough to terminate the star formation andeject the bulk of the fuel supply (the compton-thin absorbed qso phase); thistransition is followed by a period of unobscured qso activity whichsubsequently declines to leave a quiescent spheroidal galaxy.

astro-ph;0506718	xmm-newton observations of the lockman hole iv: spectra of the brightest  agn	this paper presents the results of a detailed x-ray spectral analysis of asample of 123 x-ray sources (46 being type-1 agn and 28 type-2 agn) detectedwith xmm-newton in the lockman hole field. using a single power law model oursources' average spectral slope hardens at faint 0.5-2 kev fluxes but not atfaint 2-10 kev fluxes. we explain the effect in terms of an increase in x-rayabsorption at faint fluxes. the average spectral slope of our sources is ~1.9with an intrinsic dispersion of ~0.28. we detected x-ray absorption in 37% ofthe sources, ~10% in type-1 agn and ~77% in type-2 agn. using x-ray fluxescorrected for absorption, the fraction of absorbed objects and the absorbingcolumn density distribution did not vary with x-ray flux. our type-1 and type-2agn do not appear to have different continuum shapes, but the distribution ofintrinsic absorption is different among both classes. a significant fraction ofour type-2 agn (5 out of 28) were found to display no substantial absorption.we discuss possible interpretations to this in terms of compton-thick agn andintrinsic broad line region properties. an emission line compatible with fekalpha was detected in 8 sources with rest frame equivalent widths 120-1000 ev.the agn continuum or intrinsic absorption did not depend on x-ray luminosityand/or redshift. soft excess emission was detected in 18 objects, but only in 9could we fit this spectral component with a black body model. the 0.5-2 kevluminosities of the fitted black body were not significantly different intype-1 and type-2 agn, although the temperatures were slightly higher in type-2agn than in type-1 agn. for 9 sources (including 1 type-1 agn and 3 type-2 agn)a scattering model provided a better fit of the soft excess emission.

astro-ph;0511747	the nature of x-ray absorbed starburst qsos and the qso evolutionary  scheme	in contradiction to the simple agn unification schemes, there exists asignificant population of broad line, z~2 qsos which have heavily absorbedx-ray spectra. these objects have luminosities and redshifts characteristic ofthe sources that produce the bulk of the qso luminosity in the universe. ourfollow up observations in the submillimetre show that these qsos are embeddedin ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike most unabsorbed qsos at the sameredshifts and luminosities. the radically different star formation propertiesbetween the absorbed and unabsorbed qsos implies that the x-ray absorption isunrelated to the torus invoked in agn unification schemes. the most puzzlingquestion about these objects is the nature of the x-ray absorber. we presentour study of the x-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) xmm-newtonspectroscopy. the hypothesis of a normal qso continuum, coupled with a neutralabsorber is strongly rejected. we consider the alternative hypotheses for theabsorber, originating either in the qso or in the surrounding starburst.finally we discuss the implications for qso/host galaxy formation, in terms ofan evolutionary sequence of star formation and black hole growth. we proposethat both processes occur simultaneously in the gas-and-dust-rich heavilyobscured centres of young galaxies, and that absorbed qsos form a transitionalstage, between the main obscured growth phase, and the luminous qso.

astro-ph;0605236	on the x-ray, optical emission line and black hole mass properties of  local seyfert galaxies	we investigate the relation between x-ray nuclear emission, optical emissionline luminosities and black hole masses for a sample of 47 seyfert galaxies.the sample, which has been selected from the palomar optical spectroscopicsurvey of nearby galaxies (ho, filippenko &amp; sargent 1997), covers a wide rangeof nuclear powers, from l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down to very lowluminosities (l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). best available data from chandra,xmm-newton and, in a few cases, asca observations have been considered. thanksto the good spatial resolution available from these observations and a propermodeling of the various spectral components, it has been possible to obtainaccurate nuclear x-ray luminosities not contaminated by off-nuclear sourcesand/or diffuse emission. x-ray luminosities have then been corrected takinginto account the likely candidate compton thick sources, which are a highfraction (&gt; 30%) among type 2 seyferts in our sample. the main result of thisstudy is that we confirm strong linear correlations between 2-10 kev,[oiii]\lambda5007, h_{alpha} luminosities which show the same slope as quasarsand luminous seyfert galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activitydisplayed. moreover, despite the wide range of eddington ratios (l/l_{edd})tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down to ~ 10^{-7}), nocorrelation is found between the x-ray or optical emission line luminositiesand the black hole mass. our results suggest that seyfert nuclei in our sampleare consistent with being a scaled-down version of more luminous agn.

astro-ph;0610229	x-ray absorbed qsos and the qso evolutionary sequence	unexpected in the agn unified scheme, there exists a population of broad-linez~2 qsos which have heavily absorbed x-ray spectra. these objects constitute10% of the population at luminosities and redshifts characteristic of the mainproducers of qso luminosity in the universe. our follow up observations in thesubmm show that these qsos are often embedded in ultraluminous starburstgalaxies, unlike most qsos at the same redshifts and luminosities. theradically different star formation properties between the absorbed andunabsorbed qsos implies that the x-ray absorption is unrelated to the torusinvoked in agn unification schemes. instead, these results suggest that theobjects represent a transitional phase in an evolutionary sequence relating thegrowth of massive black holes to the formation of galaxies. the most puzzlingquestion about these objects has always been the nature of the x-ray absorber.we present our study of the x-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) xmm-newtonspectroscopy. we show that the absorption is most likely due to a dense ionisedwind driven by the qso. this wind could be the mechanism by which the qsoterminates the star formation in the host galaxy, and ends the supply ofaccretion material, to produce the present day black hole/spheroid mass ratio.

astro-ph;0610363	biased galaxy formation in the fields of high-redshift agn	we discuss preliminary results from our programme to map the fields ofhigh-redshift agn. in the context of the hierarchical models such fields arepredicted to contain an over-density of young, luminous galaxies destined toevolve into the core of a rich cluster by the present epoch. we have thusimaged from submillimetre to x-ray wavelengths the few-arcmin scale fields of asmall sample of high-redshift qsos. we find that submillimetre wavelength datafrom scuba show striking over-densities of luminous star-forming galaxies overscales of ~500 kpc. whilst many of these galaxies are undetected even in deepnear-ir imaging almost all of them are detected by spitzer at 4.5, 8.0 and 24um, showing that they have extremely red colours. however, they are notdetected in our xmm-newton observations suggesting that any agn must be highlyobscured. optical-through-mid-ir seds show the redshifted 1.6 um bump fromstar-light giving preliminary evidence that the galaxies lie at the sameredshift, and thus in the same structure, as the qso although this finding mustbe confirmed with photometric and/or spectroscopic redshifts.

0809.1939	high precision x-ray logn-logs distributions: implications for the  obscured agn population	we have constrained the extragalactic source count distributions over a broadrange of x-ray fluxes and in various energy bands to test whether thepredictions from x-ray background synthesis models agree with the observationalconstraints provided by our measurements. we have used 1129 xmm-newtonobservations at |b|&gt;20 deg covering a sky area of 132.3 deg^2 to compile thelargest complete samples of x-ray objects to date in the 0.5-1 kev, 1-2 kev,2-4.5 kev, 4.5-10 kev, 0.5-2 kev and 2-10 kev energy bands. our survey includesin excess of 30,000 sources down to ~10^-15 erg/cm^2/s below 2 kev and down to~10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s above 2 kev. a break in the source count distributions wasdetected in all energy bands except the 4.5-10 kev band. an analytical modelcomprising 2 power-law components cannot adequately describe the curvature seenin the source count distributions. the shape of the logn(&gt;s)-logs is stronglydependent on the energy band with a general steepening apparent as we move tohigher energies. this is due to non-agn populations, comprised mainly of starsand clusters of galaxies, contribute up to 30% of the source population atenergies &lt;2 kev and at fluxes &gt;10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, and these populations ofobjects have significantly flatter source count distributions than agn. we finda substantial increase in the relative fraction of hard x-ray sources at higherenergies, from &gt;55% below 2 kev to &gt;77% above 2 kev. however the majority ofsources detected above 4.5 kev still have significant flux below 2 kev.comparison with predictions from the synthesis models suggest that the modelsmight be overpredicting the number of faint absorbed agn, which would call forfine adjustment of some model parameters such as the obscured to unobscured agnratio and/or the distribution of column densities at intermediate obscuration.

astro-ph;0701546	the x-ray and radio connection in low-luminosity active nuclei	we present the results of the correlation between the nuclear 2-10 kev x-rayand radio (at 2cm, 6cm and 20cm) luminosities for a well defined sample oflocal seyfert galaxies. we use a sample of low luminosity radio galaxies(llrgs) for comparison. in both seyfert and llrgs samples, x-ray and radioluminosities are significantly correlated over 8 orders of magnitude,indicating that the x-ray and radio emission sources are strongly coupled.moreover, both samples show a similar regression slope, l(x)$\propto$l(r)^(0.97), but seyfert galaxies are three orders of magnitude less luminousin the radio band than llrgs. this suggests that either similar physicalmechanisms are responsible for the observed emission or a combination ofdifferent mechanisms ends up producing a similar correlation slope. indeed, thecommon belief for llrg is that both the x-ray and radio emission are likelydominated by a relativistic jet component, while in seyfert galaxies the x-rayemission probably arises from a disk-corona system and the radio emission isattributed to a jet/outflow component. we investigate the radio loudness issuein the two samples and find that the seyfert galaxies and the llrgs show adifferent distribution of the radio loudness parameters. no correlation isfound between the luminosity and the radio loudness, however the latter isrelated to the black hole mass and anti-correlated with the eddington ratio.the dichotomy in the radio loudness between seyfert and llrg observed down tolow eddington ratios, l(2-10)/l(edd) $\sim$ 10^(-8), does not support the ideathat the origin of the radio loudness is due to a switch in the accretion mode.

astro-ph;9508042	the deficit of distant galaxy clusters in the rixos x-ray survey	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems andtherefore provide an important way of studying the formation and evolution ofthe large scale structure of the universe. cluster evolution can be inferredfrom observations of the x-ray emission of the gas in distant clusters, butinterpreting these data is not straightforward. in a simplified view, clustersgrow from perturbations in the matter distribution: their intracluster gas iscompressed and shock-heated by the gravitational collapse$^{1}$. the resultingx-ray emission is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in thechanging gravitational potential. however, if processes such as radiativecooling or pre-collapse heating of the gas are important, then the x-rayevolution will be strongly influenced by the thermal history of the gas. herewe present the first results from a faint flux-limited sample of x-ray selectedclusters compiled as part of the rosat international x-ray and optical survey(rixos). very few distant clusters have been identified. most importantly,their redshift distribution appears to be inconsistent with simple models basedon the evolution of the gravitational potential. our results suggest thatradiative cooling or non-gravitational heating of the intracluster gas mustplay an important role in the evolution of clusters.

astro-ph;9603024	optical and x-ray properties of the rixos agn: i - the continua	we present measurements of the optical and x-ray continua of 108 agn (seyfert1s and quasars) from the rosat international x-ray/optical survey (rixos). thesample covers a wide range in redshift (0&lt;z&lt;3.3), in x-ray spectral slope (-1.5&lt;ax&lt;2.6) and in optical-to-x-ray ratio (0.4$&lt;aox&lt;1.5). a correlation is foundbetween ax and aox; similar correlations have recently been reported in otherx-ray and optical samples. we also identify previously unreported relationshipsbetween the optical slope (aopt) and ax (particularly at high redshifts) andbetween aopt and aox. these trends show that the overall optical-to-x-ray continuum changes from convex to concave as ax hardens, demonstrating a strong behavioural link between the optical/uv big blue bump (bbb) and the soft x-ray excess, which is consistent with them being part of the same spectral component.by constructing models of the optical-to-x-ray continuum, we demonstrate thatthe observed correlations are consistent with an intrinsic spectrum which is absorbed through different amounts of cold gas and dust. the intrinsic spectrumis the sum of an optical-to-soft x-ray `big bump' component and an ax=1 powerlaw; the column density of the cold gas ranges from 0 to ~4e21 cm-2 and thedust-to-gas ratio is assumed to be galactic. the `big bump' may be representedby a t~1e6 k thermal bremsstrahlung or an accretion disk with a surrounding hotcorona. the scatter in the data can accommodate a wide range in big bump temperature (or black hole mass) and strength. a source for the absorbing gas may bethe dusty, molecular torus which lies beyond the broad line-emitting regions,although with a much lower column density than observed in seyfert 2 galaxies.alternatively, it may be the bulge of a spiral host galaxy or an ellipticalhost galaxy.

astro-ph;9705180	measuring the power spectrum of density fluctuations at intermediate  redshift with x-ray background observations	the precision of intensity measurements of the extragalactic x-ray background(xrb) on an angular scale of about a degree is dominated by spatialfluctuations caused by source confusion noise. x-ray source counts at the fluxlevel responsible for these fluctuations will soon be accurately measured bynew missions and it will then be possible to detect the weaker fluctuationscaused by the clustering of the fainter, more distant sources which produce thebulk of the xrb. we show here that measurements of these excess fluctuations atthe level of 0.2 per cent are within reach, improving by an order of magnitudeon present upper limits. together with the redshift evolution of the x-rayvolume emissivity in the universe, this can be used to measure the powerspectrum of the density fluctuations at comoving wavevectors 0.01-0.1 h/mpc atz=1-2 with a sensitivity better than the predictions from large-scale structuremodels. a relatively simple x-ray experiment, carried out by a large-areaproportional counter with a 0.5-2 deg^2 collimated field-of-view scanning thewhole sky a few times, would be able to determine the power spectrum of thedensity fluctuations near its expected peak in wavevector with an accuracybetter than 10 per cent.

astro-ph;9708199	optical and x-ray properties of the rixos agn: ii - emission lines	we present the optical and uv emission line properties of 160 x-ray selectedagn taken from the rixos survey (including halpha, hbeta, [oiii]5007, mgii2798and ciii]1909). this sample is believed to contain a mixture of absorbed andunabsorbed objects, with column densities up to 4e21 cm-2. although thedistribution of the [oiii] ew for the rixos agn is typical of opticallyselected samples, the balmer line ews are relatively low. this is consistentwith the presence of a dust absorber between the broad and narrow line regions(eg. a molecular torus), and intrinsically weak optical line emission. we findbaldwin effects in ciii] and mgii, and a positive response of the mgii line toits ionizing continuum. there is a strong correlation between the ew and fwhmof mgii, which may be similar to that seen in other samples for hbeta. wedemonstrate that this is consistent with models which suggest two line-emittingzones, a `very broad line region' (vblr) and an `intermediate line region'(ilr). the correlation between ew and fwhm in mgii may be a physicalcharacteristic of the ilr or it may reflect a geometric dependence. we found nocorrelation between the hbeta fwhm and the slope of the x-ray spectrum, howeverthis may be due to the effects of dust absorption which suppresses the broadhbeta component, masking any relationship. the halpha fwhm does tend to benarrow when alpha_x is soft, and broadens as alpha_x hardens, although theformal probability for this correlation is low (91 per cent). if thedistribution of alpha_x in the rixos sample reflects the level of intrinsicabsorption in these agn, the data suggest a possible link between the velocityof the balmer line-emitting region and the amount of absorbing material beyond.

astro-ph;9804314	clustering of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei	a total of 235 active galactic nuclei (agn) from two different soft x-raysurveys (the rosat deep survey -drs- and the rosat international x-ray opticalsurvey -rixos-) with redshifts between 0 and 3.5 are used to study theclustering of x-ray selected agn and its evolution. a 2 sigma significantdetection of clustering of such objects is found on scales &lt;40-80/h mpc in therixos sample, while no clustering is detected on any scales in the drs sample.assuming a single power law model for the spatial correlation function (scf),quantitative limits on the agn clustering have been obtained: a comovingcorrelation length 1.5&lt;~ r_0 &lt;~ 3.3/h mpc is implied for comoving evolution,while 1.9 &lt;~ r_0 &lt;~ 4.8 for stable clustering and 2.2 &lt;~ r_0 &lt;~ 5.5 for linearevolution. these values are consistent with the correlation lengths andevolutions obtained for galaxy samples, but imply smaller amplitude or fasterevolution than recent uv and optically selected agn samples. we also constrainthe ratio of bias parameters between x-ray selected agn and iras galaxies to be  &lt;~1.7 on scales &lt;~ 10/h mpc, a significantly smaller value than is inferredfrom local large-scale dynamical studies.

astro-ph;9902238	soft x-ray spectral variations of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy  markarian 766	the x-ray variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 766 isstudied using 9 rosat pspc datasets. the spectrum is well described by a powerlaw combined with a blackbody (kt~ 70 ev) soft excess. examination of fluxratio changes and variability amplitude in 3 x-ray bands, shows that the powerlaw component varies continuously on time-scales of ~5000s and is steeper whenit is brighter. in contrast, variability of the soft excess is not detected.spectral modeling of 31 spectra from different observations and at a range ofcount rates is also consistent with a picture in which the power law is steeperwhen it is brighter, and in which the soft excess component does not vary. thepower law variability can be explained if the power law is produced by variablethermal or non-thermal comptonization of soft photons. this behaviour issimilar to that of galactic black hole candidates in the low state. the x-rayand multiwavelength properties of markarian 766 are shown to be very similar tothose of other narrow line seyfert 1s. this may mean that the rapid x-rayvariability seen in other narrow line seyfert 1s may also not originate intheir strong soft excess components.

astro-ph;9905188	x-ray spectra of the rixos source sample	we present results of an extensive study of the x-ray spectral properties ofsources detected in the rixos survey, that is nearly complete down to a fluxlimit of 3e-14 cgs (0.5-2 kev). we show that for x-ray surveys containingsources with low count rate spectral slopes estimated using simple hardnessratios in the rosat band can be biased. instead we analyse three-colour x-raydata using statistical techniques appropriate to the poisson regime whichremoves the effects of this bias. we have then applied this technique to therixos survey to study the spectral properties of the sample. for the agn wefind an average energy index of 1.05+-0.05 with no evidence for spectralevolution with redshift. individual agn are shown to have a range of propertiesincluding soft x-ray excesses and intrinsic absorption. narrow emission linegalaxies also seem to fit to a power-law spectrum, which may indicate anon-thermal origin for their x-ray emission. we infer that most of the clustersin the sample have a bremsstrahlung temperature &gt;3 kev, although some showevidence for a cooling flow. the stars deviate strongly from a power-law modelbut fit to a thermal model. finally, we have analysed the whole rixos samplecontaining 1762 sources. we find that the mean spectral slope of the sourceshardens at lower fluxes in agreement with results from other samples. however,a study of the individual sources demonstrates that the hardening of the meanis caused by the appearance of a population of very hard sources at the lowestfluxes. this has implications for the nature of the soft x-ray background.

astro-ph;9909434	an improved method of constructing binned luminosity functions	we show that binned differential luminosity functions constructed using the1/va method have a significant systematic error for objects close to theirparent sample's flux limit(s). this is particularly noticeable when luminosityfunctions are produced for a number of different redshift ranges as is commonin the study of agn or galaxy evolution. we present a simple method ofconstructing a binned luminosity function which overcomes this problem and hasa number of other advantages over the traditional 1/va method. we also describea practical method for comparing binned and model luminosity functions, bycalculating the expectation values of the binned luminosity function from themodel. binned luminosity functions produced by the two methods are compared forsimulated data and for the large bright qso survey (lbqs). it is shown that the1/va method produces a very misleading picture of evolution in the lbqs. thebinned luminosity function of the lbqs is then compared to a model two powerlaw luminosity function undergoing pure luminosity evolution from boyle et al.(1991). the comparison is made using a model luminosity function averaged overeach redshift shell, and using the expectation values for the binned luminosityfunction calculated from the model. the luminosity function averaged in eachredshift shell gives a misleading impression that the model over predicts thenumber of qsos at low luminosity even when model and data are consistent. theexpectation values show that there are significant differences between modeland data: the model overpredicts the number of low luminosity sources at bothlow and high redshift. the luminosity function does not appear to steepenrelative to the model as redshift increases.

0810.0460	average fe k-alpha emission from distant agn	one of the most important parameters in the xrb (x-ray background) synthesismodels is the average efficiency of accretion onto smbh (super-massive blackholes). this can be inferred from the shape of broad relativistic fe lines seenin x-ray spectra of agn (active galactic nuclei). several studies have tried tomeasure the mean fe emission properties of agn at different depths with verydifferent results. we compute the mean fe emission from a large andrepresentative sample of agn x-ray spectra up to redshift ~ 3.5. we developed amethod of computing the rest-frame x-ray average spectrum and applied it to alarge sample (more than 600 objects) of type 1 agn from two complementarymedium sensitivity surveys based on xmm-newton data, the axis and xwas samples.this method makes use of medium-to-low quality spectra without needing to fitcomplex models to the individual spectra but with computing a mean spectrum forthe whole sample. extensive quality tests were performed by comparing real tosimulated data, and a significance for the detection of any feature over anunderlying continuum was derived. we detect with a 99.9% significance anunresolved fe k-alpha emission line around 6.4 kev with an ew ~ 90 ev, but wefind no compelling evidence of any significant broad relativistic emission linein the final average spectrum. deviations from a power law around the narrowline are best represented by a reflection component arising from cold orlow-ionization material. we estimate an upper limit for the ew of anyrelativistic line of 400 ev at a 3 sigma confidence level. we also marginallydetect the so-called iwasawa-taniguchi effect on the ew for the unresolvedemission line, which appears weaker for higher luminosity agn.

0810.0544	an extreme exo: a type 2 qso at z=1.87	we aim to understand the multi-wavelength properties of 2xmm j123204+215255,the source with the most extreme x-ray-to-optical flux ratio amongst a sampleof bright x-ray selected exos drawn from a cross-correlation of the 2xmmpcatalogue with the sdss-dr5 catalogue. we use 2xmmp x-ray data, sdss-dr5, notand ukirt optical/nir photometric data and subaru moircs ir spectroscopy tostudy the properties of 2xmm j123204+215255. we created a model sed includingan obscured qso and the host galaxy component to constrain the optical/irextinction and the relative contribution of the agn and the galaxy to the totalemission. 2xmm j123204+215255 is a bright x-ray source with f_x~10^{-12} ergcm^{-2} s^{-1} (2-10 kev energy band) which has no detection down to amagnitude i' &gt; 25.2. nir imaging reveals a faint k-band counterpart and nirspectroscopy shows a single broad (fwhm=5300 km/s) emission line, which isalmost certainly h-alpha at z=1.87. the x-ray spectrum shows evidence ofsignificant absorption (n_h &gt; 10^{23} cm^{-2}), typical of type 2 agn, but thebroad h-alpha emission suggests a type 1 agn classification. the very redoptical/nir colours (i'-k &gt; 5.3) strongly suggest significant reddeninghowever. we find that simple modelling can successfully reproduce the nircontinuum and strongly constrain the intrinsic nuclear optical/ir extinction toa_v~4, which turns out to be much smaller than the expected from the x-rayabsorption (assuming galactic gas-to-dust ratio).

0811.1450	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey. vi. the x-ray luminosity function	we present the x-ray luminosity function of agn in three energy bands (soft:0.5-2 kev, hard: 2-10 kev and ultrahard: 4.5-7.5 kev). we have used the xmssurvey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallowersurveys for a total of 1009, 435 and 119 sources in the soft, hard andultrahard bands, respectively. we have modeled the intrinsic absorption of thehard and ultrahard sources (nh function) and computed the intrinsic x-rayluminosity function in all bands using a maximum likelihood fit technique to ananalytical model. we find that the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) is bestdescribed by a luminosity-dependent density evolution (ldde) model. our resultsshow a good overall agreement with previous results in the hard band, althoughwith slightly weaker evolution. our model in the soft band present slightdiscrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day xlfbeing significantly flatter. we find faster evolution in the agn detected inthe ultrahard band than those in the hard band. the fraction of absorbed agn inthe hard and ultrahard bands is dependent on the x-ray luminosity. we findevidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the hard band but notin the ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. our best-fit xlfshows that the high-luminosity agn are fully formed earlier than the lessluminous agn. the latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretionrate and mass density of the universe, according to an anti-hierarchical blackhole growth scenario.
