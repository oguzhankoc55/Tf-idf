0902.2013	large-scale non-gaussian mass function and halo bias: tests on n-body  simulations	the description of the abundance and clustering of halos for non-gaussianinitial conditions has recently received renewed interest, motivated by theforthcoming large galaxy and cluster surveys, which can potentially yieldconstraints of order unity on the non-gaussianity parameter f_{nl}. we presenttests on n-body simulations of analytical formulae describing the haloabundance and clustering for non-gaussian initial conditions. we calibrate theanalytic non-gaussian mass function of matarrese et al.(2000) and loverde etal.(2008) and the analytic description of clustering of halos for non-gaussianinitial conditions on n-body simulations. we find excellent agreement betweenthe simulations and the analytic predictions if we make the corrections delta_c--&gt; delta_c x sqrt{q} and delta_c --&gt; \delta_c x q where q ~ 0.75, in thedensity threshold for gravitational collapse and in the non-gaussian fractionalcorrection to the halo bias, respectively. we discuss the implications of thiscorrection on present and forecasted primordial non-gaussianity constraints. weconfirm that the non-gaussian halo bias offers a robust and highly competitivetest of primordial non-gaussianity.

0903.1861	studying the whim with gamma ray bursts	we assess the possibility to detect and characterize the physical state ofthe missing baryons at low redshift by analyzing the x-ray absorption spectraof the gamma ray burst [grb] afterglows, measured by a micro calorimeters-baseddetector with 3 ev resolution and 1000 cm2 effective area and capable of fastre-pointing, similar to that on board of the recently proposed x-ray satellitesedge and xenia. for this purpose we have analyzed mock absorption spectraextracted from different hydrodynamical simulations used to model theproperties of the warm hot intergalactic medium [whim]. these models predictthe correct abundance of ovi absorption lines observed in uv and satisfycurrent x-ray constraints. according to these models space missions like edgeand xenia should be able to detect about 60 whim absorbers per year through theovii line. about 45 % of these have at least two more detectable lines inaddition to ovii that can be used to determine the density and the temperatureof the gas. systematic errors in the estimates of the gas density andtemperature can be corrected for in a robust, largely model-independentfashion. the analysis of the grb absorption spectra collected in three yearswould also allow to measure the cosmic mass density of the whim with about 15 %accuracy, although this estimate depends on the whim model. our results suggestthat grbs represent a valid, if not preferable, alternative to active galacticnuclei to study the whim in absorption. the analysis of the absorption spectranicely complements the study of the whim in emission that the spectrometerproposed for edge and xenia would be able to carry out thanks to its highsensitivity and large field of view.

0904.3248	the clustering of galaxy clusters in cosmological models with  non-gaussian initial conditions: predictions for future surveys	we predict the biasing and clustering properties of galaxy clusters that areexpected to be observed in the catalogues produced by two forthcoming x-ray andsunyaev-zel'dovich effect surveys. we study a set of flat cosmological modelswhere the primordial density probability distribution shows deviations fromgaussianity in agreement with current observational bounds form the backgroundradiation. we consider both local and equilateral shapes for the primordialbispectrum in non-gaussian models. the two catalogues investigated are thoseproduced by the \emph{e}rosita wide survey and from a survey based on southpole telescope observations. it turns out that both the bias and observed powerspectrum of galaxy clusters are severely affected in non-gaussian models withlocal shape of the primordial bispectrum, especially at large scales. on theother hand, models with equilateral shape of the primordial bispectrum showonly a mild effect at all scales, that is difficult to be detected withclustering observations. between the two catalogues, the one performing betteris the \emph{e}rosita one, since it contains only the largest masses, that aremore sensitive to primordial non-gaussianity.

0909.4714	imprints of primordial non-gaussianities in x-ray and sz signals from  galaxy clusters	several inflationary models predict the possibility that the primordialperturbations of the density field may contain a degree of non-gaussianitywhich would influence the subsequent evolution of cosmic structures at largescales. in order to study their impact, we use a set of three cosmologicaldm-only simulations starting from initial conditions with different levels ofnon-gaussianity: f_nl=0,+/-100. more specifically, we focus on the distributionof galaxy clusters at different redshifts and, using suitable scalingrelations, we determine their x-ray and sz signals. our analysis allows us toestimate the differences in the logn-logs and logn-logy due to the differentinitial conditions and to predict the cluster counts at different redshiftsexpected for future surveys (erosita and spt). we also use a second set ofsimulations assuming a different cosmological scenario to estimate how thedependence on f_nl is degenerate with respect to other parameters. our resultsindicate that the effects introduced by a realistic amount of primordialnon-gaussianity are small when compared to the ones connected with currentuncertainties in cosmological parameters, particularly with sigma_8. however,if future surveys will be associated with optical follow-up campaigns todetermine the cluster redshift, an analysis of the samples at z&gt;1 can providesignificant constraints on f_nl. in particular we predict that the spt clustersurvey will be able to detect ~1000 clusters at z&gt;1 for the gaussian case, witha difference of 15-20 per cent associated to f_nl=+/-100.

0707.2614	x-mas2: study systematics on the icm metallicity measurements	(abridged)the x-ray measurements of the icm metallicity are becoming morefrequent due to the availability of powerful x-ray telescope with excellentspatial and spectral resolutions. the information which can be extracted fromthe measurements of the alpha-elements, like oxygen, magnesium and silicon withrespect to the iron abundance is extremely important to better understand thestellar formation and its evolutionary history. in this paper we investigatepossible source of bias connected to the plasma physics when recovering metalabundances from x-ray spectra. to do this we analyze 6 simulated galaxyclusters processed through the new version of our x-ray map simulator, whichallows to create mock xmm-newton epic mos1 and mos2 observations. by comparingthe spectroscopic results to the input values we find that: i) fe is recoveredwith high accuracy for both hot (t&gt;3 kev) and cold (t&lt;2 kev) systems; atintermediate temperatures, however, we find a systematic overestimate whichdepends on the number counts; ii) o is well recovered in cold clusters, whilein hot systems its measure may overestimate by a factor up to 2-3; iii) being aweak line, the measurement of mg is always difficult; despite of this, for coldsystems (t&lt;2 kev) we do not find any systematic behavior, while for very hotsystems (t&gt;5 kev) the spectroscopic measurement may be strongly overestimatedup to a factor of 4; iv) si is well recovered for all the clusters in oursample. we investigate in detail the nature of the systematic effects andbiases found. we conclude that they are mainly connected with themulti-temperature nature of the projected observed spectra and to the intrinsiclimitation of the xmm-newton epic spectral resolution that does not alwaysallow to disentangle among the emission lines produced by different elements.

0912.4112	cosmic shear statistics in cosmologies with non-gaussian initial  conditions	we computed the power spectrum of weak cosmic shear in models withnon-gaussian primordial density fluctuations. cosmological initial conditionsdeviating from gaussianity have recently attracted much attention in theliterature, especially with respect to their effect on the formation ofnon-linear structures and because of the bounds that they can put on theinflationary epoch. the fully non-linear matter power spectrum was evaluatedwith the use of the physically motivated, semi-analytic halo model, where themass function and linear halo bias were suitably corrected for non-gaussiancosmologies. in agreement with previous work, we found that a level ofnon-gaussianity compatible with cmb bounds and with positive skewness producesan increase in power of the order of a few percent at intermediate scales. wethen used the matter power spectrum, together with observationally motivatedbackground source redshift distributions in order to compute the cosmologicalweak lensing power spectrum. we found that the degree of deviation from thepower spectrum of the reference gaussian model is small compared to thestatistical error expected from even future weak lensing surveys. however,summing the signal over a large range of multipoles can beat down the noise,bringing to a significant detection of non-gaussianity at the level of$|f_\mathrm{nl}| \simeq $ few tens, when all other cosmological parameters areheld fixed. finally, we have shown that the constraints on the level ofnon-gaussianity can be improved by $\sim 20%$ with the use of weak lensingtomography.

1002.1625	abell 611. ii. x-ray and strong lensing analyses	we present the results of our analyses of the x-ray emission and of thestrong lensing systems in the relaxed galaxy cluster abell 611 (z=0.288). weinfer the x-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles ofthe intra-cluster medium within the radius r ~ 700 kpc through a non-parametricapproach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adoptinga matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of abell611 via the x-ray data. we derive the total projected mass in the centralregion of abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensingfeatures through the publicly available analysis software lenstool. as a finalstep we compare the results obtained with both methods. we derive a goodagreement between the x-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in thecentral region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginaldisagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating thestrong lensing results in the outer spatial range. we suggest that in this casethe x-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrectestimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of thedark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different masscomponents in the strong lensing analysis. we discuss the effect of somepossible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. we find a slightdependence of the measurements of the x-ray temperatures (and therefore of thex-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, withtotal deviations on the value of m_200 of the order of the 1-sigma statisticalerror. the strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to theparameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, inparticular to the modelling of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) baryoniccomponent.

1002.1882	primordial density perturbations with running spectral index: impact on  non-linear cosmic structures	(abridged) we explore the statistical properties of non-linear cosmicstructures in a flat $\lambda$cdm cosmology in which the index of theprimordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is allowed to depend on thescale. within the inflationary paradigm, the running of the scalar spectralindex can be related to the properties of the inflaton potential, and it ishence of critical importance to test it with all kinds of observations, whichcover the linear and non-linear regime of gravitational instability. we focuson the amount of running $\alpha_{\mathrm{s},0}$ allowed by an updatedcombination of cmb anisotropy data and the 2df galaxy redshift survey. ouranalysis constrains $\alpha_{\mathrm{s},0} = -0.051^{+0.047}_{-0.053}$$(-0.034^{+0.039}_{-0.040})$ at 95% confidence level when (not) taking intoaccount primordial gravitational waves in a ratio as predicted by canonicalsingle field inflation, in agreement with other works. for the cosmologicalmodels best fitting the data both with and without running we studied theabundance of galaxy clusters and of rare objects, the halo bias, theconcentration of dark matter halos, the baryon acoustic oscillation, the powerspectrum of cosmic shear, and the integrated sachs-wolfe effect. we find thatcounting galaxy clusters in future x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich surveys coulddiscriminate between the two models, more so if broad redshift informationabout the cluster samples will be available. likewise, measurements of thepower spectrum of cosmological weak lensing as performed by planned all-skyoptical surveys such as euclid could detect a running of the primordialspectral index, provided the uncertainties about the source redshiftdistribution and the underlying matter power spectrum are well under control.

1003.0841	the potential of x-ray cluster surveys to constrain primordial  non-gaussianity	we present forecasts for constraints on deviations from gaussian distributionof primordial density perturbations from future x-ray surveys of galaxyclusters. our analysis is based on computing the fisher-matrix for numbercounts and large-scale power spectrum of clusters. we consider a survey withhigh-sensitivity and wide-area to detect about 2.5 x 10^5 extended sources.based on the self-calibration approach, and including planck priors in ouranalysis, we constrain 9 cosmological parameters and 4 nuisance parameters,which define the relation between cluster mass and x-ray flux. because of thescale dependence of large-scale bias induced by local-shape non-gaussianity, wefind that the power spectrum provides strong constraints on the non-gaussianityf_nl parameter, which complement the stringent constraints on the powerspectrum normalization, \sigma_8, from the number counts. to quantify the jointconstraints on theese two parameters, that specify the timing of structureformation for a fixed background expansion, we define the figure-of-meritfom_sft = (det[cov(sigma_8,f_nl)])^{-1/2}. we find that our surveys constraindeviations from gaussianity with a precision of \delta f_nl~10 at 1 \sigmaconfidence level, with fom_sft~39. we point out that constraints on f_nl areweakly sensitive to the uncertainties in the knowledge of nuisance parameters.as an application of non-gaussian constraints from available data, we analysethe impact of positive skewness on the occurrence of xmmu-j2235, a massivedistant cluster discovered at z~1.4. we confirm that in a wmap-7 gaussianlambda cdm cosmology, within the survey volume, ~5x10^{-3} objects like thisare expected to be found: to increase this probability by a factor of at least10, one needs to evade either the available constraints on f_nl or sigma_8.

1005.0242	a numerical study of the effects of primordial non-gaussianities on weak  lensing statistics	while usually cosmological initial conditions are assumed to be gaussian,inflationary theories can predict a certain amount of primordialnon-gaussianity which can have an impact on the statistical properties of thelensing observables. in order to evaluate this effect, we build a large set ofrealistic maps of different lensing quantities starting from light-conesextracted from large dark-matter only n-body simulations with initialconditions corresponding to different levels of primordial localnon-gaussianity strength $f_{\rm nl}$. considering various statisticalquantities (pdf, power spectrum, shear in aperture, skewness and bispectrum) wefind that the effect produced by the presence of primordial non-gaussianity isrelatively small, being of the order of few per cent for values of $|f_{\rmnl}|$ compatible with the present cmb constraints and reaching at most 10-15per cent for the most extreme cases with $|f_{\rm nl}|=1000$. we also discussthe degeneracy of this effect with the uncertainties due to the power spectrumnormalization $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter $\omega_{\rm m}$, findingthat an error in the determination of $\sigma_8$ ($\omega_{\rm m}$) of about 3(10) per cent gives differences comparable with non-gaussian models having$f_{\rm nl}=\pm 1000$. these results suggest that the possible presence of anamount of primordial non-gaussianity corresponding to $|f_{\rm nl}|=100$ is nothampering a robust determination of the main cosmological parameters in presentand future weak lensing surveys, while a positive detection of deviations fromthe gaussian hypothesis is possible only breaking the degeneracy with othercosmological parameters and using data from deep surveys covering a largefraction of the sky.

1101.4175	imprints of primordial non-gaussianity on the number counts of cosmic  shear peaks	we studied the effect of primordial non-gaussianity with varied bispectrumshapes on the number counts of signal-to-noise peaks in wide field cosmic shearmaps. the two cosmological contributions to this particular weak lensingstatistic, namely the chance projection of large scale structure and theoccurrence of real, cluster-sized dark matter halos, have been modeledsemi-analytically, thus allowing to easily introduce the effect of non-gaussianinitial conditions. we performed a fisher matrix analysis by taking intoaccount the full covariance of the peak counts in order to forecast the jointconstraints on the level of primordial non-gaussianity and the amplitude of thematter power spectrum that are expected by future wide field imaging surveys.we find that positive-skewed non-gaussianity increases the number counts ofcosmic shear peaks, more so at high signal-to-noise values, where the signal ismostly dominated by massive clusters as expected. the increment is at the levelof ~1 for f_nl=10 and ~10 for f_nl=100 for a local shape of the primordialbispectrum, while different bispectrum shapes give generically a smallereffect. for a future survey on the model of the proposed esa space missioneuclid and by avoiding the strong assumption of being capable to distinguishthe weak lensing signal of galaxy clusters from chance projection of largescale structures we forecasted a 1-sigma error on the level of non-gaussianityof ~30-40 for the local and equilateral models, and of ~100-200 for the lessexplored enfolded and orthogonal bispectrum shapes.

1103.0044	comparison of an x-ray selected sample of massive lensing clusters with  the marenostrum universe lcdm simulation	a long-standing problem of strong lensing by galaxy clusters regards theobserved high rate of giant gravitational arcs as compared to the predictionsin the framework of the "standard" cosmological model. recently, few otherinconsistencies between theoretical expectations and observations have beenclaimed which regard the large size of the einstein rings and the highconcentrations of few clusters with strong lensing features. all of theseproblems consistently indicate that observed galaxy clusters may begravitational lenses stronger than expected. we use clusters extracted from themarenostrum universe to build up mock catalogs of galaxy clusters selectedthrough their x-ray flux. we use these objects to estimate the probabilitydistributions of lensing cross sections, einstein rings, and concentrations forthe sample of 12 macs clusters at $z&gt;0.5$ presented in ebeling et al. (2007)and discussed in zitrin et al. (2010). we find that simulated clusters produce$\sim 50%$ less arcs than observed clusters do. the medians of thedistributions of the einstein ring sizes differ by $\sim 25%$ betweensimulations and observations. we estimate that, due to cluster triaxiality andorientation biases affecting the lenses with the largest cross sections, theconcentrations of the individual macs clusters inferred from the lensinganalysis should be up to a factor of $\sim 2$ larger than expected from the$\lambda$cdm model. the arc statistics, the einstein ring, and theconcentration problems in strong lensing clusters are mitigated but not solvedon the basis of our analysis. nevertheless, due to the lack of redshifts formost of the multiple image systems used for modeling the macs clusters, theresults of this work will need to be verified with additional data. theupcoming clash program will provide an ideal sample for extending ourcomparison (abridged).

1103.5396	the effect of primordial non-gaussianity on the skeleton of cosmic shear  maps	(abridged) we explore the imprints of deviations from gaussian primordialdensity fluctuations on the skeleton of the large-scale matter distribution asmapped through cosmological weak lensing. we computed the skeleton length ofsimulated effective convergence maps covering $\sim 35$ sq. deg each, extractedfrom a suite of cosmological $n-$body runs with different levels of localprimordial non-gaussianity. the latter is expected to alter the structureformation process with respect to the fiducial gaussian scenario, and thus toleave a signature on the cosmic web. we found that alterations of the initialconditions consistently modify both the cumulative and the differentialskeleton length, although the effect is generically smaller than the cosmicvariance and depends on the smoothing of the map prior to the skeletoncomputation. nevertheless, the qualitative shape of these deviations is rathersimilar to their primordial counterparts, implying that skeleton statisticsretain good memory of the initial conditions. we performed a statisticalanalysis in order to find out at what confidence level primordialnon-gaussianity could be constrained by the skeleton test on cosmic shear mapsof the size we adopted. at 68.3% confidence level we found an error on themeasured level of primordial non-gaussianity of $\delta f_\mathrm{nl}\sim 300$,while at 90% confidence level it is of $\delta f_\mathrm{nl}\sim 500$. whilethese values by themselves are not competitive with the current constraints,weak lensing maps larger than those used here would have a smallerfield-to-field variance, and thus would likely lead to tighter constraints. arough estimate indicates $\delta f_\mathrm{nl} \sim$ a few tens at 68.3%confidence level for an all-sky weak lensing survey.

1105.4099	on a novel approach using massive clusters at high redshifts as  cosmological probe	in this work we propose a novel method for testing the validity of thefiducial lcdm cosmology by measuring the cumulative distribution function ofthe most massive haloes in a sample of subvolumes of identical size tiled onthe sky at a fixed redshift. the fact that the most massive clusters probe thehigh-mass tail of the mass function, where the difference between lcdm andalternative cosmological models is strongest, makes our method particularlyinteresting as a cosmological probe. we utilise general extreme valuestatistics (gev) to obtain a cumulative distribution function of the mostmassive objects in a given volume. we sample this distribution functionaccording to the number of patches covered by the survey area for a range ofdifferent "test cosmologies" and for differently accurate mass estimations ofthe haloes. by fitting this sample with the gev distribution function, we canstudy which parameters are the most sensitive with respect to the testcosmologies. we find that the peak of the probability distribution function ofthe most massive halo is well suited to test the validity of the fiducial lcdmmodel, once we are able to establish a sufficiently complete large-area surveywith m_lim=10^14.5 m_sun/h (m_lim=10^14 m_sun/h) at redshifts above z=1(z=1.5). being of cumulative nature the proposed measure is robust and anaccuracy of 20-30% in the cluster masses would be sufficient to test foralternative models. since one only needs the most massive system in eachangular patch, this method would be ideally suited as a first fast consistencycheck before going into a more complex statistical analysis of the observedhalo sample.

1106.3987	matter power spectra in dynamical-dark energy cosmologies	(abridged) we used a suite of numerical cosmological simulations in order toinvestigate the effect of gas cooling and star formation on the large scalematter distribution. the simulations follow the formation of cosmic structuresin five different dark energy models: the fiducial $\lambda$cdm cosmology andfour models where the dark energy density is allowed to have a non-trivialredshift evolution. for each cosmology we have a control run with dark matteronly, in order to allow a direct assessment of the impact of baryonicprocesses. we found that the power spectra of gas and stars, as well as thetotal matter power spectrum, are in qualitative agreement with the results ofprevious works in the framework of the fiducial model, although severalquantitative differences exist. we used the halo model in order to investigatethe backreaction of gas and stars on the dark matter distribution, finding thatit is very well reproduced by increasing the average dark matter haloconcentration by 17%, irrespective of the mass. moving to model universesdominated by dynamical dark energy, it turns out that they introduce a specificsignature on the power spectra of the various matter components, that isqualitatively independent of the exact cosmology considered. this generic shapeis well captured by the halo model, however the finer details of the darkmatter power spectrum can be precisely captured only at the cost of a fewslight modifications to the ingredients entering the model. the backreaction ofbaryons onto the dark matter distribution works pretty much in the same way asin the reference $\lambda$cdm model. nonetheless, the increment in averageconcentration is less pronounced than in the fiducial model (only $\sim 10%$),in agreement with a series of other clues pointing toward the fact that starformation is less efficient when dark energy displays a dynamical evolution.

1111.1556	structure formation in cosmologies with oscillating dark energy	{abridged} we study the imprints on the formation and evolution of cosmicstructures of dynamical dark energy models, characterized by an oscillatingequation of state. the redshift evolution of the equation of state parameterw(z) for dark energy is characterized by two parameters, describing theamplitude and the frequency of the oscillations. we consider six differentoscillating dark energy models, each characterized by a different set ofparameter values. under the common assumption that dark energy is notclustering on the scales of interest, we study different aspects of cosmicstructure formation. in particular, we self-consistently solve the sphericalcollapse problem. we then estimate the behavior of several cosmologicalobservables, such as the linear growth factor, the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw)effect, the number counts of massive structures, and the matter and cosmicshear power spectra. we show that, independently of the amplitude and thefrequency of the dark energy oscillations, none of the aforementionedobservables show an oscillating behavior as a function of redshift. this is aconsequence of the said observables' being integrals over some functions of theexpansion rate over cosmic history. we also notice that deviations with respectto the expectations for a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology are generically small,and in the majority of the cases distinguishing an oscillating dark energymodel would be difficult. exceptions to this conclusion are provided by thecosmic shear power spectrum, which for some of the models shows a difference atthe level of \sim 10% over a wide range of angular scales, and the abundance ofgalaxy clusters, which is modified at the $\sim 10-20%$ level at $z \gtrsim0.6$ for future wide weak lensing surveys.

1202.4275	the effect of feedback on the emission properties of the warm-hot  intergalactic medium	at present, 30-40 per cent of the baryons in the local universe is stillundetected. according to theoretical predictions, this gas should reside infilaments filling the large-scale structure (lss) in the form of a warm-hotintergalactic medium (whim), at temperatures of 10^5 - 10^7 k, thus emitting inthe soft x-ray energies via free-free interaction and line emission from heavyelements. in this work we characterize the properties of the x-ray emission ofthe whim, and the lss in general, focusing on the influence of differentphysical mechanisms, namely galactic winds (gws), black-hole feedback andstar-formation, and providing estimates of possible observational constraints.to this purpose we use a set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations thatinclude a self-consistent treatment of star-formation and chemical enrichmentof the intergalactic medium, that allows us to follow the evolution ofdifferent metal species. we construct a set of simulated light-cones to makepredictions of the emission in the 0.3-10 kev energy range. we obtain that gwsincrease by a factor of 2 the emission of both galaxy clusters and whim. theamount of oxygen at average temperature and, consequently, the amount ofexpected bright ovii and oviii lines is increased by a factor of 3 due to gwsand by 20 per cent when assuming a top-heavy imf. we compare our results withcurrent observational constraints and find that the emission from faint groupsand whim should account from half to all of the unresolved x-ray background inthe 1-2 kev band.

1204.2229	constraining primordial non-gaussianity with cosmological weak lensing:  shear and flexion	we examine the cosmological constraining power of future large-scale weaklensing surveys on the model of \emph{euclid}, with particular reference toprimordial non-gaussianity. our analysis considers several different estimatorsof the projected matter power spectrum, based on both shear and flexion, forwhich we review the covariances and fisher matrices. the bounds provided bycosmic shear alone for the local bispectrum shape, marginalized over$\sigma_8$, are at the level of $\delta f_\mathrm{nl} \sim 100$. we considerthree additional bispectrum shapes, for which the cosmic shear constraintsrange from $\delta f_\mathrm{nl}\sim 340$ (equilateral shape) up to $\deltaf_\mathrm{nl}\sim 500$ (orthogonal shape). the competitiveness of cosmicflexion constraints against cosmic shear ones depends on the galaxy intrinsicflexion noise, that is still virtually unconstrained. adopting the very highvalue that has been occasionally used in the literature results in the flexioncontribution being basically negligible with respect to the shear one, and forrealistic configurations the former does not improve significantly theconstraining power of the latter. since the flexion noise decreases withdecreasing scale, by extending the analysis up to $\ell_\mathrm{max} = 20,000$cosmic flexion, while being still subdominant, improves the shear constraintsby $\sim 10%$ when added. however on such small scales the highly non-linearclustering of matter and the impact of baryonic physics make any errorestimation uncertain. by considering lower, and possibly more realistic, valuesof the flexion intrinsic shape noise results in flexion constraining powerbeing a factor of $\sim 2$ better than that of shear, and the bounds on$\sigma_8$ and $f_\mathrm{nl}$ being improved by a factor of $\sim 3$ upontheir combination.

1209.6332	constraining primordial magnetic fields with future cosmic shear surveys	the origin of astrophysical magnetic fields observed in galaxies and clustersof galaxies is still unclear. one possibility is that primordial magneticfields generated in the early universe provide seeds that grow throughcompression and turbulence during structure formation. a cosmological magneticfield present prior to recombination would produce substantial matterclustering at intermediate/small scales, on top of the standard inflationarypower spectrum. in this work we study the effect of this alteration on oneparticular cosmological observable, cosmic shear. we adopt the semi-analytichalo model in order to describe the non-linear clustering of matter, and feedit with the altered mass variance induced by primordial magnetic fields. wefind that the convergence power spectrum is, as expected, substantiallyenhanced at intermediate/small angular scales, with the exact amplitude of theenhancement depending on the magnitude and power-law index of the magneticfield power spectrum. we use the predicted statistical errors for a futurewide-field cosmic shear survey, on the model of the esa cosmic vision mission\emph{euclid}, in order to forecast constraints on the amplitude of primordialmagnetic fields as a function of the spectral index. we find that the amplitudewill be constrained at the level of $\sim 0.1$ ng for $n_b\sim -3$, and at thelevel of $\sim 10^{-7}$ ng for $n_b\sim 3$. the latter is at the same level oflower bounds coming from the secondary emission of gamma-ray sources, implyingthat for high spectral indices \emph{euclid} will certainly be able to detectprimordial magnetic fields, if they exist. the present study shows howlarge-scale structure surveys can be used for both understanding the origins ofastrophysical magnetic fields and shedding new light on the physics of thepre-recombination universe.

1303.2621	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). a support  vector machine classification of galaxies, stars and agns	the aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive method for classifyingsources in large sky surveys and we apply the techniques to the vimos publicextragalactic redshift survey (vipers). using the optical (u*, g', r', i') andnir data (z', ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, foridentifying stars, agns and galaxies improving the purity of the vipers sample.support vector machine (svm) supervised learning algorithms allow the automaticclassification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensionalparameter space. in this work, we tailored the svm for classifying stars, agnsand galaxies, and applied this classification to the vipers data. we train thesvm using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the vipers and vvds surveys.we tested two svm classifiers and concluded that including nir data cansignificantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. the self-check of thebest optical + nir classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification ofgalaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for agns in the 5-dimensional colour space. inthe test on vipers sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier givesan accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for agns. themethod was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify theirclassification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4900 objects. we conclude that the svm algorithm trained on a carefully selectedsample of galaxies, agns, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selectionmethods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification methodparticularly suitable for modern large surveys.

1303.6506	large-scale inhomogeneities of the intracluster medium: improving mass  estimates using the observed azimuthal scatter	using a set of hydrodynamical simulations of 62 galaxy clusters and groups westudy the icm of inhomogeneities, focusing on the ones on the large scale that,unlike clumps, are the most difficult to identify. to this purpose we introducethe concept of residual clumpiness, c_r, that quantifies the large-scaleinhomogeneity of the icm. after showing that this quantity can be robustlydefined for relaxed systems, we characterize how it varies with radius, massand dynamical state of the halo. most importantly, we observe that itintroduces an overestimate in the determination of the density profile from thex-ray emission, which translates into a systematic overestimate of 6 (12)% inthe measurement of m_gas at r_200 for our relaxed (perturbed) cluster sample.at the same time, the increase of c_r with radius introduces also a ~2%systematic underestimate in the measurement of the hydrostatic-equilibrium mass(m_he), which adds to the previous one generating a systematic ~8.5%overestimate in f_gas in our relaxed sample. since the residual clumpiness ofthe icm is not directly observable, we study its correlation with the azimuthalscatter in the x-ray surface brightness of the halo and in the y-parameterprofiles. we find that their correlation is highly significant (r_s = 0.6-0.7),allowing to define the azimuthal scatter measured in the x-ray surfacebrightness profile and in the y-parameter as robust proxies of c_r. afterproviding a function that connects the two quantities, we obtain thatcorrecting the observed gas density profiles using the azimuthal scattereliminates the bias in the measurement of m_gas for relaxed objects, whichbecomes (0+/-2)% up to 2r_200, and reduces it by a factor of 3 for perturbedones. this method allows also to eliminate the systematics on the measurementsof m_he and f_gas, although a significant halo to halo scatter remains.(abridged)

1310.3380	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): $\omega_{\rm  m_0}$ from the galaxy clustering ratio measured at $z \sim 1$	we use a sample of about 22,000 galaxies at $0.65&lt;z&lt;1.2$ from the viperspdr-1 catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement ofthe galaxy {\it clustering ratio} $\eta_{g,r}$. this statistic has favourableproperties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing thesmoothed density field in spheres of given radius $r$: the value of itscorrelation function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nr)$, and its variance$\sigma^2(r)$. for sufficiently large values of $r$, this is a universalnumber, capturing 2-point clustering information independently of the linearbias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. inthis paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,r}$to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selectioneffects which are typical of redshift surveys as vipers. we verify the accuracyand efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the surveyselection process. these results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,r}$ tonon-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its verydefinition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected.  we measure $\omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. in addition to the greatprecision achieved on our estimation of $\omega_m$ using vipers pdr-1, thisresult is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recentestimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained applying the same technique to the sdss-lrgcatalogue. it, therefore, suports the robustness of the present analysis.moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and othercosmological probes such as baos, cmb and supernovae.

0802.1200	statistical properties of sz and x-ray cluster detections	aims. we calibrate the number density, completeness, reliability and thelower mass limit of galaxy-cluster detections through their thermal sz signal,and compare them to x-ray cluster detections.  methods. we simulate maps of the thermal sz effect and the x-ray emissionfrom light cones constructed in a large, hydrodynamical, cosmologicalsimulation volume, including realistic noise contributions. the maps areconvolved with linear, optimised, single- and multi-band filters to identifylocal peaks and their signal-to-noise ratios. the resulting peak catalogues arethen compared to the halo population in the simulation volume to identify trueand spurious detections.  results. multi-band filtering improves the statistics of sz clusterdetections considerably compared to single-band filtering. observations withthe characteristics of act detect clusters with masses m&gt;6-9e13 m_o/h, quiteindependent of redshift, reach 50% completeness at ~1e14 m_o/h and 100%completeness at ~2e14 m_o/h. samples are contaminated by only a few per centspurious detections. this is broadly comparable to x-ray cluster detectionswith xmm-newton with 100 ks exposure time in the soft band, except that themass limit for x-ray detections increases much more steeply with redshift thanfor sz detections. a comparison of true and filtered signals in the sz andx-ray maps confirms that the filters introduce at most a negligible bias.

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1401.3745	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). never mind the  gaps: comparing techniques to restore homogeneous sky coverage	[abridged] non-uniform sampling and gaps in sky coverage are common in galaxyredshift surveys, but these effects can degrade galaxy counts-in-cells anddensity estimates. we carry out a comparison of methods that aim to fill thegaps to correct for the systematic effects. our study is motivated by theanalysis of the vimos extragalactic redshift survey (vipers), a flux-limitedsurvey (i&lt;22.5) based on one-pass observations with vimos, with gaps covering25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%. our findings areapplicable to other surveys with similar observing strategies. we compare 1)two algorithms based on photometric redshift, that assign redshifts to galaxiesbased on the spectroscopic redshifts of the nearest neighbours, 2) two bayesianmethods, the wiener filter and the poisson-lognormal filter. using galaxy mockcatalogues we quantify the accuracy of the counts-in-cells measurements onscales of r=5 and 8 mpc/h after applying each of these methods. we also studyhow they perform to account for spectroscopic redshift error and inhomogeneousand sparse sampling rate. we find that in vipers the errors in counts-in-cellsmeasurements on r&lt;10 mpc/h scales are dominated by the sparseness of thesample. all methods underpredict by 20-35% the counts at high densities. thissystematic bias is of the same order as random errors. no method outperformsthe others. random and systematic errors decrease for larger cells. we showthat it is possible to separate the lowest and highest densities on scales of 5mpc/h at redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1, over a large volume such as in vipers survey.this is vital for the characterisation of cosmic variance and rare populations(e.g, brightest galaxies) in environmental studies at these redshifts.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

0803.0656	strong lensing statistics and the power spectrum normalisation	we use semi-analytic modelling of the galaxy-cluster population and itsstrong lensing efficiency to explore how the expected abundance of largegravitational arcs on the sky depends on $\sigma_8$. our models take alleffects into account that have been shown to affect strong cluster lensingsubstantially, in particular cluster asymmetry, substructure, merging, andvariations in the central density concentrations. we show that the opticaldepth for long and thin arcs increases by approximately one order of magnitudewhen $\sigma_8$ increases from 0.7 to 0.9, owing to a constructive combinationof several effects. models with high $\sigma_8$ are also several orders ofmagnitude more efficient in producing arcs at intermediate and high redshifts.finally, we use realistic source number counts to quantitatively predict thetotal number of arcs brighter than several magnitude limits in the r and ibands. we confirm that, while $\sigma_8\sim0.9$ may come close to the knownabundance of arcs, even $\sigma_8\sim0.8$ falls short by almost an order ofmagnitude in reproducing known counts. we conclude that, should$\sigma_8\sim0.8$ be confirmed, we would fail to understand the strong-lensingefficiency of the galaxy cluster population, and in particular the abundance ofarcs in high-redshift clusters. we argue that early-dark energy or non-gaussiandensity fluctuations may indicate one way out of this problem.

0805.0276	the mass density field in simulated non-gaussian scenarios	in this work we study the properties of the mass density field in thenon-gaussian world models simulated by grossi et al. 2007. in particular wefocus on the one-point density probability distribution function of the massdensity field in non-gausian models with quadratic non-linearities quantifiedby the usual parameter f_nl. we find that the imprints of primordialnon-gaussianity are well preserved in the negative tail of the probabilityfunction during the evolution of the density perturbation. the effect isalready noticeable at redshifts as large as 4 and can be detected out to thepresent epoch. at z=0 we find that the fraction of the volume occupied byregions with underdensity delta &lt; -0.9, typical of voids, is about 1.3 per centin the gaussian case and increases to ~2.2 per cent if f_nl=-1000 whiledecreases to ~0.5 per cent if f_nl=+1000. this result suggests that void-basedstatistics may provide a powerful method to detect non-gaussianity even at lowredshifts which is complementary to the measurements of the higher-ordermoments of the probability distribution function like the skewness or thekurtosis for which deviations from the gaussian case are detected at the 25-50per cent level.

1505.02165	next generation cosmology: constraints from the euclid galaxy cluster  survey	we study the characteristics of the galaxy cluster samples expected from theeuropean space agency's euclid satellite and forecast constraints oncosmological parameters describing a variety of cosmological models. the methodused in this paper, based on the fisher matrix approach, is the same one usedto provide the constraints presented in the euclid red book (laureijs etal.2011). we describe the analytical approach to compute the selection functionof the photometric and spectroscopic cluster surveys. based on the photometricselection function, we forecast the constraints on a number of cosmologicalparameter sets corresponding to different extensions of the standard lambdacdmmodel. the dynamical evolution of dark energy will be constrained to deltaw_0=0.03 and delta w_a=0.2 with free curvature omega_k, resulting in a(w_0,w_a) figure of merit (fom) of 291. including the planck cmb covariancematrix improves the constraints to delta w_0=0.02, delta w_a=0.07 and afom=802. the amplitude of primordial non-gaussianity, parametrised by f_nl,will be constrained to \delta f_nl ~ 6.6 for the local shape scenario, fromeuclid clusters alone. using only euclid clusters, the growth factor parameter\gamma, which signals deviations from gr, will be constrained to delta\gamma=0.02, and the neutrino density parameter to delta omega_\nu=0.0013 (ordelta \sum m_\nu=0.01). we emphasise that knowledge of the observable--massscaling relation will be crucial to constrain cosmological parameters from acluster catalogue. the euclid mission will have a clear advantage in thisrespect, thanks to its imaging and spectroscopic capabilities that will enableinternal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of clustergalaxies. this information will be further complemented by wide-areamulti-wavelength external cluster surveys that will already be available wheneuclid flies.

1511.01145	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). environmental  effects shaping the galaxy stellar mass function	we exploit the first public data release of vipers to investigateenvironmental effects in galaxy evolution between $z\sim0.5$ and $0.9$. thelarge number of spectroscopic redshifts over an area of about$10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. theaccurate redshift measurements, with $\sigma_z = 0.00047(1+z_\mathrm{spec})$,allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest- and highest-densityenvironments, as defined in terms of spatial 3d density contrast. we estimatethe stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies residing in these two environments,and constrain its high-mass end with unprecedented precision. we find that thegalaxy smf in the densest regions has a different shape than that measured atlow densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter(less negative) slope at $z&lt;0.8$. we normalise each smf to the comoving volumeoccupied by the corresponding environment, and relate estimates from differentredshift bins. we observe an evolution of the smf of vipers galaxies in highdensities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. we compare theseresults to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures.we discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellitegalaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic andenvironmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, and thereforedifficult to disentangle. the evolution of our low-density regions is welldescribed by the formalism introduced by peng et al.~(2010), and is consistentwith the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internalphysical processes. the same formalism could also describe the evolution of thesmf in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution fromdry mergers is considered.

astro-ph;0102464	theoretical predictions on the clustering of scuba galaxies and  implications for small-scale fluctuations at sub-mm wavelengths	this paper investigates the clustering properties of scuba-selected galaxiesin the framework of a unifying scheme relating the formation of qsos andspheroids (granato et al. 2000). the theoretical angular correlation functionis derived for different bias functions, corresponding to different values ofthe ratio $m_{\rm halo}/m_{\rm sph}$ between the mass of the dark halo and thefinal mass in stars. scuba sources are predicted to be strongly clustered, witha clustering strength increasing with mass. we show that the model accounts forthe clustering of lyman-break galaxies, seen as the optical counterpart of low-to intermediate-mass primeval spheroidal galaxies and is also consistent withthe observed angular correlation function of extremely red objects. bestagreement is obtained for $m_{\rm halo}/m_{\rm sph}=100$. we also consider theimplications for small scale fluctuations observed at sub-mm wavelengths bycurrent or forthcoming experiments aimed at mapping the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). the predicted amplitude of the clustering signal in the 350ghz channel of the planck mission strongly depends on the halo-to-bulge massratio and may be of comparable amplitude to primary cmb anisotropies formultipole numbers $l\simgt 50$.

astro-ph;0109453	measuring the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble deep field  south	we present an analysis of the evolution of galaxy clustering in the redshiftinterval 0&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hdf-s. the hst optical data are combined with infraredisaac/vlt observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxiesbrighter than i_ab&lt;27.5. the clustering signal is obtained in differentredshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses thebest redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes intoaccount the redshift probability function of each object. this second methodmakes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals wherecontamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. with bothmethods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the hdf-s isconsistent with the previous results in the hdf-n. while at redshift lower thanz~1 the hdf galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b&lt;1) with respect to theunderlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,depending on the cosmological model. these results support previous claimsthat, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. the impact of cosmicerrors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in theclustering measurements in the hdf surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noisein most regimes. future observations with instruments like the acs on hst willimprove the s/n by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of theerrors will be required. in fact, pure shot-noise will give a smallercontribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volumeeffects or non-poissonian discreteness effects.

astro-ph;0310794	x-ray properties of galaxy clusters and groups from a cosmological  hydrodynamical simulation	we present results on the x-ray properties of clusters and groups ofgalaxies, extracted from a large hydrodynamical simulation. we used the gadgetcode to simulate a lambdacdm model within a box of 192 mpc/h on a side, with480^3 dark matter particles and as many gas particles. the simulation includesradiative cooling, star formation and supernova feedback. the simulated m-trelation is consistent with observations once we mimic the procedure for massestimates applied to real clusters. also, with the adopted choices ofomega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.8 the resulting xtf agrees with observationaldeterminations. the l-t relation also agrees with observations for clusterswith t&gt;2 kev, with no change of slope at the scale of groups. the entropy incentral cluster regions is higher than predicted by gravitational heatingalone, the excess being almost the same for clusters and groups. the simulatedclusters appear to have suffered some overcooling, with f*~0.2, thus abouttwice as large as the value observed. interestingly, temperature profiles arefound to steadily increase toward cluster centers. they decrease in the outerregions, much like observational data do at r&gt;0.2r_vir, while not showing anisothermal regime followed by a smooth temperature decline in the innermostregions.

astro-ph;0310844	simulating chandra observations of galaxy clusters	numerical hydro-n-body simulations are very important tools for makingtheoretical predictions for the formation of galaxy clusters. they show thatthe atmospheres of clusters of galaxies have quite complex angular and thermalstructures. the full understanding of the physical processes behind thesefeatures can be only achieved by direct comparison of observations tohydro-n-body simulations. although simple in principle, these comparisons arenot always trivial. in fact, real data are convolved with the instrumentresponse which may substantially influence the apparent properties of thestudied features. to overcome this problem we build the software package x-masdevoted to simulate x-ray observations of galaxy clusters obtained fromhydro-n-body simulations. in this paper we present how this software packageworks and discuss its application to the simulation of chandra acis-s3observations. we compare some of the main physical properties of the input datato the ones derived from simulated observations after performing a standardimaging and spectral analysis. we show that, if the thermal structure of thecluster along a particular line of sight is quite complex, the projectedspectroscopic temperature obtained from the observation is significantly lowerthan the emission-weighed value inferred directly from hydrodynamicalsimulation. this implies that much attention must be paid in the theoreticalinterpretation of observational temperatures.

astro-ph;0401199	confusion noise at far-ir to millimeter wavelengths	we present detailed predictions for the confusion noise due to extragalacticsources in the far-ir/(sub)-millimeter channels of esa/iso, nasa/spitzer,esa/herschel and esa/planck satellites, including the contribution fromclustering of unresolved scuba galaxies. clustering is found to increase theconfusion noise, compared to the case of purely poisson fluctuations, by 10-15%for the lowest frequency (i.e. lowest angular resolution) spitzer and herschelchannels, by 25-35% for the 175 micron isophot channel, and to dominate in thecase of planck/hfi channels at nu&gt;143ghz. although our calculations make use ofa specific evolutionary model (granato et al. 2004), the results are stronglyconstrained by the observed counts and by data on the redshift distribution ofscuba sources, and therefore are not expected to be heavily model dependent.the main uncertainty arises from the poor observational definition of thesource clustering properties. two models have been used for the latter: apower-law with constant slope and a redshift-independent comoving correlationlength,r_0, and the standard theoretical model for clustering evolution in alambdacdm universe, with a redshift-dependent bias factor. in both cases, theclustering amplitude has been normalized to yield a unit angular correlationfunction at theta_0=1-2 arcsec for 850 micron sources fainter than 2 mjy,consistent with the results by peacock et al. (2000). this normalizationyields, for the first model, r_0=8.3$ mpc/h, and, for the second model, aneffective mass of dark matter haloes in which these sources reside ofm_halo=1.8*10^{13} m_sun/h. these results are consistent with independentestimates for scuba galaxies and for other, likely related, sources.

astro-ph;0404425	comparing the temperatures of galaxy clusters from hydro-n-body  simulations to chandra and xmm-newton observations	theoretical studies of the physical processes guiding the formation andevolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the x-ray are mainly based on theresults of numerical hydrodynamical n-body simulations, which in turn are oftendirectly compared to x-ray observations. although trivial in principle, thesecomparisons are not always simple. we demonstrate that the projectedspectroscopic temperature of thermally complex clusters obtained from x-rayobservations is always lower than the emission-weighed temperature, which iswidely used in the analysis of numerical simulations. we show that thistemperature bias is mainly related to the fact that the emission-weightedtemperature does not reflect the actual spectral properties of the observedsource. this has important implications for the study of thermal structures inclusters, especially when strong temperature gradients, like shock fronts, arepresent. because of this bias, in real observations shock fronts appear muchweaker than what is predicted by emission-weighted temperature maps, and mayeven not be detected. this may explain why, although numerical simulationspredict that shock fronts are a quite common feature in clusters of galaxies,to date there are very few observations of objects in which they are clearlyseen. to fix this problem we propose a new formula, the spectroscopic-liketemperature function, and show that, for temperature larger than 3 kev, itapproximates the spectroscopic temperature better than few per cent, makingsimulations more directly comparable to observations.

astro-ph;0405365	measuring cluster peculiar velocities with the sunyaev-zeldovich  effects: scaling relations and systematics	the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (cmb) intensity due tothe sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect are the sum of a thermal and a kineticcontribution. separating the two components to measure the peculiar velocity ofgalaxy clusters requires radio and microwave observations at three or morefrequencies, and knowledge of the temperature t_e of the intracluster mediumweighted by the electron number density. to quantify the systematics of thisprocedure, we extract a sample of 117 massive clusters at redshift z=0 from ann-body hydrodynamical simulation, with 2x480^3 particles, of a cosmologicalvolume 192 mpc/h on a side of a flat cold dark matter model with omega_0=0.3and lambda=0.7. our simulation includes radiative cooling, star formation andthe effect of feedback and galactic winds from supernovae. we find that (1) oursimulated clusters reproduce the observed scaling relations between x-ray andsz properties; (2) bulk flows internal to the intracluster medium affect thevelocity estimate by less than 200 km/s in 93 per cent of the cases; (3) usingthe x-ray emission weighted temperature, as an estimate of t_e, canoverestimate the peculiar velocity by 20-50 per cent, if the microwaveobservations do not spatially resolve the cluster. for spatially resolvedclusters, the assumptions on the spatial distribution of the icm, required toseparate the two sz components, still produce a velocity overestimate of 10-20per cent, even with an unbiased measure of t_e. thanks to the large size of ourcluster samples, these results set a robust lower limit of 200 km/s to thesystematic errors that will affect upcoming measures of cluster peculiarvelocities with the sz effect.

astro-ph;0406388	effect of clustering on extragalactic source counts with low-resolution  instruments	in the presence of strong clustering, low-resolution surveys measure thesummed contributions of groups of sources within the beam. the counts of brightintensity peaks are therefore shifted to higher flux levels compared to thecounts of individual sources detected with high-resolution instruments. if thebeam-width corresponds a sizable fraction of the clustering size, as in thecase of planck/hfi, one actually detects the fluxes of clumps of sources. weargue that the distribution of clump luminosities can be modelled in terms ofthe two- and three-point correlation functions, and apply our formalism to theplanck/hfi 850 micron surveys. the effect on counts is found to be large andsensitive also to the evolution of the three-point correlation function; in theextreme case that the latter function is redshift-independent, the sourceconfusion due to clustering keeps being important above the canonical 5*sigmadetection limit. detailed simulations confirm the reliability of our approach.as the ratio of the beam-width to the clustering angular size decreases, theobserved fluxes approach those of the brightest sources in the beam and theclump formalism no longer applies. however, simulations show that also in thecase of the herschel/spire 500 micron survey the enhancement of the brightsource counts due to clustering is important.

astro-ph;0505258	the imprints of local superclusters on the sunyaev-zel'dovich signals  and their detectability with planck	we use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of large-scale structureformation to study the imprints of the local superclusters onto the full-skysunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) signals. following (mathis et al. 2002), the initialconditions have been statistically constrained to reproduce the density fieldwithin a sphere of 110 mpc around the milky way, as observed in the iras 1.2-jyall-sky redshift survey. as a result, the positions and masses of prominentgalaxy clusters and superclusters in our simulations coincide closely withtheir real counterparts in the local universe. we present the results of twodifferent runs, one with adiabatic gas physics only, and one also includingcooling, star formation and feedback. by analysing the full-sky maps for thethermal and kinetic sz signals extracted from these simulations, we find thatfor multipoles with l&lt;100 the power spectrum is dominated by the prominentlocal superclusters, and its amplitude at these scales is a factor of twohigher than that obtained from unconstrained simulations; at lower multipoles(l&lt;20) this factor can even reach one order of magnitude. we check theinfluence of the sz effect from local superclusters on the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) power spectrum at small multipoles and find it negligible andwith no signs of quadrupole-octopole alignment. however, performing simulationsof the cmb radiation including the experimental noise at the frequencies whichwill be observed by the planck satellite, we find results suggesting that anestimate of the sz power spectrum at large scales can be extracted.

astro-ph;0507643	properties of the diffuse x-ray background in a high-resolution  hydrodynamical simulation	we study the properties of the diffuse x-ray background by using the resultsof a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the concordance lambdacdm model.the simulation follows gravitational and gas dynamics and includes a treatmentof physical processes like radiative cooling, star formation and supernovafeedback. from the simulation outputs, we produce a set of two-dimensional mapsof the intergalactic medium x-ray emission integrated over redshift. we findthat the signal in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band is lognormally distributed with amean intensity of about 4 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2; approximately 40 percent of the emission originates from warm-hot gas (defined as baryons with10^5&lt;t&lt;10^7 k), and 90 per cent comes from structures at z&lt;0.9. since thespectrum is soft, being mostly provided by the intergalactic medium at lowtemperature, the total mean intensity in the hard (2-10 kev) x-ray band issmaller by a factor of about 4. in order to constrain the physical processesincluded in our simulation, we compare our results with the observed upperlimit (1.2 +/- 0.3) 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2 of the soft x-ray emission dueto diffuse gas. to this purpose, we remove the contributions of observableextended objects (groups and clusters of galaxies) from the simulated maps byadopting different detectability criteria which are calibrated on theproperties of systems at intermediate redshifts observed by chandra. we showthat the simulated diffuse soft x-ray emission is consistent with the presentobserved upper limit. however, if future measurements will decrease the levelof the unresolved x-ray background by a factor of two, a more efficientfeedback mechanism should be required to suppress the soft emission of the gasresiding within filaments and group-size haloes.

astro-ph;0512112	the integrated bispectrum as a test of cmb non-gaussianity: detection  power and limits on f_nl with wmap data	we propose a fast and efficient bispectrum statistic for cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) temperature anisotropies to constrain the amplitude of theprimordial non-gaussian signal measured in terms of the non-linear couplingparameter f_nl. we show how the method can achieve a remarkable computationaladvantage by focussing on subsets of the multipole configurations, where thenon-gaussian signal is more concentrated. the detection power of the test,increases roughly linearly with the maximum multipole, as shown in the idealcase of an experiment without noise and gaps. the cpu-time scales as l_{max}^3instead of l_{max}^5 for the full bispectrum which for planck resolutionl_{max} \sim 3000 means an improvement in speed of a factor 10^7 compared tothe full bispectrum analysis with minor loss in precision. we find that theintroduction of a galactic cut partially destroys the optimality of theconfiguration, which will then need to be dealt with in the future. we find foran ideal experiment with l_{max}=2000 that upper limits of f_{nl}&lt;8 can beobtained at 1 sigma. for the case of the wmap experiment, we would be able toput limits of |f_{nl}|&lt;40 if no galactic cut were present. using the real datawith galactic cut, we obtain an estimate of -80&lt;f_{nl}&lt;80 and -160&lt;f_{nl}&lt;160at 1 and 2 sigma respectively.

astro-ph;0512506	hot and cooled baryons in sph simulations of galaxy clusters: physics  and numerics	we discuss an extended set of tree+sph simulations of galaxy clusters, withthe goal of investigating the interplay between numerical resolution effectsand star-formation/feedback processes. the simulated clusters span the massrange (0.1-2.3) 10^{15}msun/h, with mass resolution varying by several decades.at the highest achieved resolution, we resolve the virial region of avirgo-like cluster with more than 2 million gas particles and with at least asmany dark-matter (dm) particles. our resolution study confirms that, in theabsence of an efficient feedback mechanism, runaway cooling leads to about 35per cent of baryons in clusters to be locked up in long lived stars at ourhighest resolution, with no evidence of convergence. however, includingfeedback causes the fraction of cooled baryons to converge at about 15 per centalready at modest resolution. feedback also stabilizes other gas-relatedquantities, such as radial profiles of entropy, gas density and temperature,against variations due to changes in resolution. we also investigate theinfluence of the gravitational force softening length, and that of numericalheating of the gas induced by two-body encounters between dm and lighter gasparticles. we show that simulations where more dm than gas particles are used,show a significantly enhanced efficiency of star formation at z&gt;3. our resultsare important for establishing and delineating the regime of numericalreliability of the present generation of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxyclusters.

astro-ph;0602361	modeling the qso luminosity and spatial clustering at low redshifts	we investigate the ability of hierarchical models of qso formation andevolution to match the observed luminosity, number counts and spatialclustering of quasars at redshift z&lt;2. these models assume that the qsoemission is triggered by galaxy mergers, that the mass of the central blackhole correlates with halo properties and that quasars shine at their eddingtonluminosity except, perhaps, during the very early stages of evolution. we findthat models based on simple analytic approximations successfully reproduce theobserved b-band qso luminosity function at all redshifts, provided that somemechanisms is advocated to quench mass accretion within haloes larger thanabout 1e13 msun that host bright quasars. these models also match the observedstrength of qso clustering at z~0.8. at larger redshifts, however, theyunderpredict the qso biasing which, instead, is correctly reproduced bysemi-analytic models in which the halo merger history and associated bhs arefollowed by monte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy. we show that thedisagreement between the luminosity function predicted by semi-analytic modelsand observations can be ascribed to the use of b-band data, which are a biasedtracer of the quasar population, due to obscuration.

astro-ph;0602434	systematics in the x-ray cluster mass estimators	we examine the systematics affecting the x-ray mass estimators applied to aset of five simulated galaxy clusters. they have been processed through thex-ray map simulator, x-mas, to provide chandra-like long exposures that areanalyzed to reconstruct the gas temperature, density, and mass profiles used asinput. we find that at r_2500 the mass profile obtained via a directapplication of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is consistent within 1sigma with the actual mass; although we notice this estimator shows highstatistical errors due to high level of chandra background. instead, thepoorness of the beta-model in describing the gas density profile makes theevaluated masses to be underestimated by \sim 40 per cent with respect to thetrue mass, both with an isothermal and a polytropic temperature profile. wealso test ways to recover the mass by adopting an analytic mass model, such asthose proposed by navarro et al. (1997) and rasia et al. (2004), and fittingthe temperature profile expected from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation tothe observed one. these methods and the one of the hydrostatic equilibriumequation provide a more robust mass estimation than the ones based on thebeta-model. in the present work the main limitation for a precise massreconstruction is to ascribe to the relatively high level of the backgroundchosen to reproduce the chandra one. after artificially reducing it by a factorof 100, we find that the estimated mass significantly underestimates the truemass profiles. this is manly due (i) to the neglected contribution of the gasbulk motions to the total energy budget and (ii) to the bias towards lowervalues of the x-ray temperature measurements because of the complex thermalstructure of the emitting plasma.

astro-ph;0603095	the clustering evolution of distant red galaxies in the goods-music  sample	we use the goods-music sample, a catalog of ~3000 ks-selected galaxies basedon vlt and hst observation of the goods-south field with extendedmulti-wavelength coverage (from 0.3 to 8 micron) and accurate estimates of thephotometric redshifts to select 179 drgs with j-ks&gt;1.3 in an area of 135 sq.arcmin. we first show that the j-ks&gt;1.3 criterion selects a ratherheterogeneous sample of galaxies, going from the targeted high-redshiftluminous evolved systems, to a significant fraction of lower redshift (1&lt;z&lt;2)and less luminous dusty starbursts. these low-redshift drgs are significantlyless clustered than higher-z drgs. with the aid of extreme and simplifiedtheoretical models of clustering evolution we show that it is unlikely that thetwo samples are drawn from the same population observed at two different stagesof evolution. high-z drgs likely represent the progenitors of the more massiveand more luminous galaxies in the local universe and might mark the regionsthat will later evolve into structures of intermediate mass, like groups orsmall galaxy clusters. low-z drgs, on the other hand, will likely evolve intoslightly less massive field galaxies.

astro-ph;0607254	searching dark-matter halos in the gabods survey	we apply the linear filter for the weak-lensing signal of dark-matter halosdeveloped in maturi et al. (2005) to the cosmic-shear data extracted from thegarching-bonn-deep-survey (gabods). we wish to search for dark-matter halosthrough weak-lensing signatures which are significantly above the random andsystematic noise level caused by intervening large-scale structures. we employa linear matched filter which maximises the signal-to-noise ratio by minimisingthe number of spurious detections caused by the superposition of large-scalestructures (lss). this is achieved by suppressing those spatial frequenciesdominated by the lss contamination. we confirm the improved stability andreliability of the detections achieved with our new filter compared to thecommonly-used aperture mass (schneider, 1996; schneider et al., 1998) and tothe aperture mass based on the shear profile expected for nfw haloes (see e.g.schirmer et al., 2004; hennawi &amp; spergel, 2005). schirmer et al.~(2006)achieved results comparable to our filter, but probably only because of the lowaverage redshift of the background sources in gabods, which keeps the lsscontamination low. for deeper data, the difference will be more important, asshown by maturi et al. (2005). we detect fourteen halos on about eighteensquare degrees selected from the survey. five are known clusters, two areassociated with over-densities of galaxies visible in the gabods image, andseven have no known optical or x-ray counterparts.

astro-ph;0702241	virial scaling of massive dark matter halos: why clusters prefer a high  normalization cosmology	we present a precise estimate of the bulk virial scaling relation of halosformed via hierarchical clustering in an ensemble of simulated cold dark mattercosmologies. the result is insensitive to cosmological parameters, the presenceof a trace, dissipationless gas component, and numerical resolution down to alimit of ~1000 particles. the dark matter velocity dispersion scales with totalmass as log(sigma_{dm}(m,z)) = log(1082.9 +- 4.0 \kms) + (0.3361 +- 0.0026)log(h(z)m_{200}/10^{15} msun), with h(z) the dimensionless hubble parameter. atfixed mass, the velocity dispersion likelihood is nearly log-normal, withscatter sigma_{ln sigma} = 0.0426 +- 0.015, except for a tail to higherdispersions containing 10% of the population that are merger transients. wecombine this relation with the halo mass function in lcdm models, and show thata low normalization condition, s_8 = sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^{0.35} \= 0.69,favored by recent wmap and sdss analysis requires that galaxy and gas specificenergies in rich clusters be 50% larger than that of the underlying darkmatter. such large energetic biases are in conflict with the current generationof direct simulations of cluster formation. a higher normalization, s_8 = 0.80,alleviates this tension and implies that the hot gas fraction within r_{500} is(0.71 +- 0.09) h_{70}^{-3/2} omega_b/\omega_m, a value consistent with recentsunyaev-zel'dovich observations.

0809.3909	the effects of primordial non-gaussianity on the cosmological  reionization	we investigate the effects of non-gaussianity in the primordial density fieldon the reionization history. we rely on a semi-analytic method to describe theprocesses acting on the intergalactic medium (igm), relating the distributionof the ionizing sources to that of dark matter haloes. extending previous workin the literature, we consider models in which the primordial non-gaussianityis measured by the dimensionless non-linearity parameter f_nl, using theconstraints recently obtained from cosmic microwave background data. we predictthe ionized fraction and the optical depth at different cosmological epochsassuming two different kinds of non-gaussianity, characterized by ascale-independent and a scale-dependent f_nl and comparing the results to thosefor the standard gaussian scenario. we find that a positive f_nl enhances theformation of high-mass haloes at early epochs, when reionization begins, and,as a consequence, the igm ionized fraction can grow by a factor up to 5 withrespect to the corresponding gaussian model. the increase of the filling factorhas a small impact on the reionization optical depth and is of order ~ 10 percent if a scale-dependent non-gaussianity is assumed. our predictions fornon-gaussian models are in agreement with the latest wmap results within theerror bars, but a higher precision is required to constrain the scaledependence of non-gaussianity.

astro-ph;9910085	a study of the core of the shapley concentration: iv. distribution of  intercluster galaxies and supercluster properties	(abridged) we present the results of a redshift survey of interclustergalaxies in the central region of the shapley concentration supercluster, aimedat determining the distribution of galaxies in between obvious overdensities.our sample is formed by 442 new redshifts, mainly in the b_j magnitude range17-18.8. adding the data from our redshift surveys on the a3558 and a3528complexes, which are close to the geometrical centre of this supercluster, weobtain a total sample of ~2000 radial velocities. using the 1440 galaxies ofour total sample in the magnitude range 17 - 18.8, we reconstructed the densityprofile in the central part of the shapley concentration; moreover we detectedanother significant overdensity at ~30000 km/s (dubbed s300). we estimate thetotal overdensity in galaxies, the mass and the dynamical state of thesestructures, and discuss the effect of considering a bias between the galaxydistribution and the underlying matter. we find an indication that the value ofthe bias between clusters and galaxies in the shapley concentration is higherthat that reported in literature, confirming the impression that thissupercluster is very rich in clusters. finally, from the comparison with sometheoretical scenarios, we find that the existence of the shapley concentrationis more consistent with the predictions of the models with a matter densityparameter &lt;1, such as open cdm and lambda cdm.

0706.0830	the importance of the merging activity for the kinetic polarization of  the sunyaev-zel'dovich signal from galaxy clusters	the polarization sensitivity of the upcoming millimetric observatories willopen new possibilities for studying the properties of galaxy clusters and forusing them as powerful cosmological probes. for this reason it is necessary toinvestigate in detail the characteristics of the polarization signals producedby their highly ionized intra-cluster medium (icm). this work is focussed onthe polarization effect induced by the icm bulk motions, the so-called kpszsignal, which has an amplitude proportional to the optical depth and to thesquare of the tangential velocity. in particular we study how this polarizationsignal is affected by the internal dynamics of galaxy clusters and what is itsdependence on the physical modelling adopted to describe the baryoniccomponent. this is done by producing realistic kpsz maps starting from theoutputs of two different sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical n-bodysimulations. the first set (17 objects) follows only non-radiativehydrodynamics, while for each of 9 objects of the second set we implement fourdifferent kinds of physical processes. our results shows that the kpsz signalturns out to be a very sensitive probe of the dynamical status of galaxyclusters. we find that major merger events can amplify the signal up to oneorder of magnitude with respect to relaxed clusters, reaching amplitude up toabout 100 nuk. this result implies that the internal icm dynamics must be takeninto account when evaluating this signal because simplicistic models, based onspherical rigid bodies, may provide wrong estimates. finally we find that thedependence on the physical modelling of the baryonic component is relevant onlyin the very inner regions of clusters.

0812.1097	observing the clustering properties of galaxy clusters in dynamical  dark-energy cosmologies	we study the clustering properties of galaxy clusters expected to be observedby various forthcoming surveys both in the x-ray and sub-mm regimes by thethermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. several different background cosmologicalmodels are assumed, including the concordance $\lambda$cdm and variouscosmologies with dynamical evolution of the dark energy. particular attentionis paid to models with a significant contribution of dark energy at early timeswhich affects the process of structure formation. past light cone and selectioneffects in cluster catalogs are carefully modeled by realistic scalingrelations between cluster mass and observables and by properly taking intoaccount the selection functions of the different instruments. the results showthat early dark-energy models are expected to produce significantly lowervalues of effective bias and both spatial and angular correlation amplitudeswith respect to the standard $\lambda$cdm model. among the cluster cataloguesstudied in this work, it turns out that those based on \emph{erosita},\emph{planck}, and south pole telescope observations are the most promising fordistinguishing between various dark-energy models.
