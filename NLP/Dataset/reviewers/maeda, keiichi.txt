0901.0410	nucleosynthesis of 56ni in wind-driven supernova explosions and  constraints on the central engine of gamma-ray bursts	theoretically expected natures of a supernova driven by a wind/jet arediscussed. approximate analytical formulations are derived to clarify basicphysical processes involved in the wind/jet-driven explosions, and it is shownthat the explosion properties are characterized by the energy injection rate(edot_iso) and the mass injection rate (mdot_iso). to explain observations ofsn 1998bw associated with gamma-ray burst (grb) 980425, the followingconditions are required: edot_iso mdot_iso &gt; ~ 10^{51} erg m_sun s^{-2} andedot_iso &gt; ~ 2 x 10^{52} erg s^{-1} (if the wind lorentz factor gamma_w ~ 1) oredot_iso &gt; ~ 7 x 10^{52} erg s^{-1} (if gamma_w &gt;&gt; 1). in sn 1998bw, 56ni (~0.4m_sun) is probably produced in the shocked stellar mantle, not in the wind.the expected natures of sne, e.g., ejected 56ni masses and ejecta masses, varydepending on edot_iso and mdot_iso. the sequence of the sn properties from highedot_iso and mdot_iso to low edot_iso and mdot_iso is the following: sn1998bw-like -- intermediate case -- low mass ejecta (&lt; ~ 1m_sun$) where 56ni isfrom the wind -- whole collapse. this diversity may explain the diversity ofsupernovae associated with grbs. our result can be used to constrain natures ofthe wind/jet, which is linked to the central engine of grbs, by studyingproperties of the associated supernovae.

0902.1440	the extremely luminous supernova 2006gy at late phase: detection of  optical emission from supernova	we performed optical spectroscopy and photometry of sn 2006gy at late time,~400 days after the explosion, with the subaru/focas in a good seeingcondition. we found that the sn faded by ~3 mag from ~200 to ~400 days afterthe explosion (i.e., by ~5 mag from peak to ~400 days) in r band. the overalllight curve is marginally consistent with the 56ni heating model, although theflattening around 200 days suggests the optical flux declined more steeplybetween ~200 and ~400 days. the late time spectrum was quite peculiar among alltypes of sne. it showed many intermediate width (~2000 km/s fwhm) emissionlines, e.g., [fe ii], [ca ii], and ca ii. the absence of the broad [o i] 6300,6364 line and weakness of [fe ii] and [ca ii] lines compared with ca ii irtriplet would be explained by a moderately high electron density in the lineemitting region. this high density assumption seems to be consistent with thelarge amount of ejecta and low expansion velocity of sn 2006gy. the h-alphaline luminosity was as small as ~1x10^39 erg/s, being comparable with those ofnormal type ii sne at similar epochs. our observation indicates that the strongcsm interaction had almost finished by ~400 days. if the late time optical fluxis purely powered by radioactive decay, at least m_ni ~ 3 m_sun should beproduced at the sn explosion. in the late phase spectrum, there were severalunusual emission lines at 7400--8800 aa and some of them might be due to ti orni synthesized at the explosion.

0903.0217	dust in supernovae; formation and evolution	core--collapsed supernovae (ccsne) have been considered to be one of sourcesof dust in the universe. what kind and how much mass of dust are formed in theejecta and are injected into the interstellar medium (ism) depend on the typeof ccsne, through the difference in the thickness (mass) of outer envelope. inthis review, after summarizing the existing results of observations on dustformation in ccsne, we investigate formation of dust in the ejecta and itsevolution in the supernova remnants (snrs) of type ii--p and type iib sne.then, the time evolution of thermal emission from dust in the snr of type iibsn is demonstrated and compared with the observation of cas a. we find that thetotal dust mass formed in the ejecta does not so much depend on the type; $\sim0.3-0.7 m_{\odot}$ in type ii--p sne and $\sim 0.13 m_{\odot}$ in type iib sn.however the size of dust sensitively depends on the type, being affected by thedifference in the gas density in the ejecta: the dust mass is dominated bygrains with radii larger than 0.03 $\mu$m in type ii-p, and less than 0.006$\mu$m in type iib, which decides the fate of dust in the snr. the survivingdust mass is $\sim 0.04-0.2 m_{\odot}$ in the snrs of type ii--p sne for theambient hydrogen density of $n_{\rm h}=10.0-1.0$ cm$^{-3}$, while almost alldust grains are destroyed in the snr of type iib. the spectral energydistribution (sed) of thermal emission from dust in snr well reflects theevolution of dust grains in snr through erosion by sputtering and stochasticheating. the observed sed of cas a snr is reasonably reproduced by the model ofdust formation and evolution for type iib sn.

0906.1062	spectropolarimetry of the unique type ib supernova 2005bf: larger  asymmetry revealed by later-phase data	we present an optical spectropolarimetric observation of the unique type ibsupernova (sn) 2005bf at 8 days after the second maximum. the data, combinedwith the polarization spectrum taken at 6 days before the second maximum (maundet al. 2007a), enable us to closely examine the intrinsic properties of the sn.the polarization percentage is smaller at the later epoch over a widewavelength range, while the position angle is similar at the two epochs. wefind that an assumption of complete depolarization of strong lines at theemission peak is not necessarily correct. the intrinsic polarization of the snis larger, and thus, the ejecta of sn 2005bf would be more asymmetric thanpreviously expected. the axis ratio of the photosphere projected on the skydeviates from unity by at least 20 %. if the position angle of interstellarpolarization is aligned with the spiral arm of the host galaxy, the deviationis larger than 25 %. the line polarization at the he i, ca ii and fe ii linesis also smaller at the later epoch. the changes in the position angle acrossthese lines, which were observed at the earlier epoch, are still marginallypresent at the later epoch. the similar polarimetric behavior suggests that thedistributions of these ions are correlated. properties of polarization, as wellas the light curve and the spectra both at photospheric and nebular phases, canbe explained by an aspherical, possibly unipolar explosion of a wn star inwhich the blob of 56ni penetrates c+o core and stops within the he layer.

0908.2057	spectropolarimetry of extremely luminous type ia supernova 2009dc:  nearly spherical explosion of super-chandrasekhar mass white dwarf	we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a candidate ofsuper-chandrasekhar mass type ia supernova (sn): sn 2009dc. the observationswere performed at 5.6 and 89.5 days after the b-band maximum. the data taken atthe later epoch are used to determine the interstellar polarization. continuumpolarization is found to be small (&lt;0.3 %), indicating that the explosion isnearly spherically symmetric. this fact suggests that a very asphericalexplosion is not a likely scenario for sn 2009dc. polarization at the si ii andca ii lines clearly shows a loop in the q-u plane, indicating anon-axisymmetric, clumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements. the degreeof line polarization at the si and ca line is moderate (0.5% +- 0.1% and 0.7%+- 0.1%, respectively), but it is higher than expected from the trend of othertype ia sne. this may suggest that there are thick enough, clumpy si-richlayers above the thick 56ni-rich layers (&gt;~ 1.2 msun). the observedspectropolarimetric properties, combined with the photometric and spectroscopicproperties, suggest that the progenitor of sn 2009dc has a super-chandrasekharmass, and that the explosion geometry is globally spherically symmetric, withclumpy distribution of intermediate-mass elements.

0707.2219	hypernovae and their gamma-ray bursts connection	the connection between long gamma ray bursts (grbs) and supernovae (sne),have been established through the well observed cases of grb980425/sn 1998bw,grb030329/sn 2003dh and grb031203/sn 2003lw. these events can be explained asthe prompt collapse to a black hole (bh) of the core of a massive star (m ~ 40msun) that had lost its outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. all these sneexhibited strong oxygen lines, and their energies were much larger than thoseof typical sne, thus these sne are called hypernovae (hne). the case of sn2006aj/grb060218 appears different: the grb was weak and soft (an x-ray flash,xrf); the sn is dimmer and has very weak oxygen lines. the explosion energy ofsn 2006aj was smaller, as was the ejected mass. in our model, the progenitorstar had a smaller mass than other grb/sne (m ~ 20 msun), suggesting that aneutron star (ns) rather than a black hole was formed. if the nascent neutronstar was strongly magnetized (a so-called magnetar) and rapidly spinning, itmay launch a weak grb or an xrf. the final fate of 20-30 msun stars showinteresting variety, as seen in the very peculiar type ib/c sn 2005bf. thismass range corresponds to the ns to bh transition. we also compare thenucleosynthesis feature of hne with the metal-poor stars and suggest thehypernova-first star connection.

0911.5484	nebular spectra and explosion asymmetry of type ia supernovae	the spectral signatures of asymmetry in type ia supernova (sn ia) explosionsare investigated, using a sample of late-time nebular spectra. first, akinematical model is constructed for sn ia 2003hv, which can account for themain features in its optical, near-infrared (nir), and mid-infrared (mid-ir)late-time spectra. it is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explainthe observed characteristics of sn 2003hv. this model includes a relativelyhigh density, fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and arelatively low density, extended 56ni-rich region which is more sphericallydistributed. the high density region consists of the inner stable fe-ni regionand outer 56ni-rich region. such a distribution may be the result of adelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces theglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation canlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. this configuration, if viewed from thedirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of theemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in sn 2003hv. forthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and theimplications for sne ia in general. the model predicts that a variation of thecentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in somelines (e.g., [ni ii]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [fe iii] blend at4700a) will not show this effect. by examining optical nebular spectra of 12sne ia, we have found that such a variation indeed exists. we suggest that theglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, as likely imprint of the deflagrationflame propagation, is a generic feature of sne ia (abridged).

1006.5336	fallback supernovae: a possible origin of peculiar supernovae with  extremely low explosion energies	we perform hydrodynamical calculations of core-collapse supernovae (sne) withlow explosion energies. these sne do not have enough energy to eject the wholeprogenitor and most of the progenitor falls back to the central remnant. weshow that such fallback sne can have a variety of light curves (lcs) but theirphotospheric velocities can only have some limited values with lower limits. wealso perform calculations of nucleosynthesis and lcs of several fallback snmodel, and find that a fallback sn from the progenitor with a main-sequencemass of 13 msun can account for the properties of the peculiar type iasupernova sn 2008ha. the kinetic energy and ejecta mass of the model are1.2*10^{48} erg and 0.074 msun, respectively, and the ejected 56ni mass is0.003 msun. thus, sn 2008ha can be a core-collapse sn with a large amount offallback. we also suggest that sn 2008ha could have been accompanied with longgamma-ray bursts and long gamma-ray bursts without associated sne may beaccompanied with very faint sne with significant amount of fallback which aresimilar to sn 2008ha.

0708.3242	multi-dimensional simulations for early phase spectra of aspherical  hypernovae: sn 1998bw and off-axis hypernovae	early phase optical spectra of aspherical jet-like supernovae (sne) arepresented. we focus on energetic core-collapse sne, or hypernovae. based onhydrodynamic and nucleosynthetic models, radiative transfer in sn atmosphere issolved with a multi-dimensional monte-carlo radiative transfer code, samurai.since the luminosity is boosted in the jet direction, the temperature there ishigher than in the equatorial plane by ~ 2,000 k. this causes anisotropicionization in the ejecta. emergent spectra are different depending on viewingangle, reflecting both aspherical abundance distribution and anisotropicionization. spectra computed with an aspherical explosion model with kineticenergy 20 x 10^{51} ergs are compatible with those of the type ic sn 1998bw if~ 10-20% of the synthesized metals are mixed out to higher velocities. thesimulations enable us to predict the properties of off-axis hypernovae. even ifan aspherical hypernova explosion is observed from the side, it should showhypernova-like spectra but with some differences in the line velocity, thewidth of the fe absorptions and the strength of the na i line.

1105.0973	formation of dust in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	we investigate the formation of dust grains in the ejecta of type iasupernovae (sne ia), adopting the carbon-deflagration w7 model. in thecalculations of dust formation, we apply the nucleation and grain growth theoryand consider the two cases with and without formation of co and sio molecules.the results of the calculations show that for the sticking probability ofalpha_j=1, c, silicate, si, and fes grains can condense at early times of~100--300 days after the explosion, whereas fe and sic grains cannot formsubstantially. due to the low gas density in sne ia with no h-envelope, theaverage radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, beingmuch smaller than those in type ii-p sne. this supports our previous conclusionthat the radius of dust formed in the ejecta is smaller in sne with lessmassive envelopes. the total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} m_sun to 0.2 m_sunfor alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not co and sio molecules areformed. we also estimate the optical depths and thermal emission by the newlyformed dust and compare to the relevant observations of sne ia. we find thatthe formation of c grains in sne ia is suppressed to be consistent with theobservational constraints. this implies that energetic photons and electronsheavily depress the formation efficiency of c grains or that the outermost c-olayer of sne ia is almost fully burned. finally, we perform the calculations ofdust destruction in the sn remnants and find that dust grains formed in theejecta of sne ia are almost completely destroyed in the shocked gas beforebeing injected into the interstellar medium. this indicates that sne ia areunlikely to be the major sources of interstellar dust.

1105.4631	on the effects of microphysical grain properties on the yields of  carbonaceous dust from type ii sne	we study the role of the unknown microphysical properties of carbonaceousdust particles in determining the amount and size distribution of carbonaceousdust condensed in type ii supernova explosions. we parametrize themicrophysical properties in terms of the shape factor of the grain and thesticking coefficient of gas-phase carbon atoms onto the grain surfaces. we findthat the amount of dust formed is fairly independent of these properties,within the parameter range considered, though limited by the available amountof carbon atoms not locked in co molecules. however, we find that thecondensation times and size distributions of dust grains depend sensitively onthe microphysical parameters, with the mass distributions being weighted towardlarger effective radii for conditions considering grains with higher stickingcoefficients and/or more aspherical shapes. we discuss that this leads toimportant consequences on the predicted extinction law of sn dust and on thesurvival rate of the formed grains as they pass through the reverse shock ofthe sn. we conclude that a more detailed understanding of the dust formationprocess and of the microphysical properties of each dust species needs to beachieved before robust prediction on the sn dust yields can be performed.

1110.3789	unburned material in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	(abridged) the presence of unburned material in the ejecta of normal type iasupernovae (sneia) is investigated using early-time spectroscopy obtained bythe csp. the tell-tale signature of pristine material from a c+o white dwarfprogenitor star is the presence of carbon. the most prominent carbon lines inoptical spectra of sneia are due to c ii. we find that at least 30% of theobjects in the sample show an absorption at ~6300 aa which is attributed to cii 6580. an association to h_alpha is considered to be unlikely. these findingsimply a larger incidence of carbon in sneia ejecta than previously noted. weshow how observational biases and physical conditions may hide these c iilines, and account for the scarcity of previous carbon detections. thisrelatively large frequency of carbon detections has crucial implications on ourunderstanding of the explosive process. the observations indicate that carbonis present merely ~1000 km s^-1 above the bulk of si ii. spectral modelingshows the detections are consistent with a mass of carbon of 10^-3--10^-2m_sun. this would imply substantial mixing, which may be related to asymmetriesof the flame propagation or clumps of unburned material along the line ofsight. however, the uniformity of the relation between c ii and si iivelocities is not consistent with the latter scenario. the observationalproperties of sneia with and without carbon signatures are compared. a trendtoward bluer color and lower luminosity is found for objects with carbon.

1202.1588	elemental abundances in the possible type ia supernova remnant  g344.7-0.1	recent studies on the galactic supernova remnant (snr) g344.7-0.1 havecommonly claimed its origin to be a core-collapse supernova (sn) explosion,based on its highly asymmetric morphology and/or proximity to a star formingregion. in this paper, however, we present an x-ray spectroscopic study of thissnr using suzaku, which is supportive of a type ia origin. strong k-shellemission from lowly ionized fe has clearly been detected, and its origin isdetermined, for the first time, to be the fe-rich sn ejecta. the abundancepattern is highly consistent with that expected for a somewhat-evolved type iasnr. it is suggested, therefore, that the x-ray point-like source cxouj170357.8-414302 located at the snr's geometrical center is not associated withthe snr but is likely to be a foreground object. our result further indicatesthat g344.7-0.1 is the first possible type ia snr categorized as a member ofthe so-called "mixed-morphology" class. in addition, we have detected emissionfrom he-like al at ~1.6 kev, the first clear detection of this element in thespectrum of an extended x-ray source. the possible enhancement of the al/mgabundance ratio from the solar value suggests that the ambient interstellarmedium has a relatively high metallicity (not less than 10% of the solarvalue), if this snr has indeed a type ia origin. we also report marginaldetection of cr and mn, although the measured fluxes have large statistical andsystematic uncertainties.

1202.4203	a search for infrared emission from core-collapse supernovae at the  transitional phase	most of the observational studies of supernova (sn) explosions are limited toearly phases (&lt; a few yr after the explosion) of extragalactic sne andobservations of sn remnants (&gt; 100 yr) in our galaxy or very nearby galaxies.sne at the epoch between these two, which we call "transitional" phase, havenot been explored in detail except for several extragalactic sne including sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud. we present theoretical predictions for theinfrared (ir) dust emissions by several mechanisms; emission from dust formedin the sn ejecta, light echo by circumstellar and interstellar dust, andemission from shocked circumstellar dust. we search for ir emission from 6core-collapse sne at the transitional phase in the nearby galaxies ngc 1313,ngc 6946, and m101 by using the data taken with the akari satellite andspitzer. among 6 targets, we detect the emission from sn 1978k in ngc 1313. sn1978k is associated with 1.3 x 10^{-3} msun of silicate dust. we show that,among several mechanisms, the shocked circumstellar dust is the most probableemission source to explain the ir emission observed for csm-rich sn 1978k. iremission from the other 5 objects is not detected. our current observations aresensitive to ir luminosity of &gt; 10^{38} erg s^{-1}, and the non-detection of sn1962m excludes the existence of the shocked circumstellar dust for a high gasmass-loss rate of sim 10^{-4} msun yr^{-1}. observations of sne at thetransitional phase with future ir satellites will fill the gap of irobservations of sne with the age of 10-100 years, and give a new opportunity tostudy the circumstellar and interstellar environments of the progenitor, andpossibly dust formation in sne.

1203.1451	a dip after the early emission of super-luminous supernovae: a signature  of shock breakout within dense circumstellar media	the origin of super-luminous supernovae (slsne), especially the source oftheir huge luminosities, has not been clarified yet. while a strong interactionbetween sn ejecta and dense circumstellar media (csm) is a leading scenario,alternative models have been proposed. in this letter, we suggest newdiagnostics to discriminate the strong sn-csm interaction scenario from theothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the lightcurve. this dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense csm withinwhich the shock breakout occurs. if a dense csm shell is located far at largeradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the sn ejecta to reach itand the early light curve can be powered by the sn ejecta before the collision.once the sn ejecta collides with the dense csm, the electron density and thusthe thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. photons become unable to goout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results inthe dip in the light curve. this dip is a solid prediction from the stronginteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.eventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense csm, and theluminosity increases by the continuous strong sn-csm interaction, resulting inan slsn. the possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor slsn, 2006oz, could bethe first example of this signature and give support to the sn-csm interactionas the power source of slsn 2006oz.

1204.6109	light curve modeling of superluminous supernova 2006gy: collision  between supernova ejecta and dense circumstellar medium	we show model light curves of superluminous supernova 2006gy on theassumption that the supernova is powered by the collision of supernova ejectaand its dense circumstellar medium. the initial conditions are constructedbased on the shock breakout condition, assuming that the circumstellar mediumis dense enough to cause the shock breakout within it. we perform a set ofnumerical light curve calculations by using a one-dimensional multigroupradiation hydrodynamics code stella. we succeeded in reproducing the overallfeatures of the early light curve of sn 2006gy with the circumstellar mediumwhose mass is about 15 msun (the average mass-loss rate ~ 0.1 msun/yr). thus,the progenitor of sn 2006gy is likely a very massive star. the density profileof the circumstellar medium is not well constrained by the light curve modelingonly, but our modeling disfavors the circumstellar medium formed by steady massloss. the ejecta mass is estimated to be comparable to or less than 15 msun andthe explosion energy is expected to be more than 4e51 erg. no 56ni is requiredto explain the early light curve. we find that the multidimensional effect,e.g., the rayleigh-taylor instability, which is expected to take place in thecool dense shell between the supernova ejecta and the dense circumstellarmedium, is important in understanding supernovae powered by the shockinteraction. we also show the evolution of the optical and near-infrared modellight curves of high-redshift superluminous supernovae. they can be potentiallyused to identify sn 2006gy-like superluminous supernovae in the future opticaland near-infrared transient surveys.

1205.4111	three-dimensional explosion geometry of stripped-envelope core-collapse  supernovae. i. spectropolarimetric observations	we study the multi-dimensional geometry of supernova (sn) explosions by meansof spectropolarimetric observations of stripped-envelope sne, i.e., sne withouta h-rich layer. we perform spectropolarimetric observations of 2stripped-envelope sne, the type ib sn 2009jf and the type ic sn 2009mi. bothobjects show non-zero polarization at the wavelength of the strong lines. theyalso show a loop in the stokes q-u diagram, which indicates a non-axisymmetric,three-dimensional ion distribution in the ejecta. we show that five out of sixstripped-envelope sne which have been observed spectropolarimetrically so farshow such a loop. this implies that a three-dimensional geometry is common instripped-envelope sne. we find that stronger lines tend to show higherpolarization. this effect is not related to the geometry, and must be correctedto compare the polarization of different lines or different objects. even afterthe correction, however, there remains a dispersion of polarization degreeamong different objects. such a dispersion might be caused by three-dimensionalclumpy ion distributions viewed from different directions.

1207.5975	the type iib supernova 2011dh from a supergiant progenitor	a set of hydrodynamical models based on stellar evolutionary progenitors isused to study the nature of sn 2011dh. our modeling suggests that a largeprogenitor star ---with r ~200 rsun---, is needed to reproduce the early lightcurve of sn 2011dh. this is consistent with the suggestion that the yellowsuper-giant star detected at the location of the sn in deep pre-explosionimages is the progenitor star. from the main peak of the bolometric light curveand expansion velocities we constrain the mass of the ejecta to be ~2 msun, theexplosion energy to be e= 6-10 x 10^50 erg, and the 56ni mass to beapproximately 0.06 msun. the progenitor star was composed of a helium core of 3to 4 msun and a thin hydrogen-rich envelope of ~0.1 m_sun with a main sequencemass estimated to be in the range of 12--15 msun. our models rule outprogenitors with helium-core masses larger than 8 msun, which correspond tom_zams &gt; 25 msun. this suggests that a single star evolutionary scenario for sn2011dh is unlikely.

1209.1904	probing shock breakout and progenitors of stripped-envelope supernovae  through their early radio emissions	we study properties of early radio emission from stripped-envelope supernovae(those of type iib/ib/ic). we suggest there is a sub-class of stripped-envelopesupernovae in their radio properties, including optically well-studied type icsupernovae (sne ic) 2002ap and 2007gr, showing a rapid rise to a radio peakwithin ~ 10 days reaching to a low luminosity (at least an order of magnitudefainter than a majority of sne iib/ib/ic). they show a decline after the peakshallower than others while the spectral index is similar. we show that allthese properties are naturally explained if the circumstellar material (csm)density is low and therefore the forward shock is expanding into the csmwithout deceleration. since the forward shock velocity in this situation, asestimated from the radio properties, still records the maximum velocity of thesn ejecta following the shock breakout, observing these sne in radiowavelengths provides new diagnostics on natures of the breakout and progenitorwhich otherwise requires a quite rapid follow-up in other wavelengths. theinferred post-shock breakout velocities of sne ic 2002ap and 2007gr aresub-relativistic, ~0.3c. these are higher than inferred for sn ii 1987a, inline with suggested compact progenitors. however, these are lower than expectedfor a wolf-rayet (wr) progenitor. it may reflect a still-unresolved nature ofthe progenitors just before the explosion, and we suggest that the wrprogenitor envelopes might have been inflated which could quickly reduce themaximum ejecta velocity from the initial shock breakout velocity.

1209.4682	a theoretical color-velocity correlation for supernovae associated with  gamma-ray bursts	we carry out the first multi-dimensional radiative transfer calculations tosimultaneously compute synthetic spectra and light curves for models ofsupernovae driven by fast bipolar outflows. these allow us to makeself-consistent predictions for the orientation dependence of both colourevolution and spectral features. we compare models with different degrees ofasphericity and metallicity and find significant observable consequences ofboth. in aspherical models, we find spectral and light curve features that varysystematically with observer orientation. in particular, we find that the earlyphase light curves are brighter and bluer when viewed close to the polar axisbut that the peak flux is highest for equatorial (off-axis) inclinations.spectral line features also depend systematically on observer orientation,including the velocity of the siii 6355a line. consequently, our models predicta correlation between line velocity and color that could assist theidentification of supernovae associated with off-axis jet-driven explosions.the amplitude and range of this correlation depends on the degree ofasphericity, the metallicity and the epoch of observation but we find that itis always present and acts in the same direction.

1211.5835	young supernovae as experimental sites to study electron acceleration  mechanism	radio emissions from young supernovae (~ 1 year after the explosion) show apeculiar feature in the relativistic electron population at a shock wave, wheretheir energy distribution is steeper than typically found in supernova remnants(snrs) and than the prediction from the standard diffusive shock acceleration(dsa) mechanism. this is especially established for a class of strippedenvelope supernovae (sne iib/ib/ic) where a combination of high shock velocityand low circumstellar material (csm) density makes it easier to derive theintrinsic energy distribution than in other classes of sne. we suggest thatthis apparent discrepancy reflects the situation that the low energy electronsbefore accelerated by the dsa-like mechanism are responsible for the radiosynchrotron emission from young sne, and that studying young sne sheds light onthe still-unresolved electron injection problem in the acceleration theory ofcosmic rays. we suggest that electron's energy distribution could be flattenedtoward the high energy, most likely around 100 mev, which marks a transitionfrom inefficient to efficient acceleration. identifying this feature will be amajor advance in understanding the electron acceleration mechanism. we suggesttwo further probes: (1) mm/sub-mm observations in the first year after theexplosion, and (2) x-ray observations at about 1 year and thereafter. we showthat these are reachable by alma and chandra for nearby sne.

1302.2785	extraordinary magnification of the ordinary type ia supernova ps1-10afx	recently, chornock and co-workers announced the pan-starrs discovery of atransient source reaching an apparent peak luminosity of ~4x10^44 erg s^-1. weshow that the spectra of this transient source are well fit by normal type iasupernova (snia) templates. the multi-band colors and light-curve shapes arealso consistent with normal sneia at the spectroscopically determined redshiftof z=1.3883; however, the observed flux is a constant factor of ~30 times toobright in each band over time as compared to the templates. at minimum, thisshows that the peak luminosities inferred from the light-curve widths of somesneia will deviate significantly from the established, empirical relation usedby cosmologists. we argue on physical grounds that the observed fluxes do notreflect an intrinsically luminous snia, but rather ps1-10afx is a normal sniawhose flux has been magnified by an external source. the only knownastrophysical source capable of such magnification is a gravitational lens.given the lack of obvious lens candidates, such as galaxy clusters, in thevicinity, we further argue that the lens is a supermassive black hole or acomparatively low-mass dark matter halo. in this case, the lens continues tomagnify the underlying host galaxy light. if confirmed, this discovery couldimpact a broad range of topics including cosmology, gamma-ray bursts, and darkmatter halos.

1305.1105	integral field spectroscopy of supernova explosion sites: constraining  mass and metallicity of the progenitors - i. type ib and ic supernovae	integral field spectroscopy of 11 type-ib/c supernova explosion sites innearby galaxies has been obtained using uh88/snifs and gemini-n/gmos. the useof integral field spectroscopy enables us to obtain both spatial and spectralinformation of the explosion site, allowing the identification of the parentstellar population of the supernova progenitor star. the spectrum of the parentpopulation provides metallicity determination via strong-line method and ageestimation obtained via comparison with simple stellar population (ssp) models.we adopt this information as the metallicity and age of the supernovaprogenitor, under the assumption that it was coeval with the parent stellarpopulation. the age of the star corresponds to its lifetime, which in turngives the estimate of its initial mass. with this method we were able todetermine both the metallicity and initial (zams) mass of the progenitor starsof the type ib and ic supernovae. we found that on average sn ic explosionsites are more metal-rich and younger than sn ib sites. the initial mass of theprogenitors derived from parent stellar population age suggests that sn ic havemore massive progenitors than sn ib. in addition, we also found indication thatsome of our sn progenitors are less massive than ~25 msun, indicating that theymay have been stars in a close binary system that have lost their outerenvelope via binary interactions to produce ib/c supernovae, instead of singlewolf-rayet stars. these findings support the current suggestions that bothbinary and single progenitor channels are in effect in producing type ib/csupernovae. this work also demonstrates the power of integral fieldspectroscopy in investigating supernova environments and active star formingregions.

1307.5579	the impact of type ia supernova explosions on helium companions in the  chandrasekhar-mass explosion scenario	in the version of the sd scenario of sne ia studied here, a co wd explodesclose to the chandrasekhar limit after accreting material from a non-degeneratehe companion. in the present study, we employ the stellar gadget code toperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of the sn ia ejectawith the he companion taking into account its orbital motion and spin. it isfound that only 2%--5% of the initial companion mass are stripped off from theouter layers of he companions due to the sn impact. the dependence of theunbound mass (or the kick velocity) on the orbital separation can be fitted ingood approximation by a power law for a given companion model. after the snimpact, the outer layers of a he donor star are significantly enriched withheavy elements from the low-expansion-velocity tail of sn ia ejecta. the totalmass of accumulated sn-ejecta material on the companion surface reaches about &gt;10e-3 m_sun for different companion models. this enrichment with heavy elementsprovides a potential way to observationally identify the surviving companionstar in sn remnants. finally, by artificially adjusting the explosion energy ofthe w7 explosion model, we find that the total accumulation of sn ejecta on thecompanion surface is also dependent on the explosion energy with a power lawrelation in good approximation.

1311.7180	sn 2005ip: a luminous type iin supernova emerging from a dense  circumstellar medium as revealed by x-ray observations	we report on x-ray spectral evolution of the nearby type iin supernova (sn)2005ip, based on chandra and swift observations covering from ~1 to 6 yearsafter the explosion. x-ray spectra in all epochs are well fitted by a thermalemission model with kt &gt; 7 kev. the somewhat high temperature suggests that thex-ray emission mainly arises from the circumstellar medium heated by theforward shock. we find that the spectra taken 2-3 years since the explosion areheavily absorbed n_h ~ 5e22 cm^{-2}, but the absorption gradually decreases tothe level of the galactic absorption n_h ~ 4e20 cm^{-2} at the final epoch.this indicates that the sn went off in a dense circumstellar medium and thatthe forward shock has overtaken it. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity staysconstant until the final epoch when it drops by a factor of ~2. the intrinsic0.2-10 kev luminosity during the plateau phase is measured to be ~1.5e41 erg/s,ranking sn 2005ip as one of the brightest x-ray sne. based on the columndensity, we derive a lower-limit of a mass-loss rate to be m_dot ~ 0.015(v_w/100 km/s) m_sun/yr, which roughly agrees with that inferred from the x-rayluminosity, m_dot ~ 0.02 (v_w/100 km/s) m_sun/yr, where v_w is thecircumstellar wind speed. such a high mass-loss rate suggests that theprogenitor star had eruptive mass ejections like a luminous blue variable star.the total mass ejected in the eruptive period is estimated to be ~15 m_sun,indicating that the progenitor mass is greater than ~25 m_sun.

1312.2911	type ib sn 1999dn as an example of the thoroughly mixed ejecta of ib  supernovae	we present the results of modelling archival observations of type ib sn1999dn. in the spectra, two he i absorption features are seen: a slowercomponent with larger opacity, and a more rapid he i component with smalleropacity. complementary results are obtained from modelling the bolometric lightcurve of sn 1999dn, where a two-zone model (dense inner region, and less denseouter region) provides a much better fit than a one-zone model. a key result wefind is that roughly equal amounts of radioactive material are found in bothregions. the two-zone analytical model provides a more realistic representationof the structure of the ejecta, including mixing and asymmetries, which offersa physical explanation for how the radioactive material is propelled to, andmixed within, the outer regions. our result supports the theoreticalexpectation that the radioactive content in the outflow of a type ib supernova(sn) is thoroughly mixed. we fit our model to six additional sne ibc, of whichthe majority of the sne ib are best described by the two-zone model, and themajority of the sne ic by the one-zone model. of the sne ic, only sn 2007gr wasbest fit by the two-zone model, indicating that the lack of helium spectralfeatures for this event cannot be attributed to poor mixing.

1401.4893	mass-loss histories of type iin supernova progenitors within decades  before their explosion	we present results of a systematic study of the mass-loss properties of typeiin supernova progenitors within decades before their explosion. we apply ananalytic light curve model to 11 type iin supernova bolometric light curves toderive the circumstellar medium properties. we reconstruct the mass-losshistories based on the estimated circumstellar medium properties. the estimatedmass-loss rates are mostly higher than 1e-3 msun/yr and they are consistentwith those obtained by other methods. the mass-loss rates are often found to beconstantly high within decades before their explosion. this indicates thatthere exists some mechanism to sustain the high mass-loss rates of type iinsupernova progenitors for at least decades before their explosion. thus, theshorter eruptive mass loss events observed in some type iin supernovaprogenitors are not always responsible for creating their dense circumstellarmedia. in addition, we find that type iin supernova progenitors may tend toincrease their mass-loss rates as they approach to the time of their explosion.we also show a detailed comparison between our analytic prediction andnumerical results.

1401.5160	early-phase photometry and spectroscopy of transitional type ia sn  2012ht: direct constraint on the rise time	we report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby type iasupernova (sn ia) 2012ht from $-15.8$ days to $+49.1$ days after $b$-bandmaximum. the decline rate of the light curve is $\deltam_{15}$($b$)$=1.39~\pm~0.05$ mag, which is intermediate between normal andsubluminous sne ia, and similar to that of the `transitional' type ia sn2004eo.  the spectral line profiles also closely resemble those of sn 2004eo. we wereable to observe sn 2012ht at very early phase, when it was still rising and wasabout three magnitudes fainter than at the peak. the rise time to the $b$-bandmaximum is estimated to be $17.6 \pm 0.5$ days and the time of the explosion ismjd $56277.98 \pm 0.13$. sn 2012ht is the first transitional sn ia whose risetime is directly measured without using light curve templates, and the fifth snia overall. this rise time is consistent with those of the other four snewithin the measurement error, even including the extremely early detection ofsn 2013dy. the rising part of the light curve can be fitted by a quadraticfunction, and shows no sign of a shock-heating component due to the interactionof the ejecta with a companion star. the rise time is significantly longer thanthat inferred for subluminous sne such as sn 1991bg, which suggests that aprogenitor and/or explosion mechanism of transitional sne ia are more similarto normal sne ia rather than subluminous sne ia.

1403.2455	long-lasting x-ray emission from type iib supernova 2011dh and mass-loss  history of the yellow supergiant progenitor	type iib supernova (sn) 2011dh, with conclusive detection of an unprecedentedyellow supergiant (ysg) progenitor, provides an excellent opportunity to deepenour understanding on the massive star evolution in the final centuries towardthe sn explosion. in this paper, we report on detection and analyses of thermalx-ray emission from sn iib 2011dh at ~500 days after the explosion on chandraarchival data, providing a solidly derived mass loss rate of an ysg progenitorfor the first time. we find that the circumstellar media (csm) should be dense,more than that expected from a wolf-rayet (wr) star by one order of magnitude.the emission is powered by a reverse shock penetrating into an outer envelope,fully consistent with the ysg progenitor but not with a wr progenitor. thedensity distribution at the outermost ejecta is much steeper than that expectedfrom a compact wr star, and this finding must be taken into account in modelingthe early uv/optical emission from sne iib. the derived mass loss rate is 3 x10^{-6} msun/year for the mass loss velocity of ~20 km/s in the final ~1,300years before the explosion. the derived mass loss properties are largelyconsistent with the standard wind mass loss expected for a giant star. this isnot sufficient to be a main driver to expel nearly all the hydrogen envelope.therefore, the binary interaction, with a huge mass transfer having taken placeat &gt;1,300 years before the explosion, is a likely scenario to produce the ysgprogenitor.

1404.5391	dust production factories in the early universe: formation of carbon  grains in red-supergiant winds of very massive population iii stars	we investigate the formation of dust in a stellar wind during thered-supergiant (rsg) phase of a very massive population iii star with thezero-age main sequence mass of 500 m_sun. we show that, in a carbon-rich windwith a constant velocity, carbon grains can form with a lognormal-like sizedistribution, and that all of the carbon available for dust formation finallycondense into dust for wide ranges of the mass-loss rate ((0.1-3)x10^{-3} m_sunyr^{-1}) and wind velocity (1-100 km s^{-1}). we also find that theacceleration of the wind driven by newly formed dust suppresses the graingrowth but still allows more than half of gas-phase carbon to be finally lockedup in dust grains. these results indicate that at most 1.7 m_sun of carbongrains can form in total during the rsg phase of 500 m_sun population iiistars. such a high dust yield could place very massive primordial stars asimportant sources of dust at the very early epoch of the universe if theinitial mass function of population iii stars was top-heavy. we also brieflydiscuss a new formation scenario of carbon-rich ultra-metal-poor starsconsidering the feedback from very massive population iii stars.

1406.7783	constraining physical properties of type iin supernovae through rise  times and peak luminosities	we investigate the diversity in the wind density, supernova ejecta energy,and ejecta mass in type iin supernovae based on their rise times and peakluminosities. we show that the wind density and supernova ejecta properties canbe estimated independently if both the rise time and peak luminosity areobserved. the peak luminosity is mostly determined by the supernova propertiesand the rise time can be used to estimate the wind density. we find that theejecta energy of type iin supernovae needs to vary by factors of 0.2-5 from theaverage if their ejecta mass is similar. the diversity in the observed risetimes indicates that their wind density varies by factors of 0.2-2 from theaverage. we show that type iin superluminous supernovae should have not onlylarge wind density but also large ejecta energy and/or small ejecta mass toexplain their large luminosities and the rise times at the same time. we alsonote that the shock breakout does not necessarily occur in the wind even if itis optically thick, except for the case of superluminous supernovae, and weanalyze the observational data both with and without assuming that the shockbreakout occurs in the dense wind of type iin supernovae.

1407.6711	supernova 2010as: the lowest-velocity member of a family of  flat-velocity type iib supernovae	we present extensive optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopicobservations of the stripped-envelope (se) supernova sn 2010as. spectroscopicpeculiarities, such as initially weak helium features and low expansionvelocities with a nearly flat evolution, place this object in the small familyof events previously identified as transitional type ib/c supernovae (sne).there is ubiquitous evidence of hydrogen, albeit weak, in this family of sne,indicating that they are in fact a peculiar kind of type iib sne that we name"flat-velocity type iib". the flat velocity evolution---which occurs atdifferent levels between 6000 and 8000 km/s for different sne---suggests thepresence of a dense shell in the ejecta. despite the spectroscopicsimilarities, these objects show surprisingly diverse luminosities. we discussthe possible physical or geometrical unification picture for such diversity.using archival hst images we associate sn 2010as with a massive cluster andderive a progenitor age of ~6 myr, assuming a single star-formation burst,which is compatible with a wolf-rayet progenitor. our hydrodynamical modelling,on the contrary, indicates the pre-explosion mass was relatively low, of ~4m_sol. the seeming contradiction between an young age and low pre-sn mass maybe solved by a massive interacting binary progenitor.

1408.4211	signatures of a companion star in type ia supernovae	while type ia supernovae (sne ia) have been used as precise cosmologicaldistance indicators, their progenitor systems remain unresolved. one of the keyquestions is if there is a non-degenerate companion star at the time of athermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf (wd). in this paper, we investigate ifan interaction between the sn ejecta and the companion star may result inobservable footprints around the maximum brightness and thereafter, byperforming multi-dimensional radiation transfer simulations based onhydrodynamic simulations of the interaction. we find that such systems resultin variations in various observational characteristics due to different viewingdirections, while the predicted behaviors (redder and fainter for the companiondirection) are opposite to what were suggested by the previous study. thevariations are generally modest and within observed scatters. however, themodel predicts trends between some observables different from observationallyderived, thus a large sample of sne ia with small calibration errors may beused to constrain the existence of such a companion star. the variations indifferent colors in optical band passes can be mimicked by externalextinctions, thus such an effect could be a source of a scatter in the peakluminosity and derived distance. after the peak, hydrogen-rich materialsexpelled from the companion will manifest themselves in hydrogen lines.h$\alpha$ is however extremely difficult to identify. alternatively, we findthat p$_{\beta}$ in post-maximum near-infrared spectra can potentially providepowerful diagnostics.

1409.5477	sn2014j gamma-rays from the 56ni decay chain	the measurement of gamma-ray lines from the decay chain of 56ni providesunique information about the explosion in supernovae. the 56ni freshly-producedin the supernova powers the optical light curve, as it emits gamma-rays uponits radioactive decay to 56co and then 56fe. gamma-ray lines from 56co decayare expected to become directly visible through the overlying white dwarfmaterial several weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate theoverlying material of the supernova envelope, diluted as it expands. the linesare expected to be doppler-shifted or broadened from the kinematics of the 56niejecta. with the spi spectrometer on integral and using an improvedinstrumental background method, we detect the two main lines from 56co decay at847 and 1238 kev from sn2014j at 3.3 mpc, significantly doppler-broadened, andat intensities (3.65+/-1.21) 10^-4 and (2.27+/-0.69) 10^-4 ph cm^-2s^-1,respectively, at brightness maximum. we measure their rise towards a maximumafter about 60-100 days and decline thereafter. the intensity ratio of the twolines is found consistent with expectations from 56co decay (0.62+/-0.28 atbrightness maximum, expected is 0.68). we find that the broad lines seen in thelate, gamma-ray transparent phase are not representative for the earlygamma-ray emission, and rather notice the emission spectrum to be complex andirregular until the supernova is fully transparent to gamma-rays, withprogressive uncovering of the bulk of 56ni. we infer that the explosionmorphology is not spherically symmetric, both in the distribution of 56ni andof the unburnt material which occults the 56co emission. comparing light curvesfrom different plausible models, the resulting 56ni mass is determined as0.49+/-0.09 m_sol.

1411.3778	constraining the amount of circumstellar matter and dust around type ia  supernovae through near-infrared echoes	the circumstellar (cs) environment is key to understanding progenitors oftype ia supernovae (sne ia), as well as the origin of a peculiar extinctionproperty toward sne ia for cosmological application. it has been suggested thatmultiple scatterings of sn photons by cs dust may explain the non-standardreddening law. in this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of snphotons by cs dust in the infrared (ir) wavelength regime. this effect allowsthe observed ir light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/sizeand the amount of cs dust. the method was applied to observed near-infrared(nir) sn ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the cs dust mass were derivedeven under conservative assumptions. we thereby clarify a difficulty associatedwith the cs dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiarreddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened sneia. for sne ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears tobe responsible for the non-standard extinction law. furthermore, deeper limitscan be obtained using the standard nature of sn ia nir light curves. in thisapplication, an upper limit of mdot ~10^{-8}-10^{-7} msun/yr (for the windvelocity of ~10 km/s) is obtained for a mass loss rate from a progenitor up to~0.01 pc, and mdot ~10^{-7}-10^{-6} msun/yr up to ~0.1 pc.

1502.04255	a chandrasekhar mass progenitor for the type ia supernova remnant 3c 397  from the enhanced abundances of nickel and manganese	despite decades of intense efforts, many fundamental aspects of type iasupernova (sne ia) remain elusive. one of the major open questions is whetherthe mass of the exploding white dwarf (wd) is close to the chandrasekhar limit.here we report the detection of strong k-shell emission from stable fe-peakelements in the suzaku x-ray spectrum of the type ia supernova remnant (snr) 3c397. the high ni/fe and mn/fe mass ratios (0.11-0.24 and 0.018-0.033,respectively) in the hot plasma component that dominates the k-shell emissionlines indicate a degree of neutronization in the sn ejecta which can only beachieved by electron captures in the dense cores of exploding wds with anear-chandrasekhar mass. this suggests a single-degenerate origin for 3c 397,since chandrasekhar mass progenitors are expected naturally if the wd accretesmass slowly from a companion. together with other results supporting thedouble-degenerate scenario, our work adds to the mounting evidence that bothprogenitor channels make a significant contribution to the sn ia rate instar-forming galaxies.

1504.01470	variable selection for modeling the absolute magnitude at maximum of  type ia supernovae	we discuss what is an appropriate set of explanatory variables in order topredict the absolute magnitude at the maximum of type ia supernovae. in orderto have a good prediction, the error for future data, which is called the"generalization error," should be small. we use cross-validation in order tocontrol the generalization error and lasso-type estimator in order to choosethe set of variables. this approach can be used even in the case that thenumber of samples is smaller than the number of candidate variables. we studiedthe berkeley supernova database with our approach. candidates of theexplanatory variables include normalized spectral data, variables about lines,and previously proposed flux-ratios, as well as the color and light-curvewidths. as a result, we confirmed the past understanding about type iasupernova: i) the absolute magnitude at maximum depends on the color andlight-curve width. ii) the light-curve width depends on the strength of si ii.recent studies have suggested to add more variables in order to explain theabsolute magnitude. however, our analysis does not support to add any othervariables in order to have a better generalization error.

1504.06035	hydrodynamical evolution of merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs: their  pre-supernova structure and observational counterparts	we perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations for mergingbinary carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) with masses of $1.1$ and $1.0$$m_\odot$, until the merger remnant reaches a dynamically steady state. usingthese results, we assess whether the binary could induce a thermonuclearexplosion, and whether the explosion could be observed as a type ia supernova(sn ia). we investigate three explosion mechanisms: a helium-ignition followingthe dynamical merger (`helium-ignited violent merger model'), a carbon-ignition(`carbon-ignited violent merger model'), and an explosion following theformation of the chandrasekhar mass wd (`chandrasekhar mass model'). anexplosion of the helium-ignited violent merger model is possible, while wepredict that the resulting sn ejecta are highly asymmetric since its companionstar is fully intact at the time of the explosion. the carbon-ignited violentmerger model can also lead to an explosion. however, the envelope of theexploding wd spreads out to $\sim 0.1r_\odot$; it is much larger than thatinferred for sn 2011fe ($&lt; 0.1r_\odot $) while much smaller than that for sn2014j ($\sim 1r_\odot$). for the particular combination of the wd massesstudied in this work, the chandrasekhar mass model is not successful to lead toan sn ia explosion. besides these assessments, we investigate the evolution ofunbound materials ejected through the merging process (`merger ejecta'),assuming a case where the sn ia explosion is not triggered by the helium- orcarbon-ignition during the merger. the merger ejecta interact with thesurrounding interstellar medium, and form a shell. the shell has a bolometricluminosity of more than $2 \times 10^{35}$ ergs$^{-1}$ lasting for $\sim 2\times 10^4$ yr. if this is the case, milky way should harbor about $10$ suchshells at any given time.

1505.01593	oister optical and near-infrared observations of type iax supernova  2012z	we report observations of the type iax supernova (sn iax) 2012z at opticaland near-infrared wavelengths from immediately after the explosion until $\sim$$260$ days after the maximum luminosity using the optical and infraredsynergetic telescopes for education and research (oister) target-of-opportunity(too) program and the subaru telescope. we found that the near-infrared (nir)light curve evolutions and color evolutions are similar to those of sne iax2005hk and 2008ha. the nir absolute magnitudes ($m_{j}\sim-18.1$ mag and$m_{h}\sim-18.3$ mag) and the rate of decline of the light curve ($\delta$$m_{15}$($b$)$=1.6 \pm 0.1$ mag) are very similar to those of sn 2005hk($m_{j}\sim-17.7$ mag, $m_{h}\sim$$-18.0$ mag, and $\delta$$m_{15}$($b$)$\sim1.6$ mag), yet differ significantly from sne 2008ha and2010ae ($m_{j}\sim-14 - -15$ mag and $\delta$ $m_{15}$($b$)$\sim2.4-2.7$ mag).the estimated rise time is $12.0 \pm 3.0$ days, which is significantly shorterthan that of sn 2005hk or any other ia sne. the rapid rise indicates that the$^{56}$ni distribution may extend into the outer layer or that the effectiveopacity may be lower than that in normal sne ia. the late-phase spectrumexhibits broader emission lines than those of sn 2005hk by a factor of 6--8.such high velocities of the emission lines indicate that the density profile ofthe inner ejecta extends more than that of sn 2005hk. we argue that the mostfavored explosion scenario is a `failed deflagration' model, although thepulsational delayed detonations is not excluded.

1505.01646	a systematic study of carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers: mass  combinations for type ia supernovae	mergers of two carbon-oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) have been considered asprogenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia). based on smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) simulations, previous studies claimed that mergers of cowds lead to an sn ia explosion either in the dynamical merger phase orstationary rotating merger remnant phase. however, the mass range of co wdsthat lead to an sn ia has not been clearly identified yet. in the present work,we perform systematic sph merger simulations for the wd masses ranging from$0.5~m_{\odot}$ to $1.1~m_{\odot}$ with higher resolutions than the previoussystematic surveys and examine whether or not carbon burning occurs dynamicallyor quiescently in each phase. we further study the possibility of sn iaexplosion and estimate the mass range of co wds that lead to an sn ia. we foundthat when the both wds are massive, i.e., in the mass range of $0.9~m_{\odot}{\le} m_{1,2} {\le} 1.1~m_{\odot}$, they can explode as an sn ia in the mergerphase. on the other hand, when the more massive wd is in the range of$0.7~m_{\odot} {\le} m_{1} {\le} 0.9~m_{\odot}$ and the total mass exceeds$1.38~m_{\odot}$, they can finally explode in the stationary rotating mergerremnant phase. we estimate the contribution of co wd mergers to the entire snia rate in our galaxy to be of ${\lt} 9\%$. so, it might be difficult toexplain all galactic sne ia by co wd mergers.

1506.03135	kepler's supernova: an overluminous type ia event interacting with a  massive circumstellar medium at a very late phase	we have analyzed xmm-newton, chandra, and suzaku observations of kepler'ssupernova remnant (snr) to investigate the properties of both the sn ejecta andthe circumstellar medium (csm). for comparison, we have also analyzed twosimilarly-aged, ejecta-dominated snrs: tycho's snr, thought to be the remnantof a typical type ia sn, and snr 0509-67.5 in the large magellanic cloud,thought to be the remnant of an overluminous type ia sn. by simply comparingthe x-ray spectra, we find that line intensity ratios of iron-group elements(ige) to intermediate-mass elements (ime) for kepler's snr and snr 0509-67.5are much higher than those for tycho's snr. we therefore argue that kepler isthe product of an overluminous type ia sn. this inference is supported by ourspectral modeling, which reveals the ige and ime masses respectively to be~0.95 m_sun and ~0.12 m_sun (kepler's snr), ~0.75 m_sun and ~0.34 m_sun (snr0509-67.5), and ~0.35 m_sun and ~0.70 m_sun (tycho's snr). we find that the csmcomponent in kepler's snr consists of tenuous diffuse gas (~0.3 m_sun) presentthroughout the entire remnant, plus dense knots (~0.035 m_sun). both of thesecomponents have an elevated n abundance (n/h ~ 4 times the solar value),suggesting that they originate from cno-processed material from the progenitorsystem. the mass of the diffuse csm allows us to infer the pre-sn mass-lossrate to be ~1.5e-5 (v_w/10 km/s) m_sun/yr, in general agreement with resultsfrom recent hydrodynamical simulations. since the dense knots have slow propermotions and relatively small ionization timescales, they were likely located afew pc away from the progenitor system. therefore, we argue that kepler's snwas an overluminous event that started to interact with massive csm a fewhundred years after the explosion. this supports the possible link betweenoverluminous sne and the so-called "ia-csm" sne.

1508.02042	the silicon and calcium high-velocity features in type ia supernovae  from early to maximum phases	the high-velocity features (hvfs) in optical spectra of type ia supernovae(sne ia) are examined with a large sample including very early-time spectra(e.g., t &lt; -7 days). multiple gaussian fits are applied to examine the hvfs andtheir evolutions, using constraints on expansion velocities for the samespecies (i.e., siii 5972 and siii 6355). we find that strong hvfs tend toappear in sne ia with smaller decline rates (e.g., dm15(b)&lt;1.4 mag), clarifyingthat the finding by childress et al. (2014) for the ca-hvfs innear-maximum-light spectra applies both to the si-hvfs and ca-hvfs in theearlier phase. the si-hvfs seem to be more common in fast-expanding sne ia,which is different from the earlier result that the ca-hvfs are associated withsne ia having slower siii 6355 velocities at maximum light (i.e., vsi). thisdifference can be due to that the hvfs in fast-expanding sne ia usuallydisappear more rapidly and are easily blended with the photospheric componentswhen approaching the maximum light. moreover, sne ia with both stronger hvfs atearly phases and larger vsi are found to have noticeably redder b-v colors andoccur preferentially in the inner regions of their host galaxies, while thosewith stronger hvfs but smaller vsi show opposite tendencies, suggesting thatthese two subclasses have different explosion environments and their hvfs mayhave different origins. we further examine the relationships between theabsorption features of siii 6355 and caii ir lines, and find that theirphotospheric components are well correlated in velocity and strength but thecorresponding hvfs show larger scatter. these results cannot be explained withionization and/or thermal processes alone, and different mechanisms arerequired for the creation of hvf-forming region in sne ia.

1509.01588	the progenitor of the type iib sn 2008ax revisited	hubble space telescope observations of the site of the supernova (sn) 2008axobtained in 2011 and 2013 reveal that the possible progenitor object detectedin pre-explosion images was in fact multiple. four point sources are resolvedin the new, higher-resolution images. we identify one of the sources with thefading sn. the other three objects are consistent with single supergiant stars.we conclude that their light contaminated the previously identified progenitorcandidate. after subtraction of these stars, the progenitor appears to besignificantly fainter and bluer than previously measured. post-explosionphotometry at the sn location indicates that the progenitor object hasdisappeared. if single, the progenitor is compatible with a supergiant star ofb to mid-a spectral type, while a wolf-rayet (wr) star would be too luminous inthe ultraviolet to account for the observations. moreover, our hydrodynamicalmodelling shows the pre-explosion mass was $4-5$ $m_\odot$ and the radius was$30-50$ $r_\odot$, which is incompatible with a wr progenitor. we present apossible interacting binary progenitor computed with our evolutionary modelsthat reproduces all the observational evidence. a companion star as luminous asan o9-b0 main-sequence star may have remained after the explosion.

0806.1589	optical spectropolarimetry and asphericity of type ic sn 2007gr	we present optical spectropolarimetric observations of type ic supernova (sn)2007gr with subaru telescope at 21 days after the maximum brightness (~37 daysafter the explosion). non-zero polarization as high as ~3% is observed at theabsorption feature of ca ii ir triplet. the polarization of the continuum lightis ~0.5% if we estimate the interstellar polarization (isp) component assumingthat the continuum polarization has a single polarization angle. this suggeststhat the axis ratio of the sn photosphere projected to the sky is differentfrom unity by ~10%. the polarization angle at the ca ii absorption is almostaligned to that of the continuum light. these features may be understood by themodel where a bipolar explosion with an oblate photosphere is viewed from theslightly off-axis direction and explosively synthesized ca near the polarregion obscures the light originated around the minor axis of the snphotosphere. given the uncertainty of the isp, however, the polarization datacould also be interpreted by the model with an almost spherically symmetricphotosphere and a clumpy ca ii distribution.

0808.0138	subaru and keck observations of the peculiar type ia supernova 2006gz at  late phases	recently, a few peculiar type ia supernovae (sne) that show exceptionallylarge peak luminosity have been discovered. their luminosity requires more than1 msun of 56ni ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might haveoriginated from super-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. however, the nature ofthese objects is not yet well understood. in particular, no data have beentaken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. we report on subaruand keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the sn ia2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these "overluminous" sne ia.the late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal sne ia,reinforcing the argument that sn 2006gz belongs to a different subclass thannormal sne ia. however, the peculiar features found at late times are notreadily connected to a large amount of 56ni; the sn is faint, and it lacks [feii] and [fe iii] emission. if the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the snejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal sne ia, the mass of 56ni doesnot exceed ~ 0.3 msun. we discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem.with the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identifywhich process is responsible. an interesting possibility is that the bulk ofthe emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in othersne ia, which might be related to dense c-rich regions as indicated by theearly-phase data. alternatively, it might be the case that sn 2006gz, thoughpeculiar, was actually not substantially overluminous at early times.

astro-ph;0110528	hypernova nucleosynthesis and early chemical evolution	we review the characteristics of nucleosynthesis in 'hypernovae', i.e.,supernovae with very large explosion energies ($ \gsim 10^{52} $ ergs). thehypernova yields compared to those of ordinary core-collapse supernovae showthe following characteristics: 1) complete si-burning takes place in moreextended region, so that the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete siburning regions is generally larger in hypernovae than normal supernovae. as aresult, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(zn, co)/fe], smaller[(mn, cr)/fe], and larger [fe/o], which could explain the trend observed invery metal-poor stars. 2) si-burning takes place in lower density regions, sothat the effects of $\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. thus $^{44}$ca,$^{48}$ti, and $^{64}$zn are produced more abundantly than in normalsupernovae. the large [(ti, zn)/fe] ratios observed in very metal-poor starsstrongly suggest a significant contribution of hypernovae. 3) oxygen burningalso takes place in more extended regions for the larger explosion energy. thena larger amount of si, s, ar, and ca ("si") are synthesized, which makes the"si"/o ratio larger. the abundance pattern of the starburst galaxy m82 may beattributed to hypernova explosions. asphericity in the explosions strengthensthe nucleosynthesis properties of hypernovae except for "si"/o. we thus suggestthat hypernovae make important contribution to the early galactic (and cosmic)chemical evolution.

astro-ph;0307108	dust in the early universe: dust formation in the ejecta of population  iii supernovae	we investigate the formation of dust grains in the ejecta of population iiisupernovae including pair--instability supernovae, applying a theory of non--steady state nucleation and grain growth. in the calculations, the timeevolution of gas temperature in theejecta, which strongly affects the numberdensity and size of newly formed grains, is calculated by solving the radiativetransfer equation taking account of the energy deposition of radio activeelements. two extreme cases are considered for the mixing of elements in theejecta; unmixed and uniformly mixed cases within the he--core.  the results of calculations are summarized as the followings; in the unmixedejecta, a variety of grain species condense, reflecting the difference of theelemental composition at the formation site in the ejecta, otherwise only oxidegrains condense in the uniformly mixed ejecta. the average size of newly formedgrains spans the range of three orders of magnitude, depending on the grainspecies and the formation condition, and the maximum radius is limited to lessthan 1 $\mu$m, which does not depend on the progenitor mass. the sizedistribution function summed up over all grain species is approximated by apower--law formula whose index is -3.5 for the larger radius and -2.5 for thesmaller one; the radius at the crossover point ranges from 0.004 to 0.1 $\mu$m,depending on the model of supernovae. the fraction of mass locked into dustgrains increases with increasing the progenitor mass; 2--5 % of the progenitormass for core collapse supernovae and 15--30 % for pair--instability supernovaewhose progenitor mass ranges from 140 to 260 $m_{\odot}$. thus, if the verymassive stars populate the first generation stars, a large amount of dustgrains would be produced in the early universe.

astro-ph;0409185	signature of electron capture in iron-rich ejecta of sn 2003du	late-time near-infrared and optical spectra are presented for thenormal-bright sn2003du. at about 300 days after the explosion, the emissionprofiles of well isolated [feii] lines (in particular that of the strong1.644mu feature) trace out the global kinematic distribution of radioactivematerial in the expanding. in sn2003du, the 1.644 mu [feii] line shows aflat-topped, profile, indicative of a thick but hollow-centered expandingshell, rather than a strongly-peaked profile that would be expected from a``center-filled'' distribution.based on detailed models for explodingchandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, we show that the feature is consistent withspherical explosion models.our model predicts central region of non-radioactiveelectron-capture elements up to 2500--3000km/s as a consequence of burningunder high density, and an extended region of 56ni up to 9,000--10,000km/s.furthermore our analysis indicates that the 1.644mu [feii] profile is notconsistent with strong mixing between the regions of electron- capture isotopesand the 56ni layers as is predicted by detailed 3d models for nucleardeflagration fronts. we discuss the possibility that the flat-topped profilecould be produced as a result of an infrared catastrophe and conclude that suchan explanation is unlikely. we put our results in context to other sneia andbriefly discuss the implications of our result for the use of sne ia ascosmological standard candles.

astro-ph;0509750	precursors and main-bursts of gamma ray bursts in a hypernova scenario	we investigate a "hypernova" model for gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., massivec+o star model with relativistic jets. in this model, non-thermal precursorscan be produced by the "first" relativistic shell ejected from the star. maingrbs are produced behind the "first"-shell by the collisions of severalrelativistic shells. they become visible to distant observers after thecolliding region becomes optically thin. we examine six selected conditionsusing relativistic hydrodynamical simulations and simple analyses.interestingly, our simulations show that sub-relativistic $(v \sim 0.8c)$ jetsfrom the central engine is sufficient to produce highly-relativistic $(\gamma &gt;100)$ shells. we find that the relativistic shells from such a star canreproduce observed grbs with certain conditions. two conditions are especiallyimportant. one is the sufficiently long duration of the central engine $ \gsim100$ sec. the other is the existence of a dense-shell somewhere behind the"first"-shell. under these conditions, both the existence and non-existence ofprecursors, and long delay between precursors and main grbs can be explained.

astro-ph;0603184	3d models for high velocity features in type ia supernovae	spectral synthesis in 3-dimensional (3d) space for the earliest spectra oftype ia supernovae (sne ia) is presented. in particular, the high velocityabsorption features that are commonly seen at the earliest epochs ($\sim 10$days before maximum light) are investigated by means of a 3d monte carlospectral synthesis code. the increasing number of early spectra availableallows statistical study of the geometry of the ejecta. the observed diversityin strength of the high velocity features (hvfs) can be explained in terms of a``covering factor'', which represents the fraction of the projected photospherethat is concealed by high velocity material. various geometrical modelsinvolving high velocity material with a clumpy structure or a thick torus cannaturally account for the observed statistics of hvfs. hvfs may be formed by acombination of density and abundance enhancements. such enhancements may beproduced in the explosion itself or may be the result of interaction withcircumstellar material or an accretion disk. models with 1 or 2 blobs, as wellas a thin torus or disk-like enhancement are unlikely as a standard situation.

astro-ph;0605725	nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse supernovae and hypernovae, and  galactic chemical evolution	we present new nucleosynthesis yields as functions of the stellar mass,metallicity, and explosion energy (corresponding to normal supernovae andhypernovae). we apply the results to the chemical evolution of the solarneighborhood. our new yields are based on the new developments in theobservational/theoretical studies of supernovae (sne) and extremely metal-poor(emp) stars in the halo, which have provided excellent opportunities to testthe explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. we use the light curve andspectra fitting of individual sn to estimate the mass of the progenitor,explosion energy, and produced 56ni mass. comparison with the abundancepatterns of emp stars has made it possible to determine the model parameters ofcore-collapse sne, such as mixing-fallback parameters.  more specifically, we take into account the two distinct new classes ofmassive sne: 1) very energetic hypernovae, whose kinetic energy (ke) is morethan 10 times the ke of normal core-collapse sne, and 2) very faint and lowenergy sne (faint sne). these two new classes of sne are likely to be``black-hole-forming'' sne with rotating or non-rotating black holes.nucleosynthesis in hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios(zn,co,v,ti)/fe and smaller (mn,cr)/fe than normal sne, which can explain theobserved trends of these ratios in emp stars. nucleosynthesis in faint sne ischaracterized by a large amount of fall-back, which explains the abundancepattern of the most fe-poor stars. these comparisons suggest thatblack-hole-forming sne made important contributions to the early galactic (andcosmic) chemical evolution.

0809.4369	evolution of newly formed dust in population iii supernova remnants and  its impact on the elemental composition of population ii.5 stars	we investigate the evolution of dust formed in population iii supernovae(sne) by considering its transport and processing by sputtering within the snremnants (snrs). we find that the fates of dust grains within snrs heavilydepend on their initial radii $a_{\rm ini}$. for type ii snrs expanding intothe ambient medium with density of $n_{\rm h,0} = 1$ cm$^{-3}$, grains of$a_{\rm ini} &lt; 0.05$ $\mu$m are detained in the shocked hot gas and arecompletely destroyed, while grains of $a_{\rm ini} &gt; 0.2$ $\mu$m are injectedinto the surrounding medium without being destroyed significantly. grains with$a_{\rm ini}$ = 0.05-0.2 $\mu$m are finally trapped in the dense shell behindthe forward shock. we show that the grains piled up in the dense shell enrichthe gas up to 10$^{-6}-10^{-4}$ $z_\odot$, high enough to form low-mass starswith 0.1-1 $m_\odot$. in addition, [fe/h] in the dense shell ranges from -6 to-4.5, which is in good agreement with the ultra-metal-poor stars with [fe/h] &lt;-4. we suggest that newly formed dust in a population iii sn can have greatimpacts on the stellar mass and elemental composition of population ii.5 starsformed in the shell of the snr.

0706.0383	evolution of dust in primordial supernova remnants: can dust grains  formed in the ejecta survive and be injected into the early interstellar  medium?	we investigate the evolution of dust that formed at population iii supernova(sn) explosions and its processing through the collisions with the reverseshocks resulting from the interaction of the sn ejecta with the ambient medium.in particular, we investigate the transport of the shocked dust within the snremnant (snr), and its effect on the chemical composition, the sizedistribution, and the total mass of dust surviving in snr. we find that theevolution of the reverse shock, and hence its effect on the processing of thedust depends on the thickness of the envelope retained by the progenitor star.furthermore, the transport and survival of the dust grains depend on theirinitial radius, a_{ini}, and composition: for type ii snrs expanding into theinterstellar medium (ism) with a density of n_{h,0}=1 cm^{-3}, small grainswith a_{ini} &lt; ~ 0.05 micron are completely destroyed by sputtering in thepostshock flow, while grains with a_{ini}= 0.05--0.2 micron are trapped intothe dense shell behind the forward shock. very large grains of a_{ini} &gt; ~ 0.2micron are ejected into the ism without decreasing their sizes significantly.we find that the total mass fraction of dust that is destroyed by the reverseshock ranges from 0.2 to 1.0, depending on the energy of the explosion and thedensity of the ambient ism. the results of our calculations have significantimpact on the abundance pattern of subsequent generation of stars that form inthe dense shell of primordial snrs.

0811.2095	observational characteristics and possible asphericity of over-luminous  type ia supernovae	a few type ia supernovae (sne ia) have been suggested to be an explosion of asuper-chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (wd) to account for their largeluminosities, requiring a large amount of 56ni. however, the candidateover-luminous sne ia 2003fg, 2006gz, and (moderately over-luminous) sn 1991t,have very different observational features: the characteristic time-scale andvelocity are very different. we examine if and how the diversity can beexplained, by 1d spherical radiation transport calculations covering a widerange of model parameters (e.g., wd mass). the observations of sn 2006gz arenaturally explained by the super-chandrasekhar-mass model. sn 1991t representsa marginal case, which may either be a chandrasekhar or asuper-chandrasekhar-mass wd explosion. on the other hand, the low velocity andshort time-scale seen in sn 2003fg indicate that the ejecta mass is smallerthan the chandrasekhar-mass, which is an apparent contradiction to the largeluminosity. we suggest that the problem is solved if the progenitor wd, andthus the sn explosion, is aspherical. this may reflect a rapid rotation of theprogenitor star, likely a consequence of the super-chandrasekhar-mass wdprogenitor. the observed differences between sne 2003fg and 2006gz may beattributed to different viewing orientations.
