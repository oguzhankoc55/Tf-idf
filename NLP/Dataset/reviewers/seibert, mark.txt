0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0904.1596	luminous thermal flares from quiescent supermassive black holes	a dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will berevealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, anda flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of thestellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. here we presentthe third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the galex deep imagingsurvey: a 1.6x10^{43} erg s^{-1} uv/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy atz=0.1855. the uv/optical sed during the peak of the flare measured by galex andpalomar lfc imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody witht_{bb}=1.7x10^{5} k and a bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{45} erg s^{-1},assuming an internal extinction with e(b-v)_{gas}=0.3. the chandra upper limiton the x-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, l_{x}(2-10 kev)&lt; 10^{41}erg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios ofuv to x-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. we compare the lightcurves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidatesdiscovered by galex, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by thepower-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disruptedsolar-type star, and (2) the uv/optical seds can be attributed to thermalemission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidaldisruption radius of a ~10^{7} m_sun central black hole. we use the observedpeak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5 &gt; m_{g} &gt; -18.9) topredict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.(abridged)

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0909.2279	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in galaxies at z~0.1: the effect of  star formation and agn	we present the analysis of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) spectraof a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 observed withthe spitzer irs. we compare the relative strengths of pah emission featureswith sdss optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between pah grainproperties and star formation and agn activity. short-to-long wavelength pahratios, and in particular the 7.7-to-11.3 micron feature ratio, are stronglycorrelated with the star formation diagnostics d_n(4000) and h-alpha equivalentwidth, increasing with younger stellar populations. this ratio also shows asignificant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the activegalaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 micron emission. a hard radiation field asmeasured by [oiii]/h-beta and [neiii]_15.6/[neii]_12.8 affects pah ratiosdifferently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity oran agn. our results are consistent with a picture in which larger pah moleculesgrow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller pah molecules arepreferentially destroyed by agn.

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0910.5123	gama: towards a physical understanding of galaxy formation	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project is the latest in a tradition oflarge galaxy redshift surveys, and is now underway on the 3.9m anglo-australiantelescope at siding spring observatory. gama is designed to map extragalacticstructures on scales of 1kpc - 1mpc in complete detail to a redshift of z~0.2,and to trace the distribution of luminous galaxies out to z~0.5. the principalscience aim is to test the standard hierarchical structure formation paradigmof cold dark matter (cdm) on scales of galaxy groups, pairs, discs, bulges andbars. we will measure (1) the dark matter halo mass function (as inferred fromgalaxy group velocity dispersions); (2) baryonic processes, such as starformation and galaxy formation efficiency (as derived from galaxy stellar massfunctions); and (3) the evolution of galaxy merger rates (via galaxy closepairs and galaxy asymmetries). additionally, gama will form the central part ofa new galaxy database, which aims to contain 275,000 galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage from coordinated observations with the latestinternational ground- and space-based facilities: galex, vst, vista, wise,herschel, gmrt and askap. together, these data will provide increased depth(over 2 magnitudes), doubled spatial resolution (0.7"), and significantlyextended wavelength coverage (uv through far-ir to radio) over the main sdssspectroscopic survey for five regions, each of around 50 deg^2. this databasewill permit detailed investigations of the structural, chemical, and dynamicalproperties of all galaxy types, across all environments, and over a 5 billionyear timeline.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

1003.4985	ngc 404, a rejuvenated lenticular galaxy on a merger-induced, blueward  excursion into the green valley	we have discovered recent star formation in the outermost portion (1-4x r_25)of the nearby lenticular (s0) galaxy ngc 404 using galex uv imaging. fuv-brightsources are strongly concentrated within the galaxy's hi ring (formed by amerger event according to del rio et al.), even though the average gas densityis dynamically subcritical. archival hst imaging reveals resolved upper mainsequence stars and conclusively demonstrates that the uv light originates fromrecent star formation activity. we present fuv, nuv radial surface brightnessprofiles and integrated magnitudes for ngc 404. within the ring, the averagestar formation rate surface density (sigma_{sfr}) is 2.2x10^-5 msun/yr/kpc^2.of the total fuv flux, 70% comes from the hi ring which is forming stars at arate of 2.5x10^-3 msun/yr. the gas consumption timescale, assuming a constantsfr and no gas recycling, is several times the age of the universe. in thecontext of the uv-optical galaxy cmd, the presence of the sf hi ring places ngc404 in the green valley separating the red and blue sequences. the rejuvenatedlenticular galaxy has experienced a merger-induced, disk-building excursionaway from the red sequence toward bluer colors, where it may evolve quiescentlyor (if appropriately triggered) experience a burst capable of placing it on theblue/star-forming sequence for up to ~1 gyr. the green valley galaxy populationis heterogeneous, with most systems transitioning from blue to red but othersevolving in the opposite sense due to acquisition of fresh gas through variouschannels.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1011.6098	dust attenuation in uv-selected starbursts at high redshift and their  local counterparts: implications for the cosmic star formation rate density	we present a new analysis of the dust obscuration in starburst galaxies atlow and high redshift. this study is motivated by our unique sample of the mostextreme uv-selected starburst galaxies in the nearby universe (z&lt;0.3), found tobe good analogs of high-redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in most of theirphysical properties. we find that the dust properties of the lyman breakanalogs (lbas) are consistent with the relation derived previously by meurer etal. (m99) that is commonly used to dust-correct star formation ratemeasurements at a very wide range of redshifts. we directly compare our resultswith high redshift samples (lbgs, bzk, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having irdata either from spitzer or herschel. the attenuation in typical lbgs at z=2-3and lbas is very similar. because lbas are much better analogs to lbgs comparedto previous local star-forming samples, including m99, the practice ofdust-correcting the sfrs of high redshift galaxies based on the localcalibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. we illustrate theimportance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relationbetween uv measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated,dust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.

1012.0749	the thick disk in the galaxy ngc 4244 from s4g imaging	if thick disks are ubiquitous and a natural product of disk galaxy formationand/or evolution processes, all undisturbed galaxies which have evolved duringa significant fraction of a hubble time should have a thick disk. the late-typespiral galaxy ngc 4244 has been reported as the only nearby edge-on galaxywithout a confirmed thick disk. using data from the spitzer survey of stellarstructure in galaxies (s4g) we have identified signs of two disk components inthis galaxy. the asymmetries between the light profiles on both sides of themid-plane of ngc 4244 can be explained by a combination of the galaxy not beingperfectly edge-on and a certain degree of opacity of the thin disk. we arguethat the subtlety of the thick disk is a consequence of either a limitedsecular evolution in ngc 4244, a small fraction of stellar material in thefragments which built the galaxy, or a high amount of gaseous accretion afterthe formation of the galaxy.

1101.4219	extreme feedback and the epoch of reionization: clues in the local  universe	the source responsible for reionizing the universe at z &gt; 6 remainsuncertain. while an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxiesmay be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of theirionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. attempts tomeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lowerredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. in this paper we present new hstcos and archival fuse far-uv spectroscopy of a sample of eleven lyman breakanalogs (lbas), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble thehigh-z lyman break galaxies. we combine these data with sdss optical spectraand spitzer photometry. we also analyze archival fuse observations of fifteentypical uv-bright local starbursts. we find evidence of small covering factorsfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. this is based on two independentpieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of thestrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratioof extinction-corrected h-alpha to uv plus far-ir luminosities. these objectsrepresent three of the four lbas that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),and highly massive (~10^9 mo) dominant central object (dco). these threeobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount ofblueshifted ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factorof neutral gas. all four lbas with dcos in our sample show extremely highvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. we show thatthese properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburstthat is exceptionally compact. we speculate that such extreme feedback may berequired to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.

1101.6051	the recent star formation in ngc 6822: an ultraviolet study	we characterize the star formation in the low-metallicity galaxy ngc 6822over the past few hundred million years, using galex far-uv (fuv, 1344-1786 a)and near-uv (nuv, 1771-2831 a) imaging, and ground-based ha imaging. from galexfuv image, we define 77 star-forming (sf) regions with area &gt;860 pc^2, andsurface brightness &lt;=26.8 mag(ab)arcsec^-2, within 0.2deg (1.7kpc) of thecenter of the galaxy. we estimate the extinction by interstellar dust in eachsf region from resolved photometry of the hot stars it contains: e(b-v) rangesfrom the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. theintegrated fuv and nuv photometry, compared with stellar population models,yields ages of the sf complexes up to a few hundred myr, and masses from 2x10^2msun to 1.5x10^6 msun. the derived ages and masses strongly depend on theassumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary acrossthe galaxy. the total mass of the fuv-defined sf regions translates into anaverage star formation rate (sfr) of 1.4x10^-2 msun/yr over the past 100 myr,and sfr=1.0x10^-2 msun/yr in the most recent 10 myr. the latter is in agreementwith the value that we derive from the ha luminosity, sfr=0.008 msun/yr. thesfr in the most recent epoch becomes higher if we add the sfr=0.02 msun/yrinferred from far-ir measurements, which trace star formation still embedded indust (age &lt;= a few myr).

0709.3304	hst morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs i: evidence for  starbursts triggered by merging	heckman et al. (2005) used the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv imagingsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compactuv-luminous galaxies (uvlgs) that closely resembles high redshift lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). we present hst images in the uv, optical, and ha, andresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the goods/udf fields to showthat the morphologies of uvlgs are also similar to those of lbgs. our sample of8 lbg analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between starformation and lbg morphology. faint tidal features or companions can be seen inall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are theresult of a merger or interaction. the uv/optical light is dominated byunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (ssbs). a detailed comparisonwith the galaxies haro 11 and vv 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the ssbsthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. the structuralfeatures revealed by the new hst images occur on very small physical scales andare thus not detectable in images of high redshift lbgs, except in a few caseswhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. we propose, therefore, thatlbgs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 msun) systems, andthat the mergers trigger the formation of ssbs. if galaxies at high redshiftsare dominated by ssbs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function ispredicted to have slope alpha~2. our results are the most direct confirmationto date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in theearly universe was highly collisional.

1107.0529	the unusual vertical mass distribution of ngc 4013 seen through the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	ngc 4013 is a nearby sb edge-on galaxy known for its "prodigious" hi warp andits "giant" tidal stream. previous work on this unusual object shows that itcannot be fitted satisfactorily by a canonical thin+thick disk structure. wehave produced a new decomposition of ngc 4013, considering three stellarflattened components (thin+thick disk plus an extra and more extendedcomponent) and one gaseous disk. all four components are considered to begravitationally coupled and isothermal. to do so, we have used the 3.6micronimages from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). we findevidence for ngc4013 indeed having a thin and a thick disk and an extraflattened component. this smooth and extended component (scaleheight z_ec kpc)could be interpreted as a thick disk or as a squashed ellipsoidal halo andcontains ~20% of the total mass of all three stellar components. we argue it isunlikely to be related to the ongoing merger or due to the off-plane stars froma warp in the other two disk components. instead, we favor a scenario in whichthe thick disk and the extended component were formed in a two-stage process,in which an initially thick disk has been dynamically heated by a merger soonenough in the galaxy history to have a new thick disk formed within it.

1203.0467	the s4g perspective on circumstellar dust extinction of agb stars in  m100	we examine the effect of circumstellar dust extinction on the near-ircontribution of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in intermediate-ageclusters throughout the disk of m100. for our sample of 17 agb-dominatedclusters we extract optical-to-mid-ir seds and find that nir brightness iscoupled to the mid-ir dust emission in such a way that a significant reductionof agb light, of up to 1 mag in k-band, follows from extinction by the dustshell formed during this stage. since the dust optical depth varies with agbchemistry (c-rich or o-rich), our results suggest that the contribution of agbstars to the flux from their host clusters will be closely linked to themetallicity and the progenitor mass of the agb star, to which dust chemistryand mass-loss rate are sensitive. our sample of clusters--each the analogue ofa ~1 gyr old post-starburst galaxy--has implications within the context of massand age estimation via sed modelling at high z: we find that the average ~0.5mag extinction estimated here may be sufficient to reduce the agb contributionin (rest-frame) k-band from ~70%, as predicted in the latest generation ofsynthesis models, to ~35%. our technique for selecting agb-dominated clustersin nearby galaxies promises to be effective for discriminating theuncertainties associated with agb stars in intermediate-age populations thatplague age and mass estimation in high-z galaxies.

1204.3879	early type galaxies with tidal debris and their scaling relations in the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	tidal debris around galaxies can yield important clues on their evolution. wehave identified tidal debris in 11 early type galaxies (t \leq 0) from a sampleof 65 early types drawn from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s4g). the tidal debris includes features such as shells, ripples andtidal tails. a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional decompositionof galactic structures, was used to quantify the residual tidal features. thetidal debris contributes ~3 - 10% to the total 3.6 {\mu}m luminosity of thehost galaxy. structural parameters of the galaxies were estimated usingtwo-dimensional profile fitting. we investigate the locations of galaxies withtidal debris in the fundamental plane and kormendy relation. we find thatgalaxies with tidal debris lie within the scatter of early type galaxieswithout tidal features. assuming that the tidal debris is indicative of recentgravitational interaction or merger, this suggests that these galaxies haveeither undergone minor merging events so that the overall structural propertiesof the galaxies are not significantly altered, or they have undergone a majormerging events but already have experienced sufficient relaxation andphase-mixing so that their structural properties become similar to those of thenon-interacting early type galaxies.

1205.3531	the inter-eruption timescale of classical novae from expansion of the z  camelopardalis shell	the dwarf nova z camelopardalis is surrounded by the largest known classicalnova shell. this shell demonstrates that at least some dwarf novae must haveundergone classical nova eruptions in the past, and that at least someclassical novae become dwarf novae long after their nova thermonuclearoutbursts. the current size of the shell, its known distance, and the largestobserved nova ejection velocity set a lower limit to the time since z cam'slast outburst of 220 years. the brightest part of the z cam shell's radius iscurrently p ~ 1690 pixels. no expansion of the radius of the brightest part ofthe ejecta was detected, with an upper limit of pdot &lt; 1 pixel/3 years. thissuggests that the last z cam eruption occurred p/pdot &gt; 5,000 years ago.however, including the important effect of deceleration as the ejecta sweeps upinterstellar matter in its snowplow phase reduces the lower limit to 1300years. this is the first strong test of the prediction of nova thermonuclearrunaway theory that the inter-outburst times of classical novae are longer than1000 yr. the intriguing suggestion that z cam was a bright nova, recorded bychinese imperial astrologers in october - november 77 bce, is consistent withour measurements. if z cam was indeed the nova of 77 bce we predict that itsejecta are currently expanding at 85 km/s, or 0.11 arcsec/yr. detection andmeasurement of this rate of expansion are doable in just a few years.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1208.3281	carnegie hubble program: a mid-infrared calibration of the hubble  constant	using a mid-infrared calibration of the cepheid distance scale based onrecent observations at 3.6 um with the spitzer space telescope, we haveobtained a new, high-accuracy calibration of the hubble constant. we haveestablished the mid-ir zero point of the leavitt law (the cepheidperiod-luminosity relation) using time-averaged 3.6 um data for tenhigh-metallicity, milky way cepheids having independently-measuredtrigonometric parallaxes. we have adopted the slope of the pl relation usingtime-averaged 3.6 um data for 80 long-period large magellanic cloud (lmc)cepheids falling in the period range 0.8 &lt; log(p) &lt; 1.8. we find a newreddening-corrected distance to the lmc of 18.477 +/- 0.033 (systematic) mag.we re-examine the systematic uncertainties in h0, also taking into account newdata over the past decade. in combination with the new spitzer calibration, thesystematic uncertainty in h0 over that obtained by the hubble space telescope(hst) key project has decreased by over a factor of three. applying the spitzercalibration to the key project sample, we find a value of h0 = 74.3 with asystematic uncertainty of +/-2.1 (systematic) km/s/mpc, corresponding to a 2.8%systematic uncertainty in the hubble constant. this result, in combination withwmap7 measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and assuminga flat universe, yields a value of the equation of state for dark energy, w0 =-1.09 +/- 0.10. alternatively, relaxing the constraints on flatness and thenumbers of relativistic species, and combining our results with those of wmap7,type ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations yields w0 = -1.08 +/- 0.10and a value of n_eff = 4.13 +/- 0.67, mildly consistent with the existence of afourth neutrino species.

1301.4833	calibration of the mid-infrared tully-fisher relation	distance measures on a coherent scale around the sky are required to addressthe outstanding cosmological problems of the hubble constant and of departuresfrom the mean cosmic flow. the correlation between galaxy luminosities androtation rates can be used to determine distances to many thousands of galaxiesin a wide range of environments potentially out to 200 mpc. mid-infrared (3.6microns) photometry with the spitzer space telescope is particularly valuableas the source of the luminosities because it provides products of uniformquality across the sky. from a perch above the atmosphere, essentially thetotal magnitude of targets can be registered in exposures of a few minutes.extinction is minimal and the flux is dominated by the light from old starswhich is expected to correlate with the mass of the targets.  in spite of the superior photometry, the correlation between mid-infraredluminosities and rotation rates extracted from neutral hydrogen profiles isslightly degraded from the correlation found with i band luminosities. a colorcorrection recovers a correlation that provides comparable accuracy to thatavailable at i band (~20% 1sigma in an individual distance) while retaining theadvantages identified above. without the color correction the relation betweenlinewidth and [3.6] magnitudes is m^{b,i,k,a}_{[3.6]} = -20.34 - 9.74 (logw_{mx}^{i} -2.5). this description is found with a sample of 213 galaxies in 13clusters that define the slope and 26 galaxies with cepheid or tip of the redgiant branch distances that define the zero point. a color corrected parameterm_{c_{[3.6]}} is constructed that has reduced scatter: m_{c_{[3.6]}} = -20.34 -9.13 (log w_{mx}^{i} -2.5). consideration of the 7 calibration clusters beyond50 mpc, outside the domain of obvious peculiar velocities, provides apreliminary hubble constant estimate of h_0=74+/-5 km/s/mpc.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1305.2940	on the origin of lopsidedness in galaxies as determined from the spitzer  survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	we study the m=1 distortions (lopsidedness) in the stellar components of 167nearby galaxies that span a wide range of morphologies and luminosities. weconfirm the previous findings of 1) a high incidence of lopsidedness in thestellar distributions, 2) increasing lopsidedness as a function of radius outto at least 3.5 exponential scale lengths, and 3) greater lopsidedness, overthese radii, for galaxies of later type and lower surface brightness.additionally, the magnitude of the lopsidedness 1) correlates with thecharacter of the spiral arms (stronger arm patterns occur in galaxies with lesslopsidedness), 2) is not correlated with the presence or absence of a bar, orthe strength of the bar when one is present, 3) is inversely correlated to thestellar mass fraction, f_*, within one radial scale length, and 4) correlatesdirectly with f_* measured within the radial range over which we measurelopsidedness. we interpret these findings to mean that lopsidedness is ageneric feature of galaxies and does not, generally, depend on a rare event,such as a direct accretion of a satellite galaxy onto the disk of the parentgalaxy. while lopsidedness may be caused by several phenomena, moderatelopsidedness (&lt;a_1&gt;_i + &lt;a_1&gt;_o)/2 &lt; 0.3) is likely to reflect halo asymmetriesto which the disk responds or a gravitationally self-generated mode . wehypothesize that the magnitude of the stellar response depends both on howcentrally concentrated the stars are with respect to the dark matter andwhether there are enough stars in the region of the lopsidedness thatself-gravity is dynamically important.

1307.7709	x-ray nuclear activity in s4g barred galaxies: no link between bar  strength and co-occurrent supermassive black hole fueling	stellar bars can lead to gas inflow toward the center of a galaxy andstimulate nuclear star formation. however, there is no compelling evidence onwhether they also feed a central supermassive black hole: by measuring thefractions of barred active and inactive galaxies, previous studies have yieldedconflicting results. in this paper, we aim to understand the lack ofobservational evidence for bar-driven active galactic nucleus (agn) activity bystudying a sample of 41 nearby (d &lt; 35 mpc) barred galaxies from the spitzersurvey for stellar structure in galaxies. we use chandra observations tomeasure nuclear 2--10 kev x-ray luminosities and estimate eddington ratios,together with spitzer 3.6um imaging to quantify the strength of the stellar barin two independent ways: (1) from its structure, as traced by its ellipticityand boxiness, and (2) from its gravitational torque q_b, taken as the maximumratio of the tangential force to the mean background radial force. in this way,rather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclearactivity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degreesof agn activity. we find nuclear x-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies withmedian x-ray luminosity and eddington ratio of l_x=4.3x10^{38} erg/s andl_bol/l_edd=6.9x10^{-6} respectively, consistent with low-luminosity agnactivity. including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections,we find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicatorsand the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellarmass, hubble type, or bulge size. strong bars do not favor brighter or moreefficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosityregime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large scalefeatures.

1310.7146	embedded star formation in s4g galaxy dust lanes	star-forming regions that are visible at 3.6 microns and halpha but not inthe u,g,r,i,z bands of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), are measured infive nearby spiral galaxies to find extinctions averaging ~3.8 mag and stellarmasses averaging ~5x10^4 msun. these regions are apparently young starcomplexes embedded in dark filamentary shock fronts connected with spiral arms.the associated cloud masses are ~10^7 msun. the conditions required to makesuch complexes are explored, including gravitational instabilities in spiralshocked gas and compression of incident clouds. we find that instabilities aretoo slow for a complete collapse of the observed spiral filaments, but theycould lead to star formation in the denser parts. compression of incidentclouds can produce a faster collapse but has difficulty explaining thesemi-regular spacing of some regions along the arms. if gravitationalinstabilities are involved, then the condensations have the local jeans mass.also in this case, the near-simultaneous appearance of equally spaced complexessuggests that the dust lanes, and perhaps the arms too, are relatively young.

1311.0875	the diffuse galactic far-ultraviolet sky	we present an all sky map of the diffuse galactic far ultraviolet (1344-1786angstroms) background using galex data, covering 65% of the sky with 11.79arcmin square pixels. we investigate the dependence of the background ongalactic coordinates, finding that a standard cosecant model of intensity isnot a valid fit. furthermore, we compare our map to galactic all sky maps of100 micron emission, n_hi column, and h-alpha intensity. we measure aconsistent low level fuv intensity at zero-points for other galacticquantities, indicating a 300 cu non-scattered isotropic component to thediffuse fuv. there is also a linear relationship between fuv and 100 micronemission below 100 micron values of 8 mjy/sr. we find a similar linearrelationship between fuv and nhi below 10^21 square cm. the relationshipbetween fuv and h-alpha intensity has no such constant cutoff. for all galacticquantities, the slope of the linear portion of the relationship decreases withgalactic latitude. a modified cosecant model, taking into account dustscattering asymmetry and albedo, is able to accurately fit the diffuse fuv atlatitudes above 20 degrees. the best fit model indicates an albedo, a, of 0.62+- 0.04 and a scattering asymmetry function, g, of 0.78 +- 0.05. deviationsfrom the model fit may indicate regions of excess fuv emission fromfluorescence or shock fronts, while low latitude regions with depressed fuvemission are likely the result of self-shielding dusty clouds.

1312.3384	unveiling the structure of barred galaxies at 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ with the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): i. disk breaks	we have performed two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 localbarred spiral galaxies using 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ images from the spitzer surveyof stellar structure in galaxies. our model fit includes up to four components(bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes intoaccount disk breaks. we find that ignoring the disk break and using a singledisk scale length in the model fit for type ii (down-bending) disk galaxies canlead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-totalluminosity ratio (b/t), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. we find thatfor galaxies with b/t $\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\rmbr}/r_{\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of b/t the ratioremains roughly constant. this suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies thedisk break is likely related to the outer lindblad resonance (olr) of the bar,and thus moves outwards as the bar grows. for galaxies with small bulges, b/t$&lt;$ 0.1, $r_{\rm br}/r_{\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. this suggeststhat the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be differentfrom that in galaxies with more massive bulges. consistent with previousstudies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges mayoriginate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, orbe related to star formation thresholds.

1411.4650	the mass profile and shape of bars in the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s4g): search for an age indicator for bars	we have measured the radial light profiles and global shapes of bars usingtwo-dimensional 3.6 $\mu m $ image decompositions for 144 face-on barredgalaxies from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). thebar surface brightness profile is correlated with the stellar mass andbulge-to-total (b/t) ratio of their host galaxies. bars in massive andbulge-dominated galaxies (b/t$&gt;$0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in lessmassive, disk-dominated galaxies (b/t$\sim$0) show an exponential, disk-likeprofile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominatedgalaxies. the global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, arerectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. we speculatethat because bars are formed out of disk, bars initially have an exponential(disk-like) profile which evolves over time, trapping more stars into the boxybar orbits. this leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. thenarrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that thesebars formed earlier (z$&gt;$1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spreadin the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradualevolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred fromobservational studies. therefore, we expect that the flatness of the barprofile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the timeelapsed since the bar formation. we argue that cosmic gas accretion is requiredto explain our results on bar profile and the presence of gas within the barregion.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0205070	the dependence of star formation history and internal structure on  stellar mass for 10^5 low-redshift galaxies	we study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size andinternal structure for a complete sample of 122,808 galaxies drawn from thesloan digital sky survey. we show that low-redshift galaxies divide into twodistinct families at a stellar mass of 3 \times 10^10 m_sol. lower massgalaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the lowconcentrations typical of disks. a significant fraction of the lowest massgalaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. at given stellarmass, the sizes of low mass galaxies are log- normally distributed withdispersion sigma(ln r_50) \sim 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea thatthey form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation ina gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. their median stellar surface massdensity scales with stellar mass as mu* propto m_*^0.54, suggesting that thestellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of itshalo mass. this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons intostars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as aresult of supernova feedback processes. at stellar masses above 3 \times 10^10m_sol, there is a rapidly increasing frac- tion of galaxies with old stellarpopulations, high surface mass densities and high concentrations typical ofbulges. in this regime, the size distribution is log-normal, but its dispersiondecreases rapidly with increasing stellar mass and the median mass surfacedensity is approximately constant. this suggests that the star formationefficiency decreases in the highest mass halos, and that little star formationoccurs in massive galaxies once they have assembled.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0504489	the galex ultraviolet variability (guvv) catalog	we present version 1.0 of the nasa galaxy evolution explorer (galex)ultraviolet variability catalog (guvv) that contains information on 84time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and farultraviolet photometric observations. these time-variable sources wereserendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently beingsurveyed by the galex satellite in two ultraviolet bands (nuv 1750-2750a, fuv1350-1750a) with limiting ab magnitudes of 23-25. the largest-amplitudevariable objects presently detected by galex are m-dwarf flare stars, which canbrighten by 5-10 mag in both the nuv and fuv bands during short duration (&lt;500s) outbursts. other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objectsinclude ab-type rr lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in thegalex fuv band. this first guvv catalog lists galactic positions and possiblesource identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with alist of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at otherwavelengths. we expect the total number of time-variable source detections toincrease as the galex mission progresses, such that later version numbers ofthe guvv catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.

astro-ph;0507396	galex observations of an energetic ultraviolet flare on the dm4e star gj  3685a	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite has obtained high timeresolution ultraviolet photometry during a large flare on the m4 dwarf star gj3685a. simultaneous nuv (1750 - 2800a) and fuv (1350 - 1750a) time-taggedphotometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overallbrightness in the fuv band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. under theassumption that the nuv emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and thatthe fuv flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, then thereis evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. the first flaretype is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or noincrease in temperature. the other involves rapid increases in both temperatureand flux. while the decay time for the first flare component may be severalhours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting thatthere was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.

astro-ph;0605328	the detection of m-dwarf uv flare events in the galex data archives	we present the preliminary results from implementing a new software tool thatenables inspection of time-tagged photon data for the astronomical sourcescontained within individual galex ultraviolet images of the sky. we haveinspected the photon data contained within 1802 galex images to reveal rapid,short-term (&lt;500 sec) uv source variability in the form of stellar flares. themean associated change in nuv magnitude due to this flaring activity is2.7+/-0.3 mag. a list of 49 new uv variable-star candidates is presented,together with their associated sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometricmagnitudes. from these data we can associate the main source of these uv flareevents with magnetic activity on m-dwarf stars. photometric parallaxes havebeen determined for 32 of these sources, placing them at distances ranging fromapproximately 25 to 1000pc. the average uv flare energy for these flare eventsis 2.5e30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of u-band, x-ray and euvflares observed on many local m-dwarf stars. we have found that stars ofclasses m0 to m5 flare with energies spanning a far larger range and with anenergy approximately 5 times greater than those of later (m6 to m8) spectraltype.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;0611926	statistical properties of the galex/sdss matched source catalogs, and  classification of the uv sources	we use the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium and all-sky-imagingsurvey (mis &amp; ais) data from the first public data release (gr1), matched tothe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr3 catalog, to perform sourceclassification. the galex surveys provide photometry in far- and near-uv bandsand the sdss in five optical bands (u,g,r,i,z). the gr1/dr3 overlapping areasare 363[83]deg^2 for the galex ais[mis], for sources within the 0.5deg centralarea of the galex fields. our sample covers mostly |b|&gt;30deg galacticlatitudes. we present statistical properties of the galex/sdss matched sourcescatalog, containing &gt;2x10^6 objects detected in at least one uv band. weclassify the matched sources by comparing the seven-band photometry to modelcolors constructed for different classes of astrophysical objects. for sourceswith photometric errors &lt;0.3 mag, the corresponding typical ab-magnitude limitsare m_fuv~21.5, m_nuv~22.5 for ais, and m_fuv~24, m_nuv~24.5 for mis. at aisdepth, the number of galactic and extragalactic objects are comparable, but thelatter predominate in the mis. based on our stellar models, we estimate thegalex surveys detect hot white dwarfs throughout the milky way halo (down to aradius of 0.04 r_sun at mis depth), providing an unprecedented improvement inthe galactic wd census. their observed surface density is consistent with milkyway model predictions. we also select low-redshift qso candidates, extendingthe known qso samples to lower magnitudes, and providing candidates fordetailed z~1 follow-up investigations. sdss optical spectra available for alarge subsample confirm the classification for the photometrically selectedcandidates with 97% purity for single hot stars, ~45%(ais)/31%(mis) forbinaries containing a hot star and a cooler companion, and about 85% for qsos.

astro-ph;0612203	galex ultraviolet photometry of globular clusters in m31: three year  results and a catalog	we present ultraviolet (uv) photometry of m31 globular clusters (gcs) foundin 23 galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images covering the entirety of m31. wedetect 485 and 273 gcs (and gc candidates) in the near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2267a) and far-ultraviolet (fuv; 1516 a), respectively. comparing m31 data withthose of galactic gcs in the uv with the aid of population models, we find thatthe age ranges of old gcs in m31 and the galactic halo are similar. threemetal-rich ([fe/h]&gt;-1) gcs in m31 produce significant fuv flux making theirfuv-v colors unusually blue for their metallicities. these are thought to beanalogs of the two peculiar galactic gcs ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with extendedblue hb stars. based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulationsin addition to the majority of the population that have a normal heliumabundance, we suggest that even small fraction of super-helium-richsubpopulations in gcs can reproduce the observed uv bright metal-rich gcs.young clusters in m31 show distinct uv and optical properties from gcs in milkyway. population models indicate that their typical age is less than ~ 2 gyrs. alarge fraction of young gcs have the kinematics of the thin, rapidly rotatingdisk component. however, a subset of the old gcs also shares the thin-diskkinematics of the younger clusters. the existence of young gcs on the outskirtsof m31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation inthe thin-disk of m31. old thin-disk gcs may set constraints on the epoch ofearly formation of the m31 thin-disk. we detect 12 (10) intermediate-age gccandidates in nuv (fuv). we suggest that some of spectroscopically identifiedintermediate-age gcs may not be truly intermediate in age, but rather older gcsthat possess developed hb.

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;0703503	the look-back time evolution of far-ultraviolet flux from the brightest  cluster elliptical galaxies at z &lt; 0.2	we present the galex uv photometry of the elliptical galaxies in abellclusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) for the study of the look-back timeevolution of the uv upturn phenomenon. the brightest elliptical galaxies (m_r &lt;-22) in 12 remote clusters are compared with the nearby giant ellipticalgalaxies of comparable optical luminosity in the fornax and virgo clusters. thesample galaxies presented here appear to be quiescent without signs of massivestar formation or strong nuclear activity, and show smooth, extended profilesin their uv images indicating that the far-uv (fuv) light is mostly produced byhot stars in the underlying old stellar population. compared to theircounterparts in nearby clusters, the fuv flux of cluster giant ellipticalgalaxies at moderate redshifts fades rapidly with ~ 2 gyrs of look-back time,and the observed pace in fuv - v color evolution agrees reasonably well withthe prediction from the population synthesis models where the dominant fuvsource is hot horizontal-branch stars and their progeny. a similar amount ofcolor spread (~ 1 mag) in fuv - v exists among the brightest cluster ellipticalgalaxies at z ~ 0.1, as observed among the nearby giant elliptical galaxies ofcomparable optical luminosity.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
