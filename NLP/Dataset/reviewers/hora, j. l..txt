0901.2096	physical conditions in the ionized gas of 30 doradus	we present a mid-infrared spectroscopic data cube of the central part of 30doradus, observed with spitzer's irs and mips/sed mode. aromatic dust emissionfeatures and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected butnot particularly strong. the dominant spectral features are emission lines frommoderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used todetermine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. the ionized gasexcitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which canplausibly be associated with individual hot stars. we fit the ionic linestrengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionizationdominates in the region. the ionization parameter u traces the rim of thecentral bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and atleast one quiescent clump. the hardness of the ionizing radiation field t_radreveals several "hot spots" that are either the result of individual very hotstars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through thesurrounding neutral cloud. consistent with other measurements of giantmolecular hydrogen regions, log(u) ranges between -3 and -0.75, and t_radbetween 30000 and 85000k.

0901.2447	the dusty nebula surrounding hr car: a spitzer view	we present mid-ir observations of the galactic luminous blue variable (lbv)hr car and its associated nebula carried out with the spitzer space telescopeusing both irac and irs, as part of a gto program aimed to study stellar ejectafrom evolved stars. our observations reveal a rich mid-ir spectrum of the innernebula showing both solid state and atomic gas signatures. stronglow-excitation atomic fine structure lines such as $ 26.0 \mu$m [\ion{fe}{2}]and $ 34.8 \mu$m [\ion{si}{2}], indicate, for the first time, the presence of apdr in this object class. while the physics and chemistry of the low-excitationgas appears to be dominated by photodissociation, a possible contribution dueto shocks can be inferred from the evidence of gas phase fe abundanceenhancement. the presence of amorphous silicates, inferred from the observedcharacteristic broad feature at $10 \mu$m located in the inner nebula, suggeststhat dust has formed during the lbv outburst. this is in contrast with thedetection of crystalline dust in other probably more evolved galactic lbvs,which is similar to the crystalline dust observed in red supergiants. this hasbeen considered to be evidence of dust production during evolutionary phasesprior to the outburst.

0904.1244	a spectroscopic study of young stellar objects in the serpens cloud core  and ngc 1333	we present spectral observations of 130 young stellar objects (ysos) in theserpens cloud core and ngc 1333 embedded clusters. the observations consist ofnear-ir spectra in the h and k-bands, from spex on the irtf and far-red spectra(6000 - 9000 a) from hectospec on the mmt. these ysos were identified inprevious spitzer and chandra observations, and the evolutionary classes of theysos were determined from the spitzer mid-ir photometry. with these spectra, wesearch for corroborating evidence for the pre-main sequence nature of theobjects, study the properties of the detected emission lines as a function ofevolutionary class, and obtain spectral types for the observed ysos. bycomparing the positions of the ysos in the hr diagrams with the pre-mainsequence tracks of baraffe (1998), we determine ages of the embedded sourcesand study the relative ages of the ysos with and without optically thickcircumstellar disks. the apparent isochronal ages of the ysos in both clustersrange from less than 1 myr to 10 myr, with most objects below 3 myr. theobserved distribution of ages for the class ii and class iii objects arestatistically indistinguishable. we examine the spatial distribution andextinction of the ysos as a function of their isochronal ages. we find thesources &lt; 3 myr to be concentrated in the molecular cloud gas while the oldersources are spatially dispersed and are not deeply embedded. nonetheless, thesources with isochronal ages &gt; 3 myr show all the characteristics of youngstellar objects in their spectra, their ir spectral energy distributions, andtheir x-ray emission.

0905.1328	spitzer sage infrared photometry of massive stars in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the large magellanic cloud,with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometriccatalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring theirinfrared properties. the photometric catalog consists of stars with infraredcounterparts in the spitzer sage survey database, for which we present uniformphotometry from 0.3-24 microns in the ubvijhks+irac+mips24 bands. the resultinginfrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant b[e], redsupergiant and luminous blue variable (lbv) stars are among the brightestinfrared point sources in the large magellanic cloud, due to their intrinsicbrightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. we detect infrared excessesdue to free-free emission among ~900 ob stars, which correlate with luminosityclass. we confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant b[e] stars, findingthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (seds) to be very similar, incontrast to the variety of sed shapes among the spectrally variable lbvs. thesimilar luminosities of b[e] supergiants (log l/lo&gt;=4) and the rare, dustyprogenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. sn 2008s and ngc 300ot), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests acommon origin for them. we find the infrared colors for wolf-rayet stars to beindependent of spectral type and their seds to be flatter than what modelspredict. the results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap forinterpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxiesat infrared wavelengths.

0906.0364	spitzer/irac limits to planetary companions of fomalhaut and epsilon  eridani	fomalhaut and epsilon eridani are two young, nearby stars that possessextended debris disks whose structures suggest the presence of perturbingplanetary objects. with its high sensitivity and stable point spread function,spitzer/irac is uniquely capable of detecting cool, jupiter-like planetarycompanions whose peak emission is predicted to occur near 4.5 um. we report ondeep irac imaging of these two stars, taken at 3.6 and 4.5 um using subarraymode and in all four channels in wider-field full array mode. observationsacquired at two different telescope roll angles allowed faint surroundingobjects to be separated from the stellar diffraction pattern. no companioncandidates were detected at the reported position of fomalhaut b with 3 sigmamodel-dependent mass upper limits of 3 mj (for an age of 200 myr). aroundepsilon eridani we instead set a limit of 4 and &lt;1 mj (1 gyr model age) at theinner and outer edge of the sub-millimeter debris ring, respectively. theseresults are consistent with non-detections in recent near-infrared imagingsearches, and set the strongest limits to date on the presence of planetsoutside epsilon eridani sub-millimeter ring.

0906.4820	spitzer 24 um images of planetary nebulae	spitzer mips 24 um images were obtained for 36 galactic planetary nebulae(pne) whose central stars are hot white dwarfs (wds) or pre-wds with effectivetemperatures of ~100,000 k or higher. diffuse 24 um emission is detected in 28of these pne. the eight non-detections are angularly large pne with very lowh-alpha surface brightnesses. we find three types of correspondence between the24 um emission and h-alpha line emission of these pne: six show 24 um emissionmore extended than h-alpha emission, nine have a similar extent at 24 um andh-alpha, and 13 show diffuse 24 um emission near the center of the h-alphashell. the sizes and surface brightnesses of these three groups of pne and thenon-detections suggest an evolutionary sequence, with the youngest ones beingbrightest and the most evolved ones undetected. the 24 um band emission fromthese pne is attributed to [o iv] 25.9 um and [ne v] 24.3 um line emission anddust continuum emission, but the relative contributions of these threecomponents depend on the temperature of the central star and the distributionof gas and dust in the nebula.

0908.0638	spitzer detection of pah and silicate features in post-agb stars and  young planetary nebulae	we have observed a small sample of hot post-agb stars with the infrared arraycamera (irac) and the infrared spectrograph (irs) on-board the spitzer spacetelescope. the stars were selected from the literature on the basis of theirfar-infrared excess (i.e., post-agb candidates) and b spectral type (i.e.,close to the ionization of the envelope). the combination of our iracobservations with 2mass and iras catalog data, along with previous radioobservations in the cm range (where available) allowed us to model the seds ofour targets and find that in almost all of them at least two shells of dust atdifferent temperatures must be present, the hot dust component ranging up to1000 k. in several targets grains larger than 1 micron are needed to match thefar-ir data points. in particular, in iras 17423-1755 grains up to 100 micronmust be introduced to match the emission in the mm range.  we obtained irs spectra to identify the chemistry of the envelopes and foundthat more than 1/3 of the sources in our sample have mixed chemistry, showingboth mid-ir bands attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) andsilicate features. the analysis of the pah features indicates that thesemolecules are located in the outflows, far away from the central stars. weconsider the larger than expected percentage of mixed-chemistry targets as aselection bias towards stars with a disk or torus around them. our resultsstrengthen the current picture of mixed chemistry being due to the spatialsegregation of different dust populations in the envelopes.

0707.2537	a combined spitzer and chandra survey of young stellar objects in the  serpens cloud core	we present spitzer and chandra observations of the nearby (~260 pc) embeddedstellar cluster in the serpens cloud core. we observed, using spitzer's iracand mips instruments, in six wavelength bands from 3 to 70 ${\mu}m$, to detectthermal emission from circumstellar disks and protostellar envelopes, and toclassify stars using color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions(seds). these data are combined with chandra observations to examine theeffects of circumstellar disks on stellar x-ray properties. young disklessstars were also identified from their increased x-ray emission. we haveidentified 138 ysos in serpens: 22 class 0/i, 16 flat spectrum, 62 class ii, 17transition disk, and 21 class iii stars; 60 of which exhibit x-ray emission.our primary results are the following: 1.) ten protostars detected previouslyin the sub-millimeter are detected at lambda &lt; 24 microns, seven at lambda &lt; 8microns, 2.) the protostars are more closely grouped than more evolved ysos(median separation : ~0.024 pc, and 3.) the luminosity and temperature of thex-ray emitting plasma around these ysos does not show any significantdependence on evolutionary class. we combine the infrared derived values of akand x-ray values of nh for 8 class iii objects and find that the column densityof hydrogen gas per mag of extinctions is less than half the standardinterstellar value, for ak &gt; 1. this may be the result of grain growth throughcoagulation and/or the accretion of volatiles in the serpens cloud core.

1101.4977	exploreneos iii: physical characterization of 65 low-deltav neos	space missions to neos are being planned at all major space agencies, andrecently a manned mission to an neo was announced as a nasa goal. efforts tofind and select suitable targets (plus backup targets) are severely hampered byour lack of knowledge of the physical properties of dynamically favorable neos.in particular, current mission scenarios tend to favor primitive low-albedoobjects. for the vast majority of neos the albedo is unknown.  here we report new constraints on the size and albedo of 65 neos withrendezvous deltav &lt; 7 km/s. our results are based on thermal-ir flux dataobtained in the framework of our ongoing (2009--2011) exploreneos survey(trilling et al. 2010) using nasa's "warm spitzer" space telescope. as of 2010july 14, we have results for 293 objects in hand (including the 65 low-deltavneos presented here); before the end of 2011 we expect to have measured thesize and albedo of ~ 700 neos (including probably ~ 160 low-deltav neos).  while there are reasons to believe that primitive volatile-rich materials areuniversally low in albedo, the converse need not be true: the orbital evolutionof some dark objects likely has caused them to lose their volatiles by comingtoo close to the sun. for all our targets, we give the closest periheliondistance they are likely to have reached (using orbital integrations frommarchi et al. 2009) and corresponding upper limits on the past surfacetemperature. low-deltav objects for which both albedo and thermal history maysuggest a primitive composition include (162998) 2001 sk162, (68372) 2001 pm9,and (100085) 1992 uy4.

1106.6018	identification of three new proto-planetary nebulae exhibiting the  unidentified feature at 21 um	among its great findings, the iras mission showed the existence of anunidentified mid-ir feature around 21 um. since its discovery, this feature hasbeen detected in all c-rich proto-pne of intermediate spectral type (a-g) and -weakly - in a few pne and agb stars, but the nature of its carriers remainsunknown. in this paper, we show the detection of this feature in the spectra ofthree new stars transiting from the agb to the pn stage obtained with thespitzer space telescope. following a recent suggestion, we try to model theseds of our targets with amorphous carbon and feo, which might be responsiblefor the unidentified feature. the fit thus obtained is not completelysatisfactory, since the shape of the feature is not well matched. in theattempt to relate the unidentified feature to other dust features, we retrievedmid-ir spectra of all the 21-um sources currently known from iso and spitzeron-line archives and noticed a correlation between the flux emitted in the21-um feature and that emitted at 7 and 11 um (pah bands and hac broademission). such a correlation may point to a common nature of the carriers.

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

1112.0574	thermal phase variations of wasp-12b: defying predictions	[abridged] we report warm spitzer full-orbit phase observations of wasp-12bat 3.6 and 4.5 micron. we are able to measure the transit depths, eclipsedepths, thermal and ellipsoidal phase variations at both wavelengths. the largeamplitude phase variations, combined with the planet's previously-measuredday-side spectral energy distribution, is indicative of non-zero bond albedoand very poor day-night heat redistribution. the transit depths in themid-infrared indicate that the atmospheric opacity is greater at 3.6 than at4.5 micron, in disagreement with model predictions, irrespective of c/o ratio.the secondary eclipse depths are consistent with previous studies. we do notdetect ellipsoidal variations at 3.6 micron, but our parameter uncertainties-estimated via prayer-bead monte carlo- keep this non-detection consistent withmodel predictions. at 4.5 micron, on the other hand, we detect ellipsoidalvariations that are much stronger than predicted. if interpreted as a geometriceffect due to the planet's elongated shape, these variations imply a 3:2 ratiofor the planet's longest:shortest axes and a relatively bright day-nightterminator. if we instead presume that the 4.5 micron ellipsoidal variationsare due to uncorrected systematic noise and we fix the amplitude of thevariations to zero, the best fit 4.5 micron transit depth becomes commensuratewith the 3.6 micron depth, within the uncertainties. the relative transitdepths are then consistent with a solar composition and short scale height atthe terminator. assuming zero ellipsoidal variations also yields a much deeper4.5 micron eclipse depth, consistent with a solar composition and modesttemperature inversion. we suggest future observations that could distinguishbetween these two scenarios.

(2011), wherethe reduced shielding in metal-poor environments depletes the h2o columndensity in the outer regions of the yso envelopes. no co ice is detectedtowards the smc sources. emission due to pure-rotational 0-0 transitions of h2is detected towards the majority of smc sources, allowing us to estimaterotational temperatures and column densities. all but one source arespectroscopically confirmed as smc ysos. of the 33 ysos identified in the smc,30 sources populate different stages of massive stellar evolution. theremaining three sources are classified as intermediate-mass ysos with a thickdusty disc and a tenuous envelope still present. we propose one of the sourcesis a d-type symbiotic system, based on the presence of raman, h and he emissionlines in the optical spectrum, and silicate emission in the irs-spectrum. thiswould be the first dust-rich symbiotic system identified in the smc.

1306.5757	the protoplanetary disks in the nearby massive star forming region  cygnus ob2	the formation of stars in massive clusters is one of the main modes of thestar formation process. however, the study of massive star forming regions ishampered by their typically large distances to the sun. one exception to thisis the massive star forming region cygnus ob2 in the cygnus x region, at thedistance of about 1400 pc. cygnus ob2 hosts very rich populations of massiveand low-mass stars, being the best target in our galaxy to study the formationof stars, circumstellar disks, and planets in presence of massive stars. inthis paper we combine a wide and deep set of photometric data, from the r bandto 24 micron, in order to select the disk bearing population of stars in cygnusob2 and identify the class i, class ii, and stars with transition andpre-transition disks. we selected 1843 sources with infrared excesses in anarea of 1 degree x 1 degree centered on cyg ob2 in several evolutionary stages:8.4% class i, 13.1% flat-spectrum sources, 72.9% class ii, 2.3% pre-transitiondisks, and 3.3% transition disks. the spatial distribution of these sourcesshows a central cluster surrounded by a annular overdensity and some clumps ofrecent star formation in the outer region. several candidate subclusters areidentified, both along the overdensity and in the rest of the association.

1312.7086	spitzer observations of a circumstellar nebula around the candidate  luminous blue variable mwc 930	mwc 930 is a star just ~2{\deg} above the galactic plane whose nature is notclear and that has not been studied in detail so far. while a post-asymptoticgiant branch (agb) classification was proposed in the past, studies of itsoptical spectrum and photometry pointed toward strong variability, thereforethe object was reclassified as a luminous blue variable (lbv) candidate. lbvstypically undergo phases of strong mass loss in the form of eruptions that cancreate shells of ejecta around the star. our goal is to search for the presenceof such a circumstellar nebula in mwc 930 and investigate its properties. to doso, we make use of space-based infrared data from our spitzer campaignperformed with the infrared array camera (irac) and the infrared spectrograph(irs) as well as data from optical and infrared (ir) surveys. in our spitzerimages, we clearly detect an extended shell around mwc 930 at wavelengthslonger than 5 um. the mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by the central starand mostly shows forbidden lines of [feii], with an underlying continuum thatdecreases with wavelength up to ~15 um and then inverts its slope, displaying asecond peak around 60 um, evidence for cold dust grains formed in a pasteruption. by modeling the sed, we identify two central components, besides thestar and the outer shell. these extra sources of radiation are interpreted asmaterial close to the central star, maybe due to a recent ejection. features ofc-bearing molecules or grains are not detected.

1401.0728	spitzer space telescope spectra of post-agb stars in the large  magellanic cloud ---polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at low metallicities	this paper reports variations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)features that were found in spitzer space telescope spectra of carbon-richpost-asymptotic giant branch (post-agb) stars in the large magellanic cloud(lmc). the paper consists of two parts. the first part describes our spitzerspectral observing programme of 24 stars including post-agb candidates. thelatter half of this paper presents the analysis of pah features in 20carbon-rich post-agb stars in the lmc, assembled from the spitzer archive aswell as from our own programme. we found that five post-agb stars showed abroad feature with a peak at 7.7 micron, that had not been classified before.further, the 10--13 micron pah spectra were classified into four classes, oneof which has three broad peaks at 11.3, 12.3 and 13.3 micron rather than twodistinct sharp peaks at 11.3 and 12.7 micron, as commonly found in hii regions.our studies suggest that pahs are gradually processed while the central starsevolve from post-agb phase to pne, changing their composition before pahs areincorporated into the interstellar medium. although some metallicity dependenceof pah spectra exists, the evolutionary state of an object is more significantthan its metallicity in determining the spectral characteristics of pahs forlmc and galactic post-agb stars.

0807.1717	diameters and albedos of three sub-kilometer near earth objects derived  from spitzer observations	near earth objects (neos) are fragments of remnant primitive bodies that datefrom the era of solar system formation. at present, the physical properties andorigins of neos are poorly understood. we have measured thermal emission fromthree neos -- (6037) 1988 eg, 1993 gd, and 2005 gl -- with spitzer's iracinstrument at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 microns (the last object was detected onlyat 5.8 and 8.0 microns). the diameters of these three objects are 400 m, 180 m,and 160 m, respectively, with uncertainties of around 20% (including bothobservational and systematic errors). for all three the geometric albedos arearound 0.30, in agreement with previous results that most neos are s-classasteroids. for the two objects detected at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, diameters andalbedos based only on those data agree with the values based on modeling thedata in all four bands. this agreement, and the high sensitivity of irac, showthe promise of the spitzer warm mission for determining the physical parametersfor a large number of neos.

astro-ph;0104437	subarcsecond mid-ir structure of the dust shell around iras 22272+5435	we report sub-arcsecond imaging of extended mid-infrared emission from aproto-planetary nebula (ppn), \iras 22272+5435, performed at the mmtobservatory with its newly upgraded 6.5 m aperture telescope and at the keckobservatory. the mid-infrared emission structure is resolved into two emissionpeaks separated by $0\arcsec.5 - 0\arcsec.6$ in the mmt 11.7 $\um$ image and inthe keck 7.9, 9.7, and 12.5 $\um$ images, corroborating the predictions basedon previous multi-wavelength morphological studies and radiative transfercalculations. the resolved images show that the ppn dust shell has a toroidalstructure with the $0\arcsec.5$ inner radius. in addition, an unresolved mid-irexcess appears at the nebula center. radiative transfer model calculationssuggest that the highly equatorially-enhanced ($\rho_{\rm eq}/\rho_{\rm pole} =9$) structure of the ppn shell was generated by an axisymmetric superwind with${\dot m}_{\rm sw} = 4 \times 10^{-6} m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which was precededby a spherical asymptotic giant branch (agb) wind with ${\dot m}_{\rm agb} = 8\times 10^{-7} m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. these model calculations also indicatethat the superwind shell contains larger dust grains than the agb wind shell.the unresolved mid-infrared excess may have been produced by a post-agb massloss at a rate of $2 - 6 \times 10^{-7} m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. while the centralstar left the agb about 380 years ago after the termination of the superwind,the star seems to have been experiencing an ambient post-agb mass loss with asudden, increased mass ejection about 10 years ago.

astro-ph;0310564	a resolved circumstellar disk around the herbig ae star hd 100546 in the  thermal infrared	we present mid-infrared nulling interferometric and direct imagingobservations of the herbig ae star hd 100546 obtained with the magellan i(baade) 6.5 m telescope. the observations show resolved circumstellar emissionat 10.3, 11.7, 12.5, 18.0, and 24.5 microns. through the nulling observations(10.3, 11.7 and 12.5 microns), we detect a circumstellar disk, with aninclination of 45 +- 15 degrees with respect to a face-on disk, a semimajoraxis position angle of 150 +- 10 degrees (e of n), and a spatial extent ofabout 25 au. the direct images (18.0 and 24.5 microns) show evidence for coolerdust with a spatial extent of 30-40 au from the star. the direct images alsoshow evidence for an inclined disk with a similar position angle as the diskdetected by nulling. this morphology is consistent with models in which aflared circumstellar disk dominates the emission. however, the similarity inrelative disk size we derive for different wavelengths suggests that the diskmay have a large inner gap, possibly cleared out by the formation of a giantprotoplanet. the existence of a protoplanet in the system also provides anatural explanation for the observed difference between hd 100546 and otherherbig ae stars.

astro-ph;0507705	a spitzer/irac survey of massive star-forming regions	we are conducting a survey of several regions of high-mass star formation toassess their content and structure. the observations include spitzerobservations, ground-based optical and near-ir imaging surveys, and optical andir spectra of objects and locations in the molecular clouds. the goal of thesurvey is to gain a better understanding of the processes involved in high massstar formation by determining the characteristics of the stars detected inthese regions and investigating the properties of the interstellar medium (ism)environment in which these stars form. in this contribution, we present resultson the identification and spatial analysis of young stars in three clusters,w5/afgl 4029, s255, and s235. first we show how the irac data are used toroughly segregate young stars according to their mid-infrared colors, into twogroups corresponding the sed class i and class ii young stellar objects. thenusing the irac data in combination with 2mass, we show how more young stars canbe identified. finally, we examine the spatial distributions of young stars inthese clusters and find a range of morphologies and of peak surface densities.

astro-ph;0603404	outflows from massive ysos as seen with the infrared array camera	the bipolar outflow from the massive star forming cluster in dr21 is one ofthe most powerful known, and in irac images the outflow stands out by virtue ofits brightness at 4.5 um (band 2). indeed, irac images of many galactic andextragalactic star formation regions feature prominent band 2 morphologies. wehave analyzed archival isosws spectra of the dr21 outflow, and compare them toupdated h2 shocked and uv-excitation models. we find that h2 line emissioncontributes about 50% of the flux of the irac bands at 3.6 um, 4.5 um , and 5.8um, and is a significant contributor to the 8.0 um band as well, and confirmthat the outflow contains multiple excitation mechanisms. other potentiallystrong features, in particular br alpha and co emission, have been suggested ascontributing to irac fluxes in outflows, but they are weak or absent in dr21;surprisingly, there also is no evidence for strong pah emission. the resultsimply that irac images can be a powerful detector of, and diagnostic for,outflows caused by massive star formation activity in our galaxy, and in othergalaxies as well. they also suggest that irac color-color diagnostic diagramsmay need to take into account the possible influence of these strong emissionlines. irac images of the general ism in the region, away from the outflow, arein approximate but not precise agreement with theoretical models.

astro-ph;0604104	a correlation between pre-main sequence stellar rotation rates and irac  excesses in orion	early observations of t tauri stars suggested that stars with evidence ofcircumstellar accretion disks rotated slower than stars without such evidence,but more recent results are not as clear. near-ir circumstellar diskindicators, though the most widely available, are subject to uncertainties thatcan result from inner disk holes and/or the system inclination. mid-infraredobservations are less sensitive to such effects, but until now, theseobservations have been difficult to obtain. the spitzer space telescope noweasily enables mid-infrared measurements of large samples of pms stars coveringa broad mass range in nearby star-forming regions. megeath and collaboratorssurveyed the orion molecular clouds (~1 myr) with the irac instrument (3.6,4.5, 5.8, 8 microns) as part of a joint irac and mips gto program. we examinethe relationship between rotation and spitzer mid-ir fluxes for ~900 stars inorion for stars between 3 and 0.1 msun. we find in these spitzer data theclearest indication to date that stars with longer periods are more likely thanthose with short periods to have ir excesses suggestive of disks.

astro-ph;0608189	spitzer sage survey of the large magellanic cloud ii: evolved stars and  infrared color magnitude diagrams	color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) are presented for the spitzer sage (surveyingthe agents of a galaxy's evolution) survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc).irac and mips 24 um epoch one data are presented. these data represent thedeepest, widest mid-infrared cmds of their kind ever produced in the lmc.combined with the 2mass survey, the diagrams are used to delineate the evolvedstellar populations in the large magellanic cloud as well as galacticforeground and extragalactic background populations. some 32000 evolved starsbrighter than the tip of the red giant branch are identified. of these,approximately 17500 are classified as oxygen-rich, 7000 carbon-rich, andanother 1200 as ``extreme'' asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. brightermembers of the latter group have been called ``obscured'' agb stars in theliterature owing to their dusty circumstellar envelopes. a large number (1200)of luminous oxygen--rich agb stars/m supergiants are also identified. finally,there is strong evidence from the 24 um mips channel that previouslyunexplored, lower luminosity oxygen-rich agb stars contribute significantly tothe mass loss budget of the lmc (1200 such sources are identified).

astro-ph;0608387	comet 162p/siding spring: a surprisingly large nucleus	we present an analysis of thermal emission from comet 162p/siding spring(p/2004 tu12) measured during its discovery apparition in 2004 december. thecomet showed no dust coma at this time, so we have sampled emission from thecomet's nucleus. observations using the mid-infrared spectrometer and imager(mirsi) were performed at nasa's infrared telescope facility, where the peak ofthe comet's spectral energy distribution was observed between 8 and 25 microns.in combination with the three near-ir spectra presented by campins et al.(2006, astron. j. 132, 1346) that show the wien-law tail of the thermalemission, the data provide powerful constraints on surface properties of thenucleus. we find that the nucleus's effective radius is 6.0+/-0.8 km. this isone of the largest radii known among jupiter-family comets, which is unusualconsidering that the comet was discovered only recently. its geometric albedois 0.059+/-0.023 in the h band, 0.037+/-0.014 in the r band, and 0.034+/-0.013in the v band. we also find that the nucleus of 162p has little ir beaming, andthis implies that the nucleus has low thermal inertia. including all near-irspectra yields a beaming parameter of 1.01+/-0.20. this result is in agreementwith others showing that cometary nuclei have low thermal inertia and little irbeaming. if confirmed for many nuclei, the interpretation of radiometry may notbe as problematic as feared.

astro-ph;0609464	discovery of two t dwarf companions with the spitzer space telescope	we report the discovery of t dwarf companions to the nearby stars hn peg(g0v, 18.4 pc, ~0.3 gyr) and hd 3651 (k0v, 11.1 pc, ~7 gyr). during an ongoingsurvey of 5'x5' fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with iracaboard the spitzer space telescope, we identified these companions as candidatet dwarfs based on their mid-ir colors. using near-ir spectra obtained with spexat the nasa irtf, we confirm the presence of methane absorption thatcharacterizes t dwarfs and measure spectral types of t2.5+/-0.5 and t7.5+/-0.5for hn peg b and hd 3651 b, respectively. by comparing our spitzer data toimages from 2mass obtained several years earlier, we find that the propermotions of hn peg b and hd 3651 b are consistent with those of the primaries,confirming their companionship. hn peg b and hd 3651 b have angular separationsof 43.2" and 42.9" from their primaries, which correspond to projected physicalseparations of 795 and 476 au, respectively. a comparison of their luminositiesto the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of0.021+/-0.009 and 0.051+/-0.014 msun for hn peg b and hd 3651 b. in addition,the models imply an effective temperature for hn peg b that is significantlylower than the values derived for other t dwarfs at similar spectral types,which is the same behavior reported by metchev &amp; hillenbrand for the younglate-l dwarf hd 203030 b. thus, the temperature of the l/t transition appearsto depend on surface gravity. meanwhile, hd 3651 b is the first substellarcompanion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-inplanet from rv surveys. the discovery of this companion supports the notionthat the high eccentricities of close-in planets like the one near hd 3651 maybe the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.

astro-ph;0611346	spitzer/irac characterization of galactic agb stars	the spitzer space telescope and in particular its infrared array camera(irac) is an ideal facility to study the distribution of agb stars in our ownand other galaxies because of its efficiency in surveying vast areas of the skyand its ability to detect sources with infrared excess. the irac colors of agbstars, however, are not well known because cool stars have numerous molecularabsorption features in the spectral region covered by the irac photometricsystem. the presence and strength of these features depends on the chemistry ofthe stellar atmosphere and the mass loss rate and can change with time due tothe star's variability. to characterize the irac colors of agb stars, we arecarrying out a spitzer guaranteed time observation program to observe a sampleof agb stars with irac. the results will be made available to the community inthe form of template magnitudes and colors for each target with the goal ofaiding the identification of agb stars in already available and future iracsurveys. we present here the first results of this project.

0812.2396	a spatially resolved study of photoelectric heating and [cii] cooling in  the lmc	(abridged) we study photoelectric heating throughout the large magellaniccloud. we quantify the importance of the [cii] cooling line and thephotoelectric heating process of various environments in the lmc andinvestigate which parameters control the extent of photoelectric heating. weuse the bice [cii] map and the spitzer/sage infrared maps. we examine thespatial variations in the efficiency of photoelectric heating: photoelectricheating rate over power absorbed by grains. we correlate the photoelectricheating efficiency and the emission from various dust constituents and studythe variations as a function of h\alpha emission, dust temperatures, and thetotal infrared luminosity. from this we estimate radiation field, gastemperature, and electron density. we find systematic variations inphotoelectric efficiency. the highest efficiencies are found in the diffusemedium, while the lowest coincide with bright star-forming regions (~1.4 timeslower). the [cii] line emission constitutes 1.32% of the far infraredluminosity across the whole of the lmc. we find correlations between the [cii]emission and ratios of the mid infrared and far infrared bands, which comprisevarious dust constituents. the correlations are interpreted in light of thespatial variations of the dust abundance and by the local environmentalconditions that affect the dust emission properties. as a function of the totalinfrared surface brightness, s_{tir}, the [cii] surface brightness can bedescribed as: s_{[cii]}=1.25 s_{tir}^{0.69} [10^{-3} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}sr^{-1}]. the [cii] emission is well-correlation with the 8 micrometeremission, suggesting that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons play a dominantrole in the photoelectric heating process.
