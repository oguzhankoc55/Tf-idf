0912.0682	caii triplet spectroscopy of small magellanic cloud red giants. ii.  abundances for a sample of field stars	we have obtained metallicities of ~ 360 red giant stars distributed in 15small magellanic cloud (smc) fields from near-infrared spectra covering thecaii triplet lines using the vlt + fors2. the errors of the derived [fe/h]values range from 0.09 to 0.35 dex per star, with a mean of 0.17 dex. themetallicity distribution of the whole sample shows a mean value of [fe/h] =-1.00 +- 0.02, with a dispersion of 0.32 +- 0.01, in agreement with global mean[fe/h] values found in previous studies. we find no evidence of a metallicitygradient in the smc. in fact, on analysing the metallicity distribution of eachfield, we derived mean values of [fe/h] = -0.99 +- 0.08 and [fe/h] = -1.02 +-0.07 for fields located closer and farther than 4 deg. from the center of thegalaxy, respectively. in addition, there is a clear tendency for the fieldstars to be more metal-poor than the corresponding cluster they surround,independent of their positions in the galaxy and of the clusters' age. we arguethat this most likely stems from the field stars being somewhat older andtherefore somewhat more metal-poor than most of our clusters.

0912.1056	vista variables in the via lactea (vvv): the public eso near-ir  variability survey of the milky way	we describe the public eso near-ir variability survey (vvv) scanning themilky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formationactivity is high. the survey will take 1929 hours of observations with the4-metre vista telescope during five years (2010-2014), covering ~10^9 pointsources across an area of 520 deg^2, including 33 known globular clusters and~350 open clusters. the final product will be a deep near-ir atlas in fivepassbands (0.9-2.5 microns) and a catalogue of more than 10^6 variable pointsources. unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-dmaps, the vvv variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-d map ofthe surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as rr lyraestars, and cepheids. it will yield important information on the ages of thepopulations. the observations will be combined with data from macho, ogle,eros, vst, spitzer, hst, chandra, integral, wise, fermi lat, xmm-newton, gaiaand alma for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the innermilky way. this public survey will provide data available to the wholecommunity and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the milkyway, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the galacticbulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions inthe disk. the combined variable star catalogues will have importantimplications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars.

0912.5208	toward the general rgb slope-metallicity-age calibration: i  metallicities, ages and kinematics for eight lmc clusters	in this paper, we discuss the properties of cmds, age, metallicity and radialvelocities of eight massive lmc clusters using data taken from fors2multiobject spectrograph at the 8.2-meter vlt/ut1. the strong near-infrared caii triplet (cat) lines of rgb stars obtained from the high s/n spectra are usedto determine the metallicity and radial velocity of cluster members. we reportfor the first time spectroscopically determined metallicity values for fourclusters based on the mean [fe/h] value of ~10 cluster members each. we foundtwo concentrations in the distribution of ages of the target clusters. six haveages between 0.8-2.2 gyr and the other two, ngc 1754 and ngc 1786, are veryold. the metallicity of the six intermediate age clusters, with a mean age of1.5 gyr, is -0.49 with a scatter of only 0.04. this tight distribution suggeststhat a close encounter between the lmc and smc may have caused not only therestart of cluster formation in the lmc but the generation of the central bar.the metallicity for the two old clusters is similar to that of the other old,metal-poor lmc clusters. we find that the lmc cluster system exhibits disk-likerotation with no clusters appearing to have halo kinematics and there is noevidence of a metallicity gradient in the lmc, in contrast with the stellarpopulation of the mw and m33, where the metallicity decreases as galactocentricdistance increases. the lmc's stellar bar may be the factor responsible for thedilution of any kind of gradient in the lmc.

1012.4931	sodium-oxygen anticorrelation among horizontal branch stars in the  globular cluster m4	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gc) is mainlygoverned by metallicity. the second parameter problem, well known since the60's, states that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the observed hbmorphology of many gcs. despite many efforts to resolve this issue, the secondparameter phenomenon still remains without a satisfactory explanation. we haveanalyzed blue, red-hb, and rr-lyrae stars in the gc m4 and studied their fe,na, and o abundances. our goal is to investigate possible connections betweenthe bimodal hb of m4 and the chemical signatures of the two stellar populationsrecently discovered among red giants of this cluster. we obtainedflames-uves/giraffe spectra of a sample of 22 stars covering the hb from thered to the blue region. while iron has the same abundance in both the red andblue-hb segment, the red-hb is composed of stars with scaled-solar sodiumabundances, while the blue-hb stars are all sodium enhanced and oxygendepleted. the rr-lyrae are na-poor, as the red-hb stars, and o-rich. this iswhat we expect if the blue-hb consists of a second generation of stars formedfrom the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar population throughhigh-temperature hydrogen-burning processes that include the cno, nena, andmgal cycles and are therefore expected to be he-rich. according to thisscenario, the sodium and oxygen pattern detected in the blue and red-hbsegments suggests helium as the second parameter that rules the hb morphologyin m4.

1103.1658	lithium-rich giants in the galactic thick disk	context: lithium is a fragile element, which is easily destroyed in thestellar interior. the existence of lithium-rich giants still represents achallenge for stellar evolution models. aims: we have collected a largedatabase of high-resolution stellar spectra of 824 candidate thick-disk giantshaving 2\,mass photometry and proper motions measured by the southernproper-motion program (spm). in order to investigate the nature of li-richgiants, we searched this database for giants presenting a strong li\,iresonance line. methods: we performed a chemical abundance analysis on theselected stars with the moog code along with proper atlas-9 model atmospheres.the iron content and atmospheric parameters were fixed by using the equivalentwidth of a sample of fe lines. we also derive abundances for c, n, and o andmeasure or derive lower limits on the $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c isotopic ratios, whichis a sensible diagnostic of the stars evolutionary status. results: we detectedfive stars with a lithium abundance higher than 1.5, i.e. li-rich according tothe current definition. one of them (spm-313132) has a(li)$&gt;$3.3 and, becauseof this, belongs to the group of the rare super li-rich giants. its kinematicsmakes it a likely thin-disk member and its atmospheric parameters arecompatible with it being a 4\,m$_\odot$ star either on the red giant branch(rgb) or the early asymptotic giant branch. this object is the first superli-rich giant detected at this phase. the other four are likely low-massthick-disk stars evolved past the rgb luminosity bump, as determined from theirmetallicities and atmospheric parameters. the most evolved of them lies closeto the rgb-tip. it has a(li)$&gt;$2.7 and a low $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c isotopic ratio,close to the cool bottom processing predictions.

1105.4102	accurate stellar kinematics at faint magnitudes: application to the  bootes~i dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we develop, implement and characterise an enhanced data reduction approachwhich delivers precise, accurate, radial velocities from moderate resolutionspectroscopy with the fibre-fed vlt/flames+giraffe facility. this facility,with appropriate care, delivers radial velocities adequate to resolve theintrinsic velocity dispersions of the very faint dsph dwarf galaxies.importantly, repeated measurements let us reliably calibrate our individualvelocity errors ($0.2 \leq \delta_v\leq 5$ km s$^{-1}$) and directly detectstars with variable radial velocities. we show, by application to the bootes-1dwarf spheroidal, that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of this system issignificantly below 6.5\,km/s reported by previous studies. our data favor atwo-population model of bootes-1, consisting of a majority `cold' stellarcomponent, with velocity dispersion $2.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5}$\,km/s, and a minority`hot' stellar component, with velocity dispersion $\sim 9$\,km/s, although wecan not completely rule out a single component distribution with velocitydispersion $4.6^{0.8}_{-0.6}$\,km/s. we speculate this complex velocitydistribution actually reflects the distribution of velocity anisotropy inbootes-1, which is a measure of its formation processes.

0710.0904	a quantitative link between globular clusters and the stellar halos in  elliptical galaxies	this paper explores the quantitative connection between globular clusters andthe diffuse stellar population of the galaxies they are associated with. bothngc 1399 and ngc 4486 (m87) are well suited for this kind of analysis due totheir large globular cluster populations. the main assumption of our montecarlo based models is that each globular cluster is formed along with a givendiffuse stellar mass that shares the same spatial distribution, chemicalcomposition and age. the main globular clusters subpopulations, that determinethe observed bimodal colour distribution, are decomposed avoiding a prioriparametric (e.g. gaussian) fits and using a new colour (c-t1)-metallicityrelation. the eventual detectability of a blue tilt in the colour magnitudediagrams of the blue globulars subpopulation is also addressed. a successfullink between globular clusters and the stellar galaxy halo is established byassuming that the number of globular clusters per associated diffuse stellarmass t is a function of total abundance [z/h] and behaves ast=gamma*exp(delta[z/h]) (i.e. increases when abundance decreases).

1108.0138	lithium and sodium in the globular cluster m4. detection of a li-rich  dwarf star: preservation or pollution?	context. the abundance inhomogeneities of light elements observed in globularclusters (gcs), and notably the ubiquitous na-o anti-correlation, are generallyinterpreted as evidence that gcs comprise several generations of stars. thereis an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce theinhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is away to shed new light on this problem. aims. we aim at investigating the li andna content of the gc m 4, that is known to have a well defined na-oanti-correlation. methods. we obtained moderate resolution (r=17 000-18 700)spectra for 91 main sequence (ms)/sub-giant branch stars of m 4 with thegiraffe spectrograph at the flames/vlt eso facility. using model atmospheresanalysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. results. we detect a weakli-na anti-correlation among un-evolved ms stars. one star in the sample, #37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance a(li)=2.87, compatible withcurrent estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. conclusions. the shallowslope found for the li-na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced inparallel to sodium. this evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,suggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate bypollution from a previous generations of stars. the recent detection of ali-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster ngc 6397 may alsopoint in this direction. still, no clear cut evidence is available against apossible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.

1109.1854	three galactic globular cluster candidates	the census of galactic globular clusters (gcs) is still incomplete, and aboutten new objects are supposed to await discovery, hidden behind the crowded andreddened regions of the galactic bulge and disk. we investigated the nature ofthree new gc candidates, discovered in the frames collected by the vistavariables in the via lactea (vvv) near-infrared survey. they will be called vvvcl002, vvv cl003, and vvv cl004. we studied the results ofpoint-spread-function near-infrared photometry from vvv data for the threeobjects and their surrounding fields, the proper motion information availablein the literature and, when possible, we derived the cluster parameters bymeans of calibrated indices measured on the color-magnitude diagrams. theevidence shows that vvv cl002 is a newly discovered, small, moderatelymetal-rich (fe/h -0.4) galactic gc. it is located at a galactocentric distanceof 0.7+-0.9 kpc, and it could be one of the nearest gc to the galactic center.its characteristics are more similar to those of low-mass, palomar-like gcsthan to more classical, old, and massive bulge gcs. vvv cl003 is the first starcluster discovered in the galactic disk on the opposite side of the center withrespect to the sun, at a galactocentric distance of ~5 kpc. its highmetallicity (fe/h -0.1) and location point to an open cluster, but a gc cannotbe excluded. vvv cl004, on the contrary, is most probably only a random clumpof field stars, as indicated by both its low statistical significance and bythe impossibility to distinguish its stars from the surrounding fieldpopulation. we claim the detection of i) a new galactic gc, deriving anestimate of its basic parameters; ii) a stellar aggregate, probably an opencluster, in the disk directly beyond the galactic center; and iii) anoverdensity of stars, most probably an asterism.

1112.3957	strengthening the open cluster distance scale via vvv photometry	approximately 14% of known galactic open clusters possess absolute errors 20%as evaluated from n&gt;3 independent distance estimates, and the statistics forage estimates are markedly worse. that impedes such diverse efforts ascalibrating standard candles and constraining masses for substellar companions.new data from the vvv survey may be employed to establish precise clusterdistances with comparatively reduced uncertainties (&lt;10%). this is illustratedby deriving parameters for pismis 19 and ngc 4349, two pertinent open clusterswhich hitherto feature sizable uncertainties (60%). fundamental parametersdetermined for pismis 19 from new vvv jhks photometry are d=2.40+-0.15 kpc,&lt;e(j-h)&gt;=0.34+-0.04, and log(t)=9.05+-0.10, whereas for ngc 4349 the analysisyielded d=1.63+-0.13 kpc, e(j-h)=0.09+-0.02, log(t)=8.55+-0.10. the resultsexhibit a significant (&gt;5x) reduction in uncertainties, and indicate that: i)existing parameters for the substellar object ngc 4349 127b require revision,in part because the new cluster parameters imply that the host is 20%less-massive (m*/ms~3.1); ii) r cru is not a member of ngc 4349 and should beexcluded from period-wesenheit calibrations that anchor the distance scale;iii) and results for pismis 19 underscore the advantages gleaned from employingdeep vvv jhks data to examine obscured (av~4) and differentially reddenedintermediate-age clusters.

1201.3241	the helium content of globular clusters: ngc6121 (m4)	he has been proposed as a key element to interpret the observed multiple ms,sgb, and rgb, as well as the complex horizontal branch (hb) morphology. starsbelonging to the bluer part of the hb, are thought to be more he rich (\deltay=0.03 or more) and more na-rich/o-poor than those located in the redder part.this hypothesis was only partially confirmed in ngc 6752, where stars of theredder zero-age hb showed a he content of y=0.25+-0.01, fully compatible withthe primordial he content of the universe, and were all na-poor/o-rich. here westudy hot blue hb (bhb) stars in the gc ngc 6121 (m4) to measure their he pluso/na content. we observed 6 bhb stars using the uves@vlt2 spectroscopicfacility. in addition to he, o, na, and fe abundances were estimated. starsturned out to be all na-rich and o-poor and to have a homogeneous enhanced hecontent with a mean value of y=0.29+-0.01(random)+-0.01(systematic). the highhe content of blue hb stars in m4 is also confirmed by the fact that they arebrighter than red hb stars (rhb). theoretical models suggest the bhb stars arehe-enhanced by \delta y=0.02-0.03 with respect to the rhb stars. the wholesample of stars has a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.06+-0.02 (internal error). thisis a rare direct measurement of the (primordial) he abundance for starsbelonging to the na-rich/o-poor population of gc stars in a temperature regimewhere the he content is not altered by sedimentation or extreme mixing assuggested for the hottest, late helium flash hb stars. our results supporttheoretical predictions that the na-rich/o-poor population is also more he-richthan the na-poor/o-rich generation and that a leading contender for the 2^{nd}parameter is the he abundance.

1205.5719	spectroscopic analysis of the two subgiant branches of the globular  cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 possibly shows a spread in [fe/h], but the relation between thisspread and the division in the sgb is unknown. we obtained blue (3950-4600 a)intermediate resolution (r~8,000) spectra for 47 stars on the bright and 30 onthe faint sgb of ngc 1851 (b-sgb and f-sgb, respectively). the determination ofthe atmospheric parameters to extremely high internal accuracy leads to smallerrors when comparing different stars in the cluster. we found that the b-sgbis slightly more metal-poor than the f-sgb, with [fe/h]=-1.227+/-0.009 and[fe/h]=-1.162+/- 0.012, respectively. this implies that the f-sgb is onlyslightly older by ~0.6 gyr than the b-sgb if the total cno abundance isconstant. there are more c-normal stars in the b-sgb than in the f-sgb. this isconsistent with what is found for hb stars, if b-sgb are the progenitors of redhb stars, and f-sgb those of blue hb ones. the abundances of the n-captureelements sr and ba have a bimodal distribution, reflecting the separationbetween f-sgb (sr and ba-rich) and b-sgb stars (sr and ba-poor). in bothgroups, there is a clear correlation between [sr/fe] and [ba/fe], suggestingthat there is a real spread in the abundances of n-capture elements. there issome correlation between c and ba abundances, while the same correlation for sris much more dubious. we identified six c-rich stars, which have a moderateoverabundance of sr and ba and rather low n abundances. this group of starsmight be the progenitors of these on the anomalous rgb in the (v, v-y) diagram.these results are discussed within different scenarios for the formation ofngc1851. it is possible that the two populations originated in differentregions of an inhomogeneous parent object. however, the striking similaritywith m22 calls for a similar evolution for these two clusters. derivingreliable cno abundances for the two sequences would be crucial.

1207.3328	the unique na:o abundance distribution in ngc 6791: the first open(?)  cluster with multiple populations	almost all globular clusters investigated exhibit a spread in their lightelement abundances, the most studied being a na:o anticorrelation. in contrast,open clusters show a homogeneous composition and are still regarded as simplestellar populations. the most probable reason for this difference is thatglobulars had an initial mass high enough to retain primordial gas and ejectafrom the first stellar generation and thus formed a second generation with adistinct composition, an initial mass exceeding that of open clusters. ngc 6791is a massive open cluster, and warrants a detailed search for chemicalinhomogeneities. we collected high resolution, high s/n spectra of 21 memberscovering a wide range of evolutionary status and measured their na, o and fecontent. we found [fe/h]=+0.42$\pm 0.01$, in good agreement with previousvalues, and no evidence for a spread. however, the na:o distribution iscompletely unprecedented. it becomes the first open cluster to show intrinsicabundance variations that cannot be explained by mixing, and thus the firstdiscovered to host multiple populations. it is also the first star cluster toexhibit two subpopulations in the na:o diagram with one being chemicallyhomogeneous while the second has an intrinsic spread that follows theanticorrelation so far displayed only by globular clusters. ngc 6791 is uniquein many aspects, displaying certain characteristics typical of open clusters,others more reminiscent of globulars, and yet others, in particular its na:obehavior investigated here, that are totally unprecedented. it clearly had acomplex and fascinating history.

1305.5902	milky way demographics with the vvv survey ii. color transformations and  near-infrared photometry for 136 million stars in the southern galactic disk	the new multi-epoch near-infrared vvv survey (vista variables in the vialactea) is sampling 562 sq. deg of the galactic bulge and adjacent regions ofthe disk. accurate astrometry established for the region surveyed allows thevvv data to be merged with overlapping surveys (e.g., glimpse, wise, 2mass,etc.), thereby enabling the construction of longer baseline spectral energydistributions for astronomical targets. however, in order to maximize use ofthe vvv data, a set of transformation equations are required to place the vvvjhks photometry onto the 2mass system. the impetus for this work is to developthose transformations via a comparison of 2mass targets in 152 vvv fieldssampling the galactic disk. the transformation coefficients derived exhibit areliance on variables such as extinction. the transformed data weresubsequently employed to establish a mean reddening law ofe_{j-h}/e_{h-ks}=2.13 +/- 0.04, which is the most precise determination to dateand merely emphasizes the pertinence of the vvv data for determining suchimportant parameters.

1307.2957	spectroscopy of blue horizontal branch stars in ngc 6656 (m22)	recent investigations revealed very peculiar properties of blue horizontalbranch (hb) stars in \omega centauri, which show anomalously low surfacegravity and mass compared to other clusters and to theoretical models. \omegacentauri, however, is a very unusual object, hosting a complex mix of multiplestellar populations with different metallicity and chemical abundances. wemeasured the fundamental parameters (temperature, gravity, and surface heliumabundance) of a sample of 71 blue hb stars in m22, with the aim of clarifyingif the peculiar results found in \omega cen are unique to this cluster. m22also hosts multiple sub-populations of stars with a spread in metallicity,analogous to \omega cen. the stellar parameters were measured on low-resolutionspectra fitting the balmer and helium lines with a grid of synthetic spectra.from these parameters, the mass and reddening were estimated. our results onthe gravities and masses agree well with theoretical expectations, matching theprevious measurements in three "normal" clusters. the anomalies found in \omegacen are not observed among our stars. a mild mass underestimate is found forstars hotter than 14\,000 k, but an exact analogy with \omega cen cannot bedrawn. we measured the reddening in the direction of m22 with two independentmethods, finding e(b-v)=0.35 \pm 0.02 mag, with semi-amplitude of the maximumvariation \delta(e(b-v))=0.06 mag, and an rms intrinsic dispersion of\sigma(e(b-v))=0.03 mag.

1310.5900	ruprecht 106: the first single population globular cluster?	all old galactic globular clusters studied in detail to date host at leasttwo generations of stars, where the second is formed from gas polluted byprocessed material produced by massive stars of the first. this process canhappen if the initial mass of the cluster exceeds a threshold above whichejecta are retained and a second generation is formed. a determination of thismass-threshold is mandatory in order to understand how gcs form. we analyzed 9rgb stars belonging to the cluster ruprecht 106. targets were observed with theuves@vlt2 spectrograph. spectra cover a wide range and allowed us to measureabundances for light (o,na,mg,al), alpha (si,ca,ti), iron-peak(sc,v,cr,mn,fe,co,ni,cu,zn) and neutron-capture(y,zr,ba,la,ce,pr,nd,sm,eu,dy,pb) elements. based on these abundances we showthat ruprecht 106 is the first convincing example of a single population gc(i.e. a true simple stellar population), although the sample is relativelysmall. this result is supported also by an independent photometric test and bythe hb morphology and the dynamical state. it is old (~12 gyrs) and, at oddswith other gcs, has no alpha-enhancement. the material it formed from wascontaminated by both s- and r- process elements. the abundance pattern pointstoward an extragalactic origin. its present day mass (m=10^4.83 msun) can beassumed as a strong lower limit for the initial mass threshold below which nosecond generation is formed. clearly, its initial mass must have beensignificantly greater but we have no current constraints on the amount of massloss during its evolution.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1401.0014	deriving metallicities from calcium triplet spectroscopy in combination  with near infrared photometry	context. [...] one of the most efficient methods is the measurement of theequivalent width (ew) of the calcium ii triplet (cat), corrected for theluminosity and temperature effects via magnitude differences from thehorizontal branch (hb). methods. we use the ks magnitude difference between thestar and the reddest part of the hb (rhb) to generate reduced equivalent widths(rew) from the datasets presented in saviane et al. (2012) and rutledge et al.(1997). subsequently we calibrated these rew against three differentmetellicity (met) scales: the one presented in carretta et al. (2009), the metvalues given in harris (2010) and a version of the former corrected viahigh-resolution spectroscopic met. results. we calculated the calibrationrelations for the two datasets and the three met scales and found that they areapproximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible. we compared ournir calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to beequivalent, establishing that the luminosity-corrected rew using the ksmagnitude is compatible with the one obtained from the v magnitude. we thenused the met obtained from the calibration to investigate the internal metdistributions of the gcs. conclusions. we have established that the([fe/h]:rew) relation is independent from the mag used for the luminositycorrection and find that the calibration relations only change slightly fordifferent met scales. the cat technique using nir photometry is thus a powerfultool to derive met. in particular, it can be used to study the internal metspread of a gc. we confirm the presence of at least two met populations in ngc6656 and find that several other gcs present peculiar met distributions.

1402.1687	age determination of fifteen old to intermediate-age small magellanic  cloud star clusters	we present cmds in the v and i bands for fifteen star clusters in the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) based on data taken with the very large telescope (vlt,chile). we selected these clusters from our previous work, wherein we derivedcluster radial velocities and metallicities from calcium ii infrared triplet(cat) spectra also taken with the vlt. we discovered that the ages of six ofour clusters have been appreciably underestimated by previous studies, whichused comparatively small telescopes, graphically illustrating the need forlarge apertures to obtain reliable ages of old and intermediate-age smc starclusters. in particular, three of these clusters, l4, l6 and l110, turn out tobe amongst the oldest smc clusters known, with ages of 7.9 +- 1.1, 8.7 +- 1.2and 7.6 +- 1.0 gyr, respectively, helping to fill a possible "smc cluster agegap" (glatt et al. 2008). using the present ages and metallicities from parisiet al. (2009), we analyze the age distribution, age gradient and agemetallicity relation (amr) of a sample of smc clusters measured homogeneously.there is a suggestion of bimodality in the age distribution but it does notshow a constant slope for the first 4 gyr (piatti 2011), and we find noevidence for an age gradient. due to the improved ages of our cluster sample,we find that our amr is now better represented in the intermediate/old periodthan that we derived in parisi et al. (2009), where we simply took agesavailable in the literature. additionally, clusters younger than aprox. 4 gyrnow show better agreement with the bursting model, but we confirm that thismodel is not a good representation of the amr during the intermediate-age/oldperiod. a more complicated model is needed to explain the smc chemicalevolution in that period.

1406.0550	uncovering multiple populations with washington photometry: i. the  globular cluster ngc 1851	the analysis of multiple populations (mps) in globular clusters (gcs) hasbecome a forefront area of research in astronomy. multiple red giant branches(rgbs), subgiant branches (sgbs), and even main sequences (mss) have now beenobserved photometrically in many gcs. uv photometry has been crucial indiscovering and analyzing these mps, but the johnson u and the stromgren andsloan u filters that have generally been used are relatively inefficient andvery sensitive to reddening and atmospheric extinction. in contrast, thewashington c filter is much broader and redder than these competing uv filters.here we investigate the use of the washington system to uncover mps using onlya 1-meter telescope. our analysis of the well-studied gc ngc 1851 finds thatthe c filter is both very efficient and effective at detecting its previouslydiscovered mps in the rgb and sgb. remarkably, we have also detected anintrinsically broad ms best characterized by two distinct but heavilyoverlapping populations that cannot be explained by binaries, field stars, orphotometric errors. the ms distribution is in very good agreement with thatseen on the rgb, with ~30% of the stars belonging to the second population.there is also evidence for two sequences in the red horizontal branch, but thisappears to be unrelated to the mps in this cluster. neither of these latterphenomena have been observed previously in this cluster. the redder ms starsare also more centrally concentrated than the blue ms. this is the first timemps in a ms have been discovered from the ground, and using only a 1-metertelescope. the washington system thus proves to be a very powerful tool forinvestigating mps, and holds particular promise for extragalactic objects wherephotons are limited.

1406.5069	the metallicity spread and the age-metallicity relation of omega  centauri	omega centauri is a peculiar globular cluster formed by a complex stellarpopulation. to shed light on this, we studied 172 stars belonging to the 5 sgbsthat we can identify in our photometry, in order to measure their [fe/h]content as well as estimate their age dispersion and the age-metallicityrelation. the first important result is that all of these sgbs has adistribution in metallicity with a spread that exceeds the observational errorsand typically displays several peaks that indicate the presence of severalsub-populations. we were able to identified at least 6 of them based on theirmean [fe/h] content. these metallicity-based sub-populations are seen tovarying extents in each of the 5 sgbs. taking advantage of the age-sensitivityof the sgb we showed that, first of all, at least half of the sub-populationshave an age spread of at least 2 gyrs. then we obtained an age-metallicityrelation that is the most complete up to date for this cluster. theinterpretation of the age-metallicity relation is not straightforward, but itis possible that the cluster (or what we can call its progenitor) was initiallycomposed of two populations having different metallicities. because of theirage, it is very unlikely that the most metal-rich derives from the mostmetal-poor by some kind of chemical evolution process, so they must be assumedas two independent primordial objects or perhaps two separate parts of a singlelarger object, that merged in the past to form the present-day cluster.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

(2014). this may berevealing possible differences in the chemical history of clusters and fieldstars. our clusters show a significant dispersion of metallicities, whateverage is considered, which could be reflecting the lack of a unique amr in thisgalaxy. none of the chemical evolution models currently available in theliterature satisfactorily represents the global chemical enrichment processesof smc clusters.

astro-ph;0012471	the stellar content and distance of ugc 4483	we present hst/wfpc2 observations of ugc 4483, an irregular galaxy in them81/ngc 2403 complex. stellar photometry was carried out with hstphot, and iscomplete to v ~ 26.0 and i ~ 24.7. we measure the red giant branch tip at i =23.56 +/- 0.10 and calculated a distance modulus of (m-m)o = 27.53 +/- 0.12(corresponding to a distance of 3.2 +/- 0.2 mpc), placing ugc 4483 within thengc 2403 subgroup. we were able to measure properties of a previously-knownyoung star cluster in ugc 4483, finding integrated magnitudes of v = 18.66 +/-0.21 and i = 18.54 +/- 0.10 for the stellar contribution (integrated lightminus halpha and [oiii] contribution), corresponding to an age of ~10-15 myrand initial mass of ~10^4 msun. this is consistent with the properties of thecluster's brightest stars, which were resolved in the data for the first time.finally, a numerical analysis of the galaxy's stellar content yields a roughlyconstant star formation rate of 1.3x10^-3 msun/yr and mean metallicity of[fe/h] = -1.3 dex from 15 gyr ago to the present.

astro-ph;0111365	the stellar populations of the cetus dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present hubble space telescope wide field planetary camera 2 photometry inthe v and i passbands of the recently discovered local group dwarf spheroidalgalaxy in cetus. our color-magnitude diagram extends from above the firstascent red giant branch (rgb) tip to approximately half a magnitude below thehorizontal branch (hb). adopting a reddening of e(b-v) = 0.03, the magnitude ofthe rgb tip yields a distance modulus of (m-m)o = 24.46 +/- 0.14. afterapplying the reddening and distance modulus, we have utilized the colordistribution of rgb stars to determine a mean metal abundance of [fe/h] = -1.7on the zinn &amp; west scale with an intrinsic internal abundance dispersion of+/-0.2 dex. an indirect calculation of the hb morphology of cetus based on themean dereddened hb color yields (b-r)/(b+v+r) = -0.91 +/- 0.09, whichrepresents an hb that is redder than what can be attributed solely to cetus'metal abundance. as such, cetus suffers from the `second parameter effect' inwhich another parameter besides metallicity is controlling the hb morphology.if we adopt the conventional `age hypothesis' explanation for the secondparameter effect, then this implies that cetus is 2-3 gyr younger than galacticglobular clusters at its metallicity.

(2002). however, they extend to higher ellipticities and largerhalf-light radii than their galactic counterparts. combining our results withthose of harris et al. fills in the gaps previously existing in $r_h - m_v$parameter space and indicates that any substantial difference between presumeddistinct cluster types in this diagram, including for example the faint fuzziesof larsen &amp; brodie (2000) and the `extended, luminous' m31 clusters of huxor etal. (2005) is now removed and that clusters form a continuum in this diagram.indeed, this continuum now extends to the realm of the ultra compact dwarfs. wehave carried out additional analysis to quantify the contamination bybackground galaxies. this shows that, although galaxies cannot be easily toldapart from clusters in some of the structural diagrams, the combination ofexcellent image quality and washington photometry should limit thecontamination to roughly 10% of the population of cluster candidates.

[dbsb2003]172 lacks central concentration and most likely this is not acluster but an extended star forming region.  the high mass of rcw87 -- if confirmed -- puts this object in line witharches and quintuplet, among the most young massive clusters in the galaxy.further study is necessary to confirm this important result.

(1999) to identify giant star candidatesat the distance and metallicity of carina across the entire extent of thephotometric survey covering some 2.2 deg^2 on and around carina. thesecarina-associated giant candidates are identified by a combination of (1) theirm-ddo51 colors, and (2) by locations in the color-magnitude diagramcommensurate with the carina rgb in the core of the galaxy. the densitydistribution of the extratidal giant candidates is similar to that found fromprevious statistical star-counting approaches. however, we are now able topinpoint actual, remotely-situated carina stars individually. because we canexclude foreground dwarf stars, our approach allows greater sensitivity and theability to map the detailed two-dimensional distribution of extended carinapopulations to much larger radii, with smaller aperture telescopes, than othertechniques. moreover, we identify candidate lists of widely displacedcarina-associated stars bright enough for spectroscopic studies of large-scaledynamical and metallicity properties of the system, and for astrometric studyby sim. we obtained spectroscopy for three such ``extratidal'' stars and fromtheir radial velocities conclude that all three are associated with carina.
