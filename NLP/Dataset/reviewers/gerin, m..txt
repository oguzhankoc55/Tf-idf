0902.2748	the ionization fraction gradient across the horsehead edge: an archetype  for molecular clouds	the ionization fraction plays a key role in the chemistry and dynamics ofmolecular clouds. we study the h13co+, dco+ and hoc+ line emission towards thehorsehead, from the shielded core to the uv irradiated cloud edge, i.e., thephotodissociation region (pdr), as a template to investigate the ionizationfraction gradient in molecular clouds. we analyze a pdbi map of the h13co+j=1-0 line, complemented with iram-30m h13co+ and dco+ higher-j line maps andnew hoc+ and co+ observations. we compare self-consistently the observedspatial distribution and line intensities with detailed depth-dependentpredictions of a pdr model coupled with a nonlocal radiative transfercalculation. the chemical network includes deuterated species, 13cfractionation reactions and hco+/hoc+ isomerization reactions. the role ofneutral and charged pahs in the cloud chemistry and ionization balance isinvestigated. the detection of hoc+ reactive ion towards the horsehead pdrproves the high ionization fraction of the outer uv irradiated regions, wherewe derive a low [hco+]/[hoc+]~75-200 abundance ratio. in the absence of pahs,we reproduce the observations with gas-phase metal abundances, [fe+mg+...],lower than 4x10(-9) (with respect to h) and a cosmic-rays ionization rate ofzeta=(5+/-3)x10(-17) s(-1). the inclusion of pahs modifies the ionizationfraction gradient and increases the required metal abundance. the ionizationfraction in the horsehead edge follows a steep gradient, with a scale length of~0.05 pc (or ~25''), from [e-]~10(-4) (or n_e ~ 1-5 cm(-3)) in the pdr to a fewtimes ~10(-9) in the core. pah^- anions play a role in the charge balance ofthe cold and neutral gas if substantial amounts of free pahs are present ([pah]&gt;10(-8)).

0905.1845	search for corannulene (c20h10) in the red rectangle	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are widely accepted as the carriersof the aromatic infrared bands (aibs), but an unambiguous identification of anyspecific interstellar pah is still missing. for polar pahs, pure rotationaltransitions can be used as fingerprints for identification. combining dedicatedexperiments, detailed simulations and observations, we explored the mm domainto search for specific rotational transitions of corannulene (c20h10). weperformed high-resolution spectroscopic measurements and a simulation of theemission spectrum of uv-excited c20h10 in the environment of the red rectangle,calculating its synthetic rotational spectrum. based on these results, weconducted a first observational campaign at the iram 30m telescope towards thissource to search for several high-j rotational transitions of (c20h10). thelaboratory detection of the j = 112 &lt;- 111 transition of corannulene showedthat no centrifugal splitting is present up to this line. observations with theiram 30m telescope towards the red rectangle do not show any corannuleneemission at any of the observed frequencies, down to a rms noise level of tmb =8 mk for the j =135 -&gt; 134 transition at 137.615 ghz. comparing the noise levelwith the synthetic spectrum, we are able to estimate an upper limit to thefraction of carbon locked in corannulene of about 1.0x10(-5) relative to thetotal abundance of carbon in pahs. the sensitivity achieved shows that radiospectroscopy can be a powerful tool to search for polar pahs. we compare thisupper limit with models for the pah size distribution, emphasising that smallpahs are much less abundant than predicted. we show that this cannot beexplained by destruction but is more likely related to the chemistry of theirformation in the environment of the red rectangle.

0906.2975	are $^{12}$co lines good indicators of the star formation rate in  galaxies?	in this paper, we investigate the relevance of using the $^{12}$co lineemissions as indicators of star formation rates (sfr). for the first time, wepresent this study for a relatively large number of $^{12}$co transitions (12)as well as over a large interval in redshift (from z$\sim$0 to z$\sim$6). forthe nearby sources (d$\leq$10 mpc), we have used homogeneous sample of$^{12}$co data provided by bayet et al. (2004, 2006), mixing observational andmodelled line intensities. for higher-z sources (z $\geq$ 1), we have collected$^{12}$co observations from various papers and have completed the data set ofline intensities with model predictions which we also present in this paper.finally, for increasing the statistics, we have included recent $^{12}$co(1-0)and $^{12}$co(3-2) observations of intermediate-z sources. linear regressionshave been calculated for identifying the tightest sfr-$^{12}$co line luminosityrelationships. we show that the \emph{total} $^{12}$co, the $^{12}$co(5-4), the$^{12}$co(6-5) and the $^{12}$co(7-6) luminosities are the best indicators ofsfr (as measured by the far-infrared luminosity). comparisons with theoreticalapproaches from krumholz and thompson (2007) and narayanan et al. (2008) arealso performed in this paper. although in general agreement, the predictionsmade by these authors and the observational results we present here show smalland interesting discrepancies. in particular, the slope of the linearregressions, for j$_{upper}\geq$ 4 $^{12}$co lines are not similar betweentheoretical studies and observations. on one hand, a larger high-j $^{12}$codata set of observations might help to better agree with models, increasing thestatistics. on the other hand, theoretical studies extended to high redshiftsources might also reduce such discrepancies.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1005.2517	hifi observations of warm gas in dr21: shock versus radiative heating	the molecular gas in the dr21 massive star formation region is known to beaffected by the strong uv field from the central star cluster and by a fastoutflow creating a bright shock. the relative contribution of both heatingmechanisms is the matter of a long debate. by better sampling the excitationladder of various tracers we provide a quantitative distinction between thedifferent heating mechanisms. hifi observations of mid-j transitions of co andhco+ isotopes allow us to bridge the gap in excitation energies betweenobservations from the ground, characterizing the cooler gas, and existing isolws spectra, constraining the properties of the hot gas. comparing the detailedline profiles allows to identify the physical structure of the differentcomponents. in spite of the known shock-excitation of h2 and the clearlyvisible strong outflow, we find that the emission of all lines up to &gt; 2 thzcan be explained by purely radiative heating of the material. however, the newherschel/hifi observations reveal two types of excitation conditions. we findhot and dense clumps close to the central cluster, probably dynamicallyaffected by the outflow, and a more widespread distribution of cooler, butnevertheless dense, molecular clumps.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.0987	herschel/hifi observations of interstellar oh+ and h2o+ towards w49n: a  probe of diffuse clouds with a small molecular fraction	we report the detection of absorption by interstellar hydroxyl cations andwater cations, along the sight-line to the bright continuum source w49n. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, to observe the972 ghz n = 1 - 0 transition of oh+ and the 1115 ghz 1(11) - 0(00) transitionof ortho-h2o+. the resultant spectra show absorption by ortho-h2o+, and strongabsorption by oh+, in foreground material at velocities in the range 0 to 70km/s with respect to the local standard of rest. the inferred oh+/h2o+abundance ratio ranges from ~ 3 to ~ 15, implying that the observed oh+ arisesin clouds of small molecular fraction, in the 2 - 8% range. this conclusion isconfirmed by the distribution of oh+ and h2o+ in doppler velocity space, whichis similar to that of atomic hydrogen, as observed by means of 21 cm absorptionmeasurements, and dissimilar from that typical of other molecular tracers. theobserved oh+/h abundance ratio of a few e-8 suggests a cosmic ray ionizationrate for atomic hydrogen of (0.6 - 2.4) e-16 s-1, in good agreement withestimates inferred previously for diffuse clouds in the galactic disk fromobservations of interstellar h3+ and other species.

1007.1523	herschel observations in the ultracompact hii region mon r2: water in  dense photon-dominated regions (pdrs)	mon r2, at a distance of 830 pc, is the only ultracompact hii region (uc hii)where the photon-dominated region (pdr) between the ionized gas and themolecular cloud can be resolved with herschel. hifi observations of theabundant compounds 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+, cs, ch, and nh have been used toderive the physical and chemical conditions in the pdr, in particular the waterabundance. the 13co, c18o, o-h2-18o, hco+ and cs observations are welldescribed assuming that the emission is coming from a dense (n=5e6 cm-3,n(h2)&gt;1e22 cm-2) layer of molecular gas around the uc hii. based on ouro-h2-18o observations, we estimate an o-h2o abundance of ~2e-8. this is theaverage ortho-water abundance in the pdr. additional h2-18o and/or water linesare required to derive the water abundance profile. a lower density envelope(n~1e5 cm-3, n(h2)=2-5e22 cm-2) is responsible for the absorption in the nh1_1-0_2 line. the emission of the ch ground state triplet is coming from bothregions with a complex and self-absorbed profile in the main component. theradiative transfer modeling shows that the 13co and hco+ line profiles areconsistent with an expansion of the molecular gas with a velocity law, v_e =0.5x (r/rout)^{-1} km/s, although the expansion velocity is poorly constrained bythe observations presented here.

1007.1539	herschel/hifi observations of spectrally resolved methylidyne signatures  toward the high-mass star-forming core ngc6334i	in contrast to extensively studied dense star-forming cores, little is knownabout diffuse gas surrounding star-forming regions. we study molecular gas inthe high-mass star-forming region ngc6334i, which contains diffuse, quiescentcomponents that are inconspicuous in widely used molecular tracers such as co.we present herschel/hifi observations of ch toward ngc6334i observed as part ofthe chess key program. hifi resolves the hyperfine components of its j=3/2-1/2transition, observed in both emission and absorption. the ch emission appearsclose to the systemic velocity of ngc6334i, while its measured linewidth of 3km/s is smaller than previously observed in dense gas tracers such as nh3 andsio. the ch abundance in the hot core is 7 10^-11, two to three orders ofmagnitude lower than in diffuse clouds. while other studies find distinctoutflows in, e.g., co and h2o toward ngc6334i, we do not detect outflowsignatures in ch. to explain the absorption signatures, at least two absorbingcomponents are needed at -3.0 and +6.5 km/s with n(ch)=7 10^13 and 3 10^13cm^-2. two additional absorbing clouds are found at +8.0 and 0.0 km/s, bothwith n(ch)=2 10^13 cm^-2. turbulent linewidths for the four absorptioncomponents vary between 1.5 and 5.0 km/s in fwhm. we constrain physicalproperties of our ch clouds by matching our ch absorbers with other absorptionsignatures. in the hot core, molecules such as h2o and co trace gas that isheated and dynamically influenced by outflow activity, whereas ch traces morequiescent material. the four ch absorbers have column densities and turbulentproperties consistent with diffuse clouds: two are located near ngc6334, andtwo are unrelated foreground clouds. local density and dynamical effectsinfluence the chemical composition of physical components of ngc6334, causingsome components to be seen in ch but not in other tracers, and vice versa.

1007.2148	detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds  with herschel/hifi: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas	we discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (hf)along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources w49n and w51. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the1232.4762 ghz j = 1 - 0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band 5areceiver. we detected foreground absorption by hf toward both sources over awide range of velocities. optically thin absorption components were detected onboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limiton - the column density of hf for the first time. as in previous observationsof hf toward the source g10.6-0.4, the derived hf column density is typicallycomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance ofoxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. we usedthe rather uncertain n(ch)-n(h2) relationship derived previously toward diffusemolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the cloudsexhibiting hf absorption. within the uncertainties, we find that the abundanceof hf with respect to h2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that hfis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. thus, hydrogenfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small h2 column density. indeed,the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of alow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the w51 sight line, at an lsrvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorptionline studies prior to the launch of herschel.

1007.4957	the origin of the [c ii] emission in the s140 pdrs - new insights from  hifi	using herschel's hifi instrument we have observed [c ii] along a cut throughs140 and high-j transitions of co and hco+ at two positions on the cut,corresponding to the externally irradiated ionization front and the embeddedmassive star forming core irs1. the hifi data were combined with availableground-based observations and modeled using the kosma-tau model for photondominated regions. here we derive the physical conditions in s140 and inparticular the origin of [c ii] emission around irs1. we identify threedistinct regions of [c ii] emission from the cut, one close to the embeddedsource irs1, one associated with the ionization front and one further into thecloud. the line emission can be understood in terms of a clumpy model ofphoton-dominated regions. at the position of irs1, we identify at least twodistinct components contributing to the [c ii] emission, one of them a small,hot component, which can possibly be identified with the irradiated outflowwalls. this is consistent with the fact that the [c ii] peak at irs1 coincideswith shocked h2 emission at the edges of the outflow cavity. we note thatpreviously available observations of irs1 can be well reproduced by asingle-component kosma-tau model. thus it is hifi's unprecedented spatial andspectral resolution, as well as its sensitivity which has allowed us to uncoveran additional hot gas component in the s140 region.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.1315	gas morphology and energetics at the surface of pdrs: new insights with  herschel observations of ngc 7023	we investigate the physics and chemistry of the gas and dust in densephoton-dominated regions (pdrs), along with their dependence on theilluminating uv field. using herschel-hifi observations, we study the gasenergetics in ngc 7023 in relation to the morphology of this nebula. ngc 7023is the prototype of a pdr illuminated by a b2v star and is one of the keytargets of herschel. our approach consists in determining the energetics of theregion by combining the information carried by the mid-ir spectrum (extinctionby classical grains, emission from very small dust particles) with that of themain gas coolant lines. in this letter, we discuss more specifically theintensity and line profile of the 158 micron (1901 ghz) [cii] line measured byhifi and provide information on the emitting gas. we show that both the [cii]emission and the mid-ir emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)arise from the regions located in the transition zone between atomic andmolecular gas. using the meudon pdr code and a simple transfer model, we findgood agreement between the calculated and observed [cii] intensities. hifiobservations of ngc 7023 provide the opportunity to constrain the energetics atthe surface of pdrs. future work will include analysis of the main coolant line[oi] and use of a new pdr model that includes pah-related species.

1101.0805	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources: methanol as a probe of  physical conditions in orion kl	we have examined methanol emission from orion kl with of the {\emherschel}/hifi instrument, and detected two methanol bands centered at 524 ghzand 1061 ghz. the 524 ghz methanol band (observed in hifi band 1a) is dominatedby the isolated $\delta$j$=$0, k$=-4\rightarrow$-3, v$_t$$=$0 q branch, andincludes 25 e-type and 2 a-type transitions. the 1061 ghz methanol band(observed in hifi band 4b) is dominated by the $\delta$j$=$0,k$=7\rightarrow$6, v$_t$$=$0 q branch transitions which are mostly blended. wehave used the isolated e-type v$_t$$=$0 methanol transitions to explore thephysical conditions in the molecular gas. with hifi's high velocity resolution,the methanol emission contributed by different spatial components along theline of sight toward orion kl (hot core, low velocity flow, and compact ridge)can be distinguished and studied separately. the isolated transitions detectedin these bands cover a broad energy range (upper state energy ranging from 80 kto 900 k), which provides a unique probe of the thermal structure in eachspatial component. the observations further show that the compact ridge isexternally heated. these observations demonstrate the power of methanol linesas probes of the physical conditions in warm regions in close proximity toyoung stars.

1105.2623	oh emission from warm and dense gas in the orion bar pdr	as part of a far-infrared (fir) spectral scan with herschel/pacs, we presentthe first detection of the hydroxyl radical (oh) towards the orion barphotodissociation region (pdr). five oh rotational lambda-doublets involvingenergy levels out to e_u/k~511 k have been detected (at ~65, ~79, ~84, ~119 and~163um). the total intensity of the oh lines is i(oh)~5x10^-4 erg s^-1 cm^-2sr^-1. the observed emission of rotationally excited oh lines is extended andcorrelates well with the high-j co and ch^+ j=3-2 line emission (but apparentlynot with water vapour), pointing towards a common origin. nonlocal, non-lteradiative transfer models including excitation by the ambient fir radiationfield suggest that oh arises in a small filling factor component of warm(tk~160-220 k) and dense (n_h~10^{6-7} cm^-3) gas with source-averaged ohcolumn densities of ~10^15 cm^-2. high density and temperature photochemicalmodels predict such enhanced oh columns at low depths (a_v&lt;1) and small spatialscales (~10^15 cm), where oh formation is driven by gas-phase endothermicreactions of atomic oxygen with molecular hydrogen. we interpret the extendedoh emission as coming from unresolved structures exposed to far-ultraviolet(fuv) radiation near the bar edge (photoevaporating clumps or filaments) andnot from the lower density "interclump" medium. photodissociation leads tooh/h2o abundance ratios (&gt;1) much higher than those expected in equally warmregions without enhanced fuv radiation fields.

1108.0604	h2co in the horsehead pdr: photo-desorption of dust grain ice mantles	aims: for the first time we investigate the role of the grain surfacechemistry in the horsehead photo-dissociation region (pdr). methods: weperformed deep observations of several h2co rotational lines toward the pdr andits associated dense-core in the horsehead nebula, where the dust is cold ($\td\simeq 20-30$ k). we complemented these observations with a map of the p-h2co$~3_{03}-2_{02}$ line at 218.2 ghz (with 12" angular resolution). we determinethe h2co abundances using a detailed radiative transfer analysis and comparethese results with pdr models that include either pure gas-phase chemistry orboth gas-phase and grain surface chemistry. results: the h2co abundances($\simeq 2-3 \times 10^{-10}$) with respect to h-nuclei are similar in the pdrand dense-core. in the dense-core the pure gas-phase chemistry model reproducesthe observed h2co abundance. thus, surface processes do not contributesignificantly to the gas-phase h2co abundance in the core. in contrast, theformation of h2co on the surface of dust grains and subsequent photo-desorptioninto the gas-phase are needed in the pdr to explain the observed gas-phase h2coabundance, because the gas-phase chemistry alone does not produce enough h2co.the assignments of different formation routes are strengthen by the differentmeasured ortho-to-para ratio of h2co: the dense-core displays the equilibriumvalue ($\sim3$) while the pdr displays an out-of-equilibrium value ($\sim2$).conclusions: photo-desorption of h2co ices is an efficient mechanism to releasea significant amount of gas-phase h2co into the horsehead pdr.

0704.3149	effects of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry of diffuse clouds	aims. we probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at theinterface between a cold neutral medium (cnm) cloudlet and the warm neutralmedium (wnm). methods. we perform moving grid, multifluid, 1d, hydrodynamicalsimulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. thediffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. results. turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the cnm and the wnm. we find that thecnm slightly expands and heats up: its ch and h$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. the change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the h$^+$ content in the cnm which results in increased oh and h$_2$o.diffusion transports some co out of the cnm. it also brings h$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of ch$^+$, h$_3^+$, oh and h$_2$o atthe interface. o lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile inthe intermediate region between the cnm and the wnm. enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy. the relative molecular yield arefound higher for bigger clouds. conclusions. turbulent diffusion can be thesource of additional molecular production and should be included in chemicalmodels of the interstellar medium (ism). it also is a good candidate for theinterpretation of observational problems such as warm h$_2$, ch$^+$ formationand presence of h$_3^+$.

1206.0403	the iram-30m line survey of the horsehead pdr: i. cf+ as a tracer of c+  and a measure of the fluorine abundance	c+ is a key species in the interstellar medium but its 158 {\mu}m finestructure line cannot be observed from ground-based telescopes. current modelsof fluorine chemistry predict that cf+ is the second most important fluorinereservoir, in regions where c+ is abundant. we detected the j = 1-0 and j = 2-1rotational lines of cf+ with high signal-to-noise ratio towards the pdr anddense core positions in the horsehead. using a rotational diagram analysis, wederive a column density of n(cf+) = (1.5 - 2.0) \times 10^12 cm^-2. because ofthe simple fluorine chemistry, the cf+ column density is proportional to thefluorine abundance. we thus infer the fluorine gas-phase abundance to be f/h =(0.6 - 1.5) \times 10^-8. photochemical models indicate that cf+ is found inthe layers where c+ is abundant. the emission arises in the uv illuminated skinof the nebula, tracing the outermost cloud layers. indeed, cf+ and c+ are theonly species observed to date in the horsehead with a double peaked lineprofile caused by kinematics. we therefore propose that cf+, which isdetectable from the ground, can be used as a proxy of the c+ layers.

1305.1119	far-infrared spectroscopy of the galactic center. hot molecular gas:  shocks versus radiation near sgra*	we present a 52-671um spectral scan toward sgra* taken with the pacs andspire spectrometers onboard herschel. the achieved angular resolution allows usto separate, for the first time at far-ir wavelengths, the emission toward thecentral cavity (gas in the inner central parsec of the galaxy) from that of thesurrounding circum-nuclear disk. the spectrum toward sgra* is dominated bystrong [oiii], [oi], [cii], [niii], [nii], and [ci] fine structure lines (indecreasing order of luminosity) arising in gas irradiated by uv-photons fromthe central stellar cluster. in addition, rotationally excited lines of 12co(from j=4-3 to 24-23), 13co, h2o, oh, h3o+, hco+ and hcn, as well asground-state absorption lines of oh+, h2o+, h3o+, ch+, h2o, oh, hf, ch and nhare detected. the excitation of the 12co ladder is consistent with a hotisothermal component at tk ~ 10^{3.1} k and n(h2)&lt; 10^4 cm^{-3}. it is alsoconsistent with a distribution of temperature components at higher density withmost co at tk&lt;300 k. the detected molecular features suggest that, at present,neither very enhanced x-ray, nor cosmic-ray fluxes play a dominant role in theheating of the hot molecular gas. the hot co component (either the bulk of theco column or just a small fraction depending on the above scenario) resultsfrom a combination of uv- and shock-driven heating. if irradiated denseclumps/clouds do not exist, shocks likely dominate the heating of the hotmolecular gas. this is consistent with the high-velocity gas detected towardsgra*.

1305.2371	the iram-30m line survey of the horsehead pdr: iii. high abundance of  complex (iso-)nitrile molecules in uv-illuminated gas	complex (iso-)nitrile molecules, such as ch3cn and hc3n, are relativelyeasily detected in our galaxy and in other galaxies. we constrain theirchemistry through observations of two positions in the horsehead edge: thephoto-dissociation region (pdr) and the dense, cold, and uv-shielded core justbehind it. we systematically searched for lines of ch3cn, hc3n, c3n, and someof their isomers in our sensitive unbiased line survey at 3, 2, and 1mm. wederived column densities and abundances through bayesian analysis using a largevelocity gradient radiative transfer model. we report the first clear detectionof ch3nc at millimeter wavelength. we detected 17 lines of ch3cn at the pdr and6 at the dense core position, and we resolved its hyperfine structure for 3lines. we detected 4 lines of hc3n, and c3n is clearly detected at the pdrposition. we computed new electron collisional rate coefficients for ch3cn, andwe found that including electron excitation reduces the derived column densityby 40% at the pdr position. while ch3cn is 30 times more abundant in the pdrthan in the dense core, hc3n has similar abundance at both positions. theisomeric ratio ch3nc/ch3cn is 0.15+-0.02. in the case of ch3cn, pure gas phasechemistry cannot reproduce the amount of ch3cn observed in the uv-illuminatedgas. we propose that ch3cn gas phase abundance is enhanced when ice mantles ofgrains are destroyed through photo-desorption or thermal-evaporation in pdrs,and through sputtering in shocks.

1309.5782	nitrogen isotopic ratios in barnard 1: a consistent study of the n2h+,  nh3, cn, hcn and hnc isotopologues	the 15n isotopologue abundance ratio measured today in different bodies ofthe solar system is thought to be connected to 15n-fractionation effects thatwould have occured in the protosolar nebula. the present study aims at puttingconstraints on the degree of 15n-fractionation that occurs during theprestellar phase, through observations of d, 13c and 15n-substitutedisotopologues towards b1b. both molecules from the nitrogen hydride family,i.e. n2h+ and nh3, and from the nitrile family, i.e. hcn, hnc and cn, areconsidered in the analysis. as a first step, we model the continuum emission inorder to derive the physical structure of the cloud, i.e. gas temperature andh2 density. these parameters are subsequently used as an input in a non-localradiative transfer model to infer the radial abundances profiles of the variousmolecules. our modeling shows that all the molecules are affected by depletiononto dust grains, in the region that encompasses the b1-bs and b1-bn cores.while high levels of deuterium fractionation are derived, we conclude that nofractionation occurs in the case of the nitrogen chemistry. independently ofthe chemical family, the molecular abundances are consistent with 14n/15n~300,a value representative of the elemental atomic abundances of the parental gas.the inefficiency of the 15n-fractionation effects in the b1b region can belinked to the relatively high gas temperature ~17k which is representative ofthe innermost part of the cloud. since this region shows signs of depletiononto dust grains, we can not exclude the possibility that the molecules werepreviously enriched in 15n, earlier in the b1b history, and that such anenrichment could have been incorporated into the ice mantles. it is thusnecessary to repeat this kind of study in colder sources to test such apossibility.

1404.0121	detection of a dense clump in a filament interacting with w51e2	in the framework of the herschel/prismas guaranteed time key program, theline of sight to the distant ultracompact hii region w51e2 has been observedusing several selected molecular species. most of the detected absorptionfeatures are not associated with the background high-mass star-forming regionand probe the diffuse matter along the line of sight. we present here thedetection of an additional narrow absorption feature at ~70 km/s in theobserved spectra of hdo, nh3 and c3. the 70 km/s feature is not uniquelyidentifiable with the dynamic components (the main cloud and the large-scaleforeground filament) so-far identified toward this region. the narrowabsorption feature is similar to the one found toward low-mass protostars,which is characteristic of the presence of a cold external envelope. thefar-infrared spectroscopic data were combined with existing ground-basedobservations of 12co, 13co, cch, cn, and c3h2 to characterize the 70 km/scomponent. using a non-lte analysis of multiple transitions of nh3 and cn, weestimated the density (n(h2) (1-5)x10^5 cm^-3) and temperature (10-30 k) forthis narrow feature. we used a gas-grain warm-up based chemical model withphysical parameters derived from the nh3 data to explain the observedabundances of the different chemical species. we propose that the 70 km/snarrow feature arises in a dense and cold clump that probably is undergoingcollapse to form a low-mass protostar, formed on the trailing side of thehigh-velocity filament, which is thought to be interacting with the w51 maincloud. while the fortuitous coincidence of the dense clump along the line ofsight with the continuum-bright w51e2 compact hii region has contributed to itsnon-detection in the continuum images, this same attribute makes it anappropriate source for absorption studies and in particular for ice studies ofstar-forming regions.

1502.05710	sulphur-bearing molecules in diffuse molecular clouds: new results from  sofia/great and the iram 30 m telescope	we have observed five sulphur-bearing molecules in foreground diffusemolecular clouds lying along the sight-lines to five bright continuum sources.we have used the great instrument on sofia to observe the 1383 ghz $^2\pi_{3/2}j=5/2-3/2$ transitions of sh towards the star-forming regions w31c,g29.96-0.02, g34.3+0.1, w49n and w51, detecting foreground absorption towardsall five sources; and the emir receivers on the iram 30m telescope at picoveleta to detect the h$_2$s 1(10)-1(01), cs j=2-1 and so 3(2)-2(1) transitions.in nine foreground absorption components detected towards these sources, theinferred column densities of the four detected molecules showed relativelyconstant ratios, with n(sh)/n(h$_2$s) in the range 1.1 - 3.0, n(cs)/n(h$_2$s)in the range 0.32 - 0.61, and n(so)/n(h$_2$s) in the range 0.08 - 0.30. theobserved sh/h$_2$ ratios - in the range (0.5-2.6) $\times 10^{-8}$ - indicatethat sh (and other sulphur-bearing molecules) account for &lt;&lt; 1% of thegas-phase sulphur nuclei. the observed abundances of sulphur-bearing molecules,however, greatly exceed those predicted by standard models of cold diffusemolecular clouds, providing further evidence for the enhancement of endothermicreaction rates by elevated temperatures or ion-neutral drift. we haveconsidered the observed abundance ratios in the context of shock and turbulentdissipation region (tdr) models. using the tdr model, we find that theturbulent energy available at large scale in the diffuse ism is sufficient toexplain the observed column densities of sh and cs. standard shock and tdrmodels, however, fail to reproduce the column densities of h$_2$s and so by afactor of about 10; more elaborate shock models - in which account is taken ofthe velocity drift, relative to h$_2$, of sh molecules produced by thedissociative recombination of h$_3$s$^+$ - reduce this discrepancy to a factor~ 3.

1503.06580	irradiated shocks in the w28 a2 massive star-forming region: a site for  cosmic rays acceleration?	the formation of massive stars play a crucial role in galaxies from numerouspoints of view. the protostar generates a strong ultraviolet radiation fieldthat ionizes its surroundings, and it drives powerful shock waves in theneighbouring medium in the form of jets and bipolar outflows, whose structurecan be partially organized by local, strong magnetic field. such an ejectionactivity locally modifies the interstellar chemistry, contributing to the cycleof matter. it also significantly participates to the energetic balance ofgalaxies. in the latter stages of massive star formation, the protostar issurrounded by an ultra-compact hii region, and irradiates its bipolar outflows,where an intrinsically strong magnetic field structure is associated to thegenerally high densities. in the hii region, or in the bipolar outflows, thequestion of in situ cosmic rays acceleration can then be raised by thesimultaneous presence of strong magnetic fields, significant ionization of thematter, and mechanical energy available in large quantities. in thiscontribution, we will only summarise the results of our study of potential insitu cosmic rays acceleration the irradiated shocks in the w28 a2 massive starforming region, based on observations from the apex, iram 30m, and herscheltelescopes, and presented in gusdorf et al., recently submitted to a&amp;a.

1506.07043	probing non polar interstellar molecules through their protonated form:  detection of protonated cyanogen (nccnh+)	cyanogen (nccn) is the simplest member of the series of dicyanopolyynes. ithas been hypothesized that this family of molecules can be importantconstituents of interstellar and circumstellar media, although the lack of apermanent electric dipole moment prevents its detection throughradioastronomical techniques. here we present the first solid evidence of thepresence of cyanogen in interstellar clouds through the detection of itsprotonated form toward the cold dark clouds tmc-1 and l483. protonated cyanogen(nccnh+) has been identified through the j=5-4 and j=10-9 rotationaltransitions using the 40m radiotelescope of yebes and the iram 30m telescope.we derive beam averaged column densities for nccnh+ of (8.6+/-4.4)e10 cm-2 intmc-1 and (3.9+/-1.8)e10 cm-2 in l483, which translate to fairly low fractionalabundances relative to h2, in the range (1-10)e-12. the chemistry of protonatedmolecules in dark clouds is discussed, and it is found that, in general terms,the abundance ratio between the protonated and non protonated forms of amolecule increases with increasing proton affinity. our chemical model predictsan abundance ratio nccnh+/nccn of 1e-4, which implies that the abundance ofcyanogen in dark clouds could be as high as (1-10)e-8 relative to h2, i.e.,comparable to that of other abundant nitriles such as hcn, hnc, and hc3n.

1510.00366	spectroscopically resolved far-ir observations of the massive  star-forming region g5.89--0.39	the fine-structure line of [oi] at 63micron is an important diagnostic toolin different fields of astrophysics. however, our knowledge of this line relieson observations with low spectral resolution, and the real contribution of eachcomponent (pdr, jet) in complex environment of star-forming regions (sfrs) ispoorly understood. we investigate the contribution of jet and pdr emission, andof absorption to the [oi]63micron line towards the ultra-compact h{\sc ii}region g5.89--0.39 and study its far-ir line luminosity in different velocityregimes through [oi], [cii], co, oh, and h2o. we mapped g5.89--0.39 in [oi] andin co(16--15) with the great receiver onboard sofia. we observed the centralposition of the source in the oh^2\pi_{3/2}, j=5/2\toj=3/2 and ^2\pi_{1/2},j=3/2\toj=1/2 lines. these data were complemented with apex co(6-5) and co(7-6)and hifi maps and single-pointing observations in [cii], h2o, and hf. the [oi]spectra in g5.89--0.39 are severely contaminated by absorptions from theenvelope and from different clouds along the line of sight. emission isdetected only at hv, clearly associated with the compact north-south outflowstraced by extremely hv low-j co. the mass-loss rate and energetics of derivedfrom [oi] agree well with estimates from co, suggesting that the molecularoutflows in g5.89--0.39 are driven by the jet system seen in [oi]. the far-irline luminosity of g5.89--0.39 is dominated by [oi] at hv; the second coolantin this velocity regime is co, while [cii], oh and h2o are minor contributorsto the cooling in the outflow. our study shows the importance ofspectroscopically resolved data of [oi]63micron for using this line asdiagnostic of sfrs. while this was not possible until now, the great receiveronboard sofia has recently opened the possibility of detailed studies of thisline to investigate its potential for probing different environments.

1510.06620	herschel hifi observations of the sgr a +50 km/s cloud. deep searches  for o2 in emission and foreground absorption	to date o2 has definitely been detected in only two sources, namely rho oph aand orion, reflecting the extremely low abundance of o2 in the interstellarmedium. one of the sources in the hop program is the +50 km/s cloud in the sgra complex in the centre of the milky way. the herschel hifi is used to searchfor the 487 and 774 ghz emission lines of o2. no o2 emission is detectedtowards the sgr a +50 km/s cloud, but a number of strong emission lines ofmethanol (ch3oh) and absorption lines of chloronium (h2cl+) are observed. a 3sigma upper limit for the fractional abundance ratio of (o2)/(h2) in the sgr a+50 km/s cloud is found to be x(o2) less than 5 x 10(-8). however, since we canfind no other realistic molecular candidate than o2 itself, we very tentativelysuggest that two weak absorption lines at 487.261 and 487.302 ghz may be causedby the 487 ghz line of o2 in two foreground spiral arm clouds. by consideringthat the absorption may only be apparent, the estimated upper limit to the o2abundance of less than (10-20) x 10(-6) in these foreground clouds is veryhigh. this abundance limit was determined also using odin non-detection limits.if the absorption is due to a differential herschel off-on emission, the o2fractional abundance may be of the order of (5-10) x 10(-6). with theassumption of pure absorption by foreground clouds, the unreasonably highabundance of (1.4-2.8) x 10(-4) was obtained. the rotation temperatures forch3oh-a and ch3oh-e lines in the +50 km/s cloud are found to be 64 and 79 k,respectively, and the fractional abundance of ch3oh is approximately 5 x10(-7).

astro-ph;0504445	interstellar deuterated ammonia: from nh3 to nd3	we use spectra and maps of nh2d, nd2h, and nd3, obtained with the cso, iram30m and arecibo telescopes, to study deuteration processes in dense cores. thedata include the first detection of the hyperfine structure of nd2h. theemission of nd2h and nd3 does not seem to peak at the positions of the embeddedprotostars, but instead at offset positions, where outflow interactions mayoccur. a constant ammonia fractionation ratio in star-forming regions isgenerally assumed to be consistent with an origin on dust grains. however, inthe pre-stellar cores studied here, the fractionation varies significantly whengoing from nh3 to nd3. we present a steady state model of the gas-phasechemistry for these sources, which includes passive depletion onto dust grainsand multiply saturated deuterated species up to five deuterium atoms (e.g.cd5+). the observed column density ratios of all four ammonia isotopologues arereproduced within a factor of 3 for a gas temperature of 10 k. we also predictthat deuterium fractionation remains significant at temperatures up to 20 k. ndand nhd, which have rotational transitions in the submillimeter domain arepredicted to be abundant.

astro-ph;0505627	photon dominated regions in the spiral arms of m83 and m51	we present ci 3p1-3p0 spectra at four spiral arm positions and the nuclei ofthe nearby galaxies m83 and m51 obtained at the jcmt. this data is complementedwith maps of co 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2, and iso/lws far-infrared data of cii (158micron), oi (63 micron), and nii (122 micron) allowing for the investigation ofa complete set of all major gas cooling lines. from the intensity of the niiline, we estimate that between 15% and 30% of the observed cii emissionoriginate from the dense ionized phase of the ism. the analysis indicates thatemission from the diffuse ionized medium is negligible. in combination with thefir dust continuum, we find gas heating efficiencies below ~0.21% in thenuclei, and between 0.25 and 0.36% at the outer positions. comparison withmodels of photon-dominated regions (pdrs) of kaufman et al. (1999) with thestandard ratios oi(63)/cii_pdr and (oi(63)+cii_pdr) vs. tir, the total infraredintensity, yields two solutions. the physically most plausible solutionexhibits slightly lower densities and higher fuv fields than found when using afull set of line ratios, cii_pdr/ci(1-0), ci(1-0)/co(3-2), co(3-2)/co(1-0),cii/co(3-2), and, oi(63)/cii_pdr. the best fits to the latter ratios yielddensities of 10^4 cm^-3 and fuv fields of ~g_0=20-30 times the averageinterstellar field without much variation. at the outer positions, the observedtotal infrared intensities are in perfect agreement with the derived bestfitting fuv intensities. the ratio of the two intensities lies at 4-5 at thenuclei, indicating the presence of other mechanisms heating the dust.

astro-ph;0602509	detection of co+ in the nucleus of m82	we present the detection of the reactive ion co+ towards the prototypicalstarburst galaxy m82. this is the first secure detection of this short-livedion in an external galaxy. values of [co+]/[hco+]&gt;0.04 are measured across theinner 650pc of the nuclear disk of m82. such high values of the [co+]/[hco+]ratio had only been previously measured towards the atomic peak in thereflection nebula ngc7023. this detection corroborates that the molecular gasreservoir in the m82 disk is heavily affected by the uv radiation from therecently formed stars. comparing the column densities measured in m82 withthose found in prototypical galactic photon-dominated regions (pdrs), we need\~20 clouds along the line of sight to explain our observations. we havecompleted our model of the molecular gas chemistry in the m82 nucleus. our pdrchemical model successfully explains the [co+]/[hco+] ratios measured in them~82 nucleus but fails by one order of magnitude to explain the large measuredco+ column densities (~1--4x10^{13} cm^{-2}). we explore possible routes toreconcile the chemical model and the observations.

astro-ph;0605716	low sulfur depletion in the horsehead pdr	we present 3.65''x3.34'' angular-resolution iram pdbi observations of the csj=2-1 line toward the horsehead photodissociation region (pdr), complementedwith iram-30m single-dish observations of several rotational lines of cs, c34sand hcs+. we analyse the cs and hcs+ photochemistry, excitation and radiativetransfer to obtain their abundances and the physical conditions prevailing inthe cloud edge. since the cs abundance scales to that of sulfur, we determinethe gas phase sulfur abundance in the pdr, an interesting intermediate mediumbetween translucent clouds (where sulfur remains in the gas phase) and darkclouds (where large depletions have been invoked). a nonlocal non-lte radiativetransfer code including dust and cosmic background illumination adapted to thehorsehead geometry has been developed to carefuly analyse the cs, c34s, hcs+and c18o rotational line emission. we use this model to consistently link theline observations with photochemical models to determine the cs/hcs+/s/s+structure of the pdr. the combination of cs, c34s and hcs+ observationstogether with the inclusion of the most recent cs collisional and chemicalrates in our models implies that sulfur depletion invoked to account for cs andhcs+ abundances is much smaller than in previous studies.

astro-ph;0611340	a survey of submillimeter c and co lines in nearby galaxies	the submillimeter co lines are formed in warm and dense molecular gas and aretherefore sensitive to the physical conditions whereas the co (j=1-0) line is atracer of the total molecular gas mass. in order to be able to compare theproperties of molecular gas in nearby and distant galaxies, we have observed cand co submillimeter lines (including the 12co(6-5) and 12co(7-6) lines) in asample of nearby galaxies using the cso. we have obtained a complete view ofthe co cooling curve (also called co spectral energy distribution) by combiningthe submillimeter cso data with previous observations found in the literature.we made use of large velocity gradient (lvg) models to analyse the observed cocooling curve, predict co line intensities from j=1-0 to j=15-14 in the studiedgalaxies, and derive the physical properties of the warm and dense moleculargas : the kinetic temperature (tk); the gas density (n(h2)); then(12co)/$\delta v$. the predictions for the line intensities and for the totalco cooling power, obtained from lvg modelling have been compared withpredictions from photo dissociation regions (pdr) models. we show how the cosed varies according to the galaxy star forming activity. for active nuclei,the peak is located near the 12co(6-5) or 12co(7-6) rotational lines, while,for normal nuclei, most of the energy is carried by the 12co(4-3) and 12co(5-4)lines. whatever the spectral type of the nucleus, the observed c cooling rateis lower than the observed co cooling rate (by a factor of around 4). the cocooling curve of nearby starburst galaxies (e.g. ngc 253) has a quite similarshape to the co cooling curve of distant galaxies. therefore, the co coolingcurves are useful diagnostics for the star forming activity in distant objects.

astro-ph;0702474	molecular oxygen in the rho ophiuchi cloud	molecular oxygen, o2 has been expected historically to be an abundantcomponent of the chemical species in molecular clouds and, as such, animportant coolant of the dense interstellar medium. however, a number ofattempts from both ground and from space have failed to detect o2 emission. thework described here uses heterodyne spectroscopy from space to search formolecular oxygen in the interstellar medium. the odin satellite carries a 1.1 msub-millimeter dish and a dedicated 119 ghz receiver for the ground state lineof o2. starting in 2002, the star forming molecular cloud core rho oph a wasobserved with odin for 34 days during several observing runs. we detect aspectral line at v(lsr) = 3.5 km/s with dv(fwhm) = 1.5 km/s, parameters whichare also common to other species associated with rho ohp a. this feature isidentified as the o2 (n_j = 1_1 - 1_0) transition at 118 750.343 mhz. theabundance of molecular oxygen, relative to h2,, is 5e-8 averaged over the odinbeam. this abundance is consistently lower than previously reported upperlimits.

astro-ph;0703393	sulfur chemistry in the horsehead. an interferometric view of the  horsehead pdr	sulfur is an abundant element which remains undepleted in diffuseinterstellar gas (av&lt;1) but it is traditionally assumed to deplete on dustgrains at higher densities and larger av. photodissociation regions (pdrs) arean interesting intermediate medium between translucent and dark clouds wherethe chemistry and energetics are dominated by the illuminating fuv radiationfield. thus they can provide new insights about the sulfur depletion problem.however, physical and chemical gradients in pdrs take place at small angularscales (~1 to 10''). aperture synthesis observations are therefore required toresolve such gradients. besides, a complete understanding of molecularexcitation is needed to correctly determine molecular abundances but also thepreavailing physical conditions. hence, multi-j observations at increasingfrequencies are also required. such high angular resolution and broad frequencycoverage observations will be provided by alma in the near future. in this workwe present iram-pdbi observations of the cs j=2-1 line toward the horsehead pdrcomplemented with iram-30m observations of several rotational lines ofdifferent sulfur bearing molecules (cs, hcs+, so, h2s, etc.). photochemical andnonlocal, non-lte radiative transfer models adapted to the horsehead geometryhave been developed. the gas phase sulfur abundance has been inferred in thepdr.

astro-ph;0703632	upper limits to the water abundance in starburst galaxies	we have searched for emission from the 557 ghz ortho-water line in theinterstellar medium of six nearby starburst galaxies. we used the odinsatellite to observe the 1_10-1_01 transition of o-h2o in the galaxies ngc253,ic342, m82, ngc4258, cena, and m51. none of the galaxies in our sample wasdetected. we derive three sigma upper limits to the h2o abundance relative toh2 ranging from 2e-9 to 1e-8. the best of these upper limits are comparable tothe measured abundance of h$_2$o in the galactic star forming region w3.however, if only 10% of the molecular gas is in very dense cores, then thewater abundance limits in the cores themselves would be larger by a factor of10 i.e. 2e-8 to 1e-7. these observations suggest that detections of h2oemission in galaxies with the upcoming herschel space observatory are likely torequire on-source integration times of an hour or more except in the verybrightest extragalactic targets such as m82 and ngc253.

astro-ph;9708175	redshifted molecular absorption systems towards pks1830-211 and  b0218+357: submillimeter co, ci and h2o data	we have detected the j=4-3 rotational transition of 12co in absorption atz=0.89 towards the quasar pks1830-211, but not the 12co 5-4 or the 3p1-3p0 finestructure line of neutral carbon. the intervening molecular medium thus has atotal 12co column density of n(co)~2x10^18 cm^-2, which corresponds to thelarge column density of molecular hydrogen of n(h2)=2.5x10^22 cm^-2 and areddening of av=25 magnitudes. the 12co excitation temperature is low, below 15k. comparison with the molecular absorption results of wiklind and combes(1996) shows that the absorbing material has similar molecular abundances togalactic dark clouds. we find an upper limit for atomic carbon of n(ci)&lt;10^18cm^-2, which again would be the case for most galactic dark clouds.  we also report new observations of the absorbing system towards b0218+357 atz=0.68. we have tentatively detected the 13co 4-3 line, but for h2o, although afeature is seen at the correct velocity, due to the inadequate signal to noiseratio we report only an upper limit for the fundamental line of ortho watervapor. the tentative detection of the 13co j=4-3 line implies that the 13coexcitation temperature is lower than 20k and the column density is fairlylarge, n(13co)~10^17 cm^-2, giving rise to saturated absorption in the j=2-1transition. the total column density of molecular gas is again large in thissource, n(h2)&gt;2x10^22 cm^-2, corresponding to a reddening &gt;20 magnitudes.

astro-ph;9806214	fir and c+ emissions of spiral galaxies disks, the example of ngc 6946	we present numerical simulations of radiative transfer in the spiral galaxyngc 6946. the interstellar medium is represented as a two phases medium, withmolecular clouds and a smooth diffuse phase. the molecular gas distribution iscalculated from the distribution of an ensemble of molecular clouds evolving inthe gravitational potential of ngc 6946. we simulate star formation by creatingob associations in molecular clouds. the transfer of uv radiation is calculatedin the clumpy interstellar medium, to determine the local uv illumination ofmolecular clouds. we compute the emergent intensity in the uv continuum, in thehalpha and c+ lines as well as in the continuum at far infrared wavelengths,60, 100 &amp; 200 microns. it is possible to obtain a consistent picture of thisgalaxy with a global star formation rate of 4 mo/yr occuring mostly in thespiral arms. the uv opacity of the model spiral galaxy disk, observed face-on,is 0.8 at 100 nm.  for radii less than 4 kpc, the c+ line is mostly produced inphotodissociation regions at the surfaces of molecular clouds. the c+ emissionfrom diffuse atomic gas accounts for about 20% of the total. it becomessignificant at large distance from the nucleus (r &gt; 4 kpc). molecular cloudsand diffuse atomic gas have almost equal contributions to the total farinfrared emission from 60 to 200 microns. as a whole, 72% of the 60 - 200microns fir emission can be attributed to dust grains heated by the uvradiation of massive stars and 28% by the radiation field of the old stellarpopulation.

0810.0832	on the chemistry and distribution of hoc+ in m82: more evidence for  extensive pdrs	the molecular gas composition in the inner 1 kpc disk of the starburst galaxym82 resembles that of galactic photon dominated regions (pdrs). in particular,large abundances of the reactive ions hoc+ and co+ have been measured in thenucleus of this galaxy. to investigate the origin of the large abundances ofreactive ions in m82, we have completed our previous 30m hoc+ j=1-0observations with the higher excitation hco+ and hoc+ j=4-3 and 3-2 rotationallines. in addition, we have obtained with the iram plateau de bureinterferometer (pdbi) a 4" resolution map of the hoc+ 1-0 emission, the firstever obtained in a galactic or extragalactic source. our hoc+ interferometricimage shows that the emission of the hoc+ 1-0 line is mainly restricted to thenuclear disk, with the maxima towards the e. and w. molecular peaks. inaddition, line excitation calculations imply that the hoc+ emission arises indense gas. therefore, the hoc+ emission is arising in the dense pdrs embeddedin the m82 nuclear disk, rather than in the intercloud phase and/or wind. wehave improved our previous chemical model of m82 by (i) using the new versionof the meudon pdr code, (ii) updating the chemical network, and (iii)considering two different types of clouds (with different thickness). mostmolecular observations (hco+, hoc+, co+, cn, hcn, h3o+) are well explainedassuming that ~ 87 % of the mass of the molecular gas is forming small clouds(av=5 mag) while only ~ 13 % of the mass is in large molecular clouds (av=50mag). such small number of large molecular clouds suggests that m82 is an oldstarburst, where star formation has almost exhausted the molecular gasreservoir.
