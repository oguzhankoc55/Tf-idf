0902.0337	stability and delay of zero-forcing sdma with limited feedback	this paper addresses the stability and queueing delay of space divisionmultiple access (sdma) systems with bursty traffic, where zero-forcingbeamforming enables simultaneous transmission to multiple mobiles. computingbeamforming vectors relies on quantized channel state information (csi)feedback (limited feedback) from mobiles. define the stability region for sdmaas the set of multiuser packet-arrival rates for which the steady-state queuelengths are finite. given perfect csi feedback and equal power allocation overscheduled queues, the stability region is proved to be a convex polytope havingthe derived vertices. for any set of arrival rates in the stability region,multiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by a joint queue-and-beamformingcontrol policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths.the stability region for limited feedback is found to be the perfect-csi regionmultiplied by one minus a small factor. the required number of feedback bitsper mobile is proved to scale logarithmically with the inverse of the abovefactor as well as linearly with the number of transmit antennas minus one. theeffects of limited feedback on queueing delay are also quantified. for poissonarrival processes, csi quantization errors are shown to multiply averagequeueing delay by a factor larger than one. this factor can be controlled byadjusting the number of feedback bits per mobile following the derivedrelationship. for general arrival processes, csi errors are found to increasekingman's bound on the tail probability of the instantaneous delay by one plusa small factor. the required number of feedback bits per mobile is shown toscale logarithmically with this factor.

0905.4700	cross-layer design of fdd-ofdm systems based on ack/nak feedbacks	it is well-known that cross-layer scheduling which adapts power, rate anduser allocation can achieve significant gain on system capacity. however,conventional cross-layer designs all require channel state information at thebase station (csit) which is difficult to obtain in practice. in this paper, wefocus on cross-layer resource optimization based on ack/nak feedback flows inofdm systems without explicit csit. while the problem can be modeled as markovdecision process (mdp), brute force approach by policy iteration or valueiteration cannot lead to any viable solution. thus, we derive a simpleclosed-form solution for the mdp cross-layer problem, which is asymptoticallyoptimal for sufficiently small target packet error rate (per). the proposedsolution also has low complexity and is suitable for realtime implementation.it is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systemsthat do not utilize the ack/nak feedbacks for cross-layer designs orcross-layer systems that utilize very unreliable csit for adaptation withmismatch in csit error statistics. asymptotic analysis is also provided toobtain useful design insights.

0908.2529	a low-overhead energy detection based cooperative sensing protocol for  cognitive radio systems	cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access represent a new paradigm shift inmore effective use of limited radio spectrum. one core component behind dynamicspectrum access is the sensing of primary user activity in the shared spectrum.conventional distributed sensing and centralized decision framework involvingmultiple sensor nodes is proposed to enhance the sensing performance. however,it is difficult to apply the conventional schemes in reality since the overheadin sensing measurement and sensing reporting as well as in sensing reportcombining limit the number of sensor nodes that can participate in distributivesensing. in this paper, we shall propose a novel, low overhead and lowcomplexity energy detection based cooperative sensing framework for thecognitive radio systems which addresses the above two issues. the energydetection based cooperative sensing scheme greatly reduces the quiet periodoverhead (for sensing measurement) as well as sensing reporting overhead of thesecondary systems and the power scheduling algorithm dynamically allocate thetransmission power of the cooperative sensor nodes based on the channelstatistics of the links to the bs as well as the quality of the sensingmeasurement. in order to obtain design insights, we also derive the asymptoticsensing performance of the proposed cooperative sensing framework based on themobility model. we show that the false alarm and mis-detection performance ofthe proposed cooperative sensing framework improve as we increase the number ofcooperative sensor nodes.

0909.4983	event-driven optimal feedback control for multi-antenna beamforming	transmit beamforming is a simple multi-antenna technique for increasingthroughput and the transmission range of a wireless communication system. therequired feedback of channel state information (csi) can potentially result inexcessive overhead especially for high mobility or many antennas. this workconcerns efficient feedback for transmit beamforming and establishes a newapproach of controlling feedback for maximizing net throughput, defined asthroughput minus average feedback cost. the feedback controller using astationary policy turns csi feedback on/off according to the system state thatcomprises the channel state and transmit beamformer. assuming channel isotropyand markovity, the controller's state reduces to two scalars. this allows theoptimal control policy to be efficiently computed using dynamic programming.consider the perfect feedback channel free of error, where each feedbackinstant pays a fixed price. the corresponding optimal feedback control policyis proved to be of the threshold type. this result holds regardless of whetherthe controller's state space is discretized or continuous. under thethreshold-type policy, feedback is performed whenever a state variableindicating the accuracy of transmit csi is below a threshold, which varies withchannel power. the practical finite-rate feedback channel is also considered.the optimal policy for quantized feedback is proved to be also of the thresholdtype. the effect of csi quantization is shown to be equivalent to an incrementon the feedback price. moreover, the increment is upper bounded by the expectedlogarithm of one minus the quantization error. finally, simulation shows thatfeedback control increases net throughput of the conventional periodic feedbackby up to 0.5 bit/s/hz without requiring additional bandwidth or antennas.

1105.5476	feedback-topology designs for interference alignment in mimo  interference channels	interference alignment (ia) is a joint-transmission technique that achievesthe capacity of the interference channel for high signal-to-noise ratios(snrs). most prior work on ia is based on the impractical assumption thatperfect and global channel-state information(csi) is available at alltransmitters. to implement ia, each receiver has to feed back csi to allinterferers, resulting in overwhelming feedback overhead. in particular, thesum feedback rate of each receiver scales quadratically with the number ofusers even if the quantized csi is fed back. to substantially suppress feedbackoverhead, this paper focuses on designing efficient arrangements of feedbacklinks, called feedback topologies, under the ia constraint. for themultiple-input-multiple-output (mimo) k-user interference channel, we proposethe feedback topology that supports sequential csi exchange (feedback andfeedforward) between transmitters and receivers so as to achieve iaprogressively. this feedback topology is shown to reduce the network feedbackoverhead from a cubic function of k to a linear one. to reduce the delay in thesequential csi exchange, an alternative feedback topology is designed forsupporting two-hop feedback via a control station, which also achieves thelinear feedback scaling with k. next, given the proposed feedback topologies,the feedback-bit allocation algorithm is designed for allocating feedback bitsby each receiver to different feedback links so as to regulate the residualinterference caused by the finite-rate feedback. simulation results demonstratethat the proposed bit allocation leads to significant throughput gainsespecially in strong interference environments.
