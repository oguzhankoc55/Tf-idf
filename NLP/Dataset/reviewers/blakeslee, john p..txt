0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

0902.1177	effects of alpha-element enhancement and the thermally  pulsing-asymptotic giant branch on surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes  and broadband colors	we investigate the effects of alpha-element enhancement and the thermallypulsing-asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stars on the surface brightnessfluctuation (sbf) magnitudes and broadband colors of simple stellar populationsand compare to the empirical calibrations. we consider a broad range of agesand metallicities using the recently updated teramo basti isochrones. we findthat the alpha-element enhanced i-band sbf magnitudes are about 0.35 magbrighter and their integrated v - i colors are about 0.02 mag redder, mostlybecause of oxygen enhancement effects on the upper red giant branch andasymptotic giant branch. we also demonstrate, using both the teramo basti andpadova isochrones, the acute sensitivity of sbf magnitudes to the presence oftp-agb stars, particularly in the near-ir, but in the i-band as well. empiricalsbf trends therefore hold great promise for constraining this important butstill highly uncertain stage of stellar evolution. in a similar vein,non-negligible disparities are found among several different models availablein the literature due to intrinsic model uncertainties.

0706.4467	surface brightness fluctuations from archival acs images: a stellar  population and distance study	we derive surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) and integrated magnitudes inthe v- and i-bands using advanced camera for surveys (acs) archival data. thesample includes 14 galaxies covering a wide range of physical properties:morphology, total absolute magnitude, integrated color. we take advantage ofthe latter characteristic of the sample to check existing empiricalcalibrations of absolute sbf magnitudes both in the i- and v-passbands.additionally, by comparing our sbf and color data with the teramo-spot simplestellar population models, and other recent sets of population synthesismodels, we discuss the feasibility of stellar population studies based onfluctuation magnitudes analysis. the main result of this study is thatmultiband optical sbf data and integrated colors can be used to significantlyconstrain the chemical composition of the dominant stellar system in thegalaxy, but not the age in the case of systems older than 3 gyr.  sbf color gradients are also detected and analyzed. these sbf gradient data,together with other available data, point to the existence of mass dependentmetallicity gradients in galaxies, with the more massive objects showing anon--negligible sbf versus color gradient. the comparison with models suggeststhat such gradients imply more metal rich stellar populations in the galaxies'inner regions with respect to the outer ones.

0907.2524	the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor globular clusters in m87:  confirmation from deep hst/acs imaging	metal-poor globular clusters (gcs) are our local link to the earliest epochsof star formation and galaxy building. studies of extragalactic gc systemsusing deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope tothe color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs in a number of galaxies. wepresent a study of the m87 gc system using deep, archival hst/acs imaging withthe f606w and f814w filters, in which we find a significant color-magnituderelation for the metal-poor gcs. the slope of this relation in the i vs. v-icolor-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_i=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistentwith expectations based on previously published results using data from the acsvirgo cluster survey. the relation is driven by the most luminous gcs, thosewith $m_i&lt;-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor gcsbrighter than $m_i=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fittedgaussian mean for the luminosity function (lf) of blue, metal-poor gcs (~0.8mag fainter than the mean for all gcs). these results indicate that there is amass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenariowhere self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. we show thatpreviously measured half-light radii of m87 gcs from best-fit psf-convolvedking models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study,and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor gcs is realand cannot be an artifact of the photometry. we fit gaussian and evolvedschechter functions to the luminosity distribution of gcs across all colors, aswell as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue gcshave a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red gcs.finally, we present a catalog of astrometry and photometry for 2250 m87 gcs.

1001.0979	the mass-metallicity relation of globular clusters in the context of  nonlinear color-metallicty relations	two recent empirical developments in the study of extragalactic globularcluster (gc) populations are the color-magnitude relation of the blue gcs (the"blue tilt") and the nonlinearity of the dependence of optical gc colors onmetallicity. the color-magnitude relation, interpreted as a mass-metallicityrelation, is thought to be a consequence of self-enrichment. nonlinearcolor-metallicity relations have been shown to produce bimodal colordistributions from unimodal metallicity distributions. we simulate gcpopulations including both a mass-metallicity scaling relation and nonlinearcolor-metallicity relations motivated by theory and observations. depending onthe assumed range of metallicities and the width of the gc luminosity function(gclf), we find that the simulated populations can have bimodal colordistributions with a "blue tilt" similar to observations, even though themetallicity distribution appears unimodal. the models that produce thesefeatures have the relatively high mean gc metallicities and nearly equal blueand red peaks characteristic of giant elliptical galaxies. the blue tilt isless apparent in the models with metallicities typical of dwarf ellipticals;the narrower gclf in these galaxies has an even bigger effect in reducing thesignificance of their color-magnitude slopes. we critically examine theevidence for nonlinearity versus bimodal metallicities as explanations for thecharacteristic double-peaked color histograms of giant ellipticals and concludethat the question remains open. we discuss the prospects for furthertheoretical and observational progress in constraining the models presentedhere and for uncovering the true metallicity distributions of extragalacticglobular cluster systems.

1003.3450	the acs fornax cluster survey vii. half-light radii of globular clusters  in early-type galaxies	we measure the half-light radii of globular clusters (gcs) in 43 galaxiesfrom the acs fornax cluster survey (acsfcs). we use these data to extendprevious work in which the environmental dependencies of the half-light radiiof gcs in early type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs) werestudied, and a corrected mean half-light radius (corrected for the observedenvironmental trends) was suggested as a reliable distance indicator. this workboth increases the sample size for the study of the environmental dependencies,and adds leverage to the study of the corrected half-light radius as a possibledistance indicator (since fornax lies at a larger distance than the virgocluster). we study the environmental dependencies of the size of gcs using botha principal component analysis as well as 2d scaling relations. we largelyconfirm the environmental dependencies shown in jordan et al. (2005), but findevidence that there is a residual correlation in the mean half-light radius ofgc systems with galaxy magnitude, and subtle differences in the othercorrelations - so there may not be a universal correction for the half-lightradii of lower luminosity galaxy gc systems. the main factor determining thesize of a gc in an early type galaxy is the gc color. red gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; =2.8+/-0.3 pc, while blue gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; = 3.4+/-0.3 pc. we show that for brightearly-type galaxies (m_b &lt; -19 mag), the uncorrected mean half-light radius ofthe gc system is by itself an excellent distance indicator (with error ~11%),having the potential to reach cosmologically interesting distances in the eraof high angular resolution adaptive optics on large optical telescopes.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

1009.3023	ultra-compact dwarfs in the core of the coma cluster	we have discovered both a red and a blue subpopulation of ultra-compact dwarf(ucd) galaxy candidates in the coma galaxy cluster. we analyzed deep f475w(sloan g) and f814w (i) hubble space telescope images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys wide field channel as part of the coma clustertreasury survey and have fitted the light profiles of ~5000 point-like sourcesin the vicinity of ngc 4874, one of the two central dominant galaxies of thecoma cluster. although almost all of these sources are globular clusters thatremain unresolved, we found that 52 objects have effective radii between ~10and 66 pc, in the range spanned by dwarf globular transition objects (dgto) anducds. of these 52 compact objects, 25 are brighter than m_v ~-11 mag, amagnitude conventionally thought to separate ucds and globular clusters. theucd/dgto candidates have the same color and luminosity distribution as the mostluminous globular clusters within the red and blue subpopulations of theimmensely rich ngc 4874 globular cluster system. unlike standard globularclusters, blue and red ucd/dgto subpopulations have the same median effectiveradius. the spatial distribution of ucd/dgto candidates reveal that theycongregate towards ngc 4874, and are not uniformly distributed. we find arelative deficit of ucd/dgtos compared with globular clusters in the inner 15kpc around ngc 4874, however at larger radii ucd/dgto and globular clustersfollow the same spatial distribution.

1009.3270	surface brightness fluctuations in the hubble space telescope acs/wfc  f814w bandpass and an update on galaxy distances	we measure surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes in the f814wfilter and g-i colors for nine bright early-type fornax cluster galaxies imagedwith the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs). the goal isto achieve the first systematic sbf calibration for the acs/f814w bandpass.because of its much higher throughput, f814w is more efficient for sbf studiesof distant galaxies than the acs/f850lp bandpass that has been used to studynearby systems. over the color range spanned by the sample galaxies,1.06&lt;g-i&lt;1.32 (ab mag), the dependence of sbf magnitude mbar_i on g-i is linearto a good approximation, with slope $\sim2$. when the f850lp sbf distancemeasurements from the acs fornax cluster survey are used to derive absolutembar_i magnitudes, the dependence on g-i becomes extremely tight, with a slopeof $1.8\pm0.2$ and scatter of 0.03 mag. the small observed scatter indicatesboth that the estimated random errors are correct, and that the intrinsicdeviations from the sbf-color relation are strongly correlated between thef814w and f850lp bandpasses, as expected. the agreement with predictions fromstellar population models is good, both in slope and zero point, indicatingthat our mean fornax distance of 20 mpc is accurate. the models predictcurvature in the relation beyond the color limits of our sample; thus, thelinear calibration should not be extrapolated naively. in the appendices, wereconsider the tonry ground-based and jensen nicmos sbf distance catalogues; weprovide a correction formula to ameliorate the small apparent bias in theformer, and the offset needed to make the latter consistent with other sbfstudies. we also tabulate two new sbf distances to galaxies observed in the acsvirgo cluster survey.

1012.0306	the acs fornax cluster survey. iv. deprojection of the surface  brightness profiles of early-type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters:  investigating the "core/power-law dichotomy"	although early observations with the hubble space telescope (hst) pointed toa sharp dichotomy among early-type galaxies in terms of the logarithmic slopegamma' of their central surface brightness profiles, several studies in thepast few years have called this finding into question. in particular, recentimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the virgo and fornaxclusters using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board hst have notfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from centralluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of thebest-fitting global sersic model. given that earlier studies also found thatthe dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity densityprofiles of the acs virgo and fornax cluster survey galaxies. having fitted thesurface brightness profiles with modified sersic models, we then deproject thegalaxies using an abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3d of theresulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effectiveradius r_e. we find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuousvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.we introduce a parameter, delta_3d, that measures the central deviation of thedeprojected luminosity profiles from the global sersic fit, showing that thisparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

1012.2634	the acs fornax cluster survey. x. color gradients of globular cluster  systems in early-type galaxies	we use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (gcs), drawn fromthe acsvcs and acsfcs, to investigate the color gradients of gc systems in 76early-type galaxies. we find that most gc systems possess an obvious negativegradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). for gc systems displaying colorbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor gc subpopulations present shallowerbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these twosubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. the fov of acs mainly restrictsus to measuring the inner gradients of gc systems. these gradients, however,can introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of gcsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. inferred correctionsto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the meancolor of metal-poor gcs and their host galaxy luminosity. the gc colorgradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens areweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarfgalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar massof m_stellar~10^10m_sun. we also measure color gradients for field stars in thehost galaxies. we find that gc color gradients are systematically steeper thanfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is thesame for both. if gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse andweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner gcsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidlywith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. the lack ofstrong gradients in the gc systems of dwarfs, which probably have notexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos wereinefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of gc formation.

0709.1073	on the metallicity-color relations and bimodal color distributions in  extragalactic globular cluster systems	we perform a series of numerical experiments to study how the nonlinearmetallicity--color relations predicted by different stellar population modelsaffect the color distributions observed in extragalactic globular clustersystems. % we present simulations in the $ubvrijhk$ bandpasses based on fivedifferent sets of simple stellar population (ssp) models. the presence ofphotometric scatter in the colors is included as well. % we find that unimodalmetallicity distributions frequently ``project'' into bimodal colordistributions. the likelihood of this effect depends on both the mean anddispersion of the metallicity distribution, as well as of course on the sspmodel used for the transformation. % adopting the teramo-spot ssp models forreference, we find that optical--to--near-ir colors should be favored withrespect to other colors to avoid the bias effect in globular cluster colordistributions discussed by \citet{yoon06}. in particular, colors such as \vh\or \vk are more robust against nonlinearity of the metallicity--color relation,and an observed bimodal distribution in such colors is more likely to indicatea true underlying bimodal metallicity distribution. similar conclusions comefrom the simulations based on different ssp models, although we also identifyexceptions to this result.

1101.5399	the globular cluster systems of abell 1185	we examine the properties of a previously discovered population of globularclusters in the heart of the rich galaxy cluster abell 1185 that might beintergalactic in nature. deep images obtained with the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) aboard hubble space telescope (hst) confirm the presence of ~1300 globular clusters brighter than i_{f814w} = 27.3 mag in a field devoid ofany large galaxies. the luminosities and colors of these objects are found tobe similar to those of metal-poor globular clusters observed in many galaxiesto date. although a significant fraction of the detected globular clustersundoubtedly reside in the outer halos of galaxies adjacent to this field,detailed modeling of their distribution suggests that the majority of theseobjects are likely to be intergalactic, in the sense that they are notgravitationally bound to any individual galaxy. we conclude that the truenature and origin of the globular cluster population in the core of a1185 --galactic residents or intergalactic wanderers -- remains uncertain, and suggesthow future observation could resolve this ambiguity.

0710.0893	a galaxy in transition: structure, globular clusters, and distance of  the star-forming s0 galaxy ngc 1533 in dorado	we use two-band imaging data from the advanced camera for surveys on boardthe hubble space telescope for a detailed study of ngc1533, an sb0 galaxy inthe dorado group surrounded by a ring of hi. ngc1533 appears to be completing atransition from late to early type: it is red, but not quite dead. faint spiralstructure becomes visible following galaxy subtraction, and luminous blue starscan be seen in isolated areas of the disk. dust is visible in the color map inthe region around the bar, and there is a linear color gradient throughout thedisk. we determine an accurate distance from the surface brightnessfluctuations (sbf) method, finding m-m = 31.44\pm0.12 mag, or d = 19.4\pm1.1mpc. we then study the globular cluster (gc) colors, sizes, and luminosityfunction (gclf). estimates of the distance from the median of the gc half-lightradii and from the peak of the gclf both agree well with the sbf distance. thegc specific frequency is s_n=1.3\pm0.2, typical for an early-type disk galaxy.the color distribution is bimodal, as commonly observed for bright galaxies.there is a suggestion of the redder gcs having smaller sizes, but the trend isnot significant. the sizes do increase significantly with galactocentricradius, in a manner more similar to the milky way gc system than to those invirgo. this difference may be an effect of the steeper density gradients inloose groups as compared to galaxy clusters. additional studies of early-typegalaxies in low density regions can help determine if this is indeed a generalenvironmental trend.

1109.5174	nonlinear color-metallicity relations of globular clusters. ii. a test  on the nonlinearity scenario for color bimodality using the u-band colors:  the case of m87 (ngc 4486)	the optical color distributions of globular clusters (gcs) in most largeelliptical galaxies are bimodal. based on the assumed linear relationshipbetween gc colors and their metallicities, the bimodality has been taken asevidence of two gc subsystems with different metallicities in each galaxy andled to a number of theories in the context of galaxy formation. more recentobservations and modeling of gcs, however, suggest that the color-metallicityrelations (cmrs) are inflected, and thus colors likely trace metallicities in anonlinear manner. the nonlinearity could produce bimodal color distributionsfrom a broad underlying metallicity spread, even if it is unimodal. despite thefar-reaching implications, whether cmrs are nonlinear and whether thenonlinearity indeed causes the color bimodality are still open questions. giventhat the spectroscopic refinement of cmrs is still very challenging, we herepropose a new photometric technique to probe the possible nonlinear nature ofcmrs. in essence, a color distribution of gcs is a "projected" distribution oftheir metallicities. since the form of cmrs hinges on which color is used, theshape of color distributions varies depending significantly on the colors.among other optical colors, the u-band related colors (e.g., u - g and u - z)are theoretically predicted to exhibit significantly less inflected cmrs thanother preferred cmrs (e.g., for g - z). as a case study, we performed thehst/wfpc2 archival u-band photometry for the m87 (ngc 4486) gc system withconfirmed color bimodality. we show that the u-band color distributions aresignificantly different from that of g - z, and consistent with our modelpredictions. with more u-band measurements, this method will support or ruleout the nonlinear-cmr scenario for the origin of gc color bimodality with highconfidence.

1109.5178	nonlinear color-metallicity relations of globular clusters. iii. on the  discrepancy in metallicity between globular cluster systems and their parent  elliptical galaxies	one of the conundrums in extragalactic astronomy is the discrepancy inobserved metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) between the two primestellar components of early-type galaxies-globular clusters (gcs) and halofield stars. this is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupledevolutionary histories between gc systems and their parent galaxies. here weshow, however, that new developments in linking the observed gc colors to theirintrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,which translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodalmdfs with broad metal-poor tails. remarkably, the inferred gc mdfs are similarto the mdfs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and thoseproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. the gc mdf shape,characterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtuallycontinuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. thecharacteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the hostgalaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment amongvarious gc systems. given that gcs are bluer than field stars within the samegalaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of gcs ceasedsomewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, gcspreferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events ingalactic formation. we further suggest a possible systematic age differenceamong gc systems, in that the gc systems in more luminous galaxies are older.this is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supportsadditionally the similar nature shared by gcs and field stars. our findingssuggest that gc systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more commonorigin than previously thought, and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxyformation.

1201.1031	optical and ir photometry of globular clusters in ngc1399: evidence for  color-metallicity nonlinearity	we combine new wide field camera~3 ir channel (wfc3/ir) f160w (h) imagingdata for ngc1399, the central galaxy in the fornax cluster, with archival f475w(g), f606w (v), f814w (i), and f850lp (z) optical data from the advanced camerafor surveys (acs). the purely optical g-i, v-i, and g-z colors of ngc1399'srich globular cluster (gc) system exhibit clear bimodality, at least formagnitudes $i_814 &gt; 21.5$. the optical-ir i-h color distribution appearsunimodal, and this impression is confirmed by mixture modeling analysis. thev-h colors show marginal evidence for bimodality, consistent with bimodality inv-i and unimodality in i-h. if bimodality is imposed for i-h with a doublegaussian model, the preferred blue/red split differs from that for opticalcolors; these "differing bimodalities" mean that the optical and optical-ircolors cannot both be linearly proportional to metallicity. consistent with thediffering color distributions, the dependence of i-h on g-i for the matched gcsample is significantly nonlinear, with an inflection point near the trough inthe g-i color distribution; the result is similar for the i-h dependence on g-zcolors taken from the acs fornax cluster survey. these g-z colors have beencalibrated empirically against metallicity; applying this calibration yields acontinuous, skewed, but single-peaked metallicity distribution. taken together,these results indicate that nonlinear color-metallicity relations play animportant role in shaping the observed bimodal distributions of optical colorsin extragalactic gc systems.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1303.6285	nonlinear color-metallicity relations of globular clusters. iv. testing  the nonlinearity scenario for color bimodality via hst/wfc3 u-band photometry  of m84 (ngc 4374)	color distributions of globular clusters (gcs) in most massive galaxies arebimodal. assuming linear color-to-metallicity conversions, bimodality is viewedas the presence of merely two gc subsystems with distinct metallicities, whichserves as a critical backbone of various galaxy formation theories. recentstudies, however, revealed that the color-metallicity relations (cmrs) oftenused to derive gc metallicities (e.g., cmrs of g-z, v-i and c-t1) are in factinflected. such inflection can create bimodal color distributions if theunderlying gc metallicity spread is simply broad as expected from thehierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation. in order to test thenonlinear-cmr scenario for gc color bimodality, the u-band photometry isproposed because the u-related cmrs (e.g., cmrs of u-g and u-z) aretheoretically predicted to be least inflected and most distinctive amongcommonly used optical cmrs. here, we present hubble space telescope (hst)/wfc3f336w (u-band) photometry of the gc system in m84, a giant elliptical in thevirgo galaxy cluster. combining the u data with the existing hst acs/wfc g andz data, we find that the u-z and u-g color distributions are different from theg-z distribution in a very systematic manner and remarkably consistent with ourmodel predictions based on the nonlinear-cmr hypothesis. the results lendfurther confidence to validity of the nonlinear-cmr scenario as an explanationfor gc color bimodality. there are some gc systems showing bimodalspectroscopic metallicity, and in such systems the inflected cmrs often createstronger bimodality in the color domain.

1304.0824	the acs virgo cluster survey. xvii. the spatial alignment of globular  cluster systems with early-type host galaxies	we study the azimuthal distribution of globular clusters (gcs) in early-typegalaxies and compare them to their host galaxies using data from the acs virgocluster survey. we find that in host galaxies with visible elongation (epsilon&gt; 0.2) and intermediate to high luminosities (m_z&lt;-19), the gcs arepreferentially aligned along the major axis of the stellar light. the red(metal-rich) gc subpopulations show strong alignment with the major axis of thehost galaxy, which supports the notion that these gcs are associated withmetal-rich field stars. the metal-rich gcs in lenticular galaxies show signs ofbeing more strongly associated with disks rather than bulges. surprisingly, wefind that the blue (metal-poor) gcs can also show the same correlation. if themetal-poor gcs are part of the early formation of the halo and built up throughmergers, then our results support a picture where halo formation and mergingoccur anisotropically, and where the present day major axis is an indicator ofthe preferred merging axis.

1310.4829	g2c2 ii: integrated colour-metallicity relations for galactic globular  clusters in sdss passbands	we use our integrated sdss photometry for 96 globular clusters in $g$ and$z$, as well as $r$ and $i$ photometry for a subset of 56 clusters, to derivethe integrated colour-metallicity relation (cmr) for galactic globularclusters. we compare this relation to previous work, including extragalacticclusters, and examine the influence of age, present-day mass functionvariations, structural parameters and the morphology of the horizontal branchon the relation. moreover, we scrutinise the scatter introduced by foregroundextinction (including differential reddening) and show that the scatter in thecolour-metallicity relation can be significantly reduced combining tworeddening laws from the literature. in all cmrs we find some low-reddeningyoung gcs that are offset to the cmr. most of these outliers are associatedwith the sagittarius system. simulations show that this is due less to age thanto a different enrichment history. finally, we introduce colour-metallicityrelations based on the infrared calcium triplet, which are clearly non-linearwhen compared to $(g^\prime-i^\prime)$ and $(g^\prime-z^\prime)$ colours.

1311.0873	the next generation virgo cluster survey - infrared (ngvs-ir): i. a new  near-uv/optical/near-ir globular cluster selection tool	the ngvs-ir project (next generation virgo survey - infrared) is a contiguousnear-infrared imaging survey of the virgo cluster of galaxies. it complementsthe optical wide-field survey of virgo (ngvs). the current state of ngvs-irconsists of ks-band imaging of 4 deg^2 centered on m87, and j and ks-bandimaging of 16 deg^2 covering the region between m49 and m87. in this paper, wepresent the observations of the central 4 deg^2 centered on virgo's coreregion. the data were acquired with wircam on the canada-france-hawaiitelescope and the total integration time was 41 hours distributed in 34contiguous tiles. a survey-specific strategy was designed to account forextended galaxies while still measuring accurate sky brightness within thesurvey area. the average 5\sigma limiting magnitude is ks=24.4 ab mag and the50% completeness limit is ks=23.75 ab mag for point source detections, whenusing only images with better than 0.7" seeing (median seeing 0.54"). starclusters are marginally resolved in these image stacks, and virgo galaxies with\mu_ks=24.4 ab mag arcsec^-2 are detected. combining the ks data with opticaland ultraviolet data, we build the uik color-color diagram which allows a veryclean color-based selection of globular clusters in virgo. this diagnostic plotwill provide reliable globular cluster candidates for spectroscopic follow-upcampaigns needed to continue the exploration of virgo's photometric andkinematic sub-structures, and will help the design of future searches forglobular clusters in extragalactic systems. equipped with this powerful newtool, future ngvs-ir investigations based on the uik diagram will address themapping and analysis of extended structures and compact stellar systems in andaround virgo galaxies.

1402.6090	globular clusters of ngc 3115 in the near-infrared. demonstrating the  correctness of two opposing scenarios	we combined new near-infrared vlt/hawk-i data of the globular clusters (gcs)in the isolated edge-on s0 galaxy ngc 3115 with optical and spectroscopic onestaken from the literature, with the aim of analyzing the multiband gc colordistributions. a recent study from the sluggs survey has shown that the gcs inthis galaxy follow a bimodal distribution of ca ii triplet indices. thus, ngc3115 presents a critical example of a gc system with multiple, distinct,metallicity subpopulations, and this may argue against the "projection"scenario, which posits that the ubiquitous color bimodality mainly results fromnonlinearities in the color-metallicity relations. using optical, nir, andspectroscopic data, we found strong and consistent evidence of indexbimodality, which independently confirms the metallicity bimodality in ngc 3115gcs. at the same time, we also found evidence for some color-colornonlinearity. taken in the broader context of previous studies, the multicolorconsistency of the gc bimodality in ngc 3115 suggests that in cases where gcsystems exhibit clear differences between their optical and optical-nir colordistributions (as in some giant ellipticals), the apparent inconsistencies mostlikely result from nonlinearities in the color-metallicity relations.

0803.0330	the acs virgo cluster survey xv. the formation efficiencies of globular  clusters in early-type galaxies: the effects of mass and environment	the fraction of stellar mass contained in globular clusters (gcs), alsomeasured by number as the specific frequency, is a fundamental quantity thatreflects both a galaxy's early star formation and its entire merging history.we present specific frequencies, luminosities, and mass fractions for theglobular cluster systems of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey, the largest homogeneous catalog of its kind. we find that 1) gc massfractions can be high in both giants and dwarfs, but are universally low ingalaxies with intermediate luminosities. 2) the behavior of specific frequencyacross galaxy mass is dominated by the blue gcs. 3) the gc fractions oflow-mass galaxies exhibit a dependence on environment. nearly all dwarfgalaxies with high gc fractions are within 1 mpc of the cd galaxy m87,presenting the first strong evidence that gc formation in dwarfs is biasedtoward dense environments. 4) gc formation in central dwarfs is biased becausetheir stars form earliest and most intensely. comparisons to the millenniumsimulation show that central dwarfs have older stellar populations and formmore stars at higher star formation rates (sfrs) and sfr surface densities. thesfr surface density in simulated dwarfs peaks before the total sfr, naturallyproducing gc populations that are older and more metal-poor than the fieldstars. 5) dwarfs within ~40 kpc of the giant ellipticals m87 and m49 are redand have few or no gcs, suggesting that they have been tidally stripped andhave contributed their gcs to the halos of their giant neighbors. the centraldwarfs with high gc mass fractions are thus likely to be the survivors mostsimilar to the protogalaxies that assembled the rich m87 globular clustersystem.(abridged)

1407.1054	the massive survey - i. a volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic  study of the most massive early-type galaxies within 108 mpc	massive early-type galaxies represent the modern-day remnants of the earliestmajor star formation episodes in the history of the universe. these galaxiesare central to our understanding of the evolution of cosmic structure, stellarpopulations, and supermassive black holes, but the details of their complexformation histories remain uncertain. to address this situation, we haveinitiated the massive survey, a volume-limited, multi-wavelength,integral-field spectroscopic (ifs) and photometric survey of the structure anddynamics of the ~100 most massive early-type galaxies within a distance of 108mpc. this survey probes a stellar mass range m* &gt; 10^{11.5} msun and diversegalaxy environments that have not been systematically studied to date. ourwide-field ifs data cover about two effective radii of individual galaxies, andfor a subset of them, we are acquiring additional ifs observations onsub-arcsecond scales with adaptive optics. we are also acquiring deep k-bandimaging to trace the extended halos of the galaxies and measure accurate totalmagnitudes. dynamical orbit modeling of the combined data will allow us tosimultaneously determine the stellar, black hole, and dark matter halo masses.the primary goals of the project are to constrain the black hole scalingrelations at high masses, investigate systematically the stellar initial massfunction and dark matter distribution in massive galaxies, and probe thelate-time assembly of ellipticals through stellar population and kinematicalgradients. in this paper, we describe the massive sample selection, discuss thedistinct demographics and structural and environmental properties of theselected galaxies, and provide an overview of our basic observational program,science goals and early survey results.

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1408.2821	the next generation virgo cluster survey. viii. the spatial distribution  of globular clusters in the virgo cluster	we report on a large-scale study of the distribution of globular clusters(gcs) throughout the virgo cluster, based on photometry from the nextgeneration virgo cluster survey, a large imaging survey covering virgo'sprimary subclusters to their virial radii. using the g', (g'-i')color-magnitude diagram of unresolved and marginally-resolved sources, weconstructed 2-d maps of the gc distribution. we present the clearest evidenceto date showing the difference in concentration between red and blue gcs overthe extent of the cluster, where the red (metal-rich) gcs are largely locatedaround the massive early-type galaxies, whilst the blue (metal-poor) gcs have amore extended spatial distribution, with significant populations present beyond83' (215 kpc) along the major axes of m49 and m87. the gc distribution aroundm87 and m49 shows remarkable agreement with the shape, ellipticity and boxinessof the diffuse light surrounding both galaxies. we find evidence for spatialenhancements of gcs surrounding m87 that may be indicative of recentinteractions or an ongoing merger history. we compare the gc map to thelocations of virgo galaxies and the intracluster x-ray gas, and find goodagreement between these baryonic structures. the virgo cluster contains a totalpopulation of 67300$\pm$14400 gcs, of which 35% are located in m87 and m49alone. we compute a cluster-wide specific frequency s_n,cl=$2.8\pm0.7$,including virgo's diffuse light. the gc-to-baryonic mass fraction ise_b=$5.7\pm1.1\times10^{-4} $and the gc-to-total cluster mass formationefficiency is e_t=$2.9\pm0.5\times10^{-5}$, values slightly lower than, butconsistent with, those derived for individual galactic halos. our results showthat the production of the complex structures in the unrelaxed virgo clustercore (including the diffuse intracluster light) is an ongoingprocess.(abridged)

1410.6291	globular cluster systems in brightest cluster galaxies: a near-universal  luminosity function?	we present the first results from our hst brightest cluster galaxy (bcg)survey of seven central supergiant cluster galaxies and their globular cluster(gc) systems. we measure a total of 48000 gcs in all seven galaxies,representing the largest single gc database. we find that a log-normal shapeaccurately matches the observed luminosity function (lf) of the gcs down to thegclf turnover point, which is near our photometric limit. in addition, the lfhas a virtually identical shape in all seven galaxies. our data underscore thesimilarity in the formation mechanism of massive star clusters in diversegalactic environments. at the highest luminosities (log l &gt; 10^7 l_sun) we findsmall numbers of "superluminous" objects in five of the galaxies; theirluminosity and color ranges are at least partly consistent with those of ucds(ultra-compact dwarfs). lastly, we find preliminary evidence that in the outerhalo (r &gt; 20 kpc), the lf turnover point shows a weak dependence on projecteddistance, scaling as l_0 ~ r^-0.2, while the lf dispersion remains nearlyconstant.

1411.6674	the initial mass function and star formation law in the outer disc of  ngc 2915	using hubble space telescope (hst) acs/wfc data we present the photometry andspatial distribution of resolved stellar populations in the outskirts of ngc2915, a blue compact dwarf with an extended hi disc. these observations revealan elliptical distribution of red giant branch stars, and a clumpy distributionof main-sequence stars that correlate with the hi gas distribution. weconstrain the upper-end initial mass function (imf) and determine the starformation law (sfl) in this field, using the observed main-sequence stars andan assumed constant star formation rate. previously published h{\alpha}observations of the field, which show one faint hii region, are used to providefurther constraints on the imf. we find that the main-sequence luminosityfunction analysis alone results in a best-fitting imf with a power-law slope{\alpha}=-2.85 and upper-mass limit m$_\rm{u}$ = 60 m$_\odot$. however, if weassume that all h{\alpha} emission is confined to hii regions then theupper-mass limit is restricted to m$_\rm{u}$ $\le$20 m$_\odot$. for theluminosity function fit to be correct we have to discount the h{\alpha}observations implying significant diffuse ionized gas or escaping ionizingphotons. combining the hst photometry with hi imaging we find the sfl has apower law index $n=1.53 \pm 0.21$. applying these results to the entire outerhi disc indicates that it contributes 11--28% of the total recent starformation in ngc 2915, depending on whether the imf is constant within the discor varies from the centre to the outer region.

1504.04139	g2c2-iii: structural parameters for galactic globular clusters in sdss  passbands	we use our galactic globular cluster catalog (g2c2) photometry for 111galactic globular clusters (gc) in g and z, as well as r and i photometry for asubset of 60 gcs and u photometry for 22 gcs, to determine the structuralparameters assuming king (1962) models.  in general, the resulting core radii are in good comparison with the currentliterature values. however, our half-light radii are slightly lower than theliterature. the concentrations (and therefore also the tidal radii) are poorlyconstrained mostly because of the limited radial extent of our imaging.therefore, we extensively discuss the effects of a limited field-of-view on thederived parameters using mosaicked sdss data, which do not suffer from thisrestriction. we also illustrate how red giant branch (rgb) stars in clustercores can stochastically induce artificial peaks in the surface brightnessprofiles. the issues related to these bright stars are scrutinised based onboth our photometry and simulated clusters. we also examine colour gradientsand find that the strongest central colour gradients are caused by central rgbstars and thus not representative for the cluster light or colour distribution.  we recover the known relation between the half-light radius and thegalactocentric distance in the g-band, but find a lower slope for redderfilters. we did not find a correlation between the scatter on this relation andother cluster properties. we find tentative evidence for a correlation betweenthe half-light radii and the [fe/h], with metal-poor gcs being larger thanmetal-rich gcs. however, we conclude that this trend is caused by the positionof the clusters in the galaxy, with metal-rich clusters being more centrallylocated.

1508.07334	the next generation virgo cluster survey. x. properties of ultra-compact  dwarfs in the m87, m49 and m60 regions	we use imaging from the next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) topresent a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies associatedwith three prominent virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive,red-sequence galaxies m87, m49 and m60. we show how ucds can be selected withhigh completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location incolor-color diagrams ($u^*ik_s$ or $u^*gz$). although the central galaxies ineach of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellarmasses, we find large differences in the sizes of their ucd populations, withm87 containing ~3.5 and 7.8 times more ucds than m49 and m60, respectively. therelative abundance of ucds in the three regions scales in proportion tosub-cluster mass, as traced by x-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, numberof globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. we find that the ucds arepredominantly blue in color, with ~85% of the ucds having colors similar toblue gcs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. we present evidence that ucdssurrounding m87 and m49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by theprominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately mergingwith the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominencecorrelates with distance from either galaxy. our analysis provides evidencethat tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in theformation of ucds.

astro-ph;0010187	lensing in the hercules supercluster	we report keck lris observations of an arc-like background galaxy near thecenter of abell 2152 (z=0.043), one of the three clusters comprising thehercules supercluster. the background object has a redshift z=0.1423 and issituated 25 arcsec north of the primary component of the a2152 brightestcluster galaxy (bcg). the object is about 15 arcsec in total length and has areddening-corrected r-band magnitude of $m_r = 18.55\pm0.03$. its spectrumshows numerous strong emission lines, as well as absorption features. thestrength of the h-alpha emission would imply a star formation rate $\sfr\approx 3h^{-2} \msun $yr$^{-1}$ in the absence of any lensing. however, thecurved shaped of this object and its tangential orientation along the majoraxis of the bcg suggest lensing. we model the a2152 core mass distributionincluding the two bcg components and the cluster potential. we present velocityand velocity dispersion profile measurements for the two bcg components and usethese to help constrain the potential. the lens modeling indicates a likelymagnification factor of $\sim1.9$ for the lensed galaxy, making a2152 thenearest cluster in which such significant lensing of a background source hasbeen observed. finally, we see evidence for a concentration of early-typegalaxies at $z=0.13$ near the centroid of the x-ray emission previouslyattributed to a2152. we suggest that emission from this backgroundconcentration is the cause of the offset of the x-ray center from the a2152bcg. the background concentration and the dispersed mass of the herculessupercluster could add further to the lensing strength of the a2152 cluster.

astro-ph;0011223	the sbf survey of galaxy distances. iv. sbf magnitudes, colors, and  distances	we report data for $i$ band surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes,v-i colors, and distance moduli for 300 galaxies. the survey contains e, s0 andearly-type spiral galaxies in the proportions of 49:42:9, and is essentiallycomplete for e galaxies to hubble velocities of 2000 km/s, with a substantialsampling of e galaxies out to 4000 km/s. the median error in distance modulusis 0.22 mag.  we also present two new results from the survey. (1) we compare the meanpeculiar flow velocity (bulk flow) implied by our distances with predictions oftypical cold dark matter transfer functions as a function of scale, and findvery good agreement with cold, dark matter cosmologies if the transfer functionscale parameter $\gamma$, and the power spectrum normalization $\sigma_8$ arerelated by $\sigma_8 \gamma^{-0.5} \approx 2\pm0.5$. derived directly fromvelocities, this result is independent of the distribution of galaxies ormodels for biasing. the modest bulk flow contradicts reports of large-scale,large-amplitude flows in the $\sim200$ mpc diameter volume surrounding oursurvey volume. (2) we present a distance-independent measure of absolute galaxyluminosity, \nbar, and show how it correlates with galaxy properties such ascolor and velocity dispersion, demonstrating its utility for measuring galaxydistances through large and unknown extinction.

astro-ph;0105366	reconciliation of the surface brightness fluctuations and type ia  supernovae distance scales	we present hubble space telescope measurements of surface brightnessfluctuations (sbf) distances to early-type galaxies that have hosted type iasupernovae (snia). the agreement in the relative sbf and snia multicolor lightcurve shape and delta-m_15 distances is excellent. there is no systematic scaleerror with distance, and previous work has shown that sbf and snia giveconsistent ties to the hubble flow. however, we confirm a systematic offset ofabout 0.25 mag in the distance zero points of the two methods, and we tracethis offset to their respective cepheid calibrations. sbf has in the past beencalibrated with cepheid distances from the h_0 key project team, while sniahave been calibrated with cepheid distances from the team composed of sandage,saha, and collaborators. when the two methods are calibrated in a consistentway, their distances are in superb agreement. until the conflict over the``long'' and ``short'' extragalactic cepheid distances among many galaxies isresolved, we cannot definitively constrain the hubble constant to better thanabout 10%, even leaving aside the additional uncertainty in the distance to thelarge magellanic cloud, common to both cepheid scales. however, recenttheoretical sbf predictions from stellar population models favor the keyproject cepheid scale, while the theoretical snia calibration lies between thelong and short scales. in addition, while the current sbf distance to m31/m32is in good agreement with the rr lyrae and red giant branch distances,calibrating sbf with the longer cepheid scale would introduce a 0.3 mag offsetwith respect to the rr lyrae scale.

astro-ph;0108194	a synthesis of data from fundamental plane and surface brightness  fluctuation surveys	we perform a series of comparisons between distance-independent photometricand spectroscopic properties used in the surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)and fundamental plane (fp) methods of early-type galaxy distance estimation.the data are taken from two recent surveys: the sbf survey of galaxy distancesand the streaming motions of abell clusters (smac) fp survey. we derive arelation between v-i colour and mg_2 index using nearly 200 galaxies anddiscuss implications for galactic extinction estimates and early-type galaxystellar populations. we find that the reddenings from schlegel et al (1998) forgalaxies with $e(b{-}v) \gta 0.2$ mag appear to be overestimated by 5--10%, butwe do not find significant evidence for large-scale dipole errors in theextinction map. in comparison to stellar population models having solarelemental abundance ratios, the galaxies in our sample are generally too blueat a given mg_2; we ascribe this to the well-known enhancement of the$\alpha$-elements in luminous early-type galaxies. we confirm a tight relationbetween stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and the sbf `fluctuation count'parameter \nbar, which is a luminosity-weighted measure of the total number ofstars in a galaxy. the correlation between \nbar and $\sigma$ is even tighterthan that between mg_2 and $\sigma$. finally, we derive fp photometricparameters for 280 galaxies from the sbf survey data set. comparisons withexternal sources allow us to estimate the errors on these parameters and derivethe correction necessary to bring them onto the smac system. the data are usedin a companion paper which compares the distances derived from the fp and sbfmethods.

astro-ph;0111183	early-type galaxy distances from the fundamental plane and surface  brightness fluctuations	we compare two methods for deriving distances to early-type galaxies:fundamental plane (fp) and surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) distances for170 galaxies. a third set of distances is provided by predictions derived fromthe density field of the iras redshift survey. overall there is good agreement.however, several nearby, low-luminosity, mainly s0 galaxies have systematicallylow fp distances; we conclude that this is at least partly due to recent starformation and consequently low mass-to-light ratios. the tie between thecepheid-calibrated sbf distances (mpc) and the far-field calibrated fpdistances (km/s) yields a hubble constant h_0 = 68 +/- 3 km/s/mpc, while thecomparison between sbf and the iras-reconstructed distances yields h_0 = 74 +/-2 (internal errorbars). possible explanations for the marginal inconsistencyinclude systematic errors in the redshift survey completeness estimates or inthe fp aperture corrections, but at this point, the best estimate of h_0 fromearly-type galaxies may be a simple average of the above two estimates. afterrevising the sbf distances to be in agreement with the final set of key projectcepheid distances, we conclude h_0 = 73 +/- 4 +/- 11, where the second errorbarrepresents the total systematic uncertainty in the distance zero point. we alsodiscuss the recently introduced "fluctuation star count" parameter nbar as aless demanding alternative to (v-i) for calibrating sbf distances. thenbar-calibrated sbf method is akin to a hybrid sbf-fp distance indicator, andwe find that the use of nbar actually improves the sbf distances. further studyof nbar would provide useful constraints for elliptical galaxy formationmodels.

astro-ph;0210129	measuring distances and probing the unresolved stellar populations of  galaxies using infrared surface brightness fluctuations	to empirically calibrate the ir surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) distancescale and probe the properties of unresolved stellar populations, we measuredfluctuations in 65 galaxies using nicmos on the hubble space telescope. theearly-type galaxies in this sample include elliptical and s0 galaxies andspiral bulges in a variety of environments. absolute fluctuation magnitudes inthe f160w (1.6 micron) filter were derived for each galaxy usingpreviously-measured i-band sbf and cepheid variable star distances. f160w sbfscan be used to measure distances to early-type galaxies with a relativeaccuracy of ~10% provided that the galaxy color is known to ~0.035 mag orbetter. near-ir fluctuations can also reveal the properties of the mostluminous stellar populations in galaxies. comparison of f160w fluctuationmagnitudes and optical colors to stellar population model predictions suggeststhat bluer elliptical and s0 galaxies have significantly younger populationsthan redder ones, and may also be more metal-rich. there are no galaxies inthis sample with fluctuation magnitudes consistent with old, metal-poor (t&gt;5gyr, [fe/h]&lt;-0.7) stellar population models. composite stellar populationmodels imply that bright fluctuations in the bluer galaxies may be the resultof an episode of recent star formation in a fraction of the total mass of agalaxy. age estimates from the f160w fluctuation magnitudes are consistent withthose measured using the h-beta balmer line index. the two types ofmeasurements make use of completely different techniques and are sensitive tostars in different evolutionary phases. both techniques reveal the presence ofintermediate-age stars in the early-type galaxies of this sample.

astro-ph;0302402	discovery of two distant type ia supernovae in the hubble deep field  north with the advanced camera for surveys	we present observations of the first two supernovae discovered with therecently installed advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble spacetelescope. the supernovae were found in wide field camera images of the hubbledeep field north taken with the f775w, f850lp, and g800l optical elements aspart of the acs guaranteed time observation program. spectra extracted from theacs g800l grism exposures confirm that the objects are type ia supernovae (sneia) at redshifts z=0.47 and z=0.95. follow-up hst observations have beenconducted with acs in f775w and f850lp and with nicmos in the near-infraredf110w bandpass, yielding a total of 9 flux measurements in the 3 bandpassesover a period of 50 days in the observed frame. we discuss many of theimportant issues in doing accurate photometry with the acs. we analyze themulti-band light curves using two different fitting methods to calibrate thesupernovae luminosities and place them on the sne ia hubble diagram. theresulting distances are consistent with the redshift-distance relation of theaccelerating universe model, although evolving intergalactic grey dust remainsas a less likely possibility. the relative ease with which these sne ia werefound, confirmed, and monitored demonstrates the potential acs holds forrevolutionizing the field of high-redshift sne ia, and therefore of testing theaccelerating universe cosmology and constraining the "epoch of deceleration".

astro-ph;0303229	dynamics of the globular cluster system associated with m49 (ngc4472):  cluster orbital properties and the distribution of dark matter	we have measured radial velocities for 196 globular clusters (gcs) aroundm49, the brightest member of the virgo cluster. combined with published data,they bring the total number of gcs with measured radial velocities in thisgalaxy to 263. using this sample, we extract the projected kinematics of thefull sample of gcs, and of the separate metal-poor and metal-rich subsamples.in agreement with previous results for the global gc kinematics based onsmaller datasets, we find that the gc system as a whole exhibits a slow overallrotation that is due almost entirely to a net rotation of the metal-poor gcsubsystem alone. in a spatial average, the metal-rich gcs shows essentially norotation. we note, however, the presence of a well defined grouping of 10metal-rich gcs that are located at opposite poles along the galaxy's major axisand which appear to be rotating at nearly 300 km/s about the minor axis. thisgrouping may be the relic of a past merger or accretion event. using ajeans-equation analysis, we show that the gc radial velocities alone pointunequivocally (and independently of x-ray observations) to the need for amassive dark halo associated with m49 and the virgo b subcluster around it. wealso show that the gc system as a whole is consistent with an almost perfectlyisotropic velocity ellipsoid. m49 is now the second elliptical galaxy (afterm87) for which we have been able to demonstrate velocity isotropy in theglobular cluster system overall, when no division based on gc color ormetallicity is attempted. thus, the data for these two galaxies lend supportthe general assumption of isotropy when using gc kinematics to study thedark-matter distribution in early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0404138	the acs virgo cluster survey. i. introduction to the survey	the virgo cluster is the dominant mass concentration in the localsupercluster and the largest collection of elliptical and lenticular galaxiesin the nearby universe. in this paper, we present an introduction to the acsvirgo cluster survey: a program to image, in the f475w and f850lp bandpasses(sloan g and z), 100 early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster using theadvanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. we describe theselection of the program galaxies and their ensemble properties, the choice offilters, the field placement and orientation, the limiting magnitudes of thesurvey, coordinated parallel observations of 100 "intergalactic" fields withwfpc2, and supporting ground-based spectroscopic observations of the programgalaxies. in terms of depth, spatial resolution, sample size and homogeneity,this represents the most comprehensive imaging survey to date of early-typegalaxies in a cluster environment. we briefly describe the main scientificgoals of the survey which include the measurement of luminosities,metallicities, ages, and structural parameters for the many thousands ofglobular clusters associated with these galaxies, a high-resolution isophotalanalysis of galaxies spanning a factor of ~ 450 in luminosity and sharing acommon environment, the measurement of accurate distances for the full sampleof galaxies using the method of surface brightness fluctuations, and adetermination of the three-dimensional structure of virgo itself.

astro-ph;0405188	the acs virgo cluster survey iii. chandra and hst observations of  low-mass x-ray binaries and globular clusters in m87	the acis instrument on board the chandra x-ray observatory has been used tocarry out the first systematic study of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in m87.we identify 174 x-ray point-sources, of which ~150 are likely lmxbs. this lmxbcatalog is combined with deep f475w and f850lp images taken with acs on hst toexamine the connection between lmxbs and globular clusters in m87. of the 1688globular clusters in our catalog, f_x = 3.6 +- 0.5% contain a lmxb and we findthat the metal-rich clusters are 3 +- 1 times more likely to harbor a lmxb thantheir metal-poor counterparts. in agreement with previous findings for othergalaxies, we find that brighter, more metal-rich clusters are more likely tocontain a lmxb. for the first time, however, we are able to demonstrate thatthe probability, p_x, that a given cluster will contain a lmxb dependssensitively on the dynamical properties of the host cluster. specifically, weuse the hst images to measure the half-light radius, concentration index andcentral density, \rho_0, for each globular, and define a parameter, \gamma,which is related to the tidal capture and binary-neutron star exchange rate.our preferred form for p_x is then p_x \propto \gamma \rho_0^{-0.42\pm0.11}(z/z_{\odot})^{0.33\pm0.1}. we argue that if the form of p_x is determined bydynamical processes, then the observed metallicity dependence is a consequenceof an increased number of neutron stars per unit mass in metal-rich globularclusters. finally, we find no compelling evidence for a break in the luminositydistribution of resolved x-ray point sources. instead, the lmxb luminosityfunction is well described by a power law with an upper cutoff at l_x ~ 10^39erg/s.

astro-ph;0501325	the acs virgo cluster survey iv: data reduction procedures for surface  brightness fluctuation measurements with the advanced camera for surveys	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) virgo cluster survey is a large programto image 100 early-type virgo galaxies using the f475w and f850lp bandpasses ofthe wide field channel of the acs instrument on the hubble space telescope(hst). the scientific goals of this survey include an exploration of thethree-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster and a critical examination ofthe usefulness of the globular cluster luminosity function as a distanceindicator. both of these issues require accurate distances for the full sampleof 100 program galaxies. in this paper, we describe our data reductionprocedures and examine the feasibility of accurate distance measurements usingthe method of surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) applied to the acs virgocluster survey f850lp imaging. the acs exhibits significant geometricaldistortions due to its off-axis location in the hst focal plane; correcting forthese distortions by resampling the pixel values onto an undistorted frameresults in pixel correlations that depend on the nature of the interpolationkernel used for the resampling. this poses a major challenge for the sbftechnique, which normally assumes a flat power spectrum for the noise. weinvestigate a number of different interpolation kernels and show through ananalysis of simulated galaxy images having realistic noise properties that itis possible, depending on the kernel, to measure sbf distances usingdistortion-corrected acs images without introducing significant additionalerror from the resampling. we conclude by showing examples of real image powerspectra from our survey.

astro-ph;0503566	the acs virgo cluster survey. vii. resolving the connection between  globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	we investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compactdwarf galaxies (ucds) by examining the properties of several compact objectsassociated with m87, all of which were previously classified as globularclusters. combining imaging from the hubble space telescope with ground-basedkeck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocitydispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictionsof population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately20pc, and have v-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. these objects,which we consider to be ucds, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticalgalaxies in virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities andcolors. these ucds are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations ofgalaxies more closely than those of galactic globular clusters. there appearsto be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of abouttwo million solar masses. if the ucds are gravitationally bound, then wesuggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental propertydistinguishing globular clusters from ucds. more than half of the ucdcandidates uncovered in the acs virgo cluster survey are associated with asingle galaxy -- m87 -- which suggests that proximity to the virgo center maybe of critical importance for the formation of these objects. these resultsshow that distinguishing bonafide ucds from bright globular clusters requires acareful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,particularly their mass-to-light ratios.

astro-ph;0504453	discovery of strong lensing by an elliptical galaxy at z=0.0345	we have discovered strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy eso325-g004, inimages obtained with the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble spacetelescope. the lens galaxy is a boxy group-dominant elliptical at z=0.0345,making this the closest known galaxy-scale lensing system. the lensed object isvery blue (b-i = 1.1), and forms two prominent arcs and a less extended thirdimage. the einstein radius is r_ein=1.9 kpc (~3 arcsec on the sky, cf. 12arcsec effective radius of the lens galaxy). assuming a high redshift for thesource, the mass within r_ein is 1.4x10^11 m_sun, and the i-band mass-to-lightratio is 1.8 (m/l)_sun. the equivalent velocity dispersion is sigma_lens=310km/s, in excellent agreement with the measured stellar dispersion sigma_v=320km/s. modeling the lensing potential with a singular isothermal ellipse (sie),we find close agreement with the light distribution. the best fit sie modelreproduces the ellipticity of the lens galaxy to ~10%, and its position anglewithin 1 degree. the model predicts the broad features of the arc geometry asobserved; the unlensed magnitude of the source is estimated at i ~ 23.75. wesuggest that one in ~200 similarly-massive galaxies within z&lt;0.1 will exhibitsuch a luminous multiply-imaged source.

astro-ph;0506314	the acs virgo cluster survey v: sbf calibration for giant and dwarf  early-type galaxies	as part of the advanced camera for survey (acs) virgo cluster survey, we havemeasured surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 100 early-typevirgo galaxies. distances derived from these measurements are needed to explorethe three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster, study the intrinsicparameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, andcompare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosityfunctions. our sbf measurements have been performed in the f850lp bandpass ofthe wide field channel of the acs on the hubble space telescope. these are thefirst measurements of this kind, and we present the first sbf calibration forthis bandpass. the measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar populationvariations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 andz_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the f475w and f850lp acsfilters. we derive the following calibration for the absolute sbf magnitudem_850: m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in therange 1.3 &lt;(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.6, and m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 &lt;=(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.3. physically,the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giantellipticals and s0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. forthe first time in sbf studies, we are able to provide a firm empiricalcalibration of sbf in early-type dwarf galaxies. our results agree with stellarpopulation model predictions from bruzual &amp; charlot (2003).

astro-ph;0507699	detection of radial surface brightness fluctuation and color gradients  in elliptical galaxies with acs	we study surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 8 ellipticalgalaxies using advanced camera for surveys (acs) wide field channel (wfc) datadrawn from the hubble space telescope (hst) archive. sbf magnitudes in thef814w bandpass, and galaxy colors from f814w, f435w, and f606w images -- whenavailable -- are presented. galaxy surface brightness profiles are determinedas well. we present the first sbf--broadband color calibration for the acs/wfcf814w bandpass, and (relative) distance moduli estimates for 7 of our galaxies.  we detect and study in detail the sbf variations within individual galaxiesas a probe of possible changes in the underlying stellar populations.inspecting both the sbf and color gradients in comparison to model predictions,we argue that sbf, and sbf-gradients, can in principle be used for unravelingthe different evolutionary paths taken by galaxies, though a more comprehensivestudy of this issue would be required. we confirm that the radial variation ofgalaxy stellar population properties should be mainly connected to the presenceof radial chemical abundance gradients, with the outer galaxy regions beingmore metal poor than the inner ones.

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0603840	a fundamental relation between compact stellar nuclei, supermassive  black holes, and their host galaxies	imaging surveys with the hubble space telescope (hst) have shown that roughly50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellarnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. wecombine hst imaging for early-type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster surveywith ground-based long-slit spectra from kpno to show that the masses ofcompact stellar nuclei in virgo cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation withthe masses of the host galaxies. the same correlation is obeyed by thesupermassive black holes (sbhs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. thecompact stellar nuclei in the local group galaxies m33 and ngc205 are alsofound to fall along this same scaling relation. these results indicate that ageneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a central massiveobject (cmo) -- either a sbh or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains amean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. in galaxies with massesgreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, sbhs appear to be the dominantmode of cmo formation.

astro-ph;0604082	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  early-type galaxies in the lynx supercluster at z~1.26	color-magnitude relations have been derived in the clusters rx j0849+4452 andrx j0848+4453 at z~1.26. the color-magnitude relation was determined fromadvanced camera for surveys imaging in the wfc f775w (i_775) and f850lp (z_850)filters combined with ground-based spectroscopy. early-type cluster candidateshave been identified according to the postman et al. morphologicalclassification. in both clusters the bright red early-type population defines atight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusterspresent different x-ray luminosities and shapes, with rx j0849+4452 being threetimes more x-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two timeshigher. the elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (cmr) in rx j0849+4452and rx j0848+4453 show an intrinsic (i_775-z_850) color scatter of 0.026 +/-0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (~1mpc atz=1.26) from the cluster x-ray emission centers. simple modeling of thescatters using stellar population models from bruzual and charlot, gives a meanluminosity-weighted age t &gt; 2.5 gyr (z_f &gt; 2.75). s0 galaxies follow theelliptical cmr; they show larger scatters about the cmr.  the intrinsic scatter decreases and the cmr slopes are steeper at smallerradii, within both clusters. we conclude that old stellar populations incluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the moreevolved cluster rx j0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion rx j0848+4453.even at a lookback time of 9 gyr, in the early merging and buildup of massiveclusters, the bulk of the stellar content of the bright elliptical galaxypopulation was in place - apparently formed some 2.5~gyr earlier at z~3

astro-ph;0609371	trends in the globular cluster luminosity function of early-type  galaxies	we present results from a study of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) in a sample of 89 early-type galaxies observed as part of the acs virgocluster survey. using a gaussian parametrization of the gclf, we find a highlysignificant correlation between the gclf dispersion, sigma, and the galaxyluminosity, m_b, in the sense that the gc systems in fainter galaxies havenarrower luminosity functions. the gclf dispersions in the milky way and m31are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation betweensigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions thatgclf shape is a function of galaxy hubble type. we show that the sigma - m_brelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)cluster masses in fainter galaxies. we further show that this behavior ismirrored by a steepening of the gc mass function for relatively high masses, m&gt;~ 3 x 10^5 m_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the gclf is not stronglyaffected by dynamical evolution over a hubble time. we argue that this trendarises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation bytheories of cluster formation. finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, thegclf "turns over" at the canonical mass scale of m_to ~ 2 x 10^5 m_sun.however, we find that m_to scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 m_sun) ingalaxies fainter than m_b &gt;~ -18.5, an important consideration if the gclf isto be used as a distance indicator for dwarf ellipticals.

astro-ph;0612139	the inner workings of early-type galaxies: cores, nuclei and  supermassive black holes (including a critical comparison of nuker and  core-sersic/sersic models)	recent years have seen dramatic progress in the study of the core and nuclearproperties of galaxies. the structure of the cores has been shown to varymethodically with global and nuclear properties, as cores respond to themechanisms by which galaxies form/evolve. the dynamical centers of galaxieshave been found capable of hosting two seemingly disparate objects:supermassive black holes (sbhs) and compact stellar nuclei. in a drasticdeparture from previous beliefs, it has been discovered that both structuresare common: galaxies lacking sbhs and/or stellar nuclei are the exception,rather than the norm. this review explores the connection between cores, sbhsand stellar nuclei in early-type galaxies, as revealed by the acs virgo clustersurvey. we find that, from parsec to kiloparsec scales, the surface brightnessprofiles of early-type galaxies are well described by a sersic model -- aparametrization that is shown to be preferable to the so called `nuker' model.relative to the inward extrapolation of the best fitting sersic model, theprofiles within the inner few tens of parsecs transition from luminosity`deficits', in the brightest (m_b &lt; ~-20) galaxies, to luminosity `excesses' inthe faintest. the compact stellar nuclei responsible for such luminosityexcesses comprise approximatively 0.2% of the total galactic mass. remarkably,this is the same fraction believed to reside in the sbhs, which arepredominantly found in the brightest galaxies showing luminosity deficits.

astro-ph;9604168	globular clusters in fornax: does $m^0$ depend on environment?	we present the $v$-band globular cluster luminosity functions (gclfs) of thefornax cluster galaxies ngc 1344, ngc 1380, ngc 1399, and ngc 1404. ourobservations reach to $v = 24.8$, roughly one magnitude beyond the gclfturnover $m^0_v$, with $\sim90\%$ completeness. from the amplitude of thegalaxy surface brightness fluctuations, we also estimate the number of globularclusters fainter than this cutoff magnitude. the gclfs of these galaxies arewell fitted by gaussians; the weighted means of their turnover magnitudes anddispersions are $\langle m^0_v\rangle = 23.88 \pm 0.10$ mag and$\langle\sigma\rangle = 1.35\pm 0.07$ mag. the assumption of a universal valuefor the absolute magnitude of the turnover $m^0_v$ places the fornax cluster$0.13 \pm 0.11$ mag more distant than virgo. however, in light of recentcepheid and other high-precision distance measurements, as well as ongoing hstobservations of gclfs for the purpose of determining the extra-galacticdistance scale, we choose to re-examine the universal gclf hypothesis. based ondata from groups and clusters of galaxies, we find evidence that $m^0_v$becomes fainter as the local density of galaxies increases. we speculate on thepossible cause of this trend; if it is confirmed, gclf observations will beless useful for determining distances, but may provide important informationfor constraining theories of star formation in primordial galaxy halos.

astro-ph;9703099	the dependence of globular cluster number on density for abell cluster  central galaxies	a study of the globular cluster systems of 23 brightest, or central, galaxiesin 19 abell clusters has recently been completed. this letter presents some ofthe newly discovered correlations of the globular cluster specific frequency$s_n$ in these galaxies with other galaxy and cluster properties and puts forthan interpretation of these results. $s_n$ is found to correlate strongly withmeasures of the cluster density, such as the velocity dispersion of the clustergalaxies and the cluster x-ray temperature and luminosity (especially ``local''x-ray luminosity). within a cluster, galaxies at smaller projected distancesfrom the x-ray center are found to have higher values of $s_n$. taken together,the scaling of $s_n$ with cluster density and the relative constancy of centralgalaxy luminosity suggest a scenario in which globular clusters form inproportionate numbers to the available mass, but galaxy luminosity``saturates'' at a maximum threshold, resulting in higher \sn\ values forcentral galaxies in denser clusters as well as the suitability of thesegalaxies as ``standard candles.'' thus, these galaxies do not have too manyglobular clusters for their luminosity; rather, they are underluminous fortheir number of globular clusters.

astro-ph;9705129	globular clusters in 19 northern abell clusters	we study the globular cluster (gc) populations of 21 giant ellipticalgalaxies in 19 abell clusters. this method, applied here primarily in the rband, is based on the surface brightness fluctuations technique ofextragalactic distance measurement. the sample galaxies range in redshift from5000 to 10,000 \kms, and were selected primarily from the lauer &amp; postman(1994) survey of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs).  we find a tight correlation between the gc specific frequency s_n of thecentral bright galaxy in the cluster and the cluster velocity dispersion. s_nalso correlates well with the cluster x-ray temperature and with the number ofbright neighboring galaxies, less well with the galaxy profile, and onlymarginally with galaxy luminosity and overall cluster richness. it does notcorrelate with cluster morphology class. thus, unlike galaxy luminosity, s_n isdetermined by the cluster mass, or density. to account for this situation, wepropose that the gcs formed early and in proportion to the available mass,while the luminosity growth of the galaxy was later halted, yielding theobserved correlations of s_n with density. we introduce a quantity called$\eta_{gc}$, the number of gcs per unit local cluster mass. for a simplecluster mass model, $\eta_{gc}$ is found to be constant, indicating a uniformgc production rate per unit available mass.  a measurement of the gaussian width $\sigma$ of the gc luminosity function(gclf) is one of the byproducts of our analysis. in the cosmic microwavebackground frame, the mean width for this sample is $&lt; \sigma &gt; = 1.43$ mag,virtually identical to the hst value for m87, the galaxy used to calibrate themean of the gclf in this analysis.
