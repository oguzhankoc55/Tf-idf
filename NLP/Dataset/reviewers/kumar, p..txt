0911.4612	controlled defects in zno by low energy ar irradiation	we report interesting observations in 1.2 mev ar8+ ion irradiated zno which,to the best of our knowledge, have not been published earlier and will beuseful for the scientific community engaged in research on zno. irradiationwith the initial fluence 1 x 10^15 ions/cm^2 changes the colour of the samplefrom white to orange while the highest irradiation fluence makes it darkreddish brown that appears as black. such changes in colour can be correlatedwith the oxygen vacancy type defects. no significant change in the grain sizeof the irradiated samples, as revealed from the x-ray diffraction (xrd) linewidth broadening, has been observed. increase of surface roughness due tosputtering is clearly visible in scanning electron micrographs (sem) withhighest fluence of irradiation. room temperature photoluminescence (pl)spectrum of the unirradiated sample shows intense ultra-violet (uv) emission (~3.27 ev) and less prominent defect level emissions (2-3 ev). the overallemission is largely quenched due to initial irradiation fluence. but withincreasing fluence uv emission is enhanced along with prominent defect levelemissions. remarkably, the resistivity of the irradiated sample with highestfluence is reduced by four orders of magnitude compared to that of theunirradiated sample. this indicates increase of donor concentration as well astheir mobility due to irradiation. oxygen vacancies are deep donors in zno, butsurely they influence the stability of the shallow donors (presumably zincinterstitial related) and vice versa. this is in conformity with recenttheoretical calculations.

0708.1649	scattered emission from a relativistic outflow and its application to  gamma-ray bursts	we investigate a scenario of photons scattering by electrons within arelativistic outflow. the outflow is composed of discrete shells with differentspeeds. one shell emits radiation for a short duration. some of this radiationis scattered by the shell(s) behind. we calculate in a simple two-shell modelthe observed scattered flux density as a function of the observed primary fluxdensity, the normalized arrival time delay between the two emission components,the lorentz factor ratio of the two shells and the scattering shell's opticaldepth. thomson scattering in a cold shell and inverse compton scattering in ahot shell are both considered. the results of our calculations are applied tothe gamma-ray bursts and the afterglows. we find that the scattered flux from acold slower shell is small and likely to be detected only for those bursts withvery weak afterglows. a hot scattering shell could give rise to a scatteredemission as bright as the x-ray shallow decay component detected in manybursts, on a condition that the isotropically equivalent total energy carriedby the hot electrons is large, $\sim 10^{52-56}$ erg. the scattered emissionfrom a faster shell could appear as a late short $\gamma$-ray/mev flash orbecome part of the prompt emission depending on the delay of the ejection ofthe shell.

1010.0753	optical property modification of zno: effect of 1.2 mev ar irradiation	we report a systematic study on 1.2 mev ar^8+ irradiated zno by x-raydiffraction (xrd), room temperature photoluminescence (pl) andultraviolet-visible (uv-vis) absorption measurements. zno retains its wurtzitecrystal structure up to maximum fluence of 5 x 10^16 ions/cm^2. even, the widthof the xrd peaks changes little with irradiation. the uv-vis absorption spectraof the samples, unirradiated and irradiated with lowest fluence (1 x 10^15ions/cm^2), are nearly same. however, the pl emission is largely quenched forthis irradiated sample. red shift of the absorption edge has been noticed forhigher fluence. it has been found that red shift is due to at least two defectcenters. the pl emission is recovered for 5 x 10^15 ions/cm^2 fluence. thesample colour is changed to orange and then to dark brown with increasingirradiation fluence. huge resistivity decrease is observed for the sampleirradiated with 5 x 10^15 ions/cm^2 fluence. results altogether indicate theevolution of stable oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials as dominant defectsfor high fluence irradiation.

1108.0929	magnetic jet model for grbs and the delayed arrival of &gt;100 mev photons	photons of energy larger than 100 mev from long-grbs arrive a few secondsafter &lt;10 mev photons do. we show that this delay is a natural consequence of amagnetic dominated relativistic jet. the much slower acceleration of a magneticjet with radius (compared with a hot baryonic outflow) results in high energygamma-ray photons to be converted to electron-positron pairs out to a largerradius whereas lower energy gamma-rays of energy less than ~10 mev can escapewhen the jet crosses the thomson-photosphere. the resulting delay for thearrival of high energy photons is found to be similar to the value observed bythe fermi satellite for a number of grbs. a prediction of this model is thatthe delay should increase with photon energy (e) as e^{0.17} for e&gt;100 mev. thedelay depends almost linearly on burst redshift, and on the distance from thecentral compact object where the jet is launched (r_0). therefore, the delay inarrival of &gt;10^2 mev photons can be used to estimate burst redshift if themagnetic jet model for gamma-ray generation is correct and r_0 is roughly thesame for long-grbs.

1203.5613	the characterization of virgo data and its impact on gravitational-wave  searches	between 2007 and 2010 virgo collected data in coincidence with the ligo andgeo gravitational-wave (gw) detectors. these data have been searched for gwsemitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotatingneutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of thedetectors. the sensitivity of gw searches is limited by noise produced by thedetector or its environment. it is therefore crucial to characterize thevarious noise sources in a gw detector. this paper reviews the virgo detectornoise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which wereidentified in the three first virgo observing runs. in many cases, theseinvestigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or toselectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. we presentexamples from the joint ligo-geo-virgo gw searches to show how well noisetransients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from thevirgo data. we also discuss how detector characterization can improve theastrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.

1205.2216	search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts during  ligo science run 6 and virgo science runs 2 and 3	we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with154 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-based gamma-rayexperiments in 2009-2010, during the sixth ligo science run and the second andthird virgo science runs. we perform two distinct searches: a modeled searchfor coalescences of either two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole;and a search for generic, unmodeled gravitational-wave bursts. we find noevidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual grb inthis sample or with the population as a whole. for all grbs we place lowerbounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of agravitational-wave emission energy of 10^-2 m c^2 at 150 hz, with a medianlimit of 17 mpc. for short hard grbs we place exclusion distances on binaryneutron star and neutron star-black hole progenitors, using astrophysicallymotivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 mpc and 28mpc respectively. these distance limits, while significantly larger than for asearch that is not aided by grb satellite observations, are not large enough toexpect a coincidence with a grb. however, projecting these exclusions to thesensitivities of advanced ligo and virgo, which should begin operation in 2015,we find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with grbs willbecome quite possible.

1206.4054	inverse compton cooling in klein-nishina regime and grb prompt spectrum	synchrotron radiation mechanism, when electrons are accelerated in arelativistic shock, is known to have serious problems to explain the observedgamma-ray spectrum below the peak for most gamma-ray bursts (grbs); thesynchrotron spectrum below the peak is much softer than observed spectra.recently, the possibility that electrons responsible for the radiation cool viainverse compton, but in the klein-nishina regime, has been proposed as asolution to this problem. we provide an analytical study of this effect andshow that it leads to a hardening of the low energy spectrum but not by enoughto make it consistent with the observed spectra for most grbs (this is assumingthat electrons are injected continuously over a time scale comparable to thedynamical time scale, as is expected for internal shocks of grbs). inparticular, we find that it is not possible to obtain a spectrum with\alpha&gt;-0.1 (f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}) whereas the typical observed valueis \alpha\sim0. moreover, extreme values for a number of parameters arerequired in order that \alpha\sim-0.1: the energy fraction in magnetic fieldneeds to be less than about 10^{-4}, the thermal lorentz factor of electronsshould be larger than 10^6, and the radius where gamma-rays are produced shouldbe not too far away from the deceleration radius. these difficulties suggestthat the synchrotron radiation mechanism in internal shocks does not provide aself-consistent solution when \alpha&gt;-0.2.

1207.7176	einstein@home all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in ligo s5  data	this paper presents results of an all-sky searches for periodic gravitationalwaves in the frequency range [50, 1190] hz and with frequency derivative rangesof [-2 x 10^-9, 1.1 x 10^-10] hz/s for the fifth ligo science run (s5). thenovelty of the search lies in the use of a non-coherent technique based on thehough-transform to combine the information from coherent searches on timescalesof about one day. because these searches are very computationally intensive,they have been deployed on the einstein@home distributed computing projectinfrastructure. the search presented here is about a factor 3 more sensitivethan the previous einstein@home search in early s5 ligo data. thepost-processing has left us with eight surviving candidates. we show thatdeeper follow-up studies rule each of them out. hence, since no statisticallysignificant gravitational wave signals have been detected, we report upperlimits on the intrinsic gravitational wave amplitude h0. for example, in the0.5 hz-wide band at 152.5 hz, we can exclude the presence of signals with h0greater than 7.6 x 10^-25 with a 90% confidence level.

1304.1545	a model for the multiwavelength radiation from tidal disruption event  swift j1644+57	gamma-ray observations of a stellar tidal disruption event (tde) detected bythe swift satellite and follow up observations in radio, mm, infrared and x-raybands have provided a rich data set to study accretion onto massive blackholes,production of relativistic jets and their interaction with the surroundingmedium. the radio and x-ray data for tde swift j1644+57 provide a conflictingpicture regarding the energy in relativistic jet produced in this event: x-raydata suggest jet energy declining with time as t^{-5/3} whereas the nearly flatlightcurves in radio and mm bands lasting for about 100 days have beeninterpreted as evidence for the total energy output increasing with time. weshow in this work that flat lightcurves do not require addition of energy todecelerating external shock (which produced radio and mm emission viasynchrotron process), instead the flat behavior is due to inverse-comptoncooling of electrons by x-ray photons streaming through the external shock; thehigher x-ray flux at earlier times cools electrons more rapidly therebyreducing the emergent synchrotron flux, and this effect weakens as the x-rayflux declines with time.

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1412.0605	a directed search for gravitational waves from scorpius x-1 with initial  ligo	we present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitationalradiation, directed at the brightest low-mass x-ray binary, scorpius x-1. oursemi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of ligo s5 data ranging from 50-550 hz,and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{f}$-statistic powerdistributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. all candidates notremoved at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% falsealarm rate. we present bayesian 95% confidence upper limits ongravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: astandard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of scorpiusx-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagneticobservations. median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at150 hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. this proofof principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknowneffects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, butimproves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

0805.0144	what did we learn from gamma-ray burst 080319b ?	the optical and gamma-ray observations of grb 080319b allow us to determine afairly complete physical picture for this remarkable burst. the data indicatethat the prompt optical and gamma-ray photons were produced at the samelocation but by different radiation processes: synchrotron and synchrotronself-compton, respectively. the burst emission was produced at a distance of10^{16.5} cm from the center of explosion by an ultra-relativistic sourcemoving at lorentz factor of ~500. a straightforward inference is that about 10times more energy must have been radiated at tens of gev than that released at~1 mev. assuming that the grb outflow was baryonic and that the gamma-raysource was shock-heated plasma, the collimation-corrected kinetic energy of thejet powering grb 080319b was larger than 10^{52.3} erg. the decay of the earlyafterglow optical emission (up to 1 ks) is too fast to be attributed to thereverse shock crossing the grb ejecta but is consistent with the expectationsfor the "large-angle emission" released during the burst. the pure power-lawdecay of the optical afterglow flux from 1 ks to 10 day is most naturallyidentified with the (synchrotron) emission from the shock propagating into awind-like medium. however, the x-ray afterglow requires a departure from thestandard blast-wave model.

1506.06874	density driven fluctuations in a two-dimensional superconductor	in the vicinity of a phase transition, the order parameter starts fluctuatingbefore vanishing at the critical point. the fluctuation regime, i.e. the waythe ordered phase disappears, is a characteristics of a transition, anddetermines the universality class it belongs to. this is valid for thermaltransitions, but also for zero temperature quantum phase transitions (qpt).  in the case of superconductivity, the order parameter has an amplitude and aphase, which can both fluctuate according to well identified scenarios. theginzburg-landau theory and its extensions describe the fluctuating regime ofregular metallic superconductors, and the associated dynamics of the pairamplitude and the phase. when the system is two-dimensional and/or verydisordered, phase fluctuations dominate.  here, we address the possibility that a new type of fluctuations occurs insuperconductors with an anomalous dynamics. in particular we show that thesuperconducting to metal qpt that occurs upon changing the gate voltage intwo-dimensional electron gases at lao/sto and lto/sto interfaces displaysanomalous scaling properties, which can be explained by density drivensuperconducting critical fluctuations.  a finite size scaling (fss) analysis reveals that the product z.nu (nu is thecorrelation length exponent and z the dynamical critical one) is z.nu = 3/2. weargue that critical superconducting fluctuations acquire an anomalous dynamicswith z=3, since they couple to density ones in the vicinity of a spontaneouselectronic phase separation, and that nu=1/2 corresponds to the mean-fieldvalue. this approach strongly departs from the conventional z=1 scenario indisordered 2d systems based on long-range coulomb interactions with dominantphase fluctuations. this scenario can explain recent data in lsco ultra-thinfilms, and apply to a whole class of two-dimensional superconductors.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

0806.1226	adiabatic expansion, early x-ray data and the central engine in grbs	the swift satellite early x-ray data shows a very steep decay in most of thegamma-ray bursts light curves. this decay is either produced by the rapidlydeclining continuation of the central engine activity or by some left-overradiation starting right after the central engine shuts off. the latterscenario consists of the emission from an "ember" that cools via adiabaticexpansion and, if the jet angle is larger than the inverse of the sourcelorentz factor, the large angle emission. in this work, we calculate thetemporal and spectral properties of the emission from such a cooling ember,providing a new treatment for the micro-physics of the adiabatic expansion. weuse the adiabatic invariance of p_{\perp}^2/b (p_{\perp} is the component ofthe electrons' momentum normal to the magnetic field, b) to calculate theelectrons' lorentz factor during the adiabatic expansion; the electron momentumbecomes more and more aligned with the local magnetic field as the expansiondevelops. we compare the theoretical expectations of the adiabatic expansion(and the large angle emission) with the current observations of the early x-raydata and find that only about 20% of our sample of 107 bursts is potentiallyconsistent with this model. this leads us to believe that, for most bursts, thecentral engine does not turn off completely during the steep decay of the x-raylight curve; therefore, this phase is produced by the continued rapidlydeclining activity of the central engine.

astro-ph;0003246	analytic light-curves of gamma-ray burst afterglows: homogeneous versus  wind external media	assuming an adiabatic evolution of a gamma-ray burst (grb) remnantinteracting with an external medium, we calculate the injection, cooling, andabsorption break frequencies, and the afterglow flux for plausible orderings ofthe break and observing frequencies. the analytical calculations are restrictedto a relativistic remnant and, in the case of collimated ejecta, to the phasewhere there is an insignificant lateral expansion. results are given for both ahomogeneous external medium and for a wind ejected by the grb progenitor.  we compare the afterglow emission at different observing frequencies, foreach type of external medium. it is found that observations at sub-millimeterfrequencies during the first day provide the best way of discriminating betweenthe two models. by taking into account the effect of inverse comptonscatterings on the electron cooling, a new possible time-dependence of thecooling break is identified. the signature of the up-scattering losses could beseen in the optical synchrotron emission from a grb remnant interacting with apre-ejected wind, as a temporary mild flattening of the afterglow decay. theup-scattered radiation itself should be detected in the soft x-ray emissionfrom grb remnants running into denser external media, starting few hours afterthe main event.

0808.1558	quantum algorithm design using dynamic learning	we present a dynamic learning paradigm for "programming" a general quantumcomputer. a learning algorithm is used to find the control parameters for acoupled qubit system, such that the system at an initial time evolves to astate in which a given measurement corresponds to the desired operation. thiscan be thought of as a quantum neural network. we first apply the method to asystem of two coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (squids),and demonstrate learning of both the classical gates xor and xnor. training ofthe phase produces a gate congruent to the cnot modulo a phase shift. strikingout for somewhat more interesting territory, we attempt learning of anentanglement witness for a two qubit system. simulation shows a reasonablysuccessful mapping of the entanglement at the initial time onto the correlationfunction at the final time for both pure and mixed states. for pure states thismapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts;however, given that knowledge, this method can be used to measure theentanglement of an otherwise unknown state. the method is easily extended tomultiple qubits or to qunits.

astro-ph;0108045	fundamental physical parameters of collimated gamma-ray burst afterglows	we determine the basic physical characteristics of eight gamma-ray bursts --980519, 990123, 990510, 991028, 991216, 000301c, 000926 and 010222 -- bymodelling the broadband emission of their afterglows. we find that the burstkinetic energies after the grb phase are well clustered around a mean value of3e50 ergs. in contrast, the energy release in gamma-rays, after correcting forcollimated explosion, varies among bursts by more than an order of magnitude.  the jet initial apertures are the 2-14 degree range, mildly correlated withthe energy, half of the jets being narrower than ~3 deg. this implies that,within 100 mpc, there are about 10 grb remnants (expanding at ~0.1c) which canbe resolved with vlba.  for all eight afterglows the total energy in the shock-accelerated electronsis close to equipartition with protons. however the slope of the power-lawelectron distribution is not universal, varying between 1.4 and 2.8.  in at least half of the cases, the density structure of the medium isinconsistent with an r^{-2} profile. a homogeneous medium with density in the0.1-50 per cc range can accommodate the broadband emission of all afterglows,with the exception of 990123, for which we find the density to be less than0.01 per cc. if grbs arise from the core collapse of massive stars, then suchlow densities indicate the existence of superbubbles created by the supernovaeand winds within a cluster of massive stars.

astro-ph;0109124	properties of relativistic jets in gamma-ray burst afterglows	we extend our calculation of physical parameters of grb jets by modeling thebroadband emission of the afterglows 970508, 980519, 991208, 000926, 000418,and 010222. together with 990123, 990510, 991216, and 000301c, there are tenwell-observed afterglows for which the initial opening angle of the grb jet canbe constrained. the jet energies (after the grb phase) obtained for this set ofafterglows are within one decade around 5e50erg. with the exception of 000418,which requires a jet wider than 1/2 radians, the jet initial half-angle in theother cases ranges from 2 deg to 20 deg. we find that, in half of the cases, ahomogeneous ambient medium accommodates the afterglow emission better than thewind-like 1/r^2 profile medium expected around massive stars. the two types ofmedia give fits of comparable quality in four cases, a wind medium providing abetter description only for 970508. the circumburst densities we obtain are inthe 0.1-100 per cc range, with the exception of 990123, for which it is below0.01 per cc. if in all ten cases the observed grb durations are a good measureof the ejecta deceleration timescale, then the parameters obtained here lead tojet initial bulk lorentz factors between 70 and 300, anticorrelated with thejet initial aperture, and jet masses around 1e-6 m_sun. our results on the jetenergy, opening lorentz factor, and evacuation of material until break-outprovide constraints on theoretical models of grb jets.

astro-ph;0201322	off-axis afterglow emission from jetted gamma-ray bursts	we calculate gamma-ray burst afterglow light-curves from a relativistic jetof initial opening angle theta_0, as seen by observers at a wide range ofviewing angles, theta_obs, from the jet axis. we describe three increasinglymore realistic models and compare the resulting light-curves. an observer attheta_obs &lt; theta_0 should see a light curve very similar to that for anon-axis observer. an observer at theta_obs &gt; theta_0 should see a rising lightcurve at early times, the flux peaking when the jet lorentz factor sim1/theta_obs. after this time the flux is not very different from that seen byan on-axis observer. a strong linear polarization (&lt;40%) may occur near thepeak in the light curve, and slowly decay with time. we show that if grb jetshave a universal energy, then orphan afterglows associated with off-axis jetsshould be seen up to a constant theta_obs, therefore the detection rate oforphan afterglows would be proportional to the true grb rate. we also discussthe proposed connection between supernova 1998bw and grb 980425.

astro-ph;0211189	grb 021004: a massive progenitor star surrounded by shells	we present spectra of the optical transient of grb021004 obtained with thehobby-eberly telescope starting 15.48, 20.31 hours, and 4.84 days after theburst and a spectrum obtained with the h. j. smith 2.7 m telescope starting14.31 hours after the burst. grb021004 is the first afterglow whose spectrum isdominated by absorption lines from high ionization species with multiplevelocity components separated by up to 3000 km/s. we argue that these lines arelikely to come from shells around a massive progenitor star. the highvelocities and high ionizations arise from a combination of acceleration andflash-ionization by the burst photons and the wind velocity and steadyionization by the progenitor. we also analyze the broad-band spectrum and thelight curve. we distinguish six components along the line of sight: (1) thez~2.293 absorption lines arise from the wind of a massive star. for a mass lossrate of ~6 x 10^{-5} solar masses per year, this component also provides theexternal medium to create the afterglow light. (2) a second shell producesabsorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associatedwith the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in thepreceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) more distantclouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have beenionized by the burst. (4-6) the massive star wind has clumps with radii andover-densities of 0.022, 0.063, and 0.12 parsecs and 50%, 10%, and 10%respectively. the immediate progenitor of the burster could either be a wc-typewolf-rayet star or a highly evolved star whose original mass was just too smallfor it to become a wn-type wolf-rayet star.

astro-ph;0301032	the effect of angular structure of gamma-ray burst outflows on the  afterglow emission	we investigate analytically the effect of an anisotropic distribution of thekinetic energy within a relativistic fireball on the decay of the afterglowemission, focusing on axially symmetric fireballs with a uniform core and apower-law decrease with angle outside the core. the afterglow fall-off steepensafter the core becomes fully visible. for observer directions within the core,simple formulae are derived for the afterglow decay after the break, while foroff-core observers results are shown graphically. some criteria for assessingfrom observations the necessity of an angular structure and/or collimation aregiven. applying them to several afterglows with light-curve breaks, we findthat jets endowed with structure are required only if the circumburst mediumhas a wind-like (r^{-2}) stratification. numerical fits to the multiwavelengthemission of the afterglows 990510 and 000301c show that, for the former, theangular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy is not far from uniformity,and that, with a standard power-law electron distribution, the sharp steepeningof the r-band light-curve of the latter is better accommodated by a structuredjet than an uniform outflow. structured outflows may accommodate the shallowerlight-curve breaks observed in other afterglows.

astro-ph;0308273	the slow decay of some radio afterglows, a puzzle for the simplest grb  fireball model	abridged:  the decay of half of the grb radio afterglows with long temporal monitoringis significantly slower than at optical frequencies, contrary to what isexpected in the simplest fireball model. we investigate four ways to decouplethe radio and optical decays: an evolving index of the power-law distributionof the shock-accelerated electrons, the presence of a spectral break betweenthe two domains, a structured outflow, and a long-lived reverse shockcontribution to the afterglow emission. [...]  in the fourth scenario, it is assumed that the radio afterglow emissionarises in the reverse shock propagating in a steady stream of ejecta, whichcatch up with the decelerating grb remnant. this scenario can accommodate theproperties of the afterglows with slow radio decays and requires that theinjected energy is less than or comparable to the initial fireball energy,while other afterglow parameters have reasonable values.  for a jet, the transition to a semi-relativistic motion mitigates the radiodecay, however this scenario would work only when the slower radio decay isobserved well after the steeper optical fall-off. a structured outflow with arelativistic core, yielding a fast decaying optical emission, and anon-relativistic envelope, producing a slowly falling-off radio afterglow, isnot a viable solution, as it fails to decouple the radio and optical decays.

astro-ph;0309161	creation of electron--positron wind in gamma-ray bursts and its effect  on the early afterglow emission	we calculate the creation of electron--positron pairs in gamma-ray bursts(grbs) resulting from the collision between scattered and outward movinggamma-ray photons. the number of pairs exceeds the number of ambient mediumelectrons encountered by the grb ejecta up to ~ 10^{16} cm from the center ofexplosion. the shock resulting from the interaction of the ejecta with thepair-wind may brighten the afterglow synchrotron emission during the first fewminutes. even without this effect, the peak intensity of the optical afterglowincreases with the density of the surrounding medium. therefore, observationsof the optical flux at early times constrain the density of the circumburstmedium. if the electron and magnetic field energies behind the forward shocksweeping-up the pair-wind and the circumburst medium are as inferred from fitsto the broadband afterglow emission at 0.5-100 days, then the current upperlimits on the optical counterpart emission, set by the rotse and lotisexperiments, indicate that the circumburst medium within 0.01 pc is less densethan 100 cm^{-3} or, if a wind, corresponds to a progenitor mass-loss to windspeed ratio below 10^{-6} m_sun/yr/(1000 km/s).

astro-ph;0404588	prompt gamma-ray and early afterglow emission in the external shock  model	we describe our attempt to determine if gamma-ray burst (grb) and afterglowemissions could both arise in external shocks for simple grbs--burstsconsisting of just a few peaks in their lightcurves. we calculate peak flux andpeak frequency during the gamma-ray burst for ten well observed bursts usingthe same set of parameters that are determined from modeling afterglowemissions. we find the gamma-ray emission properties for 970508 (which had asingle peak lightcurve) fit nicely with the extrapolation of its afterglowdata, and therefore this burst was likely produced in the external shock. onecan explain two other bursts in this sample as forward shock synchrotronemission provided that the magnetic field parameter during the burst is closeto equipartition, and larger by a factor of 100 than the afterglow value at ~1day. the remaining seven bursts cannot be explained in the external shock modeleven if we allow the energy fraction in electrons and magnetic field and thedensity of the surrounding medium to take on any physically permitted value;the peak of the spectrum is above the cooling frequency, therefore the peakflux is independent of the latter of these two parameters, and is too small byabout an order of magnitude than the observed values. we have also consideredinverse-compton scattering in forward and reverse shock regions and find thatit can explain the gamma-ray emission for a few bursts, but requires thedensity to be 1--2 orders of magnitude larger than a typical wolf-rayet starwind and much larger than permitted by late afterglow observations.

astro-ph;0406027	analysis of two scenarios for the early optical emission of the grb  afterglows 990123 and 021211	the optical light-curves of grb afterglows 990123 and 021211 exhibit a steepdecay at 100--600 seconds after the burst, the decay becoming slower afterabout 10 minutes. we investigate two scenarios for the fast decaying earlyoptical emission of these grb afterglows. in the reverse-forward shockscenario, this emission arises in the reverse shock crossing the grb ejecta,the mitigation of the light-curve decay occurring when the forward shockemission overtakes that from the reverse shock. both a homogeneous andwind-like circumburst medium are considered. in the wind-bubble scenario, thesteeply decaying, early optical emission arises from the forward shockinteracting with a 1/r^2 bubble, with a negligible contribution from thereverse shock, the slower decay starting when the blast wave reaches the bubbletermination shock and enters a homogeneous region of the circumburst medium.  we determine the shock microphysical parameters, ejecta kinetic energy, andcircumburst density which accommodate the radio and optical measurements of thegrb afterglows 990123 and 021211. we find that, for a homogeneous medium, theradio and optical emissions of the afterglow 990123 can be accommodated by thereverse-forward shock scenario if the microphysical parameters behind the twoshocks differ substantially. a wind-like circumburst medium also allows thereverse-forward shocks scenario to account for the radio and optical propertiesof the afterglows 990123 and 021211, but the required wind densities are atleast 10 times smaller than those of galactic wolf-rayet stars. the wind-bubblescenario requires a variation of the microphysical parameters when theafterglow fireball reaches the wind termination shock, which seems a contrivedfeature.

astro-ph;0508087	reverse shock emission as a probe of grb ejecta	we calculate the reverse shock (rs) synchrotron emission in the optical andthe radio wavelength bands from electron-positron pair enriched gamma-ray burstejecta with the goal of determining the pair content of grbs using early timeobservations. we take into account an extensive number of physical effects thatinfluence radiation from the reverse-shock heated grb ejecta. we find thatoptical/ir flux depends very weakly on the number of pairs in the ejecta, andthere is no unique signature of ejecta pair enrichment if observations areconfined to a single wavelength band. it may be possible to determine if thenumber of pairs per proton in the ejecta is &gt; 100 by using observations inoptical and radio bands; the ratio of flux in the optical and radio at the peakof each respective reverse-shock light curve is dependent on the number ofpairs per proton. we also find that over a large parameter space, rs emissionis expected to be very weak; grb 990123 seems to have been an exceptional burstin that only a very small fraction of the parameter space produces opticalflashes this bright. also, it is often the case that the optical flux from theforward shock is brighter than the reverse shock flux at deceleration. thiscould be another possible reason for the paucity of prompt optical flashes witha rapidly declining light curve at early times as was seen in 990123 and021211. some of these results are a generalization of similar results reportedin nakar &amp; piran (2004).

astro-ph;0510677	swift observations of the x-ray bright grb 050315	this paper discusses swift observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 050315(z=1.949) from 80 s to 10 days after the onset of the burst. the x-ray lightcurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.however, both the prompt hard x-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the bat)and the first ~ 300 s of x-ray emission (observed by the xrt) can be explainedby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. extrapolating the batlight curve into the xrt band suggests the rapidly decaying, early x-rayemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strongsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray emission may be relatedto the simple temporal and spectral character of this x-ray rich grb. theprompt (bat) spectrum was a steep down to 15 kev, and appeared to continuethrough the xrt bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with theamati relation. following the initial steep decline the x-ray afterglow did notfade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index ofalpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.the apparent `plateau' in the x-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep x-ray lightcurves revealed by swift. if the second afterglow break is identified with ajet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying e_gamma&gt; 10^50 erg.

astro-ph;0511576	discovery of an afterglow extension of the prompt phase of two gamma ray  bursts observed by swift	bat and xrt observations of two recent well-covered grbs observed by swift,grb 050315 and grb 050319, show clearly a prompt component joining the onset ofthe afterglow emission. by fitting a power law form to the gamma-ray spectrum,we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the bat, in the energyband 15-350 kev, into the spectral regime observed by the xrt 0.2-10 kev, andexamine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. wefind that the bat and xrt light curves merge to form a unified curve. there isa period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. the durationof the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting forcosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for thedeceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellarmaterial. for grb 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by anexponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(bat) ~ 24+/-2 s, andt_e(xrt) ~ 35+/-2 s. for grb 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. the early time x-ray fluxes areconsistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, andprovide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-rayemission over a large dynamic range in flux. the initial steep decay isexpected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell ofrelativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. the overallconclusion is that the prompt phase of grbs remains observable for hundreds ofseconds longer than previously thought.

astro-ph;0602060	a unified picture for gamma-ray burst prompt and x-ray afterglow  emissions	data from the swift satellite has enabled us for the first time to provide acomplete picture of the gamma-ray burst emission mechanism and its relationshipwith the early afterglow emissions. we show that gamma-ray photons for twobursts, 050126 &amp; 050219a, for which we have carried out detailed analysis wereproduced as a result of the synchrotron self-compton process in the materialejected in the explosion when it was heated to a mildly relativistictemperature at a distance from the center of explosion of order thedeceleration radius. both of these bursts exhibit rapidly declining early x-rayafterglow lightcurves; this emission is from the same source that produced thegamma-ray burst. the technique we exploit to determine this is very general andmakes no assumption about any particular model for gamma-ray generation exceptthat the basic radiation mechanism is some combination of synchrotron andinverse-compton processes in a relativistic outflow. for grb 050219a we canrule out the possibility that energy from the explosion is carried outward bymagnetic fields, and that the dissipation of this field produced the$\gamma$-ray burst.

astro-ph;0607511	a spectacular radio flare from xrf 050416a at 40 days and implications  for the nature of x-ray flashes	we present detailed optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of thex-ray flash 050416a obtained with palomar and siding springs observatories aswell as hst and the vla, placing this event among the best-studied x-rayflashes to date. in addition, we present an optical spectrum from keck lrisfrom which we measure the redshift of the burst, z=0.6528. at this redshift theisotropic-equivalent prompt energy release was about 10^51 erg, and using astandard afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energyis a factor of 10 larger, e_k,iso ~ 10^52 erg. the lack of an observed jetbreak to t ~ 20 days indicates that the opening angle is larger than 7 deg andthe total beaming-corrected relativistic energy is larger than 10^50 erg. wefurther show that the burst produced a strong radio flare at t ~ 40 daysaccompanied by an observed flattening in the x-ray band which we attribute toan abrupt circumburst density jump or an episode of energy injection (eitherfrom a refreshed shock or off-axis ejecta). late-time observations with hstshow evidence for an associated supernova with peak optical luminosity roughlycomparable to that of sn 1998bw. next, we show that the host galaxy of xrf050416a is actively forming stars at a rate of at least 2 m_solar per year witha luminosity of l_b ~ 0.5l* and metallicity of z ~ 0.2-0.8 z_solar. finally, wediscuss the nature of xrf 050416a in the context of short-hard gamma-ray burstsand under the framework of off-axis and dirty fireball models for x-rayflashes.

astro-ph;0612504	a unified picture for the gamma-ray and prompt optical emissions of grb  990123	the prompt optical emission of grb 990123 was uncorrelated to the gamma-raylight-curve and exhibited temporal properties similar to those of thesteeply-decaying, early x-ray emission observed by swift at the end of manybursts. these facts suggest that the optical counterpart of grb 990123 was thelarge-angle emission released during (the second pulse of) the burst. if theoptical and gamma-ray emissions of grb 990123 have, indeed, the same originthen their properties require that (i) the optical counterpart was synchrotronemission and the gamma-rays arose from inverse-compton scatterings("synchrotron self-compton model"), (ii) the peak-energy of theoptical-synchrotron component was at ~20 ev, and (iii) the burst emission wasproduced by a relativistic outflow moving at lorentz factor &gt; 450 and at aradius &gt; 10^{15} cm, which is comparable to the outflow deceleration radius.because the spectrum of grb 990123 was optically thin above 2 kev, the magneticfield behind the shock must have decayed on a length-scale of &lt;1% of thethickness of the shocked gas, which corresponds to 10^6-10^7 plasmaskin-depths. consistency of the optical counterpart decay rate and its spectralslope (or that of the burst, if they represent different spectral components)with the expectations for the large-angle burst emission represents the mostdirect test of the unifying picture proposed here for grb 990123.

astro-ph;0702319	the nature of the outflow in gamma-ray bursts	the swift satellite has enabled us to follow the evolution of gamma-ray burst(grb) fireballs from the prompt gamma-ray emission to the afterglow phase. theearly x-ray and optical data obtained by telescopes aboard the swift satelliteshow that the source for prompt gamma-ray emission, the emission that heraldsthese bursts, is short lived and that its source is distinct from that of theensuing, long-lived afterglow. using these data, we determine the distance ofthe gamma-ray source from the center of the explosion. we find this distance tobe 1e15-1e16 cm for most bursts and we show that this is within a factor of tenof the radius of the shock-heated circumstellar medium (csm) producing thex-ray photons. furthermore, using the early gamma-ray, x-ray and optical data,we show that the prompt gamma-ray emission cannot be produced in internalshocks, nor can it be produced in the external shock; in a more general sensegamma-ray generation mechanisms based on shock physics have problems explainingthe grb data for the ten swift bursts analyzed in this work. a magnetic fielddominated outflow model for grbs has some attractive features, although theevidence in its favor is inconclusive. finally, the x-ray and optical dataallow us to provide an upper limit on the density of the csm of about 10protons per cubic cm at a distance of about 5e16 cm from the center ofexplosion.

0705.4659	on the nature of two superconducting transitions in the specific heat of  pros$_4$sb$_{12}$: effects of crystal grinding	specific heat, dc- and ac-magnetic susceptibility are reported for a largesingle crystal of pros$_4$sb$_{12}$ and, after grinding, its powder. the roomtemperature effective paramagnetic moment of the crystal was consistent withthe pr$^{3+}$ ionic configuration and full occupancy of the pr-sublattice. thecrystal showed two distinct anomalies in the specific heat and an overalldiscontinuity in $c/t$ of more than 1000 mj/k$^2$mol. the upper transition (at$t_{c1}$) was rounded, in an agreement with previous reports. the anomaly at$t_{c2}$ was very sharp, consistent with a good quality of the crystal. weobserved a shoulder in $\chi$' and two peaks in $\chi$'' below $t_{c1}$.however, there were no signatures in $\chi$' of the lower temperaturetransition. pros$_4$sb$_{12}$ is extremely sensitive to grinding, whichsuppresses the upper superconducting transition in both the specific heat andmagnetic susceptibility. $\delta c/t_{c}$ was reduced to 140 mj/k$^2$ mol inthe powdered sample. existing data on ground, polished, and sliced crystalssuggests the existence of a length scale of order 100 $\mu$, characterizing thehigher temperature superconducting phase.

cond-mat;0412640	the dynamics of thin vibrated granular layers	we describe a series of experiments and computer simulations on vibratedgranular media in a geometry chosen to eliminate gravitationally inducedsettling. the system consists of a collection of identical spherical particleson a horizontal plate vibrating vertically, with or without a confining lid.previously reported results are reviewed, including the observation ofhomogeneous, disordered liquid-like states, an instability to a `collapse' ofmotionless spheres on a perfect hexagonal lattice, and a fluctuating,hexagonally ordered state. in the presence of a confining lid we see a varietyof solid phases at high densities and relatively high vibration amplitudes,several of which are reported for the first time in this article. the phasebehavior of the system is closely related to that observed in confinedhard-sphere colloidal suspensions in equilibrium, but with modifications due tothe effects of the forcing and dissipation. we also review measurements ofvelocity distributions, which range from maxwellian to strongly non-maxwelliandepending on the experimental parameter values. we describe measurements ofspatial velocity correlations that show a clear dependence on the mechanism ofenergy injection. we also report new measurements of the velocityautocorrelation function in the granular layer and show that increasedinelasticity leads to enhanced particle self-diffusion.
