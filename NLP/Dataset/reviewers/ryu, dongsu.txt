0901.1702	self-similar evolution of cosmic-ray modified shocks: the cosmic-ray  spectrum	we use kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) to study thetime-dependent evolution of plane, quasi-parallel, cosmic-ray (cr) modifiedshocks. thermal leakage injection of low energy crs and finite alfv\'en wavepropagation and dissipation are included. bohm diffusion as well as thediffusion with the power-law momentum dependence are modeled. as long as theacceleration time scale to relativistic energies is much shorter than thedynamical evolution time scale of the shocks, the precursor and subshocktransition approach the time-asymptotic state, which depends on the shock sonicand alfv\'enic mach numbers and the cr injection efficiency. for the diffusionmodels we employ, the shock precursor structure evolves in an approximatelyself-similar fashion, depending only on the similarity variable, x/(u_s t).during this self-similar stage, the cr distribution at the subshock maintains acharacteristic form as it evolves: the sum of two power-laws with the slopesdetermined by the subshock and total compression ratios with an exponentialcutoff at the highest accelerated momentum, p_{max}(t). based on the results ofthe dsa simulations spanning a range of mach numbers, we suggest functionalforms for the shock structure parameters, from which the aforementioned form ofcr spectrum can be constructed. these analytic forms may represent approximatesolutions to the dsa problem for astrophysical shocks during the self-similarevolutionary stage as well as during the steady-state stage if p_{max} isfixed.

0906.4850	a study of the correlation of arrival directions of uhecrs with the  large scale structure of the universe	ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) are believed to originate fromastrophysical sources, which should trace the large scale structure (lss) ofthe universe. on the other hand, the magnetic field in the intergalactic space(igmf), which also traces the lss of the universe, deflects the trajectories ofthe charged uhecrs and spoils the positional correlation of the observed uhecrevents with their true sources. to explore this problem, we studied asimulation of the propagation of uhe protons through the magnetized lss of theuniverse, reported earlier in das et al. (2008), in which the igmf wasestimated based on a turbulence dynamo model (ryu et al. 2008). hypotheticalsources were placed inside clusters and groups of galaxies in the simulateduniverse, while observers were located inside groups of galaxies that havesimilar properties as the local group. we calculated the statistics of theangular distance between the arrival directions of simulated uhe proton eventsand the positions of candidate sources in our simulation. we compared thestatistics from our simulation with those calculated with the auger data. wediscussed the implication of our works on the nature of the sources of uhecrs.

0908.0610	characteristic lengths of magnetic field in magnetohydrodynamic  turbulence	in the framework of turbulence dynamo, flow motions amplify a weak seedmagnetic field through the stretching of field lines. although theamplification process has been a topic of active research, less attention hasbeen paid to the length scales of magnetic field. in this paper, we described anumerical study on characteristic lengths of magnetic field inmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence. we considered the case of very weak or zeromean magnetic field, which is applicable to the turbulence in the intergalacticspace. our findings are as follows. (1) at saturation, the peak of magneticfield spectrum occurs at $\sim l_0/2$, where $l_0$ is the energy injectionscale, while the most energy containing scale is $\sim l_0/5$. the peak scaleof spectrum of projected, two-dimensional field is $\sim l_0$. (2) during thestage of magnetic field amplification, the energy equipartition scale shows apower-law increase of $\sim t^{1.5}$, while the integral and curvature scalesshow a linear increase. the equipartition, integral, and curvature scalessaturate at $\sim l_0$, $\sim 0.3l_0$, and $\sim 0.15l_0$, respectively. (3)the coherence length of magnetic field defined in the faraday rotation measure(rm) due to the intergalactic magnetic field (igmf) is related to the integralscale. we presented a formula that expresses the standard deviation of rm,$\sigma_{rm}$, in terms of the integral scale and rms strength of the igmf, andestimated that $\sigma_{rm}$ would be $\sim 100$ and $\sim$ a few rad m$^{-2}$for clusters and filaments, respectively.

0910.0304	estimation of magnetic field strength in the turbulent warm ionized  medium	we studied faraday rotation measure (rm) in turbulent media with the rms machnumber of unity, using isothermal, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations.four cases with different values of initial plasma beta were considered. ourmain findings are as follows. (1) there is no strong correlation between thefluctuations of magnetic field strength and gas density. so the magnetic fieldstrength estimated with rm/dm (dm is the dispersion measure) correctlyrepresents the true mean strength of the magnetic field along the line ofsight. (2) the frequency distribution of rms is well fitted to the gaussian. inaddition, there is a good relation between the width of the distribution ofrm/$\bar{\rm rm}$ ($\bar{\rm rm}$ is the average value of rms) and the strengthof the regular field along the line of sight; the width is narrower, if thefield strength is stronger. we discussed the implications of our findings inthe warm ionized medium where the mach number of turbulent motions is aroundunity.

0704.1521	cosmological shock waves in the large scale structure of the universe:  non-gravitational effects	cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced byhierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. these shocksgovern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas andacceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (cr) particles. we study the statisticsand energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance$\lambda$cdm universe, with a special emphasis on the effects ofnon-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating,and galactic superwind feedbacks. adopting an improved model for gasthermalization and cr acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusiveshock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy andthe cr energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. sinceshocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine thevorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks incosmological simulations. we find that the dynamics and energetics of shocksare governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitationalprocesses do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation andvorticity generation at cosmological shocks. our results reinforce scenarios inwhich the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium containenergetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulentflow motions.

0910.3361	intergalactic magnetic field and arrival direction of ultra-high-energy  protons	we studied how the intergalactic magnetic field (igmf) affects thepropagation of super-gzk protons that originate from extragalactic sourceswithin the local gzk sphere. toward this end, we set up hypothetical sources ofultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (uhecrs), virtual observers, and the magnetizedcosmic web in a model universe constructed from cosmological structureformation simulations. we then arranged a set of reference objects mimickingactive galactic nuclei (agns) in the local universe, with which correlations ofsimulated uhecr events are analyzed. with our model igmf, the deflection anglebetween the arrival direction of super-gzk protons and the sky position oftheir actual sources is quite large with the mean value of $&lt;\theta &gt; \sim15^{\circ}$ and the median value of $\tilde \theta \sim 7 - 10^{\circ}$. on theother hand, the separation angle between the arrival direction and the skyposition of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with $&lt;s &gt; \sim3.5 - 4^{\circ}$, which is similar to the mean angular distance in the sky tonearest neighbors among the reference objects. this is a direct consequence ofour model that the sources, observers, reference objects, and the igmf alltrace the matter distribution of the universe. the result implies thatextragalactic objects lying closest to the arrival direction of uhecrs are notnecessary their actual sources. with our model for the distribution ofreference objects, the fraction of super-gzk proton events, whose closest agnsare true sources, is less than 1/3. we discussed implications of our findingsfor correlation studies of real uhecr events.

0912.1174	hydrodynamic simulations of oscillating shock waves in a sub-keplerian  accretion flow around black holes	we study the accretion processes on a black hole by numerical simulation. weuse a grid based finite difference code for this purpose. we scan the parameterspace spanned by the specific energy and the angular momentum and compare thetime-dependent solutions with those obtained from theoretical considerations.we found several important results (a) the time dependent flow behaves close toa constant height model flow in the pre-shock region and a flow with verticalequilibrium in the post-shock region. (c) the infall time scale in thepost-shock region is several times higher than the free-fall time scale. (b)there are two discontinuities in the flow, one being just outside of the innersonic point. turbulence plays a major role in determining the locations ofthese discontinuities. (d) the two discontinuities oscillate with two differentfrequencies and behave as a coupled harmonic oscillator. a fourier analysis ofthe variation of the outer shock location indicates higher power at the lowerfrequency and lower power at the higher frequency. the opposite is true whenthe analysis of the inner shock is made. these behaviours will haveimplications in the spectral and timing properties of black hole candidates.

1008.0429	diffusive shock acceleration in test-particle regime	we examine the test-particle solution for diffusive shock acceleration, basedon simple models for thermal leakage injection and alfv'enic drift. thecritical injection rate, \xi_c, above which the cosmic ray (cr) pressurebecomes dynamically significant, depends mainly on the sonic shock mach number,m, and preshock gas temperature, t_1. in the hot-phase interstellar medium(ism) and intracluster medium, \xi_c &lt; 10^{-3} for shocks with m &lt; 5, while\xi_c ~ 10^{-4}(t_1/10^6 k)^{1/2} for shocks with m &gt; 10. for t_1=10^6 k, forexample, the test-particle solution would be valid if the injection momentum,p_{inj} &gt; 3.8 p_{th}. this leads to the postshock cr pressure less than 10% ofthe shock ram pressure. if the alfv'en speed is comparable to the sound speedin the preshock flow, as in the hot-phase ism, the power-law slope of crspectrum can be significantly softer than the canonical test-particle slope.then the cr spectrum at the shock can be approximated by the revisedtest-particle power-law with an exponential cutoff at the highest acceleratedmomentum, p_{max}(t). an analytic form of the exponential cutoff is alsosuggested.

1009.0570	faraday rotation measure due to the intergalactic magnetic field	studying the nature and origin of the intergalactic magnetic field (igmf) isan outstanding problem of cosmology. measuring faraday rotation would be apromising method to explore the igmf in the large-scale structure (lss) of theuniverse. we investigated the faraday rotation measure (rm) due to the igmf infilaments of galaxies using simulations for cosmological structure formation.we employed a model igmf based on turbulence dynamo in the lss of the universe;it has an average strength of $&lt; b &gt; \sim 10$ ng and a coherence length ofseveral $\times\ 100\ h^{-1}$ kpc in filaments. with the coherence lengthsmaller than path length, the inducement of rm would be a random walk process,and we found that the resultant rm is dominantly contributed by the densitypeak along line of sight. the rms of rm through filaments at the presentuniverse was predicted to be $\sim 1\ {\rm rad\ m^{-2}}$. in addition, wepredicted that the probability distribution function of $|{\rm rm}|$ throughfilaments follows the log-normal distribution, and the power spectrum of rm inthe local universe peaks at a scale of $\sim 1\ h^{-1}$ mpc. our prediction ofrm could be tested with future instruments.

1012.4548	quasi-spherical, time-dependent viscous accretion flow: one-dimensional  results	we investigated the instability of advective accretion flow as a consequenceof angular momentum transfer in one-dimensional, quasi-spherical transonicaccretion flow around a non-rotating black hole. the code is designed toinclude the effects of viscosity; the hydrodynamics component preserves angularmomentum strictly with lagrangian and remap method in absence of viscosity,while the viscosity component updates viscous angular momentum transfer throughthe implicit method. we performed two tests to demonstrate the suitability ofthe code for accretion study. first, we simulated the inviscid, low angularmomentum, transonic accretion flow with shocks around a black hole, and thenthe subsonic, self-similar adaf solution around a newtonian object. bothsimulations fitted the corresponding analytical curves extremely well. we thensimulated a rotating, viscous, transonic fluid with shocks. we showed that forlow viscosity parameter, stable shocks at larger distance are possible. forhigher viscosity parameter, more efficient angular momentum transfer in thepost-shock disk makes the shock structure oscillatory. moreover, as the shockdrifts to larger distances, a secondary inner shock develops. we showed thatthe inner shock is the direct consequence of expansion of the outer shock, aswell as creation of regions with $\partial l / \partial r &lt; 0$ due to moreefficient angular momentum transfer near the inner sonic point. we showed thatall disk parameters, including emissivity, oscillate with the same period asthat of the shock oscillation. our simulation may have implication for lowfrequency qpos, e.g., gro j1655-40 and xte j1550-564.

1102.2561	re-acceleration of nonthermal particles at weak cosmological shock waves	we examine diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) of the pre-exisiting as well asfreshly injected populations of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (cr) particles at weakcosmological shocks. assuming simple models for thermal leakage injection andalfv\'enic drift, we derive analytic, time-dependent solutions for the twopopulations of crs accelerated in the test-particle regime. we then comparethem with the results from kinetic dsa simulations for shock waves that areexpected to form in intracluster media and cluster outskirts in the course oflarge-scale structure formation. we show that the test-particle solutionsprovide a good approximation for the pressure and spectrum of crs acceleratedat these weak shocks. since the injection is extremely inefficient at weakshocks, the pre-existing cr population dominates over the injected population.if the pressure due to pre-existing cr protons is about 5 % of the gas thermalpressure in the upstream flow, the downstream cr pressure can absorb typicallya few to 10 % of the shock ram pressure at shocks with the mach number $m \la3$. yet, the re-acceleration of cr electrons can result in a substantialsynchrotron emission behind the shock. the enhancement in synchrotron radiationacross the shock is estimated to be about a few to several for $m \sim 1.5$ and$10^2-10^3$ for $m \sim 3$, depending on the detail model parameters. theimplication of our findings for observed bright radio relics is discussed.

1109.4055	magnetic fields in the large-scale structure of the universe	magnetic fields appear to be ubiquitous in astrophysical environments. theirexistence in the intracluster medium is established through observations ofsynchrotron emission and faraday rotation. on the other hand, the nature ofmagnetic fields outside of clusters, where observations are scarce andcontroversial, remains largely unknown. in this chapter, we review recentdevelopments in our understanding of the nature and origin of intergalacticmagnetic fields, and in particular, intercluster fields. a plausible scenariofor the origin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields is for seedfields, created in the early universe, to be amplified by turbulent flowsinduced during the formation of the large scale structure. we present severalmechanisms for the generation of seed fields both before and afterrecombination. we then discuss the evolution and role of magnetic fields duringthe formation of the first starts. we describe the turbulent amplification ofseed fields during the formation of large scale structure and the nature of themagnetic fields that arise. finally, we discuss implications of intergalacticmagnetic fields.

1205.1895	diffusive shock acceleration simulations of radio relics	recent radio observations have identified a class of structures, so-calledradio relics, in clusters of galaxies. the radio emission from these sources isinterpreted as synchrotron radiation from gev electrons gyrating inmicrog-level magnetic fields. radio relics, located mostly in the outskirts ofclusters, seem to associate with shock waves, especially those developed duringmergers. in fact, they seem to be good structures to identify and probe suchshocks in intracluster media (icms), provided we understand the electronacceleration and re-acceleration at those shocks. in this paper, we describetime-dependent simulations for diffusive shock acceleration at weak shocks thatare expected to be found in icms. freshly injected as well as pre-existingpopulations of cosmic-ray (cr) electrons are considered, and energy losses viasynchrotron and inverse compton are included. we then compare the synchrotronflux and spectral distributions estimated from the simulations with those intwo well-observed radio relics in ciza j2242.8+5301 and zwcl0008.8+5215.considering that the cr electron injection is rather inefficient at weak shockswith mach number m &lt;~ a few, the existence of radio relics could indicate thepre-existing population of low-energy cr electrons in icms. the implication ofour results on the merger shock scenario of radio relics is discussed.

1212.3246	diffusive shock acceleration at cosmological shock waves	we reexamine nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (dsa) at cosmologicalshocks in the large scale structure of the universe, incorporatingwave-particle interactions that are expected to operate in collisionlessshocks. adopting simple phenomenological models for magnetic fieldamplification (mfa) by cosmic-ray (cr) streaming instabilities and alfv'enicdrift, we perform kinetic dsa simulations for a wide range of sonic andalfv'enic mach numbers and evaluate the cr injection fraction and accelerationefficiency. in our dsa model the cr acceleration efficiency is determinedmainly by the sonic mach number ms, while the mfa factor depends on thealfv'enic mach number and the degree of shock modification by crs. we show thatat strong cr modified shocks, if scattering centers drift with an effectivealfv'en speed in the amplified magnetic field, the cr energy spectrum issteepened and the acceleration efficiency is reduced significantly, compared tothe cases without such effects. as a result, the postshock cr pressuresaturates roughly at ~ 20 % of the shock ram pressure for strong shocks withms&gt;~ 10. in the test-particle regime (ms&lt;~ 3), it is expected that the magneticfield is not amplified and the alfv'enic drift effects are insignificant,although relevant plasma physical processes at low mach number shocks remainlargely uncertain.

1403.0325	exploring the intergalactic magnetic field by means of faraday  tomography	unveiling the intergalactic magnetic field (igmf) in filaments of galaxies isa very important and challenging subject in modern astronomy. in order to probethe igmf from rotation measures (rms) of extragalactic radio sources, we needto separate rms due to other origins such as the source, intervening galaxies,and our galaxy. in this paper, we discuss observational strategies for theseparation by means of faraday tomography (faraday rm synthesis). we consideran observation of a single radio source such as a radio galaxy or a quasarviewed through the galaxy and the cosmic web. we then compare the observationwith another observation of a neighbor source with a small angular separation.our simulations with simple models of the sources suggest that it would be noteasy to detect the rm due to the igmf of order ~ 1 rad/m/m, an expected valuefor the igmf through a single filament. contrary to it, we find that the rm ofat least ~10 rad/m/m could be detected with the ska or itspathfinders/precursors, if we achieve selections of ideal sources. theseresults would be improved if we incorporate decomposition techniques such asrmclean and qu-fitting. we discuss feasibility of the strategies for cases withcomplex galactic emissions as well as with effects of observational noise andradio frequency interferences.

1403.1420	shock waves and cosmic ray acceleration in the outskirts of galaxy  clusters	the outskirts of galaxy clusters are continuously disturbed by mergers andgas infall along filaments, which in turn induce turbulent flow motions andshock waves. we examine the properties of shocks that form within $r_{200}$ insample galaxy clusters from structure formation simulations. while most ofthese shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (crs), thereare a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of crprotons via diffusive shock acceleration. we show that the energetic shocksreside mostly in the outskirts and a substantial fraction of them are inducedby infall of the warm-hot intergalactic medium from filaments. as a result, theradial profile of the cr pressure in the intracluster medium is expected to bebroad, dropping off more slowly than that of the gas pressure, and might beeven temporarily inverted, peaking in the outskirts. the volume-integratedmomentum spectrum of cr protons inside $r_{200}$ has the power-law slope of$4.25 - 4.5$, indicating that the average mach number of the shocks of main crproduction is in the range of $\left&lt; m_s \right&gt;_{\rm cr} \approx 3 - 4$. wesuggest that some radio relics with relatively flat radio spectrum could beexplained by primary electrons accelerated by energetic infall shocks with $m_s&gt;~ 3$ induced in the cluster outskirts.

1405.0557	injection of $\kappa$-like suprathermal particles into diffusive shock  acceleration	we consider a phenomenological model for the thermal leakage injection in thediffusive shock acceleration (dsa) process, in which suprathermal protons andelectrons near the shock transition zone are assumed to have the so-called$\kappa$-distributions produced by interactions of background thermal particleswith pre-existing and/or self-excited plasma/mhd waves or turbulence. the$\kappa$-distribution has a power-law tail, instead of an exponential cutoff,well above the thermal peak momentum. so there are a larger number of potentialseed particles with momentum, above that required for participation in the dsaprocess. as a result, the injection fraction for the $\kappa$-distributiondepends on the shock mach number much less severely compared to that for themaxwellian distribution. thus, the existence of $\kappa$-like suprathermaltails at shocks would ease the problem of extremely low injection fractions,especially for electrons and especially at weak shocks such as those found inthe intracluster medium. we suggest that the injection fraction for protonsranges $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $10 &lt; \kappa_p &lt; 30$at quasi-parallel shocks, while the injection fraction for electrons becomes$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $\kappa_e &lt; 2$ atquasi-perpendicular shocks. for such $\kappa$ values the ratio of cosmic rayelectrons to protons naturally becomes $k_{e/p}\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, which isrequired to explain the observed ratio for galactic cosmic rays.

1406.3871	statistical techniques for detecting the intergalactic magnetic field  from large samples of extragalactic faraday rotation data	rotation measure (rm) grids of extragalactic radio sources have been widelyused for studying cosmic magnetism. but their potential for exploring theintergalactic magnetic field (igmf) in filaments of galaxies is unclear, sinceother faraday-rotation media such as the radio source itself, interveninggalaxies, and the interstellar medium of our galaxy are all significantcontributors. we study statistical techniques for discriminating the faradayrotation of filaments from other sources of faraday rotation in futurelarge-scale surveys of radio polarization. we consider a 30 degree times 30degree field-of-view toward the south galactic pole, while varying the numberof sources detected in both present and future observations. we select sourceslocated at high redshifts and toward which depolarization and opticalabsorption systems are not observed, so as to reduce the rm contributions fromthe sources and intervening galaxies. it is found that a high-pass filter cansatisfactorily reduce the rm contribution from the galaxy, since the angularscale of this component toward high galactic latitudes would be much largerthan that expected for the igmf. present observations do not yet provide asufficient source density to be able to estimate the rm of filaments. however,from the proposed approach with forthcoming surveys, we predict significantresiduals of rm that should be ascribable to filaments. the predicted structureof the igmf down to scales of 0.1 degree should be observable with data fromthe ska, if we achieve selections of sources toward which sight lines do notcontain intervening galaxies and rm errors are less than a few rad m-2.

1407.0098	faraday dispersion functions of galaxies	the faraday dispersion function (fdf), which can be derived from an observedpolarization spec- trum by faraday rotation measure synthesis, is a profile ofpolarized emissions as a function of faraday depth. we study intrinsic fdfsalong sight lines through face-on, milky-way-like galaxies by means of asophisticated galactic model incorporating 3d mhd turbulence, and investigatehow much the fdf contains information intrinsically. since the fdf reflectsdistributions of thermal and cosmic- ray electrons as well as magnetic fields,it has been expected that the fdf could be a new probe to examine internalstructures of galaxies. we, however, find that an intrinsic fdf along a sightline through a galaxy is very complicated, depending significantly on actualconfigurations of turbulence. we perform 800 realizations of turbulence, andfind no universal shape of the fdf even if we fix the global parameters of themodel. we calculate the probability distribution functions of the standarddeviation, skewness, and kurtosis of fdfs and compare them for models withdifferent global pa- rameters. our models predict that the presence of verticalmagnetic fields and large scale-height of cosmic-ray electrons tend to make thestandard deviation relatively large. contrastingly, differences in skewness andkurtosis are relatively less significant.

1507.08737	vorticity, shocks and magnetic fields in subsonic, icm-like turbulence	we analyze high resolution simulations of compressible, mhd turbulence withproperties resembling conditions in galaxy clusters. the flow is driven toturbulence mach number $\mathcal{m}_t \sim 1/2$ in an isothermal medium with aninitially very weak, uniform seed magnetic field ($\beta = p_g/p_b = 10^6$).since cluster turbulence is likely to result from a mix of sheared (solenoidal)and compressive forcing processes, we examine the distinct turbulenceproperties for both cases. in one set of simulations velocity forcing isentirely solenoidal ($\nabla\cdot \delta {\vec u} = 0$), while in the other itis entirely compressive ($\nabla\times \delta {\vec u} = 0$). both casesdevelop a mixture of solenoidal and compressive turbulent motions, since eachgenerates the other. the development of compressive turbulent motions leads toshocks, even when the turbulence is solenoidally forced and subsonic. shocks,in turn, produce and amplify vorticity, which is especially important incompressively forced turbulence. to clarify those processes we include a pairof appendices that look in detail at vorticity evolution in association withshocks. from our simulation analyses we find that magnetic fields amplified tonear saturation levels in predominantly solenoidal turbulence can actuallyenhance vorticity on small scales by concentrating and stabilizing shear. theproperties, evolution rates and relative contributions of the kinetic andmagnetic turbulent elements depend strongly on the character of the forcing.specifically, shocks are stronger, but vorticity evolution and magnetic fieldamplification are slower and weaker when the turbulence is compressivelyforced. we identify a simple relation to estimate characteristic shockstrengths in terms of the turbulence mach number and the character of theforcing. our results will be helpful in understanding flow motions in galaxyclusters.

astro-ph;0005444	properties of cosmic shock waves in large scale structure formation	we have examined the properties of shock waves in simulations of large scalestructure formation for two cosmological scenarios (a scdm and a lcdm withomega =1). large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments andgalaxy clusters (gcs) on a scale of circa 5 mpc/h in both cases. energeticmotions, both residual of past accretion history and due to current asymmetricinflow along filaments, generate additional, common shocks on a scale of about1 mpc/h, which penetrate deep inside gcs. also collisions between substructuresinside gcs form merger shocks. consequently, the topology of the shocks is verycomplex and highly connected. during cosmic evolution the comoving shocksurface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process inboth scenarios. accretion shocks have very high mach numbers (10-10^3), whenphoto-heating of the pre-shock gas is not included. the typical shock speed isof order v_{sh}(z) =h(z)lambda_{nl}(z), with lambda_{nl}(z) the wavelengthscale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch. however, the machnumber for shocks occuring within clusters is usually smaller (3-10), due tothe fact that the intracluster gas is already hot. statistical fits of shockspeed around gcs as a function of gcs temperature give power-law's in accordwith 1-d predictions. however, a very different result is obtained for fits ofthe shock radius, reflecting the very complex shock structures forming in 3-dsimulations. the in-flowing kinetic energy across such shocks, giving the poweravailable for cosmic-ray acceleration, is comparable to the cluster x-rayluminosity emitted from a central region of radius 0.5 mpc/h. considering theirlarge size and long lifetimes, those shocks are potentially interesting sitesfor cosmic-ray acceleration, if modest magnetic fields exist within them.

astro-ph;0007035	the parker instability in a thick gaseous disk ii: numerical simulations  in 2d	we present 2d, ideal-mhd numerical simulations of the parker instability in amulti-component warm disk model. the calculations were done using two numericalcodes with different algorithms, tvd and zeus-3d. the outcome of the numericalexperiments performed with both codes is very similar, and confirms the resultsof the linear analysis for the undular mode derived by kim et al. (2000): themost unstable wavelength is about 3 kpc and its growth timescale is between30-50 myr (the growth rate is sensitive to the position of the upper boundaryof the numerical grid). thus, the time and length scales of this multicomponentdisk model are substantially larger than those derived for thin disk models. weuse three different types of perturbations, random, symmetric, andantisymmetric, to trigger the instability. the antisymmetric mode is dominant,and determines the minimum time for the onset of the nonlinear regime. theinstability generates dense condensations and the final peak column densityvalue in the antisymmetric case, as also derived by kim et al. (2000), is abouta factor of 3 larger than its initial value. these wavelengths and densityenhancement factors indicate that the instability alone cannot be the mainformation mechanism of giant molecular clouds in the general interstellarmedium. the role of the instability in the formation of large-scalecorrugations along spiral arms is briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0008084	the magnetohydrodynamic kelvin-helmholtz instability: a  three-dimensional study of nonlinear evolution	we investigate through high resolution 3d simulations the nonlinear evolutionof compressible magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to the kelvin-helmholtzinstability. we confirm in 3d flows the conclusion from our 2d work that evenapparently weak magnetic fields embedded in kelvin-helmholtz unstable plasmaflows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability.in fact, that statement is strengthened in 3d by this work, because it showshow field line bundles can be stretched and twisted in 3d as the quasi-2d cat'seye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. in our simulations twistingof the field may increase the maximum field strength by more than a factor oftwo over the 2d effect. if, by these developments, the alfv\'en mach number offlows around the cat's eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggestmagnetic stresses will eventually destroy the cat's eye and cause the plasmaflow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable flow thatretains memory of the original shear. for our flow configurations the regime in3d for such reorganization is $4\lesssim m_{ax} \lesssim 50$, expressed interms of the alfv\'en mach number of the original velocity transition and theinitial alfv\'en speed projected to the flow plan. for weaker fields theinstability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early stages, and the cat's eyeis destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a 3d nature. then,the flows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropicturbulence. in this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magneticenergy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent amplification, which isretained long afterwards. the magnetic energy eventually catches up to thekinetic energy, and the nature of flows become magnetohydrodynamic.

astro-ph;0010472	winds and shocks in galaxy clusters: shock acceleration on an  intergalactic scale	we review the possible roles of large scale shocks as particle acceleratorsin clusters of galaxies. recent observational and theoretical work hassuggested that high energy charged particles may constitute a substantialpressure component in clusters. if true that would alter the expected dynamicalevolution of clusters and increase the dynamical masses consistent withhydrostatic equilibrium. moderately strong shocks are probably common inclusters, through the actions of several agents. the most obvious of theseagents include winds from galaxies undergoing intense episodes of starbursts,active galaxies and cosmic inflows, such as accretion and cluster mergers. wedescribe our own work derived from simulations of large scale structureformation, in which we have, for the first time, explicitly included passivecomponents of high energy particles. we find, indeed that shocks associatedwith these large scale flows can lead to nonthermal particle pressures bigenough to influence cluster dynamics. these same simulations allow us also tocompute nonthermal emissions from the clusters. here we present resultingpredictions of gamma-ray fluxes.

astro-ph;0010500	formation of proto-globular cluster clouds by thermal instability	many models of globular cluster formation assume the presence of cold denseclouds in early universe. here we re-examine the fall &amp; rees (1985) model forformation of proto-globular cluster clouds (pgccs) via thermal instabilities ina protogalactic halo. we first argue, based on the previous study by others,that under the protogalactic environments only nonlinear densityinhomogeneities can condense into pgccs. we then carry out numericalsimulations of the collapse of overdense clouds in one-dimensional sphericalgeometry, including self-gravity and radiative cooling down to t=10^4 k. sinceimprinting of jeans mass at 10^4 k is essential to this model, here we focus onthe cases where external uv background radiation prevents the formation of h2molecules and so prevent the cloud from cooling below 10^4 k. the quantitativeresults from these simulations can be summarized as follows: 1) perturbationssmaller than m_min ~ (10^{5.6} m_sun) (n_h/0.05 cm3)^{-2} cool isobarically,while perturbations larger than m_max ~ (10^8 m_sun) (n_h/0.05 cm3)^{-2} coolisochorically. on the other hand, intermediate size perturbations (m_min&lt;m_pgcc &lt; m_max) are compressed supersonically. 2) for supersonically collapsingclouds, the density compression factor after they cool to t_c=10^4 k range10^{2.5}-10^6. 3) for supersonically collapsing clouds the jeans mass can bereduced to as small as 10^{5.5} m_sun (n_h/0.05 cm3)^{-1/2} at the maximumcompression. 4) the density profile of simulated pgccs can be approximated by aconstant core with a halo of rho ~ r^{-2} rather than a singular isothermalsphere.

astro-ph;0012080	3d mhd simulations of radio galaxies including nonthermal electron  transport	we report on an effort to study the connections between dynamics in simulatedradio galaxy plasma flows and the properties of nonthermal electron populationscarried in those flows. to do this we have introduced a new numerical schemefor electron transport that allows a much more detailed look at this problemthan has been possible before. especially when the dynamics is fully threedimensional the flows are generally chaotic in the cocoon, and the jet itselfcan flail about violently. the bending jet can pinch itself off and redirectitself to enhance its penetration of the ambient medium. these behaviors ofteneliminate the presence of a strong jet termination shock, which is assumedpresent in all modern cartoon models of the rg phenomenon. instead a much morecomplex ``shock web'' forms near the end of the jet that leads to a far lesspredictable pattern of particle acceleration. similarly, the magnetic fields inthese flows are highly filamented, as well as spatially and temporallyintermittent. this leads to a very localized and complex pattern of synchrotronaging for relativistic electron populations, which makes it difficult to useproperties of the electron spectrum to infer the local rate of aging.

astro-ph;0104259	three-dimensional simulations of the parker instability in a  uniformly-rotating disk	we investigate the effects of rotation on the evolution of the parkerinstability in an exponentially-stratified and uniformly-rotating magnetizedgas disk by carrying out three-dimensional numerical simulations with anisothermal magnetohydrodynamic code. the instability has been initialized byrandom velocity perturbations. in the linear stage, the evolution is not muchdifferent from that without rotation and the mixed (undular + interchange) moderegulates the system. the interchange mode induces alternating dense andrarefied regions with small radial wavelengths, while the undular mode bendsthe magnetic field lines in the plane of azimuthal and vertical directions. inthe nonlinear stage, flow motion overall becomes chaotic as in the case withoutrotation. however, as the gas in higher positions slides down along field linesforming supersonic flows, the coriolis force becomes important. as oppositelydirected flows fall into valleys along both sides of magnetic field lines, theyexperience the coriolis force toward opposite directions, which twists magneticfield lines there. hence, we suggest that the coriolis force plays a role inrandomizing magnetic field. the three-dimensional density structure formed bythe instability is still sheet-like with the short dimension along the radialdirection, as in the case without rotation. however, the long dimension is nowslightly tilted with respect to the mean field direction. the shape of highdensity regions is a bit rounder. the maximum enhancement factor of thevertical column density relative to its initial value is about 1.5, which issmaller than that in the case without rotation. we conclude that uniformrotation doesn't change our point of view that the parker instability alone isnot a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0105465	cosmic ray protons accelerated at cosmological shocks and their impact  on groups and clusters of galaxies	we investigate the production of cosmic ray (cr) protons at cosmologicalshocks by performing, for the first time, numerical simulations of large scalestructure formation that include directly the acceleration, transport andenergy losses of the high energy particles. crs are injected at shocksaccording to the thermal leakage model and, thereafter, accelerated to apower-law distribution as indicated by the test particle limit of the diffusiveshock acceleration theory. the evolution of the cr protons accounts for lossesdue to adiabatic expansion/compression, coulomb collisions and inelastic p-pscattering. our results suggest that cr protons produced at shocks formed inassociation with the process of large scale structure formation could amount toa substantial fraction of the total pressure in the intra-cluster medium. theirpresence should be easily revealed by glast through detection of gamma-ray fluxfrom the decay of neutral pions produced in inelastic p-p collisions of such crprotons with nuclei of the intra-cluster gas. this measurement will allow adirect determination of the cr pressure contribution in the intra-clustermedium. we also find that the spatial distribution of cr is typically moreirregular than that of the thermal gas because it is more influenced by theunderlying distribution of shocks. this feature is reflected in the appearanceof our gamma-ray synthetic images. finally, the average cr pressuredistribution appears statistically slightly more extended than the thermalpressure.

astro-ph;0109303	the effect of the random magnetic field component on the parker  instability	the parker instability is considered to play important roles in the evolutionof the interstellar medium. most studies on the development of the instabilityso far have been based on an initial equilibrium system with a uniform magneticfield. however, the galactic magnetic field possesses a random component inaddition to the mean uniform component, with comparable strength of the twocomponents. parker and jokipii have recently suggested that the randomcomponent can suppress the growth of small wavelength perturbations. here, weextend their analysis by including gas pressure which was ignored in theirwork, and study the stabilizing effect of the random component in theinterstellar gas with finite pressure. following parker and jokipii, themagnetic field is modeled as a mean azimuthal component, $b(z)$, plus a randomradial component, $\epsilon(z) b(z)$, where $\epsilon(z)$ is a random functionof height from the equatorial plane. we show that for the observationallysuggested values of $&lt;\epsilon^2&gt;^{1/2}$, the tension due to the randomcomponent becomes important, so that the growth of the instability is eithersignificantly reduced or completely suppressed. when the instability stillworks, the radial wavenumber of the most unstable mode is found to be zero.that is, the instability is reduced to be effectively two-dimensional. wediscuss briefly the implications of our finding.

astro-ph;0211179	two-dimensional axisymmetric collapse of thermally unstable primordial  clouds	we have performed two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse ofisolated axisymmetric clouds condensing via radiative cooling in a primordialbackground gas. in order to study the development of the so-called``shape-instability'', we have considered two types of axisymmetric clouds,oblate and prolate clouds of various sizes and with axial ratios of $0.5 \leq{r_{\rm c,r}} /{r_{\rm c,z}} \leq 2$. we find that the degree of oblateness orprolateness is enhanced during the initial cooling phase. but it can bereversed later, if the initial contrast in cooling times between the cloud gasand the background gas is much greater than one. in such cases an oblate cloudcollapses to a structure composed of an outer thin disk and a central prolatecomponent. a prolate cloud, on the other hand, becomes a thin cigar-shapestructure with a central dense oblate component. the reversal of shape in thecentral part of the cooled clouds is due to supersonic motions either along thedisk plane in the case of oblate clouds or along the symmetry axis in the caseof prolate clouds. for a background gas of $t_h=1.7\times 10^6$k and $n_h=0.1\cm3$ in a protogalactic halo environment, the mean density of the cloud gasthat has cooled to $10^4$k increases to $100 n_h$ or so, in our simulationswhere nonequilibrium cooling is adopted and the background gas cools too. thespherical jeans mass of such gas is estimated to be about $m_j \sim5\times10^{7}\msun$. in order for cloud mass to exceed the jeans mass and atthe same time in order for the thermal instability to operate, the initialcloud size should be around $1 - 1.5 l_{\rm cool}$ where $l_{\rm cool}$ is thecooling length.

astro-ph;0211216	cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies	we argue that clusters of galaxies have an intergalactic medium, which ispermeated by strong magnetic fields and also has a contribution of pressurefrom cosmic rays. these two components of total pressure are probably highlytime dependent, and range probably between 1/10 of the gas pressure up toequipartition between gas pressure and the sum of the two other components.radio galaxies are likely to provide the main source for both magnetic fieldsand cosmic rays. in this concept it becomes easy to understand the occasionalmismatch between the total mass inferred from the assumption of hydrostaticequilibrium derived purely from gas, and the total mass derived from lensingdata. we also suggest that the structure and topology of the magnetic field maybe highly inhomogeneous - at least over a certain range of scales, and maycontain long twisted filaments of strong magnetic fields, as on the sun. theanalogy with the interstellar medium may be fruitful to explore further, wherewe do not know where magnetic fields come from, but suspect that the cosmicrays derive from supernova explosions. in such an analogy it becomes useful torefer to "radio galaxy explosions" in clusters of galaxies. a full scaleexploration of all the implications, especially of the notion that occasionallycomplete equipartition may be reached, is a task for the future.

astro-ph;0211365	clusters of galaxies: shock waves and cosmic rays	recent observations of galaxy clusters in radio and x-ray indicate thatcosmic rays and magnetic fields may be energetically important in theintracluster medium. according to the estimates based on theses observationalstudies, the combined pressure of these two components of the intraclustermedium may range between $10% \sim 100 %$ of gas pressure, although their totalenergy is probably time dependent. hence, these non-thermal components may haveinfluenced the formation and evolution of cosmic structures, and may provideunique and vital diagnostic information through various radiations emitted viatheir interactions with surrounding matter and cosmic background photons. wesuggest that shock waves associated with cosmic structures, along withindividual sources such as active galactic nuclei and radio galaxies, supplythe cosmic rays and magnetic fields to the intracluster medium and tosurrounding large scale structures. in order to study 1) the properties ofcosmic shock waves emerging during the large scale structure formation of theuniverse, and 2) the dynamical influence of cosmic rays, which were ejected byagn-like sources into the intracluster medium, on structure formation, we haveperformed two sets of n-body/hydrodynamic simulations of cosmic structureformation. in this contribution, we report the preliminary results of thesesimulations.

astro-ph;0301625	the effect of cosmic ray diffusion on the parker instability	the parker instability, which has been considered as a process governing thestructure of the interstellar medium, is induced by the buoyancy of magneticfield and cosmic rays. in previous studies, while the magnetic field has beenfully incorporated in the context of isothermal magnetohydrodynamics, cosmicrays have been normally treated with the simplifying assumption of infinitediffusion along magnetic field lines but no diffusion across them. the cosmicray diffusion is, however, finite. in this work, we take into account fully thediffusion process of cosmic rays in a linear stability analysis of the parkerinstability. cosmic rays are described with the diffusion-convection equation.with realistic values of cosmic ray diffusion coefficients expected in theinterstellar medium, we show that the result of previous studies with thesimplifying assumption on cosmic ray diffusion applies well. finiteness ofparallel diffusion decreases the growth rate of the parker instability, whilethe relatively smaller perpendicular diffusion has no significant effect. wediscuss the implication of our result on the role of the parker instability inthe interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0507591	density power spectrum of compressible hydrodynamic turbulent flows	turbulent flows are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, andunderstanding density structures and their statistics in turbulent media is ofgreat importance in astrophysics. in this paper, we study the density powerspectra, $p_{\rho}$, of transonic and supersonic turbulent flows through oneand three-dimensional simulations of driven, isothermal hydrodynamic turbulencewith root-mean-square mach number in the range of $1 \la m_{\rm rms} \la 10$.  from one-dimensional experiments we find that the slope of the density powerspectra becomes gradually shallower as the rms mach number increases. it isbecause the density distribution transforms from the profile with {\itdiscontinuities} having $p_{\rho} \propto k^{-2}$ for $m_{\rm rms} \sim 1$ tothe profile with {\it peaks} having $p_{\rho} \propto k^0$ for $m_{\rm rms} \gg1$. we also find that the same trend is carried to three-dimension; that is,the density power spectrum flattens as the mach number increases. but thedensity power spectrum of the flow with $m_{\rm rms} \sim 1$ has the kolmogorovslope. the flattening is the consequence of the dominant density structures of{\it filaments} and {\it sheets}. observations have claimed different slopes ofdensity power spectra for electron density and cold h i gas in the interstellarmedium. we argue that while the kolmogorov spectrum for electron densityreflects the {\it transonic} turbulence of $m_{\rm rms} \sim 1$ in the warmionized medium, the shallower spectrum of cold h i gas reflects the {\itsupersonic} turbulence of $m_{\rm rms} \sim$ a few in the cold neutral medium.

astro-ph;0507623	3d simulations of mhd jet propagation through uniform and stratified  external environments	we present a set of high-resolution 3d mhd simulations of steady light,supersonic jets, exploring the influence of jet mach number and the ambientmedium on jet propagation and energy deposition over long distances. theresults are compared to simple self-similar scaling relations for themorphological evolution of jet-driven structures and to previously published 2dsimulations. for this study we simulated the propagation of light jets withinternal mach numbers 3 and 12 to lengths exceeding 100 initial jet radii inboth uniform and stratified atmospheres.  the propagating jets asymptotically deposit approximately half of theirenergy flux as thermal energy in the ambient atmosphere, almost independent ofjet mach number or the external density gradient. nearly one-quarter of the jettotal energy flux goes directly into dissipative heating of the icm, supportingarguments for effective feedback from agns to cluster media. the remainingenergy resides primarily in the jet and cocoon structures. despite havingdifferent shock distributions and magnetic field features, global trends inenergy flow are similar among the different models.  as expected the jets advance more rapidly through stratified atmospheres thanuniform environments. the asymptotic head velocity in king-type atmospheresshows little or no deceleration. this contrasts with jets in uniform media withheads that are slowed as they propagate. this suggests that the energydeposited by jets of a given length and power depends strongly on the structureof the ambient medium. while our low-mach jets are more easily disrupted, theircocoons obey evolutionary scaling relations similar to the high-mach jets.

astro-ph;0509127	molecular cloud evolution. i. molecular cloud and thin cnm sheet  formation	we discuss molecular cloud formation by large-scale supersonic compressionsin the diffuse warm neutral medium (wnm). initially, a shocked layer forms, andwithin it, a thin cold layer. an analytical model and high-resolution 1dsimulations predict the thermodynamic conditions in the cold layer. after $\sim1$ myr of evolution, the layer has column density $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{19}\psc$, thickness $\sim 0.03$ pc, temperature $\sim 25$ k and pressure $\sim6650$ k $\pcc$. these conditions are strongly reminiscent of those recentlyreported by heiles and coworkers for cold neutral medium sheets. in the 1dsimulations, the inflows into the sheets produce line profiles with a centralline of width $\sim 0.5 \kms$ and broad wings of width $\sim 1 \kms$. 3dnumerical simulations show that the cold layer develops turbulent motions andincreases its thickness, until it becomes a fully three-dimensional turbulentcloud. fully developed turbulence arises on times ranging from $\sim 7.5$ myrfor inflow mach number $\mr = 2.4$ to $&gt; 80$ myr for $\mr = 1.03$. thesenumbers should be considered upper limits. the highest-density turbulent gas(hdg, $n &gt; 100 \pcc$) is always overpressured with respect to the mean wnmpressure by factors 1.5--4, even though we do not include self-gravity. theintermediate-density gas (idg, $10 &lt; n [{\rm cm}^ {-3}] &lt; 100$) has asignificant pressure scatter that increases with $\mr$, so that at $\mr = 2.4$,a significant fraction of the idg is at a higher pressure than the hdg. ourresults suggest that the turbulence and at least part of the excess pressure inmolecular clouds can be generated by the compressive process that forms theclouds themselves, and that thin cnm sheets may be formed transiently by thismechanism, when the compressions are only weakly supersonic.

astro-ph;0604536	effects of rotation on thermal-gravitational instability in the  protogalactic disk environment	thermal-gravitational instability (tgi) is studied in the protogalacticenvironment. we extend our previous work, where we found that dense clumpsfirst form out of hot background gas by thermal instability and later a smallfraction of them grow to virialized clouds of mass m_c &gt;~ 6x10^6 m_sun bygravitational infall and merging. but these clouds have large angular momentum,so they would be difficult, if not impossible, to further evolve into globularclusters. in this paper, through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ina uniformly rotating frame, we explore if the coriolis force due to rotation inprotogalactic disk regions can hinder binary merging and reduce angularmomentum of the clouds formed. with rotation comparable to the galacticrotation at the solar circle, the coriolis force is smaller than the pressureforce during the early thermal instability stage. so the properties of clumpsformed by thermal instability are not affected noticeably by rotation, exceptincreased angular momentum. however, during later stage the coriolis forcebecomes dominant over the gravity, and hence the further growth togravitationally bound clouds by gravitational infall and merging is prohibited.our results show that the coriolis force effectively destroys the picture ofcloud formation via tgi, rather than alleviate the problem of large angularmomentum.

astro-ph;0610474	hydrodynamic interactions of relativistic extragalactic jets with dense  clouds	we have studied three-dimensional hydrodynamic interactions of relativisticextragalactic jets with two-phase ambient media. these jets propagate through adenser homogeneous gas and then impact clouds with densities 100 to 1000 timeshigher than the initial beam density. the deflection angle of the jet isinfluenced more by the density contrast of the cloud than by the beam machnumber of the jet. a relativistic jet with low relativistic beam mach numbercan eventually be slightly bent after it crosses the dense cloud; however, wehave not seen permanently bent structures in the interaction of a highrelativistic beam mach number jet with a cloud. the relativistic jet impacts ondense clouds do not necessarily destroy the clouds completely, and much of thecloud body can survive as a coherent blob. this enhancement of cloud durabilityis partly due to the geometric influence of the off-axis collisions we considerand also arises from the lower rate of cloud fragmentation through thekelvin-helmholtz instability for relativistic jets. to compare our simulationswith observed extragalactic radio jets, we have computed the approximatesurface distributions of synchrotron emission at different viewing angles.these surface intensity maps show relativistic jets interacting with clouds canproduce synchrotron emission knots similar to structures observed in manyvlbi-scale radio sources. we find that the synchrotron emission increasessteeply at the moment of impact and the emission peaks right before the jetpasses through the cloud.

astro-ph;9607141	the protogalactic origin for cosmic magnetic fields	it is demonstrated that strong magnetic fields are produced from a zeroinitial magnetic field during the pregalactic era, when galaxies are firstforming. their development proceeds in three phases. in the first phase, weakmagnetic fields are created by the biermann battery mechanism, acting inshocked parts of the intergalactic medium where caustics form and intersect. inthe second phase, these weak magnetic fields are amplified to strong magneticfields by the kolmogoroff turbulence endemic to gravitational structureformation of galaxies. during this second phase, the magnetic fields reachsaturation with the turbulent power, but they are coherent only on the scale ofthe smallest eddy. in the third phase, the magnetic field strength increases toequipartition with the turbulent energy, and the coherence length of themagnetic fields increases to the scale of the largest turbulent eddy,comparable to the scale of the entire galaxy. the resulting magnetic fieldrepresents a galactic magnetic field of primordial origin. no further dynamoaction is necessary, after the galaxy forms, to explain the origin of magneticfields. however, the magnetic field may be altered by dynamo action once thegalaxy and the galactic disk have formed. it is first shown by direct numericalsimulations, that thermoelectric currentsassociated with the biermann battery,build the field up from zero to $10^{-21}$ g in the regions about to collapseinto galaxies, by $z\sim3$. for weak fields, in the absence of dissipation, thecyclotron frequency ${\bf \omega_{cyc}}=e{\bf b } /m_h c $ and $ {\bf\omega}/(1+ \chi )$, where ${\bf \omega = \nabla \times v }$ is the vorticityand $\chi$ is the degree of ionization, satisfy the same equations, and initialconditions ${\bf \omega_{cyc}=\omega}=0$, so that, ${\bf \omega_{cyc}}({\bf

astro-ph;9703072	the parker instability under a linear gravity	a linear stability analysis has been done to a magnetized disk under a lineargravity. we have reduced the linearized perturbation equations to asecond-order differential equation which resembles the schr\"{o}dinger equationwith the potential of a harmonic oscillator. depending on the signs of energyand potential terms, eigensolutions can be classified into ``continuum'' and``discrete'' families. when magnetic field is ignored, the continuum family isidentified as the convective mode, while the discrete family asacoustic-gravity waves. if the effective adiabatic index $\gamma$ is less thanunity, the former develops into the convective instability. when a magneticfield is included, the continuum and discrete families further branch intoseveral solutions with different characters. the continuum family is dividedinto two modes: one is the original parker mode, which is a slow mhd modemodulated by the gravity, and the other is a stable alfv\'en mode. the parkermodes can be either stable or unstable depending on $\gamma$. when $\gamma$ issmaller than a critical value $\gamma_{cr}$, the parker mode becomes unstable.the discrete family is divided into three modes: a stable fast mhd modemodulated by the gravity, a stable slow mhd mode modulated by the gravity, andan unstable mode which is also attributed to a slow mhd mode. the unstablediscrete mode does not always exist. even though the unstable discrete modeexists, the parker mode dominates it if the parker mode is unstable. however,if $\gamma \ge \gamma_{cr}$, the discrete mode could be the only unstable one.when $\gamma$ is equal $\gamma_{cr}$, the minimum growth time of the unstablediscrete mode is $1.3 \times 10^8$ years with a corresponding length scale of2.4 kpc. it is suggestive that the corrugatory features seen in the galaxy andexternal galaxies are related to the unstable discrete mode.

astro-ph;9706208	hydrodynamics of cloud collisions in 2d: the fate of clouds in a  multi-phase medium	we have studied head-on collisions between equal-mass, mildly supersonic(mach number 1.5) hi clouds, in a standard two-phase ism (t_cl = 74 k, n_cl =22 cm^-3, \chi = 100). we explore the role of various factors, including theradiative cooling parameter \eta = t_rad/t_coll (t_coll=r_c/v_c), evolutionarymodifications on the cloud structure (by colliding clouds ``evolved'' throughindependent motion within the intercloud medium (wim)), and the symmetry of theproblem (by colliding initially identical clouds, evolved to different agesbefore impact). the presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material inthe cloud wake, developed during such evolution through the wim, significantlyalters these interactions with respect to the standard case of non-evolvedclouds.  in general, in our adiabatic collisions the clouds are disrupted and converttheir gas into a few low density contrast clumps. by contrast, for symmetricradiative cases we find that the two clouds coalesce, with almost all theinitial kinetic energy radiated away. on the other hand, for both adiabatic andradiative collisions, asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency todisrupt the two clouds. fragmentation of the clouds may occur, andinstabilities are in general enhanced. in addition, radiative cooling is lessefficient in our asymmetric interactions, so that those parts of the cloudsthat initially seem to merge are more likely to re-expand and fade into thewim. since the majority of real cloud collisions should be asymmetric for onereason or another, we conclude that most gasdynamical diffuse cloud collisionswill be disruptive, at least in the absence of significant self-gravity or of asignificant magnetic field.

astro-ph;9709250	the supergalactic structure and the origin of the highest energy cosmic  rays	the recent discoveries of several reliable events of high energy cosmic raysat an energy above 10^20 ev raise questions about their path through the nearbyuniverse. the two analyses of the haverah park data set and the akeno data setappear to have an inconsistent pattern. both data sets showed some measure of acorrelation with the supergalactic plane, the locus of cosmologically nearbygalaxies, radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies. we need a reasonable modelof the true intergalactic magnetic field. using recent cosmological simulationsof structure formation in the universe, we estimate the magnetic fields whichcorrespond to the upper limits in the rotation measure to distant radiosources. we estimate that the magnetic field strength in supergalactic sheetsand filaments may be in the range of 0.1 to 1 mug. if such strengths arerealized inside our local supercluster, this opens up the possibility to focuscharged particles in the direction perpendicular to the supergalatic plane,analoguously but in the opposite direction to solar wind modulation. iffocusing exists, it means that for all particles captured into the sheets, thedilution with distance d is 1/d instead of 1/d^2. this means in effect, that wemay see sources to much larger distances than expected sofar. this effect isrelevant only for energies for which the possible distances are smaller thanthe void scale of the cosmological galaxy distribution, in the range possiblyup to 100 mpc.

astro-ph;9709252	cosmic structure of magnetic fields	the simulations of the formation of cosmological structure allows todetermine the spatial inhomogeneity of cosmic magnetic fields. suchsimulations, however, do not give an absolute number for the strength of themagnetic field due to insufficient spatial resolution. combining thesesimulations with observations of the rotation measure to distant radio sourcesallows then to deduce upper limits for the strength of the magnetic field.these upper limits are of order 0.2 - 2 mug along the filaments and sheets ofthe galaxy distribution. in one case, the sheet outside the coma cluster, thereis a definitive estimate of the strength of the magnetic field consistent withthis range. such estimates are almost three orders of magnitude higher thanhitherto assumed usually. high energy cosmic ray particles can be eitherfocussed or strongly scattered in such magnetic filaments and sheets, dependingon the initial transverse momentum. the cosmological background in radio andx-ray wavelengths will have contributions from these intergalactic filamentsand sheets, should the magnetic fields really be as high as 0.2 - 2 mug.

astro-ph;9803275	cosmic magnetic fields in large scale filaments and sheets	we consider the possibility that cosmic magnetic field, instead of beinguniformly distributed, is strongly correlated with the large scale structure ofthe universe. then, the observed rotational measure of extra-galactic radiosources would be caused mostly by the clumpy magnetic field in cosmologicalfilaments/sheets rather than by a uniform magnetic field, which was oftenassumed in previous studies. as a model for the inhomogeneity of thecosmological magnetic field, we adopt a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,where the field is passively included, and can approximately represent the realfield distribution with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength.then, we derive an upper limit of the magnetic field strength by comparing theobserved limit of rotational measure with the rotational measure expected fromthe magnetic field geometry in the simulated model universe. the resultingupper limit to the magnetic field in filaments and sheets is ${\bar b}_{fs} \la1 \mu g$ which is $\sim10^3$ times higher than the previously quoted values.this value is close to, but larger than, the equipartition magnetic fieldstrength in filaments and sheets. the amplification mechanism of the magneticfield to the above strength is uncertain. the implications of such a strengthof the cosmic magnetic field are discussed.

astro-ph;9807228	a divergence-free upwind code for multidimensional magnetohydrodynamic  flows	a description is given for preserving ${\bmsy\nabla}\cdot{\vec b}=0$ in amagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) code that employs the upwind, total variationdiminishing (tvd) scheme and the strang-type operator splitting formulti-dimensionality. the method is based on the staggered mesh technique toconstrain the transport of magnetic field: the magnetic field components aredefined at grid interfaces with their advective fluxes on grid edges, whileother quantities are defined at grid centers. the magnetic field at gridcenters for the upwind step is calculated by interpolating the values from gridinterfaces. the advective fluxes on grid edges for the magnetic field evolutionare calculated from the upwind fluxes at grid interfaces. then, the magneticfield can be maintained with ${\bmsy\nabla}\cdot{\vec b}=0$ exactly, if this isso initially, while the upwind scheme is used for the update of fluidquantities. the correctness of the code is demonstrated through tests comparingnumerical solutions either with analytic solutions or with numerical solutionsfrom the code using an explicit divergence-cleaning method. also the robustnessis shown through tests involving realistic astrophysical problems.

astro-ph;9808174	magnetohydrodynamics of cloud collisions in a multi-phase interstellar  medium	we extend previous studies of the physics of interstellar cloud collisions bybeginning investigation of the role of magnetic fields through 2dmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) numerical simulations. we study head-on collisionsbetween equal mass, mildly supersonic diffuse clouds. we include a moderatemagnetic field and two limiting field geometries, with the field lines parallel(aligned) and perpendicular (transverse) to the colliding cloud motion. weexplore both adiabatic and radiative cases, as well as symmetric and asymmetricones. we also compute collisions between clouds evolved through prior motion inthe intercloud medium and compare with unevolved cases.  we find that: in the (i) aligned case, adiabatic collisions, like their hdcounterparts, are very disruptive, independent of the cloud symmetry. however,when radiative processes are taken into account, partial coalescence takesplace even in the asymmetric case, unlike the hd calculations. in the (ii)transverse case, collisions between initially adjacent unevolved clouds arealmost unaffected by magnetic fields. however, the interaction with themagnetized intercloud gas during the pre-collision evolution produces a regionof very high magnetic energy in front of the cloud. in collisions betweenevolved clouds with transverse field geometry, this region acts like a``bumper'', preventing direct contact between the clouds, and eventuallyreverses their motion. the ``elasticity'', defined as the ratio of the final tothe initial kinetic energy of each cloud, is about 0.5-0.6 in the cases weconsidered. this behavior is found both in adiabatic and radiative cases.

astro-ph;9808244	three-dimensional evolution of the parker instability under a uniform  gravity	using an isothermal mhd code, we have performed three-dimensional,high-resolution simulations of the parker instability. the initial equilibriumsystem is composed of exponentially-decreasing isothermal gas and magneticfield (along the azimuthal direction) under a uniform gravity. the evolution ofthe instability can be divided into three phases: linear, nonlinear, andrelaxed. during the linear phase, the perturbations grow exponentially with apreferred scale along the azimuthal direction but with smallest possible scalealong the radial direction, as predicted from linear analyses. during thenonlinear phase, the growth of the instability is saturated and flow motionbecomes chaotic. magnetic reconnection occurs, which allows gas to cross fieldlines. this, in turn, results in the redistribution of gas and magnetic field.the system approaches a new equilibrium in the relaxed phase, which isdifferent from the one seen in two-dimensional works. the structures formedduring the evolution are sheet-like or filamentary, whose shortest dimension isradial. their maximum density enhancement factor relative to the initial valueis less than 2. since the radial dimension is too small and the densityenhancement is too low, it is difficult to regard the parker instability aloneas a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.

astro-ph;9809081	simulating electron transport and synchrotron emission in radio  galaxies: shock acceleration and synchrotron aging in axis-symmetric flows	we introduce a simple and economical but effective method for includingrelativistic electron transport in multi-dimensional simulations of radiogalaxies. the method is designed to follow explicitly diffusive acceleration atshocks, and, in smooth flows 2nd order fermi acceleration plus adiabatic andsynchrotron cooling. we are able to follow both the spatial and energydistributions of the electrons, so that direct synchrotron emission propertiescan be modeled in time-dependent flows for the first time.  here we present first results in the form of some axis-symmetric mhdsimulations of mach 20 light jet flows. these show clearly the importance ofnonsteady terminal shocks that develop in such flows even when the jet inflowis steady. as a result of this and other consequences of the fundamentallydriven character of jets, we find complex patterns of emissivities andsynchrotron spectra, including steep spectral gradients in hot spots, islandsof distinct spectra electrons within the lobes and spectral gradients comingfrom the dynamical histories of a given flow element rather than fromsynchrotron aging of the embedded electrons. in addition, spectral aging in thelobes tends to proceed more slowly than one would estimate from regions of highemissivity.

astro-ph;9901048	on the exchange of kinetic and magnetic energy between clouds and the  interstellar medium	we investigate, through 2d mhd numerical simulations, the interaction of auniform magnetic field oblique to a moving interstellar cloud. in particular weexplore the transformation of cloud kinetic energy into magnetic energy as aresult of field line stretching. some previous simulations have emphasized thepossible dynamical importance of a ``magnetic shield'' formed around cloudswhen the magnetic field is perpendicular to the cloud motion (jones et al.1996, miniati et al. 1998). it was not clear, however, how dependent thosefindings were to the assumed field configuration and cloud properties. toexpand our understanding of this effect, we examine several new cases by varingthe magnetic field orientation angle with respect to the cloud motion (\theta),the cloud-background density contrast, and the cloud mach number.  we show that in 2d and with \theta large enough, the magnetic field tensioncan become dominant in the dynamics of the motion of high density contrast, lowmach number clouds. in such cases a significant fraction of cloud kineticenergy can be transformed into magnetic energy with the magnetic pressure atthe cloud nose exceeding the ram pressure of the impinging flow. we derive acharacteristic timescale for this process of energy ``conversion''. we findalso that unless the cloud motion is highly aligned to the magnetic field,reconnection through tearing mode instabilities in the cloud wake limit theformation of a strong flux rope feature following the cloud. finally we attemptto interpret some observational properties of the magnetic field in view of ourresults.

astro-ph;9908315	simulations of nonthermal electron transport in multidimensional flows:  application to radio galaxies	we have developed an economical, effective numerical scheme for cosmic-raytransport suitable for treatment of electrons up to a few hundreds of gev inmultidimensional simulations of radio galaxies. the method follows the electronpopulation in sufficient detail to allow computation of synthetic radio andx-ray observations of the simulated sources, including spectral properties (seethe companion paper by tregillis et al. 1999). the cosmic-ray particlesimulations can follow the effects of shock acceleration, second-order fermiacceleration as well as radiative and adiabatic energy losses. we have appliedthis scheme to 2-d and 3-d mhd simulations of jet-driven flows and have begunto explore links between dynamics and the properties of high energy electronpopulations in radio lobes. the key initial discovery is the great importanceto the high energy particle population of the very unsteady and inhomogeneousflows, especially near the end of the jet. because of this, in particular, oursimulations show that a large fraction of the particle population flowing fromthe jet into the cocoon never passes through strong shocks. the shock strengthsencountered are not simply predicted by 1-d models, and are quite varied.consequently, the emergent electron spectra are highly heterogeneous. rates ofsynchrotron aging in "hot-spots" seem similarly to be very uneven, enhancingcomplexity in the spectral properties of electrons as they emerge into thelobes and making more difficult the task of comparing dynamical and radiativeages.

astro-ph;9908316	simulations of nonthermal electron transport in multidimensional flows:  synthetic observations of radio galaxies	we have applied an effective numerical scheme for cosmic-ray transport to 3dmhd simulations of jet flow in radio galaxies (see the companion paper by joneset al. 1999). the marriage of relativistic particle and 3d magnetic fieldinformation allows us to construct a rich set of ``synthetic observations'' ofour simulated objects. the information is sufficient to calculate the ``true''synchrotron emissivity at a given frequency using explicit information aboutthe relativistic electrons. this enables us to produce synchrotronsurface-brightness maps, including polarization. inverse-compton x-raysurface-brightness maps may also be produced. first results intended to explorethe connection between jet dynamics and electron transport in radio lobes arediscussed. we infer lobe magnetic field values by comparison of syntheticallyobserved x-ray and synchrotron fluxes, and find these ``inverse-compton''fields to be quite consistent with the actual rms field averaged over the lobe.the simplest minimum energy calculation from the synthetic observations alsoseems to agree with the actual simulated source properties.

astro-ph;9909033	the mhd kelvin-helmholtz instability iii: the role of sheared magnetic  field in planar flows	we have carried out simulations of the nonlinear evolution of themagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) kelvin-helmholtz (kh) instability for compressiblefluids in $2\frac{1}{2}$-dimensions, extending our previous work by frank et al(1996) and jones \etal (1997). in the present work we have simulated flows inthe x-y plane in which a ``sheared'' magnetic field of uniform strength``smoothly'' rotates across a thin velocity shear layer from the z direction tothe x direction, aligned with the flow field. we focus on dynamical evolutionof fluid features, kinetic energy dissipation, and mixing of the fluid betweenthe two layers, considering their dependence on magnetic field strength forthis geometry. the introduction of magnetic shear can allow a cat's eye-likevortex to form, even when the field is stronger than the nominal linearinstability limit given above. for strong fields that vortex is asymmetric withrespect to the preliminary shear layer, however, so the subsequent dissipationis enhanced over the uniform field cases of comparable field strength. in fact,so long as the magnetic field achieves some level of dynamical importanceduring an eddy turnover time, the asymmetries introduced through the magneticshear will increase flow complexity, and, with that, dissipation and mixing.the degree of the fluid mixing between the two layers is strongly influenced bythe magnetic field strength. mixing of the fluid is most effective when thevortex is disrupted by magnetic tension during transient reconnection, throughlocal chaotic behavior that follows.
