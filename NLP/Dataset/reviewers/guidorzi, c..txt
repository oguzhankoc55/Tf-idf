0903.1414	evidence for energy injection and a fine-tuned central engine at optical  wavelengths in grb 070419a	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral analysis ofthe fred grb 070419a. the early-time emission in the $\gamma$-ray and x-raybands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while atlate times the x-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. incontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ upto 10$^6$ s). we investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of thestandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical lightcurve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a lorenzfactor $\gamma \approx 350$ at this time. in contrast, the shallow opticaldecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shockcomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peaktime for it to be explained within the standard model. this predicts anincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emissionfrom t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. a highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due tounrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that isnot observed. we conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tunedenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required tocreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that areinvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical x-ray light curves of grbs.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0906.3187	uves/vlt high resolution absorption spectroscopy of the grb080330  afterglow: a study of the grb host galaxy and intervening absorbers	we study the gamma ray burst (grb) environment and intervening absorbers byanalyzing the optical absorption features produced by gas surrounding the grbor along its line of sight. we analyzed high resolution spectroscopicobservations (r=40000, s/n=3 - 6) of the optical afterglow of grb080330, takenwith uves at the vlt ~ 1.5 hours after the grb trigger. the spectrumillustrates the complexity of the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 1.51 whichhas at least four components in the main absorption system. we detect strongfeii, siii, and niii excited absorption lines associated with the bluemostcomponent only. in addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorberslying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in theredshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, each exhibiting mgii absorption. for the bluemostcomponent in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from thesite of the grb explosion. we do so by assuming that the excited absorptionlines are produced by indirect uv pumping, and compare the data with a timedependent photo-excitation code. the distance of this component is found to be280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other grbs (1 - 6 kpc). we identifytwo additional mgii absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent widthlarger than 1a. the distance between the grb and the absorber measured in thispaper confirms that the power of the grb radiation can influence the conditionsof the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. forthe intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strongintervening system is found per afterglow, as has been noted in studiesexhibiting an excess of strong mgii absorbers along grb sightlines compared toquasars.

0907.0384	extremely energetic fermi gamma-ray bursts obey spectral energy  correlations	the extremely energetic fermi grbs 080916c, with its eiso of ~ 10^{55} erg in1 kev - 10 gev and intense gev emission, and 090323 give us a uniqueopportunity to test the reliability and extension of spectral energycorrelations. based on konus/wind and fermi spectral measurements, we find thatboth events are fully consistent with the updated (95 events as of april 2009)ep,i - eiso correlation, thus further confirming and extending it and pointingagainst a possible flattening or increased dispersion at very high energies.this also suggests that the physics behind the emission of peculiarly brightand hard grbs is the same as for softer and weaker ones. in addition, we findthat the normalization of the correlation obtained by considering these twogrbs and the other long ones for which ep,i was measured with high accuracy bythe fermi/gbm are fully consistent with those obtained by other instruments(e.g., bepposax, swift, konus-wind), thus indicating that the correlation isnot affected significantly by detectors limited thresholds and energy bands.prompted by the extension of the spectrum of grb 080916c up to several gevswithout any excess or cut-off, we also investigated if the evaluation of eisoin the commonly adopted 1 kev - 10 mev energy band may bias the ep,i - eisocorrelation contributing to its scatter. by computing eiso from 1 kev to 10gev, the slope of the correlation becomes slightly flatter, while itsdispersion does not change significantly. finally, we find that grb 080916c isalso consistent with most of the other spectral energy correlations derivedfrom it, with the possible exception of the ep,i - eiso - tb correlation.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

0704.1609	grb 061121: broadband spectral evolution through the prompt and  afterglow phases of a bright burst	swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of grb 061121 (z=1.314),allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. manyother telescopes, including konus-wind, xmm-newton, rotse and the faulkestelescope north, also observed the burst. the gamma-ray, x-ray and uv/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andx-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the prompt emission, stretching from1ev up to 1mev, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1kev. theoptical-to-x-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for x-ray flares. the sedshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. this behaviourmight be a symptom of self-comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. grb 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by swift. using acombination of swift and konus-wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1kev - 10mev in the grb rest frame. a probable jet break isdetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for thebeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1004.0901	unveiling the origin of x-ray flares in gamma-ray bursts	we present an updated catalog of 113 x-ray flares detected by swift in the~33% of the x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grb). 43 flares have ameasured redshift. for the first time the analysis is performed in 4 differentx-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flaretemporal properties with energy. we find that flares are narrower at higherenergies: their width follows a power-law relation w~e^{-0.5} reminiscent ofthe prompt emission. flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time whichis twice the rise time on average. both time scales linearly evolve with time,giving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both timescales are stretched by the same factor. as a consequence, the flare widthlinearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearlydistinguishes the flare from the grb prompt emission. the flare 0.3-10 kev peakluminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with largescatter: l_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. when multiple flares are present, a globalsoftening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than theprevious one. the 0.3-10 kev isotropic energy distribution is a log-normalpeaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. the flareaverage spectral energy distribution (sed) is found to be a power-law withspectral energy index beta~1.1. these results confirmed that the flares aretightly linked to the prompt emission. however, after considering variousmodels we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entireset of observations.

1004.1568	lag-luminosity relation in gamma-ray burst x-ray flares: a direct link  to the prompt emission	the temporal and spectral analysis of 9 bright x-ray flares out of a sampleof 113 flares observed by swift reveals that the flare phenomenology isstrictly analogous to the prompt gamma-ray emission: high energy flare profilesrise faster, decay faster and peak before the low energy emission. however,flares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.as time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminositiesand softer emission. the flare spectral peak energy e_{p,i} evolves to lowervalues following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.the two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energye_{iso} and peak luminosity l_{p,iso} when compared to the e_{p,i}-e_{iso} ande_{p,i}-l_{iso} prompt correlations. e_{p,i} is found to correlate with l_{iso}within single flares, giving rise to a time resolved e_{p,i}(t)-l_{iso}(t).like prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: l_{p,iso}^{0.3-10kev} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}. the lag-luminosity is proven to be a fundamentallaw extending 5 decades in time and 5 in energy. moreover, this is directevidence that grb x-ray flares and prompt gamma-ray pulses are produced by thesame mechanism. finally we establish a flare-afterglow morphology connection:flares are preferentially detected superimposed to one-break or canonical x-rayafterglows.

1004.3831	gamma-ray burst long lasting x-ray flaring activity	in this paper we shed light on late time (i.e. with peak time t_{pk} \gtrsim1000 s) flaring activity. we address the morphology and energetic of flares inthe window \sim 10^3-10^6 s to put constraints on the temporal evolution of theflare properties and to identify possible differences in the mechanismproducing the early and late time flaring emission, if any. this requires thecomplete understanding of the observational biases affecting the detection ofx-ray flares superimposed on a fading continuum at t &gt; 1000 s. we consider allthe swift grbs that exhibit late time flares. our sample consists of 36 flares,14 with redshift measurements. we inherit the strategy of data analysis fromchincarini et al. (2010) in order to make a direct comparison with the earlytime flare properties. the morphology of the flare light curve is the same forboth early time and late time flares, while they differ energetically. thewidth of late time flares increases with time similarly to the early timeflares. simulations confirmed that the increase of the width with time is notdue to the decaying statistics, at least up to 10^4 s. the energy output oflate time flares is one order of magnitude lower than the early time flare one,being \sim 1% e_{prompt}. the evolution of the peak luminosity as well as thedistribution of the peak flux-to-continuum ratio for late time flares indicatethat the flaring emission is decoupled from the underlying continuum,differently from early time flares/steep decay. a sizable fraction of late timeflares are compatible with afterglow variability. the internal shock originseems the most promising explanation for flares. however, some differences thatemerge between late and early time flares suggest that there could be no uniqueexplanation about the nature of late time flares.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1009.0172	on the average gamma-ray burst x-ray flaring activity	gamma-ray burst x-ray flares are believed to mark the late time activity ofthe central engine. we compute the temporal evolution of the average flareluminosity $&lt; l &gt;$ in the common rest frame energy band of 44 grbs taken fromthe large \emph{swift} 5-years data base. our work highlights the importance ofa proper consideration of the threshold of detection of flares against thecontemporaneous continuous x-ray emission. in the time interval $30\rm{s}&lt;t&lt;1000\,\rm{s}$ we find $&lt; l &gt;\propto t^{-2.7\pm 0.1}$; this impliesthat the flare isotropic energy scaling is $e_{\rm{iso,flare}}\proptot^{-1.7}$. the decay of the continuum underlying the flare emission closelytracks the average flare luminosity evolution, with a typical flare tosteep-decay luminosity ratio which is $l_{\rm{flare}}/l_{\rm{steep}}=4.7$: thissuggests that flares and continuum emission are deeply related to one another.we infer on the progenitor properties considering different models. accordingto the hyper-accreting black hole scenario, the average flare luminosityscaling can be obtained in the case of rapid accretion ($t_{\rm{acc}}\ll t$) orwhen the last $\sim 0.5 m_{\sun}$ of the original $14 m_{\sun}$ progenitor starare accreted. alternatively, the steep $\propto t^{-2.7}$ behaviour could betriggered by a rapid outward expansion of an accretion shock in the materialfeeding a convective disk. if instead we assume the engine to be a rapidlyspinning magnetar, then its rotational energy can be extracted to power a jetwhose luminosity is likely to be between the monopole ($l\propto e^{-2t}$) anddipole ($l\propto t^{-2}$) cases. in both scenarios we suggest the variability,which is the main signature of the flaring activity, to be established as aconsequence of different kinds of instabilities.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1010.5379	spectral catalogue of bright gamma-ray bursts detected with the  bepposax/grbm	the emission process responsible for the so-called "prompt" emission ofgamma-ray bursts is still unknown. a number of empirical models fitting thetypical spectrum still lack a satisfactory interpretation. a few grb spectralcatalogues derived from past and present experiments are known in theliterature and allow to tackle the issue of spectral properties of gamma-raybursts on a statistical ground. we extracted and studied the time-integratedphoton spectra of the 200 brightest grbs observed with the gamma-ray burstmonitor which flew aboard the bepposax mission (1996-2002) to provide anindependent statistical characterisation of grb spectra. the spectra were fitwith three models: a simple power-law, a cut-off power law or a band function.the typical photon spectrum of a bright grb consists of a low-energy indexaround 1.0 and a peak energy of the nufnu spectrum e_p~240 kev in agreementwith previous results on a sample of bright cgro/batse bursts. spectra of ~35%of grbs can be fit with a power-law with a photon index around 2, indicative ofpeak energies either close to or outside the grbm energy boundaries. we confirmthe correlation between e_p and fluence, with a logarithmic dispersion of 0.13around the power-law with index 0.21+-0.06. the low-energy and peak energydistributions are not yet explained in the current literature. the capabilityof measuring time-resolved spectra over a broadband energy range, ensuringprecise measurements of parameters such as e_p, will be crucial for futureexperiments (abridged).

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1107.1740	x-ray flare candidates in short gamma-ray bursts	we present the first systematic study of x-ray flare candidates in shortgamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) exploiting the large 6-year swift database with theaim to constrain the physical nature of such fluctuations. we find that flarecandidates appear in different types of sgrb host galaxy environments and showno clear correlation with the x-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates aredetected both in sgrbs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-raysand in sgrbs which do not show such component. we furthermore show that sgrbx-ray flare candidates only partially share the set of observational propertiesof long grb (lgrb) flares. in particular,the main parameter driving theduration evolution of x-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to bethe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on thedifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, promptvariability time-scales and energy budgets. on the contrary, sgrb flarecandidates significantly differ from lgrb flares in terms of peak luminosity,isotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variabilityflux. however, these differences disappear when the central engine time-scalesand energy budget are accounted for, suggesting that (i) flare candidates andprompt pulses in sgrbs likely have a common origin; (ii) similar dissipationand/or emission mechanisms are responsible for the prompt and flare emission inlong and short grbs, with sgrbs being less energetic albeit faster evolvingversions of the long class. finally, we show that in strict analogy to the sgrbprompt emission, flares candidates fall off the lag-luminosity relation definedby lgrbs, thus strengthening the sgrb flare-prompt pulse connection.

1202.3443	average power density spectrum of swift long gamma-ray bursts in the  observer and in the source rest frames	we calculate the average power density spectra (pds) of 244 long gamma-raybursts detected with the swift burst alert telescope in the 15-150 kev bandfrom january 2005 to august 2011. for the first time we derived the average pdsin the source rest frame of 97 grbs with known redshift. for 49 of them anaverage pds was also obtained in a common source-frame energy band to accountfor the dependence of time profiles on energy. previous results obtained onbatse grbs with unknown redshift showed that the average spectrum in the25-2000 kev band could be modelled with a power-law with a 5/3 index overnearly two decades of frequency with a break at ~1 hz. depending on thenormalisation and on the subset of grbs considered, our results show analogousto steeper slopes (between 1.7 and 2.0) of the power-law. however, no clearevidence for the break at ~1 hz was found, although the softer energy band ofbat compared with batse might account for that. we instead find a break atlower frequency corresponding to a typical source rest frame characteristictime of a few seconds. we furthermore find no significant differences betweenobserver and source rest frames. notably, no distinctive pds features are foundfor grbs with different intrinsic properties of the prompt emission either.finally, the average pds of grbs at higher redshifts shows possibly shallowerpower-law indices than that of low-z grbs. it is not clear whether this is dueto an evolution with z of the average pds.

1203.1059	the prompt-afterglow connection in gamma-ray bursts: a comprehensive  statistical analysis of swift x-ray light-curves	we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of swift x-ray light-curvesof gamma-ray bursts (grbs) collecting data from more than 650 grbs discoveredby swift and other facilities. the unprecedented sample size allows us toconstrain the rest frame x-ray properties of grbs from a statisticalperspective, with particular reference to intrinsic time scales and theenergetics of the different light-curve phases in a common rest-frame 0.3-30kev energy band. temporal variability episodes are also studied and theirproperties constrained. two fundamental questions drive this effort: i) doesthe x-ray emission retain any kind of "memory"of the prompt gamma-ray phase?ii) where is the dividing line between long and short grb x-ray properties? weshow that short grbs decay faster, are less luminous and less energetic thanlong grbs in the x-rays, but are interestingly characterized by similarintrinsic absorption. we furthermore reveal the existence of a number ofstatistically significant relations that link the x-ray to prompt gamma-rayparameters in long grbs; short grbs are outliers of the majority of these2-parameter relations. however and more importantly, we report on the existenceof a universal 3-parameter scaling that links the x-ray and the gamma-rayenergy to the prompt spectral peak energy of both long and short grbs:e_{x,iso}\propto e_{gamma,iso}^{1.00\pm 0.06}/e_{pk}^{0.60\pm 0.10}.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1206.5532	the optical sn 2012bz associated with the long grb 120422a	the association of type ic sne with long-duration grbs is well established.we endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, tocharacterize these sne at increasingly high redshifts. we obtained a series ofoptical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ic sn2012bzassociated with the swift long-duration grb120422a (z=0.283) using the 3.6-mtng and the 8.2-m vlt telescopes. the peak times of the light curves ofsn2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the b-band and i'-band lightcurves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. thebolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometricmeasurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in thenear-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. therefore, the presentlight curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual uv-optical-irbolometric light curve. this pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (mbol= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape andluminosity to the bolometric light curves of the sne associated with z&lt;0.2 grbsand more luminous than those of sne associated with xrfs. a comparison with themodel generated for the bolometric light curve of sn2003dh suggests thatsn2012bz produced only about 15% less 56ni than sn2003dh, about 0.35 msol.similarly the vlt spectra of sn2012bz, after correction for galactic extinctionand for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosionparameters with those observed in sn2003dh (ek~3.5 x 10^52 erg, mej~7 msol) anda similar progenitor mass (~25-40 msol). grb120422a is consistent with theepeak-eiso and the ex,iso-egamma,iso-e_peak relations. grb120422a/sn2012bzshows the grb-sn connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitoredboth photometrically and spectroscopically.

0711.3739	when grb afterglows get softer, hard components come into play	we aim to investigate the ability of simple spectral models to describe thegrb early afterglow emission. we performed a time resolved spectral analysis ofa bright grb sample detected by the swift burst alert telescope and promptlyobserved by the swift x-ray telescope,with spectroscopically measured redshiftin the period april 2005 -- january 2007. the sample consists of 22 grbs and atotal of 214 spectra. we restricted our analysis to the softest spectrasub--sample which consists of 13 spectra with photon index &gt; 3. in this samplewe found that four spectra, belonging to grb060502a, grb060729, grb060904b,grb061110a prompt--afterglow transition phase, cannot be modeled neither by asingle power law nor by the band model. instead we find that the data presenthigh energy (&gt; 3 kev, in the observer frame) excesses with respect to thesemodels. we estimated the joint statistical significance of these excesses atthe level of 4.3 sigma. in all four cases, the deviations can be modeled wellby adding either a second power law or a blackbody component to the usualsynchrotron power law spectrum. the additional power law would be explained bythe emerging of the afterglow, while the blackbody could be interpreted as thephotospheric emission from x-ray flares or as the shock breakout emission. inone case these models leave a 2.2 sigma excess which can be fit by a gaussianline at the energy the highly ionized nickel recombination. although the datado not allow an unequivocal interpretation, the importance of this analysisconsists in the fact that we show that a simple power law model or a band modelare insufficient to describe the x-ray spectra of a small homogeneous sample ofgrbs at the end of their prompt phase.

0712.1412	anomalous x-ray emission in grb060904b: a nickel line?	the detection of an extra component in grb060904b x-ray spectra in additionto the standard single power-law behaviour has recently been reported in theliterature. this component can be fit with different models; in particular theaddition of a spectral line provides the best representation.in this paper weinvestigate the physical properties that the surrounding medium must have inorder to produce a spectral feature that can explain the detected emission. weanalyse and discuss how and if the detected spectral excess fits in differenttheoretical models developed to explain the nature of line emission during theafterglow phase of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). trasmission and reflection modelshave been considered. given the high value (&gt;&gt;1) of the thomson optical depth,the emission is likely to arise in a reflection scenario. within reflectionmodels, the external reflection geometry fails to predict the observedluminosity. on the contrary, the detected feature can be explained in a funnelscenario with typical opening angle theta of 5 degrees, nickel mass of theorder of 0.1 m_o and t=10^6 k. for theta=20 degrees, assuming the reprocessingmaterial to be the sn shell, the detected emission implies a nickel mass of 0.4m_o at t=10^7 k and a metallicity 10 times the solar value. if the giant x-rayflare that dominates the early xrt light curve is identified with the ionizingsource, the sn expansion began 3000 s before the grb event.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1311.4340	new constraints on grb jet geometry and relativistic shock physics	we use high--quality, multi-band observations of swift grb120404a, fromgamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of vaneerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1407.8126	game: grb and all-sky monitor experiment	we describe the grb and all-sky monitor experiment (game) mission submittedby a large international collaboration (italy, germany, czech repubblic,slovenia, brazil) in response to the 2012 esa call for a small missionopportunity for a launch in 2017 and presently under further investigation forsubsequent opportunities. the general scientific objective is to performmeasurements of key importance for grb science and to provide the wideastrophysical community of an advanced x-ray all-sky monitoring system. theproposed payload was based on silicon drift detectors (~1-50 kev), cdznte (czt)detectors (~15-200 kev) and crystal scintillators in phoswich (nai/csi)configuration (~20 kev-20 mev), three well established technologies, for atotal weight of ~250 kg and a required power of ~240 w. such instrumentationallows a unique, unprecedented and very powerful combination of large field ofview (3-4 sr), a broad energy energy band extending from ~1 kev up to ~20 mev,an energy resolution as good as ~300 ev in the 1-30 kev energy range, a sourcelocation accuracy of ~1 arcmin. the mission profile included a launch (e.g., byvega) into a low earth orbit, a baseline sky scanning mode plus pointedobservations of regions of particular interest, data transmission to ground viax-band (4.8 gb/orbit, alcantara and malindi ground stations), and prompttransmission of grb / transient triggers.

1409.6467	the nature of the late achromatic bump in grb 120326a	the long ${\it swift}$ gamma-ray burst grb 120326a at redshift $z=1.798$exhibited a multi-band light curve with a striking feature: a late-time,long-lasting achromatic rebrightening, rarely seen in such events. peaking inoptical and x-ray bands $\sim 35$ ks ($\sim 12.5$ ks in the grb rest frame)after the 70-s grb prompt burst, the feature brightens nearly two orders ofmagnitude above the underlying optical power-law decay. modelling themultiwavelength light curves, we investigate possible causes of therebrightening in the context of the standard fireball model. we exclude a rangeof scenarios for the origin of this feature: reverse-shock flash, late-timeforward shock peak due to the passage of the maximal synchrotron frequencythrough the optical band, late central engine optical/x-ray flares, interactionbetween the expanding blast wave and a density enhancement in the circumburstmedium and gravitational microlensing. instead we conclude that the achromaticrebrightening may be caused by a refreshed forward shock or a geometricaleffect. in addition, we identify an additional component after the end of theprompt emission, that shapes the observed x-ray and optical light curvesdifferently, ruling out a single overall emission component to explain theobserved early time emission.

1410.7387	dust in the wind: the role of recent mass loss in long gamma-ray bursts	we study the late-time (t&gt;0.5 days) x-ray afterglows of nearby (z&lt;0.5) longgamma-ray bursts (grb) with swift and identify a population of explosions withslowly decaying, super-soft (photon index gamma_x&gt;3) x-ray emission that isinconsistent with forward shock synchrotron radiation associated with theafterglow. these explosions also show larger-than-average intrinsic absorption(nh_x,i &gt;6d21 cm-2) and prompt gamma-ray emission with extremely long duration(t_90&gt;1000 s). chance association of these three rare properties (i.e. largenh_x,i, super-soft gamma_x and extreme duration) in the same class ofexplosions is statistically unlikely. we associate these properties with theturbulent mass-loss history of the progenitor star that enriched and shaped thecircum-burst medium. we identify a natural connection between nh_x,i gamma_xand t_90 in these sources by suggesting that the late-time super-soft x-raysoriginate from radiation reprocessed by material lost to the environment by thestellar progenitor before exploding, (either in the form of a dust echo or asreprocessed radiation from a long-lived grb remnant), and that the interactionof the explosion's shock/jet with the complex medium is the source of theextremely long prompt emission. however, current observations do not allow usto exclude the possibility that super-soft x-ray emitters originate frompeculiar stellar progenitors with large radii that only form in very dustyenvironments.

1410.7399	constraining duty cycles through a bayesian technique	the duty cycle (dc) of astrophysical sources is generally defined as thefraction of time during which the sources are active. however, dcs aregenerally not provided with statistical uncertainties, since the standardapproach is to perform monte carlo bootstrap simulations to evaluate them,which can be quite time consuming for a large sample of sources. as analternative, considerably less time-consuming approach, we derived thetheoretical expectation value for the dc and its error for sources whose stateis one of two possible, mutually exclusive states, inactive (off) or flaring(on), as based on a finite set of independent observational data points.following a bayesian approach, we derived the analytical expression for theposterior, the conjugated distribution adopted as prior, and the expectationvalue and variance. we applied our method to the specific case of theinactivity duty cycle (idc) for supergiant fast x-ray transients. we alsostudied idc as a function of the number of observations in the sample. finally,we compare the results with the theoretical expectations. we found excellentagreement with our findings based on the standard bootstrap method. ourbayesian treatment can be applied to all sets of independent observations oftwo-state sources, such as active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, etc. inaddition to being far less time consuming than bootstrap methods, theadditional strength of this approach becomes obvious when considering awell-populated class of sources ($n_{\rm src} \geq 50$) for which the prior canbe fully characterized by fitting the distribution of the observed dcs for allsources in the class, so that, through the prior, one can further constrain thedc of a new source by exploiting the information acquired on the dcdistribution derived from the other sources.

0804.0811	the early-time optical properties of gamma-ray burst afterglows	we present a multiwavelength analysis of 63 gamma-ray bursts observed withthe world's three largest robotic optical telescopes, the liverpool and faulkestelescopes (north and south). optical emission was detected for 24 grbs withbrightnesses ranging from r = 10 to 22 mag in the first 10 minutes after theburst. by comparing optical and x-ray light curves from t = 100 to about 10^6seconds, we introduce four main classes, defined by the presence or absence oftemporal breaks at optical and/or x-ray wavelengths. while 15/24 grbs can bemodelled with the forward-shock model, explanation of the remaining nine isvery challenging in the standard framework even with the introduction of energyinjection or an ambient density gradient. early x-ray afterglows, even segmentsof light curves described by a power-law, may be due to additional emissionfrom the central engine. 39 grbs in our sample were not detected and have deepupper limits (r &lt; 22 mag) at early time. of these, only ten were identified byother facilities, primarily at near infrared wavelengths, resulting in a darkburst fraction of about 50%. additional emission in the early time x-rayafterglow due to late-time central engine activity may also explain some darkbursts by making the bursts brighter than expected in the x-ray band comparedto the optical band.

1412.0404	gamma-ray burst engines may have no memory	a sizeable fraction of gamma-ray burst (grb) time profiles consist of atemporal sequence of pulses. the nature of this stochastic process carriesinformation on how grb inner engines work. the so-called interpulse timedefines the interval between adjacent pulses, excluding the long quiescenceperiods during which the signal drops to the background level. it was found bymany authors in the past that interpulse times are lognormally distributed, atvariance with the exponential case that is expected for a memoryless process.we investigated whether the simple hypothesis of a temporally uncorrelatedsequence of pulses is really to be rejected, as a lognormal distributionnecessarily implies. we selected and analysed a number of multi--peakedcgro/batse grbs and simulated similar time profiles, with the crucialdifference that we assumed exponentially distributed interpulse times, as isexpected for a memoryless stationary poisson process. we then identified peaksin both data sets using a novel peak search algorithm, which is more efficientthan others used in the past. we independently confirmed that the observedinterpulse time distribution is approximately lognormal. however, we found thesame results on the simulated profiles, in spite of the intrinsic exponentialdistribution. although intrinsic lognormality cannot be ruled out, this showsthat intrinsic interpulse time distribution in real data could still beexponential, while the observed lognormal could be ascribed to the lowefficiency of peak search algorithms at short values combined with thelimitations of a bin-integrated profile. our result suggests that grb enginesmay emit pulses after the fashion of nuclear radioactive decay, that is, as amemoryless process.

0804.1727	multiwavelength analysis of the intriguing grb 061126: the reverse shock  scenario and magnetization	we present a detailed study of the prompt and afterglow emission from swiftgrb 061126 using bat, xrt, uvot data and multi-color optical imaging from tenground-based telescopes. grb 061126 was a long burst (t_90=191 s) with fouroverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. the x-ray afterglow, observedfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay withalpha_x=1.290 \pm 0.008. optical observations presented here cover the timerange from 258 s (faulkes telescope north) to 15 days (gemini north) after theburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallowtransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately13 min after the burst. we suggest the early, steep component is due to areverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times largerthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. the ejecta might beendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. the opticallight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, whilethere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the x-ray light curve. wemodel the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (thesteeper decay in x-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to x-ray)are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. thismight imply that the x-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shockemission. the possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would givesupport to the additional emission scenario.

0804.2141	the prompt, high resolution spectroscopic view of the "naked-eye"  grb080319b	grb080319b reached 5th optical magnitude during the burst prompt emission.thanks to the vlt/uves rapid response mode, we observed its afterglow just8m:30s after the grb onset when the magnitude was r ~ 12. this allowed us toobtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolution spectrum of a grb afterglowever (s/n per resolution element ~ 50). the spectrum is rich of absorptionfeatures belonging to the main system at z=0.937, divided in at least sixcomponents spanning a total velocity range of 100 km/s. the vlt/uvesobservations caught the absorbing gas in a highly excited state, producing thestrongest fe ii fine structure lines ever observed in a grb. a few hours laterthe optical depth of these lines was reduced by a factor of 4-20, and theoptical/uv flux by a factor of ~ 60. this proves that the excitation of theobserved fine structure lines is due to "pumping" by the grb uv photons. acomparison of the observed ratio between the number of photons absorbed by theexcited state and those in the fe ii ground state suggests that the sixabsorbers are ~ 2-6 kpc from the grb site, with component i ~ 3 times closer tothe grb site than components iii to vi. component i is characterized also bythe lack of mg i absorption, unlike all other components. this may be due bothto a closer distance and a lower density, suggesting a structured ism in thisgalaxy complex.

1501.02706	a common stochastic process rules gamma-ray burst prompt emission and  x-ray flares	prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray afterglow emission in gamma-ray bursts(grbs) are characterized by a bursty behavior and are often interspersed withlong quiescent times. there is compelling evidence that x-ray flares are linkedto prompt gamma-rays. however, the physical mechanism that leads to the complextemporal distribution of gamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares is not understood.here we show that the waiting time distribution (wtd) of pulses and flaresexhibits a power-law tail extending over 4 decades with index ~2 and can be themanifestation of a common time-dependent poisson process. this result is robustand is obtained on different catalogs. surprisingly, grbs with many (&gt;=8)gamma-ray pulses are very unlikely to be accompanied by x-ray flares after theend of the prompt emission (3.1 sigma gaussian confidence). these results areconsistent with a simple interpretation: an hyperaccreting disk breaks up intoone or a few groups of fragments, each of which is independently accreted withthe same probability per unit time. prompt gamma-rays and late x-ray flares arenothing but different fragments being accreted at the beginning and at the end,respectively, following the very same stochastic process and likely the samemechanism.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

1503.08428	radio flares from gamma-ray bursts	we present predictions of centimeter and millimeter radio emission fromreverse shocks in the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with the goal ofdetermining their detectability with current and future radio facilities. usinga range of grb properties, such as peak optical brightness and time, isotropicequivalent gamma-ray energy and redshift, we simulate radio light curves in aframework generalized for any circumburst medium structure and including aparametrization of the shell thickness regime that is more realistic than thesimple assumption of thick- or thin-shell approximations. building on earlierwork by mundell et al. (2007) and melandri et al. (2010) in which the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock was suggested to lie at radio, rather thanoptical wavelengths at early times, we show that the brightest and mostdistinct reverse-shock radio signatures are detectable up to 0.1 -- 1 day afterthe burst, emphasizing the need for rapid radio follow-up. detection is easierfor bursts with later optical peaks, high isotropic energies, lower circumburstmedium densities, and at observing frequencies that are less prone tosynchrotron self-absorption effects - typically above a few ghz. given recentdetections of polarized prompt gamma-ray and optical reverse-shock emission, wesuggest that detection of polarized radio/mm emission will unambiguouslyconfirm the presence of low-frequency reverse shocks at early time.

0805.0377	measuring the cosmological parameters with the ep,i-eiso correlation of  gamma-ray bursts	we have used the ep,i-eiso correlation of grbs to measure the cosmologicalparameter omega_m. by adopting a maximum likelihood approach which allows us tocorrectly quantify the extrinsic (i.e. non--poissonian) scatter of thecorrelation, we constrain (for a flat universe) omega_m to 0.04-0.40 (68%confidence level), with a best fit value of omega_m ~ 0.15, and exclude omega_m= 1 at 99.9% confidence level. if we release the assumption of a flat universe,we still find evidence for a low value of omega_m (0.04-0.50 at 68% confidencelevel) and a weak dependence of the dispersion of the ep,i-eiso correlation onomega_lambda (with an upper limit of omega_lambda ~ 1.15 at 90% confidencelevel). our approach makes no assumptions on the ep,i-eiso correlation and itdoes not use other calibrators to set the "zero' point of the relation,therefore our treatment of the data is not affected by circularity and theresults are independent of those derived via type ia sne (or other cosmologicalprobes). unlike other multi-parameters correlations, our analysis grounds ononly two parameters, then including a larger number (a factor ~3) of grbs andbeing less affected by systematics. simulations based on realisticextrapolations of ongoing (and future) grb experiments (e.g., swift,konus-wind, glast) show that: i) the uncertainties on cosmological parameterscan be significantly decreased; ii) future data will allow us to get clues onthe "dark energy" evolution.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1508.04898	a search for galactic transients disguised as gamma-ray bursts	a significant fraction of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) arecharacterised by a fast rise and exponential decay (fred) temporal structure.this is not a distinctive feature of this class, since it is observed in manygalactic transients and is likely descriptive of a sudden release of energyfollowed by a diffusion process. possible evidence has recently been reportedby tello et al. (2012) for a galactic contamination in the sample of fred grbsdiscovered with swift. we searched for possible galactic intruders disguised asfred grbs in the swift catalogue up to september 2014. we selected 181 fredgrbs (2/3 with unknown redshift) and considered different subsamples. we testedthe degree of isotropy through the dipole and the quadrupole momentdistributions, both with reference to the galaxy and in acoordinate-system-independent way, as well as with the two-point angularautocovariance function. in addition, we searched for possible indicators of agalactic origin among the spectral and temporal properties of individual grbs.we found marginal (~3 sigma) evidence for an excess of freds with unknownredshift towards the galactic plane compared with what is expected for anisotropic distribution corrected for the non-uniform sky exposure. however,when we account for the observational bias against optical follow-upobservations of low-galactic latitude grbs, the evidence for anisotropydecreases to ~2 sigma. in addition, we found no statistical evidence fordifferent spectral or temporal properties from the bulk of cosmological grbs.we found marginal evidence for the presence of a disguised galactic populationamong swift grbs with unknown redshift. the estimated fraction is f=(19 +-11)%, with an upper limit of 34% (90% confidence).

0805.4104	evidence for luminosity evolution of long gamma-ray bursts in swift data	we compute the luminosity function (lf) and the formation rate of long gammaray bursts (grbs) by fitting the observed differential peak flux distributionobtained by the batse experiment in two different scenarios: i) the grbluminosity evolves with redshift and ii) grbs form preferentially inlow-metallicity environments. in both cases, model predictions are consistentwith the swift number counts and with the number of detections at z&gt;2.5 andz&gt;3.5. to discriminate between the two evolutionary scenarios, we compare themodel results with the number of luminous bursts (i.e. with isotropic peakluminosity in excess of 10^53 erg s^-1) detected by swift in its first threeyears of mission. our sample conservatively contains only bursts with goodredshift determination and measured peak energy. we find that pure luminosityevolution models can account for the number of sure identifications. in thecase of a pure density evolution scenario, models with z_th&gt;0.3 zsun are ruledout with high confidence. for lower metallicity thresholds, the model resultsare still statistically consistent with available lower limits. however, manyfactors can increase the discrepancy between model results and data, indicatingthat some luminosity evolution in the grb lf may be needed also for such lowvalues of z_th. finally, using these new constraints, we derive robust upperlimits on the bright-end of the grb lf, showing that this cannot be steeperthan ~2.6.

1509.03099	limits on optical polarization during the prompt phase of grb 140430a	gamma-ray burst grb 140430a was detected by the swift satellite and observedpromptly with the imaging polarimeter ringo3 mounted on the liverpooltelescope, with observations beginning while the prompt $\gamma$-ray emissionwas still ongoing. in this paper, we present densely sampled (10-secondtemporal resolution) early optical light curves in 3 optical bands and limitsto the degree of optical polarization. we compare optical, x-ray and gamma-rayproperties and present an analysis of the optical emission during a period ofhigh-energy flaring. the complex optical light curve cannot be explained merelywith a combination of forward and reverse shock emission from a standardexternal shock, implying additional contribution of emission from internalshock dissipation. we estimate an upper limit for time averaged opticalpolarization during the prompt phase to be as low as p &lt; 12% (1$\sigma$). thissuggests that the optical flares and early afterglow emission in this grb arenot highly polarized. alternatively, time averaging could mask the presence ofotherwise polarized components of distinct origin at different polarizationposition angles.

0805.4698	outliers from the mainstream: how a massive star can produce a gamma-ray  burst	it is now recognized that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are linked tothe collapse of massive stars, based on the association between (low-redshift)grbs and (type ic) core-collapse supernovae (sne). the census of massive starsand grbs reveals, however, that not all massive stars do produce a grb. only~1% of core collapse sne are able to produce a highly relativistic collimatedoutflow, and hence a grb. the extra crucial parameter has long been suspectedto be metallicity and/or rotation. we find observational evidence stronglysupporting that both ingredients are necessary in order to make a grb out of acore-collapsing star. a detailed study of the absorption pattern in the x-rayspectrum of grb060218 reveals evidence of material highly enriched in lowatomic number metals ejected before the sn/grb explosion. we find that, withinthe current scenarios of stellar evolution, only a progenitor starcharacterized by a fast stellar rotation and sub-solar initial metallicitycould produce such a metal enrichment in its close surrounding.

astro-ph;0101425	detection of the optical afterglow of grb 000630: implications for dark  bursts	we present the discovery of the optical transient of the long-durationgamma-ray burst grb000630. the optical transient was detected with the nordicoptical telescope 21.1 hours after the burst. at the time of discovery themagnitude of the transient was r = 23.04+-0.08. the transient displayed apower-law decline characterized by a decay slope of alpha = -1.035+-0.097. adeep image obtained 25 days after the burst shows no indication of acontribution from a supernova or a host galaxy at the position of thetransient. the closest detected galaxy is a r=24.68+-0.15 galaxy 2.0 arcsecnorth of the transient.  the magnitudes of the optical afterglows of grb980329, grb980613 andgrb000630 were all r&gt;=23 less than 24 hours from the burst epoch. we discussthe implications of this for our understanding of grbs without detected opticaltransients. we conclude that i) based on the gamma-ray properties of thecurrent sample we cannot conclude that grbs with no detected ots belong toanother class of grbs than grbs with detected ots and ii) the majority (&gt;75%)of grbs for which searches for optical afterglow have been unsuccessful areconsistent with no detection if they were similar to bursts like grb000630 atoptical wavelengths.

astro-ph;0104362	bepposax measurements of the bright gamma-ray burst 010222	we analyze the bepposax measurements of the prompt and afterglow emission ofthe gamma-ray burst grb010222. among 45 grbs detected with the wide fieldcameras on bepposax, the 40-700 kev fluence of (9.3+/-0.3)e-5 erg cm-2 is onlysurpassed by grb990123. in terms of the isotropic 20-2000 kev energy output of7.8e53 erg, it ranks third of all grbs with measured distances. since thisburst is so bright, the data provide complete and valuable coverage up to 65 hrafter the event, except for a gap between 3.5 and 8.0 hr. the 2-10 kev fluxhistory shows clear signs of a break which is consistent with a break seen inthe optical, and provides supporting evidence for the achromatic nature of thebreak. an explanation for the break in the context of a collimated expansion isnot straightforward. rather, a model is favored whereby the fireball is brakedto the non-relativistic regime quickly (within a fraction of day) by a dense1e6 cm-3 circumburst medium. this implies that, after a mild beamingcorrection, grb010222 may be the most energetic burst observed thus far. thex-ray decay index after the break is 1.33+/-0.04, the spectral index0.97+/-0.05. the decay is, with unprecedented accuracy, identical to thatobserved in the optical.

astro-ph;0203467	grb 011121: a massive star progenitor	of the cosmological gamma-ray bursts, grb 011121 has the lowest redshift,z=0.36. more importantly, the multi-color excess in the afterglow detected inthe hubble space telescope (hst) light curves is compelling observationalevidence for an underlying supernova. here we present near-infrared and radioobservations of the afterglow. we undertake a comprehensive modeling of theseobservations and those reported in the literature and find good evidencefavoring a wind-fed circumburst medium. in detail, we infer the progenitor hada mass loss rate of mdot ~ 10^-7 / v_w3 mo/yr where v_w3 is the speed of thewind from the progenitor in units of 10^3 km/s. this mass loss rate is similarto that inferred for the progenitor of sn 1998bw which has been associated withgrb 980425. our data, taken in conjunction with the hst results of bloom et al.(2002), provide a consistent picture: the long duration grb 011121 had amassive star progenitor which exploded as a supernova at about the same time asthe grb event.

astro-ph;0208008	discovery of grb 020405 and its late red bump	we present the discovery of grb 020405 made with the inter-planetary network(ipn). with a duration of 60 s, the burst appears to be a typical long durationevent. we observed the 75-square acrminute ipn error region with the mountstromlo observatory's 50-inch robotic telescope and discovered a transientsource which subsequently decayed and was also associated with a variable radiosource. we identify this source as the afterglow of grb 020405. subsequentobservations by other groups found varying polarized flux and established aredshift of 0.690 to the host galaxy. motivated by the low redshift wetriggered observations with wfpc2 on-board the hubble space telescope (hst).modeling the early ground-based data with a jet model, we find a clear redexcess over the decaying optical lightcurves that is present between day 10 andday 141 (the last hst epoch). this `bump' has the spectral and temporalfeatures expected of an underlying supernova (sn). in particular, the red colorof the putative sn is similar to that of the sn associated with grb 011121, atlate time. restricting the sample of grbs to those with z&lt;0.7, a total of fivebursts, red bumps at late times are found in grb 970228, grb 011121, and grb020405. it is possible that the simplest idea, namely that all long durationgrbs have underlying sne with a modest dispersion in their properties(especially peak luminosity), is sufficient to explain the non detections.

astro-ph;0406575	a decreasing column density during the prompt emission from grb000528  observed with bepposax	we report observation results of the prompt x-- and $\gamma$--ray emissionfrom grb 000528. this event was detected with the gamma-ray burst monitor andone of the two wide field cameras aboard the bepposax satellite. the grb waspromptly followed on with the bepposax narrow field instruments and with groundoptical and radio telescopes. the x-ray afterglow source was identified, but nooptical or radio counterpart found. we report here results from the prompt andafterglow emission analysis. the main feature derived from spectral evolutionof the prompt emission is a high hydrogen-equivalent column density withevidence of its decrease with time. we model this behavior in terms of atime-dependent photoionization of the local circum-burst medium, finding that acompact and dense environment is required by the data. we also find a fading ofthe late part of the 2--10 kev prompt emission which is consistent withafterglow emission. we discuss this result in the light of the external shockmodel scenario.

astro-ph;0409053	the interplanetary network supplement to the batse catalogs of  untriggered cosmic gamma ray bursts	we present interplanetary network (ipn) detection and localizationinformation for 211 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed as untriggered events bythe burst and transient source experiment (batse), and published in catalogs bykommers et al. (2001) and stern et al. (2001). ipn confirmations have beenobtained by analyzing the data from 11 experiments. for any given burstobserved by batse and one other distant spacecraft, arrival time analysis (or``triangulation'') results in an annulus of possible arrival directions whosehalf-width varies between 14 arcseconds and 5.6 degrees, depending on theintensity, time history, and arrival direction of the burst, as well as thedistance between the spacecraft. this annulus generally intersects the batseerror circle, resulting in a reduction of the area of up to a factor of ~650.when three widely separated spacecraft observed a burst, the result is an errorbox whose area is as much as 30000 times smaller than that of the batse errorcircle.  because the ipn instruments are considerably less sensitive than batse, theygenerally did not detect the weakest untriggered bursts, but did detect themore intense ones which failed to trigger batse when the trigger was disabled.in a few cases, we have been able to identify the probable origin of bursts assoft gamma repeaters. the vast majority of the ipn-detected events, however,are grbs, and the confirmation of them validates many of the proceduresutilized to detect batse untriggered bursts.

astro-ph;0412589	probing the environment in gamma-ray bursts: the case of an x-ray  precursor, afterglow late onset and wind vs constant density profile in  grb011121 and grb011211	in this paper we present bepposax and xmm observations of two long gamma-raybursts, the x-ray rich event of december 11, 2001 (grb011211) and the hard andvery bright event of november 21, 2001 (grb011121). in both events we findevidence of a late x-ray burst, taking place several minutes after the promptemission. the temporal and spectral behaviour of this phenomenon suggest thatit represents the onset of the afterglow. broad band spectral modelling of theafterglow indicate that the fireball evolution in the december burst takesplace in a ism environment. on the contrary in the november burst the wind caseis revealed by an x-ray decay slower than that observed in the optical($\delta_{\rm x}=1.29\pm0.04$ vs $\delta_{\rm o}=1.66\pm0.06$). the windprofile should change into a constant density profile at large radii, in orderto reconcile late-time radio data with a jet. two other results are obtainedfor this burst. an x-ray burst is preceding by about 30 s the much harder grb.contrary to the prediction of simple models of precursor activity forcollapsars, its spectrum is not consistent with a black body. finally, asubstantial absorption column ($\nh=(7\pm2)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) isdetected during the early part of the prompt emission. this is much greaterthan that of the wind, and it is thus likely associated with the regionsurrounding the burst.

astro-ph;0504602	the puzzling case of grb 990123: multiwavelength afterglow study	we report on the bepposax data analysis of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 990123, one of the brightest grbs detected by bepposax. mainly due to itsexceptional brightness, this is the only source for which the wide fieldcameras have allowed an early detection of the x-ray afterglow between about 20and 60 min after the grb trigger. besides, again for the first time,high-energy emission from the afterglow was detected up to 60 kev. for thex-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha = 1.46 +/- 0.04;the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index gamma about 1.9. thebackward extrapolation of the afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the lategrb emission, thus suggesting that both emissions are produced by the samephenomenon. an extensive set of multiwavelength observations for the grb 990123afterglow made during the bepposax pointing was collected from the literature.the hard x-ray to radio range coverage allowed to construct a spectral fluxdistribution and to perform an analysis of the grb afterglow in the context ofthe "fireball" model. we also report the results of temporal and spectralanalysis of an x-ray source serendipitously observed about 22 arcmin north ofthe grb afterglow, along with the optical spectroscopy of its possiblecounterpart to establish the nature of this source.

astro-ph;0504607	the puzzling case of grb 990123: prompt emission and broad-band  afterglow modeling	we report on bepposax simultaneous x- and gamma-ray observations of thebright grb 990123. we present the broad-band spectrum of the prompt emission,including optical, x- and gamma-rays, confirming the suggestion that theemission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have different physicalorigins. in the framework of the standard fireball model, we discuss the x-rayafterglow observed by the nfis and its hard x-ray emission up to 60 kev severalhours after the burst, detected for about 20 ks by the pds. considering the2-10 kev and optical light curves, the 0.1-60 kev spectrum during the 20 ks inwhich the pds signal was present and the 8.46 ghz upper limits, we find thatthe multi-wavelength observations cannot be readily accommodated by basicafterglow models. while the temporal and spectral behavior of the opticalafterglow is possibly explained by a synchrotron cooling frequency between theoptical and the x-ray energy band during the nfis observations, in x-rays thisassumption only accounts for the slope of the 2-10 kev light curve, but not forthe flatness of the 0.1-60 kev spectrum. including the contribution of inversecompton (ic) scattering, we solve the problem of the flat x-ray spectrum andjustify the hard x-ray emission; we suggest that the lack of a significantdetection of 15-60 kev emission in the following 75 ks and last 70 ks spectra,should be related to poorer statistics rather than to an important suppressionof ic contribution. however, considering also the radio band data, we find the8.46 ghz upper limits violated. on the other hand, leaving unchanged theemission mechanism requires modifying the hydrodynamics by invoking an ambientmedium whose density rises rapidly with radius and by having the shock losingenergy. thus we are left with an open puzzle which requires further inspection.

astro-ph;0511032	the automatic real-time grb pipeline of the 2-m liverpool telescope	the 2-m liverpool telescope (lt), owned by liverpool john moores university,is located in la palma (canary islands) and operates in fully robotic mode. in2005, the lt began conducting an automatic grb follow-up program. on receivingan automatic grb alert from a gamma-ray observatory (swift, integral, hete-ii,ipn) the lt initiates a special override mode that conducts follow-upobservations within 2-3 min of the grb onset. this follow-up procedure beginswith an initial sequence of short (10-s) exposures acquired through an r' bandfilter. these images are reduced, analyzed and interpreted automatically usingpipeline software developed by our team called "lt-trap" (liverpool telescopetransient rapid analysis pipeline); the automatic detection and successfulidentification of an unknown and potentially fading optical transient triggersa subsequent multi-color imaging sequence. in the case of a candidate brighterthan r'=15, either a polarimetric (from 2006) or a spectroscopic observation(from 2007) will be triggered on the lt. if no candidate is identified, thetelescope continues to obtain z', r' and i' band imaging with increasinglylonger exposure times. here we present a detailed description of the lt-trapand briefly discuss the illustrative case of the afterglow of grb 050502a,whose automatic identification by the lt just 3 min after the grb, led to theacquisition of the first early-time (&lt; 1 hr) multi-color light curve of a grbafterglow.

astro-ph;0607601	anatomy of a dark burst - the afterglow of grb 060108	we report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a grb (060108) thatwould have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-basedoptical imaging with the 2-m robotic faulkes telesscope (ftn). ourmultiwavelength analysis reveals an x-ray light curve typical of many swiftlong grbs (3-segments plus flare). its optical afterglow, however, was alreadyfainter than the detection limit of the uvot within 100s of the burst. opticalimaging in bvri' filters with the ftn began 2.75 minutes after the burst andresulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a ukirtk-band identification at ~45 mins. r and i'-band light curves are consistentwith a single power law decay in flux, f(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 &lt;0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. deep vlt r-band imaging at ~12 daysreveals a faint, extended object (r ~23.5 mag) at the location of theafterglow. although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of thea_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. this impliesthat the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observedin the x-rays. we derive a maximum photometric redshift z&lt;3.2 for grb 060108and a best-fitting optical-to-x-ray sed at 1000 s after the burst consistentwith a power law with index beta_ox = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.the unambiguous detection at b-band and the derived photometric redshift ruleout a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of grb 060108.instead, the hard opt/x-ray spectral index confirms it as one of theoptically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains theuvot non-detection (abridged).

astro-ph;0610660	the remarkable afterglow of grb 061007: implications for optical flashes  and grb fireballs	we present a multiwavelength analysis of swift grb 061007. the 2-m roboticfaulkes telescope south (fts) began observing 137 s after the onset of thegamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from r10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. these observationsbegin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-lawdecay identical to that seen at optical and x-ray wavelengths, with temporalslope alpha 1.7 this remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare forswift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. we suggest theafterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with theon-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates froma physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. the afterglowcontinues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. theobserved multiwavelength evolution of grb 061007 is explained by an expandingfireball whose optical, x-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated byemission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that isalready below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,nu_c, above the x-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. in contrast, the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. we suggestthat the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of swiftgrbs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysicsparameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_b.

astro-ph;0611554	the early and late-time spectral and temporal evolution of grb 050716	we report on a comprehensive set of observations of gamma ray burst 050716,detected by the swift satellite and subsequently followed-up rapidly in x-ray,optical and near infra-red wavebands. the prompt emission is typical oflong-duration bursts, with two peaks in a time interval of t90 = 68 seconds (15- 350 kev). the prompt emission continues at lower flux levels in the x-rayband, where several smaller flares can be seen, on top of a decaying lightcurve that exhibits an apparent break around 220 seconds post trigger. thistemporal break is roughly coincident with a spectral break. the latter can berelated to the extrapolated evolution of the break energy in the promptgamma-ray emission, and is possibly the manifestation of the peak flux breakfrequency of the internal shock passing through the observing band. a possible3 sigma change in the x-ray absorption column is also seen during this time.the late-time afterglow behaviour is relatively standard, with an electrondistribution power-law index of p = 2 there is no noticable temporal break outto at least 10 days. the broad-band optical/nir to x-ray spectrum indicates aredshift of z ~&gt; 2 for this burst, with a host-galaxy extinction value ofe(b-v) ~ 0.7 that prefers an smc-like extinction curve.

astro-ph;0611732	the circumburst environment of a fred grb: study of the prompt emission  and x-ray/optical afterglow of grb 051111	we report a multi-wavelength analysis of the prompt emission and earlyafterglow of grb051111 and discuss its properties in the context of currentfireball models. the detection of grb051111 by the burst alert telescopeon-board swift triggered early bvri' observations with the 2-m robotic faulkestelescope north in hawaii, as well as x-ray observations with the swift x-raytelescope. the prompt gamma-ray emission shows a classical fred profile. theoptical afterglow light curves are fitted with a broken power law, withalpha_1=0.35 to alpha_2=1.35 and a break time around 12 minutes after the grb.although contemporaneous x-ray observations were not taken, a power lawconnection between the gamma-ray tail of the fred temporal profile and the latexrt flux decay is feasible. alternatively, if the x-ray afterglow tracks theoptical decay, this would represent one of the first grbs for which thecanonical steep-shallow-normal decay typical of early x-ray afterglows has beenmonitored optically. we present a detailed analysis of the intrinsicextinction, elemental abundances and spectral energy distribution. from theabsorption measured in the low x-ray band we find possible evidence for anoverabundance of some alpha elements such as oxygen, [o/zn]=0.7+/-0.3, or,alternatively, for a significant presence of molecular gas. the ir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution measured at 80 minutes after the burst isconsistent with the cooling break lying between the optical and x-ray bands.extensive modelling of the intrinsic extinction suggests dust with big grainsor grey extinction profiles. the early optical break is due either to an energyinjection episode or, less probably, to a stratified wind environment for thecircumburst medium.

astro-ph;0701087	the prompt to late-time multiwavelength analysis of grb 060210	we present our analysis of the multiwavelength photometric &amp; spectroscopicobservations of grb 060210 and discuss the results in the overall context ofcurrent grb models. all available optical data underwent a simultaneoustemporal fit, while x-ray and gamma-ray observations were analysed temporally &amp;spectrally. the results were compared to each other and to possible grb models.the x-ray afterglow is best described by a smoothly broken power-law with abreak at 7.4 hours. the late optical afterglow has a well constrained singlepower-law index which has a value between the two x-ray indices, though it doesagree with a single power-law fit to the x-ray. an evolution of the hardness ofthe high-energy emission is demonstrated and we imply a minimum host extinctionfrom a comparison of the extrapolated x-ray flux to that measured in theoptical. we find that the flaring gamma-ray and x-ray emission is likely due tointernal shocks while the flat optical light curve at that time is due to theexternal shock. the late afterglow is best explained by a cooling break betweenthe optical and x-rays and continued central engine activity up to the time ofthe break. the required collimation corrected energy of ~ 2x10^52 erg, while atthe high end of the known energy distribution, is not unprecedented.

astro-ph;0701450	attributes of flares in gamma ray bursts: sample i	we discuss some of the preliminary results and findings derived from theanalysis of a first sample of flares detected by the xrt on board swift. theanalysis shows that the morphology of flares is the one we expect from thecollision of ultra-relativistic shells as it happens during the internal shockmodel proposed by rees and meszaros in 1994. furthermore the delta(t)/t ratioand the decay-time to rise-time ratio have mean values that are in goodagreement with the values observed in the prompt emission pulses that arebelieved to originate from internal shocks. the conclusion is that the flareanalysis favors the internal shock as due to shells that have been ejected bythe central engine after the prompt emission. the central engine seems toremain active and capable of generating large amounts of energy also at latertimes. more data are needed to establish whether or not some of the flarescould be due to shells that have been emitted with small lorentz factor at thetime of the prompt emission and generate later time flares due to the catch upof these shells.

astro-ph;0701591	swift grbs: the early afterglow spectral energy distribution	we present the first results of a program to systematically study theoptical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) of swift grb afterglowswith known redshift. the goal is to study the properties of the grb explosionand of the intervening absorbing material. in this report we present thepreliminary analysis on 23 afterglows. thanks to swift, we could build the sedat early times after the grb (minutes to hours). we derived the hydrogen columndensities and the spectral slopes from the x-ray spectrum. we then constrainedthe visual extinction by requiring that the combined optical/x-ray sed is dueto synchrotron, namely either a single power law or a broken power law with aslope change by 0.5. we confirm a low dust-to-metal ratio, smaller than in thesmc, even from the analysis of data taken significantly earlier than previouslypossible. our analysis does not support the existence of ``grey'' dust. we alsofind that the synchrotron spectrum works remarkably well to explain afterglowseds. we clearly see, however, that during the x-ray steep decay phases and theflares, the x-ray radiation cannot be due only to afterglow emission.

astro-ph;0701920	on the temporal variability classes found in long gamma-ray bursts with  known redshift	based on the analysis of a small sample of batse and konus gamma-ray bursts(grbs) with know redshift it has been reported that the width of theautocorrelation function (acf) shows a remarkable bimodal distribution in therest-frame of the source. however, the origin of these two well-separated acfclasses remains unexplained.we complement previous acf analysis studying thecorresponding power density spectra (pds). with the addition of beppo-sax dataand taken advantage of its broad-band capability, we not only increase theburst sample but we extend the analysis to x-ray energies. the rest-frame pdsanalysis at gamma-ray energies shows that the two acf classes are not simplycharacterised by a different low frequency cut-off, but they have a distinctvariability as a whole in the studied frequency range. both classes exhibitaverage pds with power-law behaviour at high frequencies (f' &gt; 0.1 hz) butsignificantly different slopes, with index values close to those of brownian(-2) and kolmogorov (-5/3) spectra for the narrow and broad classesrespectively. the latter spectrum presents an additional pds component, alow-frequency noise excess with a sharp cut-off. at x-ray energies we find thepower-law index unchanged for the broad class, but a significantly steeperslope in the narrow case (~ -3). we interpret this as an indication that thebroad class bursts have weaker spectral evolution than the narrow ones, assuggested also by our analysis of the acf energy dependence. the low and highfrequency pds components may then arise from two radiating regions involvingdifferent emission mechanisms.

astro-ph;0702220	swift observations of grb 070110: an extraordinary x-ray afterglow  powered by the central engine	we present a detailed analysis of swift multi-wavelength observations of grb070110 and its remarkable afterglow. the early x-ray light curve, interpretedas the tail of the prompt emission, displays a spectral evolution already seenin other gamma-ray bursts. the optical afterglow shows a shallow decay up to ~2d after the burst, which is not consistent with standard afterglow models. themost intriguing feature is a very steep decay in the x-ray flux at ~20 ks afterthe burst, ending an apparent plateau. the abrupt drop of the x-ray light curverules out an external shock as the origin of the plateau in this burst andimplies long-lasting activity of the central engine. the temporal and spectralproperties of the plateau phase point towards a continuous central engineemission rather than the episodic emission of x-ray flares. we suggest that theobserved x-ray plateau is powered by a spinning down central engine, possibly amillisecond pulsar, which dissipates energy at an internal radius beforedepositing energy into the external shock.

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.

0810.5446	swift monitoring of supergiant fast x-ray transients: the  out-of-outburst behaviour and the flares from igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a sub-class of high mass x-raybinaries (hmxbs) associated with ob supergiant companions and displayingtransient x-ray activity. this behaviour is quite surprising since hmxbshosting supergiants were known to be persistent sources, until the integraldiscoveries obtained by means of the monitoring of the galactic plane. we havebeen performing a monitoring campaign with swift of four sfxts with the mainaim of characterizing both the long-term behaviour of these transients and theproperties during bright outbursts. here we discuss the properties of the x-rayemission observed outside the outbursts as well as the flares observed from twosfxts: igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302. contrarily to what previously thought,swift allowed us to discover that sfxts spend most of the time in accretion ata low level, even outside the bright outbursts, with an accretion luminosity of1e33-1e34 erg/s, and that the quiescent level at ~1e32 erg/s is a much rarerstate.

0811.1444	a new measurement of the cosmic x-ray background	we present a new measurement of the cosmic x-ray background (cxrb) in the1.5-7 kev energy band, performed by exploiting the swift x-ray telescope (xrt)data archive. we also present a cxrb spectral model in a wider energy band(1.5-200 kev), obtained by combining these data with the recently publishedswift-bat measurement. from the xrt archive we collect a complete sample of 126high galactic latitude gamma-ray burst (grb) follow-up observations. thisprovides a total exposure of 7.5 ms and a sky-coverage of 7 square degreeswhich represents a serendipitous survey, well suited for a direct measurementof the cxrb in the 1.5-10 kev interval. our work is based on a completecharacterization of the instrumental background and an accurate measurement ofthe stray-light contamination and vignetting calibration. we find that the cxrbspectrum in the 1.5-7 kev energy band can be equally well fitted by a singlepower-law with photon index gamma=1.47+/-0.07 or a single power-law with photonindex gamma=1.41+/-0.06 and an exponential roll-off at 41 kev. the measuredflux in the 2-10 kev energy band is 2.18+/-0.13 e-11 erg/(cm2 s deg2) in the2-10 kev band. combining swift-xrt with swift-bat (15-200 kev) we find that, inthe 1.5-200 kev band, the cxrb spectrum can be well described by twosmoothly-joined power laws with the energy break at 29.0+/-0.5 kevcorresponding to a nu f_nu peak located at 22.4+/-0.4 kev. taking advantage ofboth the swift high energy instruments (xrt and bat), we produce an analyticaldescription of the cxrb spectrum over a wide (1.5-200 kev) energy band. thismodel is marginally consistent with the heao1 measurement (~10% higher atenergies higher than 20 kev, while it is significantly (30%) higher at lowenergies (2-10 kev).

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
