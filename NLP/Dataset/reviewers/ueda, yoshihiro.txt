0901.1982	grs 1915+105 in "soft state": nature of accretion disk wind and origin  of x-ray emission	we present the results from simultaneous chandra hetgs and rxte observationsof the microquasar grs 1915+105 in its quasi-stable "soft state" (or state a)performed on 2007 august 14, several days after the state transition from "hardstate" (state c). the x-ray flux increased with spectral hardening around themiddle of the chandra observation, after which the 67 hz qpo becamesignificant. the hetgs spectra reveal at least 32 narrow absorption lines fromhighly ionized ions including ne, mg, si, s, ar, ca, cr, mn, fe, whose featuresare the deepest among those ever observed with chandra from this source. wefind that the absorber has outflow velocities of ~150 and ~500 km s^{-1} with aline-of-sight velocity dispersion of ~70 and ~200 km s^{-1} for the si xiv andfe xxvi ions, respectively. the larger velocity and its dispersion in heavierions indicate that the wind has a non-uniform dynamical structure along theline-of-sight. the location of the absorber is estimated at ~(1-3)x10^5 r_g(r_g is the gravitational radius) from the source, consistent with thermallyand/or radiation driven winds. the continuum spectra obtained with rxte in the3-25 kev band can be well described with a thermal comptonization with anelectron temperature of ~4 kev and an optical depth of ~5 from seed photonsfrom the standard disk extending down to (4-7) r_g. in this interpretation,most of the radiation energy is produced in the comptonization corona, whichcompletely covers the inner part of the disk. a broad (1\sigma width of ~0.2kev) iron-k emission line and a smeared edge feature are detected, which can beexplained by reflection from the accretion disk at radii larger than 400 r_g.

0902.3307	suzaku view of the swift/bat active galactic nuclei (i): spectral  analysis of six agns and evidence for two types of obscured population	we present a systematic spectral analysis with suzaku of six agns detected inthe swift/bat hard x-ray (15--200 kev) survey, swift j0138.6-4001,j0255.2-0011, j0350.1-5019, j0505.7-2348, j0601.9-8636, and j1628.1-5145. thisis considered to be a representative sample of new agns without x-ray spectralinformation before the bat survey. we find that the 0.5--200 kev spectra ofthese sources can be uniformly fit with a base model consisting of heavilyabsorbed (log $n_{\rm{h}} &gt; 23.5 \rm{cm}^{-2}$) transmitted components,scattered lights, a reflection component, and an iron-k emission line. thereare two distinct groups, three "new type" agns (including the two sourcesreported by \citealt{ueda2007}) with an extremely small scattered fraction($f_{\rm{scat}} &lt; 0.5%$) and strong reflection component ($r = \omega / 2 \pi\gtrsim 0.8$ where $\omega$ is the solid angle of the reflector), and three"classical type" ones with $f_{\rm{scat}} &gt; 0.5%$ and $r \lesssim 0.8$. thespectral parameters suggest that the new type has an optically thick torus forthomson scattering ($n_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{25} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) with a smallopening angle $\theta \sim 20^{\circ}$ viewed in a rather face-on geometry,while the classical type has a thin torus ($n_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{23-24} \\rm{cm}^{-2}$) with $\theta \gtrsim 30^{\circ}$. we infer that a significantnumber of new type agns with an edge-on view is missing in the current all-skyhard x-ray surveys.

0903.2802	the suzaku view of the swift/bat agns (ii): time variability and spectra  of five "hidden" agns	the fraction of compton thick sources is one of the main uncertainties leftin understanding the agn population. the swift burst alert telescope (bat)all-sky survey, for the first time gives us an unbiased sample of agn for allbut the most heavily absorbed sources (log nh &gt; 25). still, the bat spectra (14- 195 kev) are time-averaged over months of observations and therefore hard tocompare with softer spectra from the swift xrt or other missions. this makes itdifficult to distinguish between compton-thin and compton-thick models. withsuzaku, we have obtained simultaneous hard (&gt; 15 kev) and soft (0.3 - 10 kev)x-ray spectra for 5 compton-thick candidate sources. we report on the spectraand a comparison with the bat and earlier xmm observations. based on both fluxvariability and spectral shape, we conclude that these hidden sources are notcompton-thick. we also report on a possible correlation between excess varianceand swift bat luminosity from the 16 d binned light curves, which holds truefor a sample of both absorbed (4 sources), unabsorbed (8 sources), and comptonthick (circinus) agn, but is weak in the 64 day binned bat light curves.

0904.3425	spectroscopic observations of the wz sge-type dwarf nova gw librae  during the 2007 superoutburst	we carried out an international spectroscopic observation campaign of thedwarf nova gw librae (gw lib) during the 2007 superoutburst. our observationperiod covered the rising phase of the superoutburst, maximum, slowly decayingphase (plateau), and long fading tail after the rapid decline from the plateau.the spectral features dramatically changed during the observations. in therising phase, only absorption lines of h$\alpha$, h$\beta$, and h$\gamma$ werepresent. around the maximum, the spectrum showed singly-peaked emission linesof h$\alpha$, he i 5876, he i 6678, he ii 4686, and c iii/n iii as well asabsorption lines of balmer components and he i. these emission linessignificantly weakened in the latter part of the plateau phase. in the fadingtail, all the balmer lines and he i 6678 were in emission, as observed inquiescence. we find that the center of the h$\alpha$ emission component wasmostly stable over the whole orbital phase, being consistent with the lowinclination of the system. comparing with the observational results of wz sgeduring the 2001 superoutburst, the same type of stars as gw lib seen with ahigh inclination angle, we interpret that the change of the h$\alpha$ profilebefore the fading tail phase is attributed to a photoionized region formed atthe outer edge of the accretion disk, irradiated from the white dwarf and innerdisk.

1001.2989	suzaku and optical spectroscopic observations of ss 433 in the 2006  april multiwavelength campaign	we report results of the 2006 april multi-wavelengths campaign of ss 433,focusing on x-ray data observed with suzaku at two orbital phases (in- andout-of- eclipse) and simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations. byanalyzing the fe25 k_alpha lines originating from the jets, we detect rapidvariability of the doppler shifts, dz/dt ~ 0.019/0.33 day^-1, which is largerthan those expected from the precession and/or nodding motion. this phenomenonprobably corresponding to "jitter" motions observed for the first time inx-rays, for which significant variability both in the jet angle and intrinsicspeed is required. from the time lag of optical doppler curves from those ofx-rays, we estimate the distance of the optical jets from the base to be ~(3-4)\times 10^14 cm. based on the radiatively cooling jet model, we determine theinnermost temperature of the jets to be t_0 = 13 +/- 2 kev and 16 +/- 3 kev(the average of the blue and red jets) for the out-of-eclipse and in-eclipsephase, respectively, from the line intensity ratio of fe25 k_alpha and fe26k_alpha. while the broad band continuum spectra over the 5--40 kev band ineclipse is consistent with a multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission expectedfrom the jets, and its reflection component from cold matter, theout-of-eclipse spectrum is harder than the jet emission with the basetemperature determined above, implying the presence of an additional hardcomponent.

1001.3612	mass function of binary massive black holes in active galactic nuclei	if the activity of active galactic nuclei (agns) is predominantly induced bymajor galaxy mergers, then a significant fraction of agns should harbor binarymassive black holes in their centers. we study the mass function of binarymassive black holes in nearby agns based on the observed agn black-hole massfunction and theory of evolution of binary massive black holes interacting witha massive circumbinary disk in the framework of coevolution of massive blackholes and their host galaxies. the circumbinary disk is assumed to be steady,axisymmetric, geometrically thin, self-regulated, self-gravitating butnon-fragmenting with a fraction of eddington accretion rate, which is typicallyone tenth of eddington value. the timescale of orbital decay is {then}estimated as ~10^8yr for equal mass black-hole, being independent of the blackhole mass, semi-major axis, and viscosity parameter but dependent on theblack-hole mass ratio, eddington ratio, and mass-to-energy conversionefficiency. this makes it possible for any binary massive black holes to mergewithin a hubble time by the binary-disk interaction. we find that (1.8+-0.6%)for the equal mass ratio and (1.6+-0.4%) for the one-tenth mass ratio of thetotal number of nearby agns have close binary massive black holes with orbitalperiod less than ten years in their centers, detectable with on-going highlysensitive x-ray monitors such as monitor of all-sky x-ray image and/orswift/burst alert telescope. assuming that all binary massive black holes havethe equal mass ratio, about 20% of agns with black hole masses of10^{6.5-7}m_sun has the close binaries and thus provides the best chance todetect them.

0707.3867	low/hard state spectra of gro j1655-40 observed with suzaku	the galactic black-hole binary gro j1655$-$40 was observed with suzaku on2005 september 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) and 20 ks with the hard x-ray detector (hxd). the source wasdetected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 kev, with anintensity of $\sim$50 mcrab at 20 kev. at a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300kev luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of theeddington luminosity for a 6 $m_{\odot}$ black hole). the source was in atypical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photonindex of $\sim 1.6$. during the observation, the source intensity graduallydecreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ kev, and by 35% below 2 kev. this,together with the soft x-ray spectra taken with the xis, suggests the presenceof an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from acool ($\sim 0.2$ kev) disk. the hard x-ray spectra obtained with the hxd reveala high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ kev.since the spectral photon index above 10 kev is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than thatobserved in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher thanthose of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 kev spectrum cannot bereproduced by a single thermal comptonization model, even consideringreflection effects. instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can besuccessfully explained by invoking two thermal-comptonization components withdifferent $y$-parameters. in contrast to the high/soft state spectra of thisobject in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalentwidths of 60--100 ev, the present xis spectra bear no such features beyond anupper-limit equivalent width of 25 ev.

1002.0909	scattered x-rays in obscured active galactic nuclei and their  implications for geometrical structure and evolution	we construct a new sample of 32 obscured active galactic nuclei (agns)selected from the second xmm-newton serendipitous source catalogue toinvestigate their multiwavelength properties in relation to the "scatteringfraction", the ratio of the soft x-ray flux to the absorption-corrected directemission. the sample covers a broad range of the scattering fraction(0.1%-10%). a quarter of the 32 agns have a very low scattering fraction(smaller than 0.5%), which suggests that they are buried in a geometricallythick torus with a very small opening angle. we investigate correlationsbetween the scattering fraction and multiwavelength properties. we find thatagns with a small scattering fraction tend to have low [o iii]lambda5007/x-rayluminosity ratios. this result agrees with the expectation that the extent ofthe narrow-line region is small because of the small opening angle of thetorus. there is no significant correlation between scattering fraction andfar-infrared luminosity. this implies that a scale height of the torus is notprimarily determined by starburst activity. we also compare scattering fractionwith black hole mass or eddington ratio and find a weak anti-correlationbetween the eddington ratio and scattering fraction. this implies that morerapidly growing supermassive black holes tend to have thicker tori.

1003.3350	testing accretion disk structure with suzaku data of lmc x-3	the suzaku observation of lmc x-3 gives the best data to date on the shape ofthe accretion disk spectrum. this is due to the combination of very lowabsorbing column density along this line of sight which allows the shape of thedisk emisison to be constrained at low energies by the ccd's, while the tailcan be simultaneously determined up to 30 kev by the high energy detectors.these data clearly demonstrate that the observed disk spectrum is broader thana simple 'sum of blackbodies', and relativistic smearing of the emission isstrongly required. however, the intrinsic emission should be more complex thana (color-corrected) sum of blackbodies as it should also contain photo-electricabsorption edges from the partially ionised disk photosphere. these arebroadened by the relativistic smearing, but the models predict ~ 3-5 per centdeviations for 1/3- 1 solar abundance around the edge energies, significantlystronger than observed. this indicate that the models need to include morephysical processes such as self-irradiation, bound-bound (line) absorption,and/or emission from recombination continuua and/or lines. alternatively, ifnone of these match the data, it may instead require that the accretion diskdensity and/or emissivity profile with height is different to that assumed.thus these data demonstrate the feasibility of observational tests of ourfundamental understanding of the vertical structure of accretion disks.

1007.0801	maxi gsc observations of a spectral state transition in the black hole  candidate xte j1752-223	we present the first results on the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 fromthe gas slit camera (gsc) on-board the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) onthe international space station. including the onset of the outburst reportedby the proportional counter array on-board the rossi x-ray timing explorer on2009 october 23, the maxi/gsc has been monitoring this source approximately 10times per day with a high sensitivity in the 2-20 kev band. xte j1752-223 wasinitially in the low/hard state during the first 3 months. an anti-correlatedbehavior between the 2-4 kev and 4-20 kev bands were observed around january20, 2010, indicating that the source exhibited the spectral transition to thehigh/soft state. a transient radio jet may have been ejected when the sourcewas in the intermediate state where the spectrum was roughly explained by apower-law with a photon index of 2.5-3.0. the unusually long period in theinitial low/hard state implies a slow variation in the mass accretion rate, andthe dramatic soft x-ray increase may be explained by a sudden appearance of theaccretion disk component with a relatively low innermost temperature (0.4-0.7kev). such a low temperature might suggest that the maximum accretion rate wasjust above the critical gas evaporation rate required for the state transition.

1010.1003	bright x-ray flares from the bl lac object mrk 421, detected with maxi  in 2010 january and february	strong x-ray flares from the blazar mrk 421 were detected in 2010 january andfebruary through the 7 month monitoring with the maxi gsc. the maximum 2 -- 10kev flux in the january and february flares was measured as 120 +- 10 mcrab and164 +- 17 mcrab respectively; the latter is the highest among those reportedfrom the object. a comparison of the maxi and swift bat data suggests a convexx-ray spectrum with an approximated photon index of about 2. this spectrum isconsistent with a picture that maxi is observing near the synchrotron peakfrequency. the source exhibited a spectral variation during these flares,slightly different from those in the previous observations, in which thepositive correlation between the flux and hardness was widely reported. byequating the halving decay timescale in the january flare, $t_{\rm d} \sim 2.5\times 10^{4}$ s, to the synchrotron cooling time, the magnetic field wasevaluated as b = 0.045 g $(\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, where $\delta$ is the jetbeaming factor. assuming that the light crossing time of the emission region isshorter than the doubling rise time, $t_{\rm r} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{4}$ s,the region size was roughly estimated as $ r &lt; 6 \times 10^{15}$ cm$(\delta/10)$. these are consistent with the values previously reported. forthe february flare, the rise time, $t_{\rm r} &lt; 1.3 \times 10^{5}$ s, gives aloose upper limit on the size as $ r &lt; 4 \times 10^{16}$ cm $(\delta/10)$,although the longer decay time $t_{\rm d} \sim 1.4 \times 10^{5}$ s, indicatesb = 0.015 g $(\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, which is weaker than the previous results.this could be reconciled by invoking a scenario that this flare is asuperposition of unresolved events with a shorter timescale.

0708.3968	spectral evolution of grb 060904a observed with swift and suzaku --  possibility of inefficient electron acceleration	we observed an x-ray afterglow of grb 060904a with the swift and suzakusatellites. we found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phaseand the decline phase of an x-ray flare in the bat and xrt data. the observedspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\gamma= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundredseconds in the prompt tail. this is one of the steepest x-ray spectra everobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron accelerationand synchrotron radiation. then, we applied an alternative spectral fittingusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (bpec) model. it is valid toconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotronfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. sincethe spectral cutoff appears in the soft x-ray band, we conclude the electronacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of grb 060904a. thesecutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tailphase to the shallow decay one. after that, typical afterglow spectra with thephoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both xrt andsuzaku/xis up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. we could successfullytrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energyand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\propto t^{-3} \simt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. this factindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completelydifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. therefore we conclude theemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.

(2009) to the suzaku spectra. we find our data are wellexplained by this torus model, which has four geometrical parameters. the fitresults suggest that ngc 612 has the torus half opening-angle of $\simeq60^{\circ}-70^{\circ}$ and is observed from a nearly edge-on angle with a smallamount of scattering gas, while ngc 3081 has a very small opening angle $\simeq15^\circ$ and is observed on a face-on geometry, more like the deeply buried"new type" agns found by ueda et al.

0709.3877	the cosmic mev gamma-ray background and hard x-ray spectra of active  galactic nuclei: implications for the origin of hot agn coronae	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation at 1-10 mev isstill unknown. although the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) up to a few hundredskev can be accounted for by the sum of active galactic nuclei (agns), currentmodels of agn spectra cannot explain the background spectrum beyond ~1 mev,because of the thermal exponential cutoff of electron energy distributionassumed in the models. here we construct a new spectral model by calculatingthe comptonization process including nonthermal electrons, which are expectedto exist in an agn hot corona if it is heated by magnetic reconnections. weshow that the mev background spectrum can nicely be explained by our model,when coronal electrons have a nonthermal power-law component whose total energyis a few percent of the thermal component and whose spectral index is d(lnn_e)/d(ln e_e) ~ -4. although the mev gamma-ray flux from such a component innearby agn spectra is below the detection limit of past observations, it couldbe detected by planned future mev detectors. we point out that the amount ofthe nonthermal component and its electron index are similar to those found forelectrons accelerated by magnetic reconnections in solar flares and the earthmagnetosphere, giving a support to the reconnection hypothesis for the originof hot agn coronae.

1107.4844	peculiarly narrow sed of grb 090926b with maxi and fermi/gbm	the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) gas slit camera (gsc) on theinternational space station (iss) detected a gamma-ray burst (grb) on 2009,september 26, grb\,090926b. this grb had extremely hard spectra in the x-rayenergy range. joint spectral fitting with the gamma-ray burst monitor on thefermi gamma-ray space telescope shows that this burst has peculiarly narrowspectral energy distribution and is represented by comptonized blackbody model.this spectrum can be interpreted as photospheric emission from the lowbaryon-load grb fireball. calculating the parameter of fireball, we found thesize of the base of the flow $r_0 = (4.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{9} \, y^{\prime \,-3/2}$ cm and lorentz factor of the plasma $\gamma = (110 \pm 10) \, y^{\prime\, 1/4}$, where $y^{\prime}$ is a ratio between the total fireball energy andthe energy in the blackbody component of the gamma-ray emission. this $r_0$ isfactor of a few larger, and the lorentz factor of 110 is smaller by also factorof a few than other bursts that have blackbody components in the spectra.

1108.5516	the first maxi/gsc catalog in the high galactic-latitude sky	we present the first unbiased source catalog of the monitor of all-sky x-rayimage (maxi) mission at high galactic latitudes ($|b| &gt; 10^{\circ}$), producedfrom the first 7-month data (2009 september 1 to 2010 march 31) of the gas slitcamera in the 4--10 kev band. we develop an analysis procedure to detect faintsources from the maxi data, utilizing a maximum likelihood image fittingmethod, where the image response, background, and detailed observationalconditions are taken into account. the catalog consists of 143 x-ray sourcesabove 7 sigma significance level with a limiting sensitivity of$\sim1.5\times10^{-11}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (1.2 mcrab) in the 4--10 kevband. among them, we identify 38 galactic/lmc/smc objects, 48 galaxy clusters,39 seyfert galaxies, 12 blazars, and 1 galaxy. other 4 sources are confusedwith multiple objects, and one remains unidentified. the log $n$ - log $s$relation of extragalactic objects is in a good agreement with the heao-1 a-2result, although the list of the brightest agns in the entire sky hassignificantly changed since that in 30 years ago.

1108.5897	a large x-ray flare from a single weak-lined t tauri star twa-7 detected  with maxi gsc	we present a large x-ray flare from a nearby weak-lined t tauri star twa-7detected with the gas slit camera (gsc) on the monitor of all-sky x-ray image(maxi). the gsc captured x-ray flaring from twa-7 with a flux of$3\times10^{-9}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 2--20 kev band during the scantransit starting at ut 2010-09-07 18:24:30.the estimated x-ray luminosity atthe scan in the energy band is 3$\times10^{32}$ ergs s$^{-1}$,indicating thatthe event is among the largest x-ray flares fromt tauri stars.since maxi gscmonitors a target only during a scan transit of about a minute per 92 minorbital cycle, the luminosity at the flare peak might have been higher thanthat detected. at the scan transit, we observed a high x-ray-to-bolometricluminosity ratio, log $l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol}$ = $-0.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$; i.e., thex-ray luminosity is comparable to the bolometric luminosity. since twa-7 hasneither an accreting disk nor a binary companion, the observed event impliesthat none of those are essential to generate such big flares in t tauri stars.

1109.0852	revisit of local x-ray luminosity function of active galactic nuclei  with the maxi extragalactic survey	we construct a new x-ray (2--10 kev) luminosity function of compton-thinactive galactic nuclei (agns) in the local universe, using the first maxi/gscsource catalog surveyed in the 4--10 kev band. the sample consists of 37non-blazar agns at $z=0.002-0.2$, whose identification is highly ($&gt;97%$)complete. we confirm the trend that the fraction of absorbed agns with $n_{\rmh} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ rapidly decreases against luminosity ($l_{\rm x}$),from 0.73$\pm$0.25 at $l_{\rm x} = 10^{42-43.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to 0.12$\pm0.09$at $l_{\rm x} = 10^{43.5-45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the obtained luminosity functionis well fitted with a smoothly connected double power-law model whose indicesare $\gamma_1 = 0.84$ (fixed) and $\gamma_2 = 2.0\pm0.2$ below and above thebreak luminosity, $l_{*} = 10^{43.3\pm0.4}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, respectively. whilethe result of the maxi/gsc agrees well with that of heao-1 at $l_{\rm x} \gtsim10^{43.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$, it gives a larger number density at the lowerluminosity range. comparison between our luminosity function in the 2--10 kevband and that in the 14--195 kev band obtained from the swift/bat surveyindicates that the averaged broad band spectra in the 2--200 kev band shoulddepend on luminosity, approximated by $\gamma\sim1.7$ for $l_{\rm x} \ltsim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ while $\gamma\sim 2.0$ for $l_{\rm x} \gtsim 10^{44}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this trend is confirmed by the correlation between the luminositiesin the 2--10 kev and 14--195 kev bands in our sample. we argue that there is nocontradiction in the luminosity functions between above and below 10 kev oncethis effect is taken into account.

1109.1378	a spectral study of the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 in the  high/soft state with maxi, suzaku and swift	we report on the x-ray spectral analysis of the black hole candidate xte\j1752--223 in the 2009--2010 outburst, utilizing data obtained with themaxi/gas slit camera (gsc), the swift/xrt, and suzaku, which workcomplementarily. as already reported by nakahira et al. (2010) maxi monitoredthe source continuously throughout the entire outburst for about eight months.all the maxi/gsc energy spectra in the high/soft state lasting for 2 months arewell represented by a multi-color disk plus power-law model. the innermost disktemperature changed from $\sim$0.7 kev to $\sim$0.4 kev and the disk fluxdecreased by an order of magnitude. nevertheless, the innermost radius isconstant at $\sim$41 $d_{3.5}(\cos{\it i})^{-1/2}$ km, where $d_{3.5}$ is thesource distance in units of 3.5 kpc and $i$ the inclination. the multi-colordisk parameters obtained with the maxi/gsc are consistent with those with theswift/xrt and suzaku. the suzaku data also suggests a possibility that the diskemission is slightly comptonized, which could account for broad iron-k featuresreported previously. assuming that the obtained innermost radius represents theinnermost stable circular orbit for a non-rotating black hole, we estimate themass of the black hole to be 5.51$\pm$0.28 $m_{\odot}$ $d_{3.5}(\cos{\iti})^{-1/2}$, where the correction for the stress-free inner boundary conditionand color hardening factor of 1.7 are taken into account. if the inclination isless than 49$^{\circ}$ as suggested from the radio monitoring of transient jetsand the soft-to-hard transition in 2010 april occurred at 1--4% of eddigntonluminosity, the fitting of the suzaku spectra with a relativisticaccretion-disk model derives constraints on the mass and the distance to be3.1--55 $m_{\odot}$ and 2.3--22 {\rm kpc}, respectively. this confirms that thecompact object in xte j1752--223 is a black hole.

1109.6069	long-term monitoring of the black hole binary gx 339-4 in the high/soft  state during the 2010 outburst with maxi/gsc	we present the results of monitoring the galactic black hole candidate gx339-4 with the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) / gas slit camera (gsc) inthe high/soft state during the outburst in 2010. all the spectra throughout the8-month period are well reproduced with a model consisting of multi-color disk(mcd) emission and its comptonization component, whose fraction is &lt;= 25% inthe total flux. in spite of the flux variability over a factor of 3, theinnermost disk radius is constant at r_in = 61 +/- 2 km for the inclinationangle of i = 46 deg and the distance of d=8 kpc. this r_in value is consistentwith those of the past measurements with tenma in the high/soft state. assumingthat the disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit of a non-spinningblack hole, we estimate the black hole mass to be m = 6.8 +/- 0.2 m_sun for i =46 deg and d = 8 kpc, which is consistent with that estimated from the suzakuobservation of the previous low/hard state. further combined with the massfunction, we obtain the mass constraint of 4.3 m_sun &lt; m &lt; 13.3 m_sun for theallowed range of d = 6-15 kpc and i &lt; 60 deg. we also discuss the spinparameter of the black hole in gx 339-4 by applying relativistic accretion diskmodels to the swift/xrt data.

1110.6512	combined spectral and timing analysis of the black hole candidate maxi  j1659-152 discovered by maxi and swift	we report on x-ray spectral and timing results of the new black holecandidate (bhc) maxi j1659-152 with the orbital period of 2.41 hours (shortestamong bhcs) in the 2010 outburst from 65 rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte)observations and 8 simultaneous swift and rxte observations. according to thedefinitions of the spectral states in remillard &amp; mcclintock (2006), most ofthe observations have been classified into the intermediate state. all thex-ray broadband spectra can be modeled by a multi-color disk plus a power-lawwith an exponential cutoff or a multi-color disk plus a comptonizationcomponent. during the initial phase of the outburst, a high energy cutoff wasvisible at 30-40 kev. the innermost radius of the disk gradually decreased by afactor of more than 3 from the onset of the outburst and reached a constantvalue of 35 d_10 cos i^-1/2 km, where d_10 is the distance in units of 10 kpcand $i$ is the inclination. the type-c quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo)frequency varied from 1.6 hz to 7.3 hz in association with a change of theinnermost radius, while the innermost radius remained constant during thetype-b qpo detections at 1.6-4.1 hz. hence, we suggest that the origin of thetype-b qpos is different from that of type-c qpos, the latter of which wouldoriginate from the disk truncation radius. assuming the constant innermostradius in the latter phase of the outburst as the innermost stable circularorbit, the black hole mass in maxi j1659-152 is estimated to be 3.6-8.0 m_solarfor a distance of 5.3-8.6 kpc and an inclination angle of 60-75 degrees.

1201.6491	outburst of ls v+44 17 observed by maxi and rxte, and discovery of a dip  structure in the pulse profile	we report on the first observation of an x-ray outburst of a be/x-ray binarypulsar ls v +44 17/rx j0440.9+4431, and the discovery of an absorption dipstructure in the pulse profile. an outburst of this source was discovered bymaxi gsc in 2010 april. it was the first detection of the transient activity ofls v +44 17 since the source was identified as a be/x-ray binary in 1997. fromthe data of the follow-up rxte observation near the peak of the outburst, wefound a narrow dip structure in its pulse profile which was clearer in thelower energy bands. the pulse-phase-averaged energy spectra in the 3$-$100 kevband can be fitted with a continuum model containing a power-law function withan exponential cutoff and a blackbody component, which are modified at lowenergy by an absorption component. a weak iron k$\alpha$ emission line is alsodetected in the spectra. from the pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy we foundthat the absorption column density at the dip phase was much higher than thosein the other phases. the dip was not seen in the subsequent rxte observationsat lower flux levels. these results suggest that the dip in the pulse profileoriginates from the eclipse of the radiation from the neutron star by theaccretion column.

1205.0140	infrared and hard x-ray diagnostics of agn identification from the  swift/bat and akari all-sky surveys	we combine data from two all-sky surveys in order to study the connectionbetween the infrared and hard x-ray (&gt;10kev) properties for local activegalactic nuclei (agn). the swift/burst alert telescope all-sky survey providesan unbiased, flux-limited selection of hard x-ray detected agn.cross-correlating the 22-month hard x-ray survey with the akari all-sky survey,we studied 158 agn detected by the akari instruments. we find a strongcorrelation for most agn between the infrared (9, 18, and 90 micron) and hardx-ray (14-195 kev) luminosities, and quantify the correlation for varioussubsamples of agn. partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsiccorrelation after removing the redshift contribution. the correlation for radiogalaxies has a slope and normalization identical to that for seyfert 1s,implying similar hard x-ray/infrared emission processes in both. in contrast,compton-thick sources show a large deficit in the hard x-ray band, because highgas column densities diminish even their hard x-ray luminosities. we proposetwo photometric diagnostics for source classification: one is an x-rayluminosity vs. infrared color diagram, in which type 1 radio-loud agn are wellisolated from the others in the sample. the other uses the x-ray vs. infraredcolor as a useful redshift-independent indicator for identifying compton-thickagn. importantly, compton-thick agn and starburst galaxies in composite systemscan also be differentiated in this plane based upon their hard x-ray fluxes anddust temperatures. this diagram may be useful as a new indicator to classifyobjects in new and upcoming surveys such as wise and nustar.

1205.0599	the truncated disk from suzaku data of gx 339-4 in the extreme very high  state	we report on the geometry of accretion disk and high energy coronae in thestrong comptonization state (the very high/steep power law/hard intermediatestate) based on a suzaku observation of the famous galactic black hole gx339-4. these data were taken just before the peak of the 2006-2007 outburst,and the average x-ray luminosity in the 0.7-200 kev band is estimated to be2.9e38 erg/s for a distance of 8 kpc. we fit the spectrum with both simple(independent disk and corona) and sophisticated (energetically coupled disk andcorona) models, but all fits imply that the underlying optically thick disk istruncated significantly before the innermost stable circular orbit around theblack hole. we show this directly by a comparison with similarly broadband datafrom a disk dominated spectrum at almost the same luminosity observed byxmm-newton and rxte 3 days after the suzaku observation.  during the suzaku observation, the qpo frequency changes from 4.3 hz to 5.5hz, while the spectrum softens. the energetically coupled model gives acorresponding 5+/- 8 % decrease in derived inner radius of the disk. while thisis not significant, it is consistent with the predicted change in qpo frequencyfrom lense-thirring precession of the hot flow interior to the disk and/or adeformation mode of this flow, as a higher qpo frequency implies a smaller sizescale for the corona. this is consistent with the truncated disk extendingfurther inwards towards the black hole.

1205.2774	a candidate active galactic nucleus with a pure soft thermal x-ray  spectrum	we report the discovery of a candidate active galactic nucleus (agn), 2xmmj123103.2+110648 at z = 0.13, with an x-ray spectrum represented purely by softthermal emission reminiscent of galactic black hole (bh) binaries in thedisk-dominated state. this object was found in the second xmm serendipitoussource catalogue as a highly variable x-ray source. in three separateobservations, its x-ray spectrum can be represented either by a multicolor diskblackbody model with an inner temperature of kt_in~0.16-0.21 kev or a wienspectrum comptonized by an optically thick plasma with kt~0.14-0.18 kev. thesoft x-ray luminosity in the 0.5--2 kev band is estimated to be (1.6-3.8)x10^42erg/s. hard emission above ~2 kev is not detected. the ratio of the soft tohard emission is the strongest among agns observed thus far. spectra selectedin high/low flux time intervals are examined in order to study spectralvariability. in the second observation with the highest signal-to-noise ratio,the low energy (below 0.7 kev) spectral regime flattens when the flux is high,while the shape of the high energy part (1-1.7 kev) remains unchanged. thisbehavior is qualitatively consistent with being caused by strongcomptonization. both the strong soft excess and spectral change consistent withcomptonization in the x-ray spectrum imply that the eddington ratio is large,which requires a small bh mass (smaller than ~10^5m_solar.

1205.5032	mid and far infrared properties of a complete sample of local agns	we investigate the mid- (mir) to far-infrared (fir) properties of a nearlycomplete sample of local active galactic nuclei (agns) detected in theswift/bat all sky hard x-ray (14-195 kev) survey, based on the crosscorrelation with the akari infrared survey catalogs complemented by those withiras and wise. out of 135 non-blazer agns in the swift/bat 9 month catalog, weobtain the mir photometric data for 128 sources either in the 9, 12, 18, 22,and/or 25 um band. we find good correlation between their hard x-ray and mirluminosities over 3 orders of magnitude (42&lt; log lambda l_{lambda}(9, 18 um)&lt;45), which is tighter than that with the fir luminosities at 90 um. thissuggests that thermal emission from hot dusts irradiated by the agn emissiondominate the mir fluxes. both x-ray unabsorbed and absorbed agns follow thesame correlation, implying isotropic infrared emission, as expected in clumpydust tori rather than homogeneous ones. we find excess signals around 9 um inthe averaged infrared spectral energy distribution from heavy obscured "newtype" agns with small scattering fractions in the x-ray spectra. this could beattributed to the pah emission feature, suggesting that their host galaxieshave strong starburst activities.

1206.3927	slow and fast transitions in the rising phase of outbursts from ns-lmxb  transients, aqlx-1 and 4u1608-52	we analyzed the initial rising behaviors of x-ray outbursts from twotransient low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) containing a neutron-star (ns), aqlx-1 and 4u 1608-52, which are continuously being monitored by maxi/gsc in 2--20kev, rxte/asm in 2--10 kev, and swift/bat in 15--50 kev. we found that theobserved ten outbursts are classified into two types by the patterns of therelative intensity evolutions in the two energy bands below/above 15 kev. onetype behaves as the 15--50 kev intensity achieves the maximum during theinitial hard-state period and drops greatly at the hard-to-soft statetransition. on the other hand, the other type does as both the 2--15 kev andthe 15--50 kev intensities achieve the maximums after the transition. theformer have the longer initial hard-state ($\gtrsim$ 9 d) than the latter's($\ltsim$5 d). therefore, we named them as slow-type (s-type) and fast-type(f-type), respectively. these two types also show the differences in theluminosity at the hard-to-soft state transition as well as in the averageluminosity before the outburst started, where the s-type are higher than thef-type in the both. these results suggest that the x-ray radiation during thepre-outburst period, which heats up the accretion disk and delays the disktransition (i.e., from a geometrically thick disk to a thin one), woulddetermine whether the following outburst becomes s-type or f-type. theluminosity when the hard-to-soft state transition occurs is higher than $\sim 8\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the s-type, which corresponds to 4% of theeddington luminosity for a 1.4 \mo ns.

1208.5050	comoving space density and obscured fraction of high-redshift active  galactic nuclei in the subaru/{\it xmm-newton} deep survey	we study the comoving space density of x-ray-selected luminous activegalactic nuclei (agns) and the obscured agn fraction at high redshifts ($3 &lt; z&lt; 5$) in the subaru/{\it xmm-newton} deep survey (sxds) field. from an x-raysource catalog with high completeness of optical identification thanks to deepoptical images, we select a sample of 30 agns at $z &gt; 3$ with intrinsic(de-absorbed and rest-frame 2--10 kev) luminosities of $l_{\rm x} = 10^{44-45}$erg s$^{-1}$ detected in the 0.5--2 kev band, consisting of 20 and 10 objectswith spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, respectively. utilizing the$1/v_{\rm max}$ method, we confirm that the comoving space density of luminousagns decreases with redshift above $z &gt; 3$. when combined with the {\itchandra}-cosmos result of civano et al.\ (2011), the density decline of agnswith $l_{\rm x} = 10^{44-45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is well represented by a power lawof $(1 + z)^{-6.2 \pm 0.9}$. we also determine the fraction of x-ray obscuredagns with $n_{\rm h} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the compton-thin population to be0.54$^{+0.17}_{-0.19}$, by carefully taking into account observational biasesincluding the effects of photon statistics for each source. this result isconsistent with an independent determination of the type-2 agn fraction basedon optical properties, for which the fraction is found to be 0.59$\pm$0.09.comparing our result with that obtained in the local universe, we conclude thatthe obscured fraction of luminous agns increases significantly from $z=0$ to$z&gt;3$ by a factor of 2.5$\pm$1.1.

1302.1070	luminosity-dependent unification of active galactic nuclei and the x-ray  baldwin effect	the existence of an anti-correlation between the equivalent width (ew) of thenarrow core of the iron kalpha line and the luminosity of the continuum (i.e.the x-ray baldwin effect) in type-i active galactic nuclei has been confirmedover the last years by several studies carried out with xmm-newton, chandra andsuzaku. however, so far no general consensus on the origin of this trend hasbeen reached. several works have proposed the decrease of the covering factorof the molecular torus with the luminosity (in the framework of theluminosity-dependent unification models) as a possible explanation for thex-ray baldwin effect. using the fraction of obscured sources measured by recentx-ray and ir surveys as a proxy of the half-opening angle of the torus, and therecent monte-carlo simulations of the x-ray radiation reprocessed by astructure with a spherical-toroidal geometry by ikeda et al. (2009) andbrightman &amp; nandra (2011), we test the hypothesis that the x-ray baldwin effectis related to the decrease of the half-opening angle of the torus with theluminosity. simulating the spectra of an unabsorbed population with aluminosity-dependent covering factor of the torus as predicted by recent x-raysurveys, we find that this mechanism is able to explain the observed x-raybaldwin effect. fitting the simulated data with a log-linear l_{2-10kev}-ewrelation, we found that in the seyfert regime (l_{2-10kev}&lt; 10^44.2 erg s^-1)luminosity-dependent unification produces a slope consistent with theobservations for average values of the equatorial column densities of the torusof log n_h^t &gt; 23.1. in the quasar regime (l_{2-10 kev}&gt; 10^44.2 erg s^-1) adecrease of the covering factor of the torus with the luminosity slower thanthat observed in the seyfert regime (as found by recent hard x-ray surveys) isable to reproduce the observations for 23.2 &lt; log n_h^t &lt; 24.2.

0712.3106	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) - vi. properties of active  galactic nuclei selected by optical variability	we present the properties of active galactic nuclei (agn) selected by opticalvariability in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf). based on the locationsof variable components and light curves, 211 optically variable agn werereliably selected. we made three agn samples; x-ray detected opticallynon-variable agn (xa), x-ray detected optically variable agn (xva), and x-rayundetected optically variable agn (va). in the va sample, we found a bimodaldistribution of the ratio between the variable component flux and the hostflux. one of these two components in the distribution, a class of agn with afaint variable component $i'_{\rm{vari}}\sim25$ mag in bright host galaxies$i'\sim21$ mag, is not seen in the xva sample. these agn are expected to havelow eddington ratios if we naively consider a correlation between bulgeluminosity and black hole mass. these galaxies have photometric redshifts$z_{\rm{photo}}\sim0.5$ and we infer that they are low-luminosity agn withradiatively inefficient accretion flows (riafs). the properties of the xva andva objects and the differences from those of the xa objects can be explainedwithin the unified scheme for agn. optical variability selection for agn is anindependent method and could provide a complementary agn sample which even deepx-ray surveys have not found.

1305.2912	broad band x-ray spectra of two low-luminosity active galactic nuclei  ngc 1566 and ngc 4941	we report the first broad band x-ray spectra of the low luminosity activegalactic nuclei (llagn) ngc 1566 (type 1.5) and ngc 4941 (type 2) observed withsuzaku and swift/bat covering the 0.5-195 kev band. both targets have hardx-ray luminosities of ~ 10^{41-42} ergs/s in the 15-55 kev band. the spectra ofthe nucleus are well reproduced by a sum of partially or fully coveredtransmitted emission and its reflection from the accretion disk, reprocessedemission from the torus accompanied by a strong narrow iron-k\alpha line, and ascattered component (for ngc 4941). we do not significantly detect a broadiron-k\alpha line from the inner accretion disk in both targets, and obtain anupper limit on the corresponding solid angle of \omega/2\pi &lt; 0.3 in ngc 1566.the reflection strength from the torus is moderate, \omega/2\pi=0.45^{+0.13}_{-0.10} in ngc 1566 and \omega/2\pi =0.64^{+0.69}_{-0.27} in ngc4941. comparison of the equivalent width of the narrow iron-k\alpha line with amodel prediction based on a simple torus geometry constrains its half-openingangle to be \theta_oa ~ 60-70 degree in ngc 4941. these results agree with theobscured agn fraction obtained from hard x-ray and mid-infrared selectedsamples at similar luminosities. our results support the implication that theaveraged covering fraction of agn tori is peaked at l 10^{42-43} ergs/s butdecreases toward lower luminosities.

1305.5980	suzaku view of the swift/bat active galactic nuclei. v. torus structure  of two luminous radio-loud agns (3c 206 and pks 0707-35)	we present the results from broad-band x-ray spectral analysis of 3c 206 andpks 0707-35 with suzaku and swift/bat, two of the most luminous unobscured andobscured radio-loud active galactic nuclei with hard x-ray luminosities of10^{45.5} erg s^{-1} and 10^{44.9} erg s^{-1} (14--195 kev), respectively.based on the radio core luminosity, we estimate that the x-ray spectrum of 3c206 contains a significant (~ 60% in the 14--195 kev band) contribution fromthe jet, while it is negligible in pks 0707-35. we can successfully model thespectra with the jet component (for 3c 206), the transmitted emission, and tworeflection components from the torus and the accretion disk. the reflectionstrengths from the torus are found to be r_{torus} (= \omega/2\pi) = 0.29 +-0.18 and 0.41 +- 0.18 for 3c 206 and pks 0707-35, respectively, which aresmaller than those in typical seyfert galaxies. utilizing the torus model byikeda et al. (2009), we quantify the relation between the half opening angle ofa torus (\theta_{oa}) and the equivalent width of an iron-k line. the observedequivalent width of 3c 206, &lt; 71 ev, constrain the column density in theequatorial plane to n_{h}^{eq} &lt; 10^{23} cm^{-2}, or the half opening angle to\theta_{oa} &gt; 80^\circ if n_{h}^{eq} = 10^{24} cm^{-2} is assumed. that of pks0707-35, 72 +- 36 ev, is consistent with n_{h}^{eq} ~ 10^{23} cm^{-2}. ourresults suggest that the tori in luminous radio-loud agns are only poorlydeveloped. the trend is similar to that seen in radio-quiet agns, implying thatthe torus structure is not different between agns with jets and without jets.

1307.4507	the role of the gamma-eddington ratio relation on the x-ray baldwin  effect in active galactic nuclei	the x-ray baldwin effect is the inverse correlation between the equivalentwidth (ew) of the narrow component of the iron kalpha line and the x-rayluminosity of active galactic nuclei (agn). a similar trend has also beenobserved between fe kalpha ew and the eddington ratio (lambda_edd). usingchandra/heg results of shu et al. (2010) and bolometric corrections we studythe relation between ew and the lambda_edd, and find that log ew =(-0.13+/-0.03)log(lambda_edd) + 1.47. we explore the role of the known positivecorrelation between the photon index of the primary x-ray continuum (gamma) andlambda_edd on the x-ray baldwin effect. we simulate the iron kalpha lineemitted by populations of unabsorbed agn considering 3 different geometries ofthe reflecting material: toroidal, spherical-toroidal and slab. we find thatthe gamma-lambda_edd correlation cannot account for the whole x-ray baldwineffect, unless a strong dependence of gamma on lambda_edd, such as the onerecently found by risaliti et al. (2009) and jin et al. (2012), is assumed. noclear correlation is found between ew and gamma. we conclude that a goodunderstanding of the slope of the gamma-lambda_edd relation is critical toassess whether the trend plays a leading or rather a marginal role in the x-raybaldwin effect.

0801.3315	suzaku results on cygnus x-1 in the low/hard state	the black-hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed for 17 ks with the suzaku x-rayobservatory in 2005 october, while it was in a low/hard state with a 0.7-300kev luminosity of 4.6 x 10^37 erg/s. the xis and hxd spectra, spanning 0.7-400kev, were reproduced successfully incorporating a cool accretion disk and a hotcomptonizing corona. the corona is characterized by an electron temperature of~100 kev, and two optical depths of ~0.4 and ~1.5 which account for the harderand softer continua, respectively. the disk has the innermost temperature of~0.2 kev, and is thought to protrude half way into the corona. the disk notonly provides seed photons to the compton cloud, but also produces a softspectral excess, a mild reflection hump, and a weakly broadened iron line. acomparison with the suzaku data on gro j1655-40 reveals several interestingspectral differences, which can mostly be attributed to inclination effectsassuming that the disk has a flat geometry while the corona is grosslyspherical. an intensity-sorted spectroscopy indicates that the continuumbecomes less comptonized when the source flares up on times scales of 1-200 s,while the underlying disk remains unchanged.

1310.0019	accretion disk and ionized absorber of the 9.7-hour dipping black hole  binary maxi j1305-704	we report the results from x-ray studies of the newly discovered black holecandidate maxi j1305-704 based on suzaku and swift observations in the low/hardand high/soft states, respectively. the long suzaku observation shows two typesof clear absorption dips, both of which recur on a dip interval of 9.74 +- 0.04hours, which we identify with the orbital period. there is also partiallyionized absorption in the non-dip (persistent) emission in both the high/softstate and, very unusually, the low/hard state. however, this absorption (inboth states) has substantially lower ionization than that seen in other highinclination systems, where the material forms a homogeneous disk wind. hereinstead the absorption is most probably associated with clumpy, compactstructures associated with the dipping material, which we see uniquely in thissource likely because we view it at a very large inclination angle. a largeinclination angle is also favored, together with a low black hole mass, toexplain the high disk temperature seen in the fairly low luminosity high/softstate, as doppler boosting enhances the disk temperature at high inclination.the disk radius inferred from these data is significantly smaller than that ofthe soft component seen in the low/hard state, supporting models where the diskis truncated at low luminosities. we find, however, that the lack ofvariability power on time scales of ~50 sec in the suzaku low/hard state datais difficult to explain, even with a low mass black hole.

1402.1836	toward the standard population synthesis model of the x-ray background:  evolution of x-ray luminosity and absorption functions of active galactic  nuclei including compton-thick populations	we present the most up-to-date x-ray luminosity function (xlf) and absorptionfunction of active galactic nuclei (agns) over the redshift range from 0 to 5,utilizing the largest, highly complete sample ever available obtained fromsurveys performed with swift/bat, maxi, asca, xmm-newton, chandra, and rosat.the combined sample, including that of the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey,consists of 4039 detections in the soft (0.5--2 kev) and/or hard ($&gt;2$ kev)band. we utilize a maximum likelihood method to reproduce the count-rate versusredshift distribution for each survey, by taking into account the evolution ofthe absorbed fraction, the contribution from compton-thick (ctk) agns, andbroad band spectra of agns including reflection components from tori based onthe luminosity and redshift dependent unified scheme. we find that the shape ofthe xlf at $z \sim 1-3$ is significantly different from that in the localuniverse, for which the luminosity dependent density evolution model gives muchbetter description than the luminosity and density evolution model. theseresults establish the standard population synthesis model of the x-raybackground (xrb), which well reproduces the source counts, the observedfractions of ctk agns, and the spectrum of the hard xrb. the number ratio ofctk agns to the absorbed compton-thin (ctn) agns is constrained to be$\approx$0.5--1.6 to produce the 20--50 kev xrb intensity within presentuncertainties, by assuming that they follow the same evolution as ctn agns. thegrowth history of supermassive black holes is discussed based on the new agnbolometric luminosity function.

1405.2645	the narrow fe k$\alpha$ line and the molecular torus in active galactic  nuclei - an ir/x-ray view	the narrow component of the iron k$\alpha$ is an almost ubiquitous feature inthe x-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (agn) and is believed to originatein neutral material, possibly located in the molecular torus. this would implya tight connection between the fe k$\alpha$ equivalent width (ew) and thephysical properties of the torus. in a recent work we have shown that thedecrease of the covering factor of the torus with the luminosity, as expectedby luminosity-dependent unification models, would be able to explain thedecrease of fe k$\alpha$ ew with the luminosity (i.e., the x-ray baldwineffect). recent developments in the study of the mid-ir (mir) spectrum of agnallow important parameters of the torus to be deduced, such as its coveringfactor ($f_{\rm\,obs}$) and equatorial column density ($n_{\rm\,h}^{\rm\,t}$),by applying clumpy torus models. using xmm-newton/epic observations of a sampleof 24 type-i agn, we investigate the relation between the physical parametersof the torus obtained by recent mir works and the properties of the fek$\alpha$ line. we correct the values of the fe k$\alpha$ ew by taking theinclination angle, the photon index, the equatorial column density, andhalf-opening angle of the torus into account using a physical torus model ofx-ray reprocessed radiation. we find that the relation between fe k$\alpha$ ewand $f_{\rm\,obs}$ shows a slope that is consistent with the expected value,albeit with a low statistical significance. a trend that is consistent with thetheoretical prediction is also found when comparing the fe k$\alpha$ ew to$n_{\rm\,h}^{\rm\,t}$. our work seems to confirm that the bulk of the narrow fek$\alpha$ line is produced by the same material responsible for the miremission.

1405.7575	iron k$\alpha$ emission in type-i and type-ii active galactic nuclei	the narrow fe k$\alpha$ line is one of the main signatures of thereprocessing of x-ray radiation from the material surrounding supermassiveblack holes, and it has been found to be omnipresent in the x-ray spectra ofactive galactic nuclei (agn). in this work we study the characteristics of thenarrow fe k$\alpha$ line in different types of agn. using the results of alarge suzaku study we find that seyfert 2s have on average lower fe k$\alpha$luminosities than seyfert 1s for the same 10-50 kev continuum luminosity.simulating dummy sy1s and sy2s populations using physical torus models of x-rayreflected emission, we find that this difference can be explained by means ofdifferent average inclination angles with respect to the torus, as predicted bythe unified model. alternative explanations include differences in theintensities of compton humps or in the photon index distributions. we show thatthe ratio between the flux of the broad and narrow fe k$\alpha$ line in the6.35-6.45 kev range depends on the torus geometry considered, and is on average$&lt;25\%$ and $&lt;15\%$ for type i and type ii agn, respectively. we find evidenceof absorption of the narrow fe k$\alpha$ line flux in compton-thick agn, whichsuggests that part of the reflecting material is obscured. we estimate that onaverage in obscured agn the reflected radiation from neutral material is seenthrough a column density which is 1/4 of that absorbing the primary x-rayemission. this should be taken into account in synthesis models of the cxb andwhen studying the luminosity function of heavily obscured agn. we detect thefirst evidence of the x-ray baldwin effect in seyfert 2s, with the same slopeas that found for seyfert 1s, which suggests that the mechanism responsible forthe decrease of the equivalent width with the continuum luminosity is the samein the two classes of objects.

1406.3912	maxi observations of grbs	monitor of all-sky image (maxi) gas slit camera (gsc) detects gamma-raybursts (grbs) including the bursts with soft spectra, such as x-ray flashes(xrfs). maxi/gsc is sensitive to the energy range from 2 to 30 kev. this energyrange is lower than other currently operating instruments which is capable ofdetecting grbs. since the beginning of the maxi operation on august 15, 2009,gsc observed 35 grbs up to the middle of 2013. one third of them are alsoobserved by other satellites. the rest of them show a trend to have softspectra and low fluxes. because of the contribution of those xrfs, the maxi grbrate is about three times higher than those expected from the batse log n - logp distribution. when we compare it to the observational results of thewide-field x-ray monitor on the high energy transient explorer 2, which coversthe the same energy range to that of maxi/gsc, we find a possibility that manyof maxi bursts are xrfs with epeak lower than 20 kev. we discuss the source ofsoft grbs observed only by maxi. the maxi log n - log s distribution suggeststhat the maxi xrfs distribute in closer distance than hard grbs. since thedistributions of the hardness of galactic stellar flares and x-ray burstsoverlap with those of maxi grbs, we discuss a possibility of a confusion ofthose galactic transients with the maxi grb samples.

1407.6449	decay structure of two hyperbolic relaxation models with regularity-loss	the paper aims at investigating two types of decay structure for linearsymmetric hyperbolic systems with non-symmetric relaxation. precisely, thesystem is of the type $(p,q)$ if the real part of all eigenvalues admits anupper bound $-c|\xi|^{2p}/(1+|\xi|^2)^{q}$, where $c$ is a generic positiveconstant and $\xi$ is the frequency variable, and the system enjoys theregularity-loss property if $p&lt;q$. it is well known that the standard type$(1,1)$ can be assured by the classical kawashima-shizuta condition. a newstructural condition was introduced in \cite{udk} to analyze theregularity-loss type $(1,2)$ system with non-symmetric relaxation. in thepaper, we construct two more complex models of the regularity-loss typecorresponding to $p=m-3$, $q=m-2$ and $p=(3m-10)/2$, $q=2(m-3)$, respectively,where $m$ denotes phase dimensions. the proof is based on the delicate fourierenergy method as well as the suitable linear combination of series of energyinequalities. due to arbitrary higher dimensions, it is not obvious to capturethe energy dissipation rate with respect to the degenerate components. thus,for each model, the analysis always starts from the case of low phasedimensions in order to understand the basic dissipative structure in thegeneral case, and in the mean time, we also give the explicit construction ofthe compensating symmetric matrix $k$ and skew-symmetric matrix $s$.

1408.5975	akari irc 2.5-5 um spectroscopy of infrared galaxies over a wide  luminosity range	we present the result of a systematic infrared 2.5-5 um spectroscopic studyof 22 nearby infrared galaxies over a wide infrared luminosity range (10 &lt;log(l_ir / lsun) &lt; 13) obtained from akari infrared camera (irc). the uniqueband of the akari irc spectroscopy enables us to access both the 3.3 umpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission feature from star formingactivity and the continuum of torus-dust emission heated by an active galacticnucleus (agn). applying our agn diagnostics to the akari spectra, we discover14 buried agns. the large fraction of buried agns suggests that agn activitybehind the dust is almost ubiquitous in ultra-/luminous infrared galaxies(u/lirgs). we also find that both the fraction and energy contribution ofburied agns increase with infrared luminosity from 10 &lt; log(l_ir / lsun) &lt; 13,including normal infrared galaxies with log (l_ir / lsun) &lt; 11. the energycontribution from agns in the total infrared luminosity is only ~7% in lirgsand ~20% in ulirgs, suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosityoriginates from starburst activity. using the pah emission, we investigate theluminosity relation between star formation and agn. we find that these infraredgalaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected seyfertgalaxies with the same agn luminosities, implying that infrared galaxies couldbe an early evolutionary phase of agn.

1408.6095	suzaku observation of iras 00521-7054, a peculiar type-ii agn with a  very broad feature at 6 kev	iras 00521$-$7054 is the first seyfert 2 in which the presence of anextremely large fe k$\alpha$ line has been claimed. we report here on theanalysis of a 100 ks suzaku observation of the source. we confirm the existenceof a very strong excess over the power-law x-ray continuum at $e\sim6$ kev($ew\simeq 800$ ev), extending down to $\sim 4.5$ kev, and found that the x-rayspectrum of the source can be explained by two different models. i) anabsorption scenario, in which the x-ray source is obscured by twofully-covering ionized absorbers, with a strong reflection component fromneutral material ($r\sim 1.7$), a black body component and four narrow gaussianlines (corresponding to fe k$\alpha$, fe k$\beta$, fe xxv and fe xxvi). ii) areflection scenario, in which the x-ray spectrum is dominated by an obscured($\log n_{\rm\,h}\sim 22.9$) blurred reflection produced in an ionized diskaround a rotating supermassive black hole with a spin of $a \geq 0.73$, andaffected by light-bending ($r\sim 2.7$), plus two narrow gaussian lines(corresponding to fe k$\alpha$ and fe k$\beta$). the narrow fe k$\alpha$ andk$\beta$ lines are consistent with being produced by ionized iron, and inparticular by fe xiv-fe xvi and fe xii-fe xvi for the absorption and reflectionscenario, respectively. while the x-ray continuum varies significantly duringthe observation, the intensity of the broad feature appears to be constant, inagreement with both the absorption and reflection scenarios. for both scenarioswe obtained a steep power-law emission ($\gamma\sim 2.2-2.3$), and we speculatethat the source might be an obscured narrow-line seyfert 1.

1410.7771	maxi investigation into the longterm x-ray variability from the  very-high-energy gamma-ray blazar mrk 421	the archetypical very-high-energy gamma-ray blazar mrk 421 was monitored formore than 3 years with the gas slit camera onboard monitor of all sky x-rayimage (maxi), and its longterm x-ray variability was investigated. the maxilightcurve in the 3 -- 10 kev range was transformed to the periodogram in thefrequency range $f = 1 \times 10^{-8}$ -- $2 \times 10^{-6}$ hz. the artifactson the periodogram, resulting from data gaps in the observed lightcurve, wereextensively simulated for variations with a power-law like power spectrumdensity (psd). by comparing the observed and simulated periodograms, the psdindex was evaluated as $\alpha = 1.60 \pm 0.25$. this index is smaller thanthat obtained in the higher frequency range ($f &gt; 1 \times 10^{-5}$ hz),namely, $\alpha = 2.14 \pm 0.06$ in the 1998 asca observation of the object.the maxi data impose a lower limit on the psd break at $f_{\rm b} = 5 \times10^{-6}$ hz, consistent with the break of $f_{\rm b} = 9.5 \times 10^{-6}$ hz,suggested from the asca data. the low frequency psd index of mrk 421 derivedwith maxi falls well within the range of the typical value among nearby seyfertgalaxies ($\alpha = 1$ -- $2$). the physical implications from these resultsare briefly discussed.

1501.06584	on the difference of torus geometry between hidden and non-hidden broad  line active galactic nuclei	we present results from the fitting of infrared (ir) spectral energydistributions of 21 active galactic nuclei (agn) with clumpy torus models. wecompiled high spatial resolution ($\sim 0.3$--$0.7$ arcsec) mid-ir $n$-bandspectroscopy, $q$-band imaging and nuclear near- and mid-ir photometry from theliterature. combining these nuclear near- and mid-ir observations, far-irphotometry and clumpy torus models, enables us to put constraints on the torusproperties and geometry. we divide the sample into three types according to thebroad line region (blr) properties; type-1s, type-2s with scattered or hiddenbroad line region (hblr) previously observed, and type-2s without any publishedhblr signature (nhblr). comparing the torus model parameters gives us the firstquantitative torus geometrical view for each subgroup. we find that nhblr agnhave smaller torus opening angles and larger covering factors than those ofhblr agn. this suggests that the chance to observe scattered (polarized) fluxfrom the blr in nhblr could be reduced by the dual effects of (a) lessscattering medium due to the reduced scattering volume given the small torusopening angle and (b) the increased torus obscuration between the observer andthe scattering region. these effects give a reasonable explanation for the lackof observed hblr in some type-2 agn.

1502.01077	low-mass x-ray binary maxi j1421-613 observed by maxi gsc and swift xrt	monitor of all sky x-ray image (maxi) discovered a new outburst of an x-raytransient source named maxi j1421-613. because of the detection of three x-raybursts from the source, it was identified as a neutron star low-mass x-raybinary. the results of data analyses of the maxi gsc and the swift xrtfollow-up observations suggest that the spectral hardness remained unchangedduring the first two weeks of the outburst. all the xrt spectra in the 0.5-10kev band can be well explained by thermal comptonization of multi-color diskblackbody emission. the photon index of the comptonized component is $\approx$2, which is typical of low-mass x-ray binaries in the low/hard state. sincex-ray bursts have a maximum peak luminosity, it is possible to estimate the(maximum) distance from its observed peak flux. the peak flux of the secondx-ray burst, which was observed by the gsc, is about 5 photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. by assuming a blackbody spectrum of 2.5 kev, the maximum distance tothe source is estimated as 7 kpc. the position of this source is contained bythe large error regions of two bright x-ray sources detected with orbitingsolar observatory-7 (oso-7) in 1970s. besides this, no past activities at thexrt position are reported in the literature. if maxi j1421-613 is the samesource as (one of) them, the outburst observed with maxi may have occurredafter the quiescence of 30-40 years.

astro-ph;0001009	the nature of ultra-luminous compact x-ray sources in nearby spiral  galaxies	studies were made of asca spectra of seven ultra-luminous compact x-raysources (ulxs) in nearby spiral galaxies; m33 x-8 (takano et al. 1994), m81 x-6(fabbiano 1988b; kohmura et al. 1994; uno 1997), ic 342 source 1 (okada et al.1998), dwingeloo 1 x-1 (reynolds et al. 1997), ngc 1313 source b (fabbiano &amp;trinchieri 1987; petre et al. 1994), and two sources in ngc 4565 (mizuno et al.1999). with the 0.5--10 kev luminosities in the range 10^{39-40} ergs/s, theyare thought to represent a class of enigmatic x-ray sources often found inspiral galaxies. for some of them, the asca data are newly processed, or thepublished spectra are reanalyzed. for others, the published results are quoted.the asca spectra of all these seven sources have been described successfullywith so called multi-color disk blackbody (mcd) emission arising fromoptically-thick standard accretion disks around black holes. except the case ofm33 x-8, the spectra do not exhibit hard tails. for the source luminosities notto exceed the eddington limits, the black holes are inferred to have ratherhigh masses, up to ~100 solar masses. however, the observed innermost disktemperatures of these objects, tin = 1.1--1.8 kev, are too high to becompatible with the required high black-hole masses, as long as the standardaccretion disks around schwarzschild black holes are assumed. similarly highdisk temperatures are also observed from two galactic transients withsuperluminal motions, gro 1655-40 and grs 1915+105. the issue of unusually highdisk temperature may be explained by the black hole rotation, which makes thedisk get closer to the black hole, and hence hotter.

astro-ph;0310616	possibility of a white dwarf as the accreting compact star in ci cam (=  xte j0421+560)	we present results from asca observations of the binary ci cam both inquiescence and in outburst in order to identify its central accreting object.the quiescence spectrum of ci cam consists of soft and hard components whichare separated clearly at aound 2-3kev. a large equivalent width of an iron kaemission line prefers an optically thin thermal plasma emission model to anon-thermal power-law model for the hard component, which favors a white dwarfas the accreting object, since the optically thin thermal hard x-ray emissionis a common characteristic among cataclysmic variables (binaries including anaccreting white dwarf).  the outburst spectrum, on the other hand, is composed of a hard componentrepresented by a multi-temperature optically thin thermal plasma emission andof an independent soft x-ray component that appears below 1 kev intermittentlyon a decaying light curve of the hard component. the spectrum of the softcomponent is represented well by a blackbody with the temperature of0.07-0.12kev overlaid with several k-edges associated with highly ionizedoxygen. this, together with the luminosity as high as ~1e38 erg/s is similar toa super-soft source (sss). the outburst in the hard x-ray band followed by theappearance of the soft blackbody component reminds us of recent observations ofnovae in outburst. we thus assume the outburst of ci cam is that of a nova, andobtain the distance to ci cam to be 5-17kpc by means of the relation betweenthe optical decay time and the absolute magnitude. this agrees well with arecent estimate of the distance of 5-9kpc in the optical band. all of theseresults from the outburst data prefer a white dwarf for the central object ofci cam.

astro-ph;0402520	near-infrared colors of hard x-ray selected active galactic nuclei	we present results of near-infrared photometry (j, h, k_s) for a sample ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) obtained from hard x-ray surveys with asca. thesample covers the agns at z=0.1-1 with l(2-10kev)=10^42-10^46 erg/s with veryhigh completeness. the fraction of red (j-k_s&gt;2 mag) agns in our sample is2(+-1)%, which is comparable to that for optically- or uv-selectedquasi-stellar objects (qsos, i.e. luminous agns). the number of red agns foundin our sample is also consistent with that expected from the surface density ofred agns found in 2mass by cutri et al. (2001). we find that theanomalously-small dust-to-gas ratios in circumnuclear gas, which is seen insome agns with seyfert-class luminosity, also occur in the qsos (agns withluminosity of l(2-10kev) &gt; 10^44.5 erg/s). for all the qsos with an x-rayabsorption of n_h &gt; 10^22 /cm2 in our sample, the values of a_v/n_h are smallerthan the galactic value by a factor of 5 to 100. since a fraction of thispopulation among the qsos in our sample is about 30%, such fraction ofoptical/uv-selected type 1 qsos known to date may show type 2 nature in x-ray.

astro-ph;0405158	partial covering interpretation of the x-ray spectrum of the nls1 1h  0707-495	the x-ray spectrum of 1h 0707-495 obtained with xmm-newton showing a deepflux drop at ~7 kev (boller et al. 2002) is studied based on the partialcovering concept. the previously inferred extreme iron overabundance can bereduced down to ~3x solar if the hard component gradually steepens at highenergies. the spectral shape supports that 1h 0707-495 is an agn analogue ofthe galactic black-hole binaries in the soft state. interpreting the softexcess as the emission from an optically-thick disk, the minimum black holemass m is estimated to be 2 x 10^6 solar masses from the intrinsic luminositycorrected for partial covering. based on the slim disk model, the observed disktemperature implies that the luminosity is close to the eddington limit. therapid and large flux variations with little change in the spectral shape canalso be explained, if not all, as due to changes in the partial coveringfraction. partial covering may account for the large variabilitycharacteristics of nls1.

astro-ph;0410655	study of the galactic interstellar medium from high resolution x-ray  spectroscopy: x-ray absorption fine structure and abundances of o, mg, si, s,  and fe	we study the composition of the galactic interstellar medium (ism) toward thegalactic center region (5 &lt; |l| &lt; 20 degree) by utilizing x-ray absorptionfeatures of three bright low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), gx 13+1, gx 5-1, andgx 340+0, observed with the chandra hetgs. we detect x-ray absorption finestructure (xafs) of the si k-edge, characterized by a narrow and a broadabsorption feature at 1846 and ~1865 ev, respectively. comparison with groundexperimental data indicates that most of the ism si exists in the form ofsilicates, although a composition of "pure" forsterite is ruled out. the xafsspectra of the sulfur k-edge indicate that a significant fraction of s existsin the gas phase. from each source, we derive the column densities of mg, s,si, and fe from the k-edge depth and that of o (or h) from the absorption ofthe continuum. the elemental abundance ratios are found to be consistentbetween the three targets: the mean values of o/si, mg/si, s/si, and fe/si aredetermined to be 0.55+-0.17, 1.14+-0.13, 1.03+-0.12, and 0.97+-0.31 solar,respectively (90% error in the mean value). we discuss the origins of theoverabundances of the heavy metals relative to o in the galactic ism bycomparison with the abundance pattern of the intracluster medium in clusters ofgalaxies. assuming that most of the mg and si atoms are depleted into silicatesof either the proxine or olivine family, we estimate that the number ratio ofmg to fe in olivine is &gt;~1.2 and that 17%-43% of the total o atoms in the ismmust be contained in silicate grains.

astro-ph;0509912	supermassive black hole mass functions at intermediate redshifts from  spheroid and agn luminosity functions	redshift evolution of supermassive black hole mass functions (bhmfs) isinvestigated up to z ~ 1. bhmfs at intermediate redshifts are calculated in twoways. one way is from early-type galaxy luminosity functions (lfs); we assumean m_bh - l_sph correlation at a redshift by considering a passive evolution ofl_sph in the local relationship. the resultant bhmfs (spheroid-bhmfs) from lfsof red sequence galaxies indicates a slight decrease of number density withincreasing redshift at m_bh &gt; 10^{7.5-8} m_solar. since a redshift evolution inslope and zeropoint of the m_bh - l_sph relation is unlikely to be capable ofmaking such an evolution in bhmf, the evolution of the spheroid-bhmfs isperhaps due mainly to the decreasing normalization in the galaxy lfs. we alsoinvestigate how spheroid-bhmfs are affected by uncertainties existing in thederivation in detail. the other way of deriving a bhmf is based on thecontinuity equation for number density of smbhs and lfs of active galacticnucleus (agn). the resultant bhmfs (agn-bhmfs) show no clear evolution out to z= 1 at m_bh &gt; 10^8 m_solar, but exhibit a significant decrease with redshift inthe lower mass range. comparison of the spheroid-bhmfs with the agn-bhmfssuggests that at m_bh &gt; 10^{8} m_solar, the spheroid-bhmfs are broadlyconsistent with the agn-bhmfs out to z ~ 1. the agreement between thespheroid-bhmfs and the agn-bhmfs appears to support that most of the smbhs arealready hosted by massive spheroids at z ~ 1 and they evolve withoutsignificant mass growth since then.

0809.1278	timing and spectral study of ax j1745.6-2901 with suzaku	the eclipsing low-mass x-ray binary ax j1745.6-2901 was observed with suzakuin its outburst phase. combining the chandra observation made 1.5 month earlierthan suzaku, we determined the orbital period to be 30063.76+/-0.14 s. we founddeep flux dips prior to the eclipse phase of orbit. the x-ray spectrum of thepersistent phase is described with a combination of a direct and a scattered-inby dust emissions. during the eclipse, the x-ray spectrum becomes only the dustscattering (scattered-in) component. the optical depth of the dust-scatteringis ~10.5 at 1 kev. the direct component is composed of a blackbody likely fromthe neutron star surface and a disk-blackbody. no power-law component is foundin the hard energy band up to 30 kev. a clear edge at ~7.1 kev in the deep dipspectrum indicates that the major portion of fe in the absorber is neutral orat low ionization state. we discovered four narrow absorption lines near thek-shell transition energies of fe xxv, fe xxvi, and ni xxvii. the absorptionline features are well explained by the solar abundance gas in a bulk motion of~10^3 km/s.

astro-ph;0604291	host galaxies of hard x-ray selected type-2 active galactic nuclei at  intermediate redshifts	we study properties of the host galaxies of 15 hard x-ray selected type-2active galactic nuclei (agns) at intermediate redshifts (0.05$&lt;z&lt;$0.6) detectedin $asca$ surveys. the absorption corrected hard x-ray luminosities $l_{\rm2-10 kev}$ range from 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. we tookthe $r$-band image of these agns with the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope.thanks to the intrinsic obscuration of nuclear light, we can decompose thegalaxies with a spheroid component and a disk component. the resulting spheroidluminosities correlate with $l_{\rm 2-10 kev}$; higher (lower) x-ray luminosityagns tend to reside in luminous (less luminous) spheroids. it is also foundthat the hosts of luminous agns show a large spheroid-to-disk luminosity ratio($\sim$1), while those of less luminous agns spread between 0 and 1. thecorrelation between $l_{\rm 2-10kev}$ and spheroid luminosity indicates thatthe relation between mass of a supermassive black hole (smbh) and spheroidluminosity (bs-relation) at the intermediate redshifts. the bs-relation agreeswith that in the local universe if the eddington ratio of 0.24 is adopted,which is a mean value determined from our $asca$ type-1 agn sample at similarredshifts through the broad-line width and continuum luminosity. the presentstudy demonstrates the effectiveness of using type-2 agns at high redshifts tostudy their host properties.

astro-ph;0609529	radio imaging of the subaru/xmm-newton deep field - i. the 100-microjy  catalogue, optical identifications, and the nature of the faint radio source  population	we describe deep radio imaging at 1.4-ghz of the 1.3 square degreesubaru/xmm-newton deep field (sxdf), made with the very large array in b and cconfigurations. we present a radio map of the entire field, and a catalogue of505 sources covering 0.8 square degrees to a peak flux density limit of 100microjy. robust optical identifications are provided for 90% of the sources,and suggested ids are presented for all but 14 (of which 7 are optically blank,and 7 are close to bright contaminating objects). we show that the opticalproperties of the radio sources do not change with flux density, suggestingthat agns continue to contribute significantly at faint flux densities. we testthis assertion by cross-correlating our radio catalogue with the x-ray sourcecatalogue and conclude that radio-quiet agns become a significant population atflux densities below 300 microjy, and may dominate the population responsiblefor the flattening of the radio source counts if a significant fraction of themare compton-thick.

astro-ph;0610496	suzaku discovery of iron absorption lines in outburst spectra of the  x-ray transient 4u 1630-472	we present the results of six suzaku observations of the recurrent black holetransient 4u1630-472 during its decline from outburst from february 8 to march23 in 2006. all observations show the typical high/soft state spectral shape inthe 2-50kev band, roughly described by an optically thick disk spectrum in thesoft energy band plus a weak power-law tail that becomes dominant only above\~20kev. the disk temperature decreases from 1.4kev to 1.2kev as the fluxdecreases by a factor 2, consistent with a constant radius as expected fordisk-dominated spectra. all the observations reveal significant absorptionlines from highly ionized (h-like and he-like) iron ka at 7.0kev and 6.7kev.the brightest datasets also show significant but weaker absorption structuresbetween 7.8kev and 8.2kev, which we identify as a blend of iron kb and nickelka absorption lines. the energies of these absorption lines suggest a blueshift with an outflow velocity of ~1000km/s.. the h-like iron ka equivalentwidth remains approximately constant at ~30 ev over all the observations, whilethat of the he-like ka line increases from 7 ev to 20 ev. thus the ionizationstate of the material decreases, as expected from the decline in flux. we fitthe profiles with voigt functions (curve of growth) to derive absorbingcolumns, then use these together with detailed photo-ionization calculations toderive physical parameters of the absorbing material. the data then constrainthe velocity dispersion of the absorber to 200-2000 km/s, and the size of theplasma as ~1e10 cm assuming a source distance of 10 kpc.

astro-ph;9610156	simultaneous x-ray and gamma-ray observations of cyg x-1 in the hard  state by ginga and osse	we present four x-ray/gamma-ray spectra of cyg x-1 observed in the hard('low') state simultaneously by ginga and gro/osse on 1991 july 6. the 3-30 kevginga spectra are well represented by power laws with an energy spectral indexof alpha~0.6 and a compton reflection component including a fluorescent fek-alpha corresponding to the solid angle of the reflector of ~0.3 times 2 pi.the overall ginga/osse spectra can be modelled by repeated compton scatteringin a mildly-relativistic, tau ~1, plasma. however, the high-energy cutoff issteeper than that due to single-temperature thermal comptonisation. it can bedescribed by a superposition of dominant optically-thin, thermal emission atkt~140 kev and a wien-like component from an optically-thick plasma at kt~50kev. the x-ray spectra do not show the presence of an anisotropy break requiredif thermal compton scattering takes place in a corona above a cold disc. also,the flat spectral index shows that the plasma is soft-photon starved, i.e., theluminosity in incident soft x-ray seed photons is very much less than that inthe hard x-rays. furthermore, the observed solid angle of the reflector issignificantly less than 2 pi. these facts taken together strongly rule out adisc-corona geometry. rather, the observed spectra are consistent with ageometry in which the cold accretion disc (which both supplies the seed softx-rays and reflects hard x-rays) only exists at large radii, while thecomptonising hot plasma is located in an inner region with no cold disc. thishot plasma consists of either pure electron-positron pairs if the source sizeis ~5 schwarzschild radii or it contains also protons if the size is larger.

astro-ph;9908128	the asca medium sensitivity survey (the gis catalog project): source  counts and evidence for emerging population of hard sources	we present first results from the asca medium sensitivity survey (amss; orthe gis catalog project). from the serendipitous fields amounting to 106dege-2, we determined the log n - log s relations in the 0.7-7 kev and 2-10 kevbands with the best statistical accuracy obtained so far, over the flux rangefrom 1 x 10e-11 to 5 x 10e-14 and 7 x 10e-14 erg se-1 cme-2, respectively. whenthe sources detected in the 0.7-7 kev band are divided into two subsamples withhigher and lower spectral hardness, the former exhibits a significantly steeperslope than the latter at fluxes below ~10e-12 erg se-1 cme-2 (0.7-7 kev). theaverage spectrum of sources becomes continuously harder toward fainter fluxes,from a photon index of 2.1 in the 0.7-10 kev range at the flux of ~10e-11 to1.6 at ~10e-13 erg se-1 cme-2 (0.7-7 kev). this is consistent with thecomparison of source counts between the 2-10 kev and the 0.7-2 kev band, andsolves the puzzle of their discrepancy reported previously. our resultsdemonstrate rapid emergence of hard x-ray sources with a decreasing flux from\~10e-12 to ~10e-13 erg se-1 cme-2 (2-10 kev).

0706.1168	suzaku observations of active galactic nuclei detected in the swift/bat  survey: discovery of "new type" of buried supermassive black holes	we present the suzaku broad band observations of two agns detected by theswift/bat hard x-ray (&gt;15 kev) survey that did not have previous x-ray data,swift j0601.9-8636 and swift j0138.6-4001. the suzaku spectra reveals in bothobjects a heavily absorbed power law component with a column density of nh =~10^{23.5-24} cm^{-2} that dominates above 10 kev, and an intense reflectioncomponent with a solid angle &gt;~ $2\pi$ from a cold, optically thick medium. wefind that these agns have an extremely small fraction of scattered light fromthe nucleus, &lt;~ 0.5% with respect to the intrinsic power law component. thisindicates that they are buried in a very geometrically-thick torus with a smallopening angle and/or have unusually small amount of gas responsible forscattering. in the former case, the geometry of swift j0601.9-8636 should benearly face-on as inferred from the small absorption for the reflectioncomponent. the discovery of two such objects in this small sample implies thatthere must be a significant number of yet unrecognized, very compton thick agnsviewed at larger inclination angles in the local universe, which are difficultto detect even in the currently most sensitive optical or hard x-ray surveys.
