hep-th;0303029	asymptotic quasinormal modes of reissner-nordstr\"om and kerr black  holes	according to a recent proposal, the so-called barbero-immirzi parameter ofloop quantum gravity can be fixed, using bohr's correspondence principle, froma knowledge of highly-damped black hole oscillation frequencies. suchfrequencies are rather difficult to compute, even for schwarzschild blackholes. however, it is now quite likely that they may provide a fundamental linkbetween classical general relativity and quantum theories of gravity. here wecarry out the first numerical computation of very highly damped quasinormalmodes (qnm's) for charged and rotating black holes. in the reissner-nordstr\"omcase qnm frequencies and damping times show an oscillatory behaviour as afunction of charge. the oscillations become faster as the mode order increases.at fixed mode order, qnm's describe spirals in the complex plane as the chargeis increased, tending towards a well defined limit as the hole becomesextremal. kerr qnm's have a similar oscillatory behaviour when the angularindex $m=0$. for $l=m=2$ the real part of kerr qnm frequencies tends to$2\omega$, $\omega$ being the angular velocity of the black hole horizon, whilethe asymptotic spacing of the imaginary parts is given by $2\pi t_h$.

hep-th;0307013	highly damped quasinormal modes of kerr black holes	motivated by recent suggestions that highly damped black hole quasinormalmodes (qnm's) may provide a link between classical general relativity andquantum gravity, we present an extensive computation of highly damped qnm's ofkerr black holes. we do not limit our attention to gravitational modes, thusfilling some gaps in the existing literature. the frequency of gravitationalmodes with l=m=2 tends to \omega_r=2 \omega, \omega being the angular velocityof the black hole horizon. if hod's conjecture is valid, this asymptoticbehaviour is related to reversible black hole transformations. other highlydamped modes with m&gt;0 that we computed do not show a similar behaviour. thereal part of modes with l=2 and m&lt;0 seems to asymptotically approach a constantvalue \omega_r\simeq -m\varpi, \varpi\simeq 0.12 being (almost) independent ofa. for any perturbing field, trajectories in the complex plane of qnm's withm=0 show a spiralling behaviour, similar to the one observed forreissner-nordstrom (rn) black holes. finally, for any perturbing field, theasymptotic separation in the imaginary part of consecutive modes with m&gt;0 isgiven by 2\pi t_h (t_h being the black hole temperature). we conjecture thatfor all values of l and m&gt;0 there is an infinity of modes tending to thecritical frequency for superradiance (\omega_r=m) in the extremal limit.finally, we study in some detail modes branching off the so--called``algebraically special frequency'' of schwarzschild black holes. for the firsttime we find numerically that qnm multiplets emerge from the algebraicallyspecial schwarzschild modes, confirming a recent speculation.

0904.0451	internal dynamics and dynamical friction effects in the dwarf spheroidal  galaxy in fornax	in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy the globular clusters are distributedwidely, without any significant central concentration. oh et al. pointed outthat such a distribution is paradoxical: dynamical friction effects estimatedusing single-component king models would have forced the globular clusters tospiral down to the center of the galaxy well within a hubble time. this paperis devoted to a discussion of this paradox. we describe a model in which thestars of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy are embedded in a cloud of dark matter,and each of these components is specified by its own phase space distributionfunction. this model allows us to fit self-consistently the observed luminosityprofile and the spatial variation of the velocity dispersion of the stars. thisfitting yields two basic parameters, related to the central density andvelocity dispersion, that characterize the phase space distribution of darkmatter. the dynamical friction effects calculated on the basis of thisself-consistent model are small enough that the observed spatial distributionof the globular clusters poses no difficulty, and the apparent paradox isresolved. thus we have at hand a model for fornax that reproduces the mainobserved features of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

0906.0313	post-circular expansion of eccentric binary inspirals: fourier-domain  waveforms in the stationary phase approximation	we lay the foundations for the construction of analytic expressions forfourier-domain gravitational waveforms produced by eccentric, inspiralingcompact binaries in a post-circular or small-eccentricity approximation. thetime-dependent, "plus" and "cross" polarizations are expanded in besselfunctions, which are then self-consistently re-expanded in a power series aboutzero initial eccentricity to eighth order. the stationary phase approximationis then employed to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the fouriertransform of the post-circular expanded, time-domain signal. we exemplify thisframework by considering newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in thepost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase andamplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the fourier domainwaveform. such higher harmonics lead to an effective increase in the inspiralmass reach of a detector as a function of the binary's eccentricity e_0 at thetime when the binary enters the detector sensitivity band. using the largestinitial eccentricity allowed by our approximations (e_0 &lt; 0.4), the mass reachis found to be enhanced up to factors of approximately 5 relative to that ofcircular binaries for advanced ligo, lisa, and the proposed einstein telescopeat a signal-to-noise ratio of ten. a post-newtonian generalization of the postcircular scheme is also discussed, which holds the promise to provide"ready-to-use" fourier-domain waveforms for data analysis of eccentricinspirals.

0909.0287	gravitational wave signatures of the absence of an event horizon. i.  nonradial oscillations of a thin-shell gravastar	gravitational waves from compact objects provide information about theirstructure, probing deep into strong-gravity regions. here we illustrate how thepresence or absence of an event horizon can produce qualitative differences inthe gravitational waves emitted by ultra-compact objects. in order to set up astraw-man ultra-compact object with no event horizon, but which is otherwisealmost identical to a black hole, we consider a nonrotating thin-shell modelinspired by mazur and mottola's gravastar, which has a schwarzschild exterior,a de sitter interior and an infinitely thin shell with finite tensionseparating the two regions. as viewed from the external space-time, the shellcan be located arbitrarily close to the schwarzschild radius, so a gravastarmight seem indistinguishable from a black hole when tests are only performed onits external metric. we study the linearized dynamics of the system, and inparticular the junction conditions connecting internal and externalgravitational perturbations. as a first application of the formalism we computepolar and axial oscillation modes of a thin-shell gravastar. we show that thequasinormal mode spectrum is completely different from that of a black hole,even in the limit when the surface redshift becomes infinite. polar qnms dependon the equation of state of matter on the shell and can be used to distinguishbetween different gravastar models. our calculations suggest thatlow-compactness gravastars could be unstable when the sound speed on the shellvs/c&gt;0.92.

0707.1202	matched-filtering and parameter estimation of ringdown waveforms	using recent results from numerical relativity simulations of non-spinningbinary black hole mergers we revisit the problem of detecting ringdownwaveforms and of estimating the source parameters, considering both lisa andearth-based interferometers. we find that advanced ligo and ego could detectintermediate-mass black holes of mass up to about 1000 solar masses out to aluminosity distance of a few gpc. for typical multipolar energy distributions,we show that the single-mode ringdown templates presently used for ringdownsearches in the ligo data stream can produce a significant event loss (&gt; 10%for all detectors in a large interval of black hole masses) and very largeparameter estimation errors on the black hole's mass and spin. we estimate thatmore than 10^6 templates would be needed for a single-stage multi-mode search.therefore, we recommend a "two stage" search to save on computational costs:single-mode templates can be used for detection, but multi-mode templates orprony methods should be used to estimate parameters once a detection has beenmade. we update estimates of the critical signal-to-noise ratio required totest the hypothesis that two or more modes are present in the signal and toresolve their frequencies, showing that second-generation earth-based detectorsand lisa have the potential to perform no-hair tests.

1001.3031	gravitational-wave signatures of the absence of an event horizon. ii.  extreme mass ratio inspirals in the spacetime of a thin-shell gravastar	we study gravitational-wave emission from the quasi-circular, extreme massratio inspiral of compact objects of mass m0 into massive objects of mass m&gt;&gt;m0whose external metric is identical to the schwarzschild metric, except for theabsence of an event horizon. to be specific we consider one of the simplestrealizations of such an object: a nonrotating thin-shell gravastar. the powerradiated in gravitational waves during the inspiral shows distinctive peakscorresponding to the excitation of the polar oscillation modes of thegravastar. for ultra-compact gravastars the frequency of these peaks dependsmildly on the gravastar compactness. for masses m~10^6msun the peaks typicallylie within the optimal sensitivity bandwidth of lisa, potentially providing aunique signature of the horizonless nature of the central object. forrelatively modest values of the gravastar compactness the radiated power haseven more peculiar features, carrying the signature of the microscopicproperties of the physical surface replacing the event horizon.

1002.2643	final spins from the merger of precessing binary black holes	the inspiral of binary black holes is governed by gravitational radiationreaction at binary separations r &lt; 1000 m, yet it is too computationallyexpensive to begin numerical-relativity simulations with initial separations r&gt; 10 m. fortunately, binary evolution between these separations is welldescribed by post-newtonian equations of motion. we examine how thispost-newtonian evolution affects the distribution of spin orientations atseparations r ~ 10 m where numerical-relativity simulations typically begin.although isotropic spin distributions at r ~ 1000 m remain isotropic at r ~ 10m, distributions that are initially partially aligned with the orbital angularmomentum can be significantly distorted during the post-newtonian inspiral.spin precession tends to align (anti-align) the binary black hole spins witheach other if the spin of the more massive black hole is initially partiallyaligned (anti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum, thus increasing(decreasing) the average final spin. spin precession is stronger forcomparable-mass binaries, and could produce significant spin alignment beforemerger for both supermassive and stellar-mass black hole binaries. we alsopoint out that precession induces an intrinsic accuracy limitation (&lt; 0.03 inthe dimensionless spin magnitude, &lt; 20 degrees in the direction) in predictingthe final spin resulting from the merger of widely separated binaries.

1003.4993	relativistic suppression of black hole recoils	numerical-relativity simulations indicate that the black hole produced in abinary merger can recoil with a velocity up to v_max ~ 4,000 km/s with respectto the center of mass of the initial binary. this challenges the paradigm thatmost galaxies form through hierarchical mergers, yet retain supermassive blackholes at their centers despite having escape velocities much less than v_max.interaction with a circumbinary disk can align the binary black hole spins withtheir orbital angular momentum, reducing the recoil velocity of the final blackhole produced in the subsequent merger. however, the effectiveness of thisalignment depends on highly uncertain accretion flows near the binary blackholes. in this letter, we show that if the spin s_1 of the more massive binaryblack hole is even partially aligned with the orbital angular momentum l,relativistic spin precession on sub-parsec scales can align the binary blackhole spins with each other. this alignment significantly reduces the recoilvelocity even in the absence of gas. for example, if the angle between s_1 andl at large separations is 10 degrees while the second spin s_2 is isotropicallydistributed, the spin alignment discussed in this paper reduces the medianrecoil from 864 km/s to 273 km/s for maximally spinning black holes with a massratio of 9/11. this reduction will greatly increase the fraction of galaxiesretaining their supermassive black holes.

1009.6172	constraining properties of the black hole population using lisa	lisa should detect gravitational waves from tens to hundreds of systemscontaining black holes with mass in the range from 10 thousand to 10 millionsolar masses. black holes in this mass range are not well constrained bycurrent electromagnetic observations, so lisa could significantly enhance ourunderstanding of the astrophysics of such systems. in this paper, we describe aframework for combining lisa observations to make statements about massiveblack hole populations. we summarise the constraints that lisa observations ofextreme-mass-ratio inspirals might be able to place on the mass function ofblack holes in the lisa range. we also describe how lisa observations can beused to choose between different models for the hierarchical growth ofstructure in the early universe. we consider four models that differ in theirprescription for the initial mass distribution of black hole seeds, and in theefficiency of accretion onto the black holes. we show that with as little as 3months of lisa data we can clearly distinguish between these models, even underrelatively pessimistic assumptions about the performance of the detector andour knowledge of the gravitational waveforms.

1010.3874	up to eleven: radiation from particles with arbitrary energy falling  into higher-dimensional black holes	we consider point particles with arbitrary energy per unit mass e that fallradially into a higher-dimensional, nonrotating, asymptotically flat blackhole. we compute the energy and linear momentum radiated in this process asfunctions of e and of the spacetime dimensionality d=n+2 for n=2,...,9 (in somecases we go up to 11). we find that the total energy radiated increases with nfor particles falling from rest (e=1). for fixed particle energies 1&lt;e&lt;=2 weshow explicitly that the radiation has a local minimum at some critical valueof n, and then it increases with n. we conjecture that such a minimum existsalso for higher particle energies. the present point-particle calculationbreaks down when n=11, because then the radiated energy becomes larger than theparticle mass. quite interestingly, for n=11 the radiated energy predicted byour calculation would also violate hawking's area bound. this hints at aqualitative change in gravitational radiation emission for n&gt;11. our resultsare in very good agreement with numerical simulations of low-energy,unequal-mass black hole collisions in d=5 (that will be reported elsewhere) andthey are a useful benchmark for future nonlinear evolutions of thehigher-dimensional einstein equations.

1011.3281	superkicks in ultrarelativistic encounters of spinning black holes	we study ultrarelativistic encounters of two spinning, equal-mass black holesthrough simulations in full numerical relativity. two initial data sequencesare studied in detail: one that leads to scattering and one that leads to agrazing collision and merger. in all cases, the initial black hole spins lie inthe orbital plane, a configuration that leads to the so-called "superkicks". inastrophysical, quasicircular inspirals, such kicks can be as large as ~3,000km/s; here, we find configurations that exceed ~15,000 km/s. we find that themaximum recoil is to a good approximation proportional to the total amount ofenergy radiated in gravitational waves, but largely independent of whether amerger occurs or not. this shows that the mechanism predominantly responsiblefor the superkick is not related to merger dynamics. rather, a consistentexplanation is that the "bobbing" motion of the orbit causes an asymmetricbeaming of the radiation produced by the in-plane orbital motion of the binary,and the net asymmetry is balanced by a recoil. we use our results to formulatesome conjectures on the ultimate kick achievable in any black hole encounter.

1011.5893	reconstructing the massive black hole cosmic history through  gravitational waves	the massive black holes we observe in galaxies today are the naturalend-product of a complex evolutionary path, in which black holes seeded inproto-galaxies at high redshift grow through cosmic history via a sequence ofmergers and accretion episodes. electromagnetic observations probe a smallsubset of the population of massive black holes (namely, those that are activeor those that are very close to us), but planned space-based gravitational-waveobservatories such as the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) can measurethe parameters of ``electromagnetically invisible'' massive black holes out tohigh redshift. in this paper we introduce a bayesian framework to analyze theinformation that can be gathered from a set of such measurements. our goal isto connect a set of massive black hole binary merger observations to theunderlying model of massive black hole formation. in other words, given a setof observed massive black hole coalescences, we assess what information can beextracted about the underlying massive black hole population model. forconcreteness we consider ten specific models of massive black hole formation,chosen to probe four important (and largely unconstrained) aspects of the inputphysics used in structure formation simulations: seed formation, metallicity``feedback'', accretion efficiency and accretion geometry. for the first timewe allow for the possibility of ``model mixing'', by drawing the observedpopulation from some combination of the ``pure'' models that have beensimulated. a bayesian analysis allows us to recover a posterior probabilitydistribution for the ``mixing parameters'' that characterize the fractions ofeach model represented in the observed distribution. our work shows that lisahas enormous potential to probe the underlying physics of structure formation.

1103.6041	accuracy of the post-newtonian approximation. ii. optimal asymptotic  expansion of the energy flux for quasicircular, extreme mass-ratio inspirals  into a kerr black hole	we study the effect of black hole spin on the accuracy of the post-newtonianapproximation. we focus on the gravitational energy flux for the quasicircular,equatorial, extreme mass-ratio inspiral of a compact object into a kerr blackhole of mass m and spin j. for a given dimensionless spin a=j/m^2 (ingeometrical units), the energy flux depends only on the orbital velocity v or(equivalently) on the boyer-lindquist orbital radius r. we investigate theformal region of validity of the taylor post-newtonian expansion of the energyflux (which is known up to order v^8 beyond the quadrupole formula),generalizing previous work by two of us. the "error function" used to determinethe region of validity of the post-newtonian expansion can have twoqualitatively different kinds of behavior, and we deal with these two casesseparately. we find that, at any fixed post-newtonian order, the edge of theregion of validity (as measured by v/v_{isco}, where v_{isco} is the orbitalvelocity at the innermost stable circular orbit) is only weakly dependent on a.unlike in the nonspinning case, the lack of sufficiently high order terms doesnot allow us to determine if there is a convergent to divergent transition atorder v^6. independently of a, the inclusion of angular multipoles up to andincluding l=5 in the numerical flux is necessary to achieve the level ofaccuracy of the best-known (n=8) pn expansion of the energy flux.

(ii) our description of natal kicks fromsupernovae plays an important role, especially for the formation of bh-bhsystems. (iii) the masses of bh-bh systems can be substantially increased inthe case of low metallicities or weak winds.

1203.2920	effects of post-newtonian spin alignment on the distribution of  black-hole recoils	recent numerical relativity simulations have shown that the final black holeproduced in a binary merger can recoil with a velocity as large as 5,000 km/s.because of enhanced gravitational-wave emission in the so-called "hang-up"configurations, this maximum recoil occurs when the black-hole spins arepartially aligned with the orbital angular momentum. we revisit our previousstatistical analysis of post-newtonian evolutions of black-hole binaries in thelight of these new findings. we demonstrate that despite these newconfigurations with enhanced recoil velocities, spin alignment during thepost-newtonian stage of the inspiral will still significantly suppress (orenhance) kick magnitudes when the initial spin of the more massive black holeis more (or less) closely aligned with the orbital angular momentum than thatof the smaller hole. we present a preliminary study of how this post-newtonianspin alignment affects the ejection probabilities of supermassive black holesfrom their host galaxies with astrophysically motivated mass ratio and initialspin distributions. we find that spin alignment suppresses (enhances) ejectionprobabilities by ~ 40% (20%) for an observationally motivated mass-dependentgalactic escape velocity, and by an even greater amount for a constant escapevelocity of 1,000 km/s. kick suppression is thus at least a factor two moreefficient than enhancement.

1209.0773	perturbations of slowly rotating black holes: massive vector fields in  the kerr metric	we discuss a general method to study linear perturbations of slowly rotatingblack holes which is valid for any perturbation field, and particularlyadvantageous when the field equations are not separable. as an illustration ofthe method we investigate massive vector (proca) perturbations in the kerrmetric, which do not appear to be separable in the standard teukolskyformalism. working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effectsinduced by rotation: a zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modesand bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling betweenaxial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. we explicitly computethe perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle themethod can be extended to any order. working at first order in rotation we showthat polar and axial proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled setsof equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axialperturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. by extending the calculation to secondorder we can study the superradiant regime of proca perturbations in aself-consistent way. for the first time we show that proca fields around kerrblack holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly strongerthan for massive scalar fields. because of this instability, astrophysicalobservations of spinning black holes provide the tightest upper limit on themass of the photon: mv&lt;4x10^-20 ev under our most conservative assumptions.spin measurements for the largest black holes could reduce this bound tomv&lt;10^-22 ev or lower.

1211.6114	universality, maximum radiation and absorption in high-energy collisions  of black holes with spin	we explore the impact of black hole spins on the dynamics of high-energyblack hole collisions. we report results from numerical simulations withgamma-factors up to 2.49 and dimensionless spin parameter +0.85, +0.6, 0, -0.6,-0.85. we find that the scattering threshold becomes independent of spin atlarge center-of-mass energies, confirming previous conjectures that structuredoes not matter in ultrarelativistic collisions. it has further been arguedthat in this limit all of the kinetic energy of the system may be radiated byfine tuning the impact parameter to threshold. on the contrary, we find thatonly about 60% of the kinetic energy is radiated for gamma=2.49. by monitoringapparent horizons before and after scattering events we show that the "missingenergy" is absorbed by the individual black holes in the encounter, andmoreover the individual black-hole spins change significantly. we support thisconclusion with perturbative calculations. an extrapolation of our results tothe limit gamma-&gt;infinity suggests that about half of the center-of-mass energyof the system can be emitted in gravitational radiation, while the rest must beconverted into rest-mass and spin energy.

1302.4442	resonant-plane locking and spin alignment in stellar-mass black-hole  binaries: a diagnostic of compact-binary formation	we study the influence of astrophysical formation scenarios on theprecessional dynamics of spinning black-hole binaries by the time they enterthe observational window of second- and third-generation gravitational-wavedetectors, such as advanced ligo/virgo, ligo-india, kagra and the einsteintelescope. under the plausible assumption that tidal interactions are efficientat aligning the spins of few-solar mass black-hole progenitors with the orbitalangular momentum, we find that black-hole spins should be expected topreferentially lie in a plane when they become detectable by gravitational-waveinterferometers. this "resonant plane" is identified by the conditions\delta\phi=0{\deg} or \delta\phi=+/-180{\deg}, where \delta\phi is the anglebetween the components of the black-hole spins in the plane orthogonal to theorbital angular momentum. if the angles \delta \phi can be accurately measuredfor a large sample of gravitational-wave detections, their distribution willconstrain models of compact binary formation. in particular, it will tell uswhether tidal interactions are efficient and whether a mechanism such as masstransfer, stellar winds, or supernovae can induce a mass-ratio reversal (sothat the heavier black hole is produced by the initially lighter stellarprogenitor). therefore our model offers a concrete observational link betweengravitational-wave measurements and astrophysics. we also hope that it willstimulate further studies of precessional dynamics, gravitational-wave templateplacement and parameter estimation for binaries locked in the resonant plane.

1304.2836	numerical simulations of single and binary black holes in scalar-tensor  theories: circumventing the no-hair theorem	scalar-tensor theories are a compelling alternative to general relativity andone of the most accepted extensions of einstein's theory. black holes in thesetheories have no hair, but could grow "wigs" supported by time-dependentboundary conditions or spatial gradients. time-dependent or spatially varyingfields lead in general to nontrivial black hole dynamics, with potentiallyinteresting experimental consequences. we carry out a numerical investigationof the dynamics of single and binary black holes in the presence of scalarfields. in particular we study gravitational and scalar radiation fromblack-hole binaries in a constant scalar-field gradient, and we compare ournumerical findings to analytical models. in the single black hole case we findthat, after a short transient, the scalar field relaxes to staticconfigurations, in agreement with perturbative calculations. furthermore wepredict analytically (and verify numerically) that accelerated black holes in ascalar-field gradient emit scalar radiation. for a quasicircular black-holebinary, our analytical and numerical calculations show that the dominantcomponent of the scalar radiation is emitted at twice the binary's orbitalfrequency.

1305.4306	quasinormal ringing of kerr black holes. ii. excitation by particles  falling radially with arbitrary energy	the analytical understanding of quasinormal mode ringing requires an accurateknowledge of the green's function describing the response of the black hole toexternal perturbations. we carry out a comprehensive study of quasinormal modeexcitation for kerr black holes. relying on the formalism developed by mano,suzuki and takasugi, we improve and extend previous calculations of thequasinormal mode residues in the complex frequency plane ("excitation factors"b_q). using these results we compute the "excitation coefficients" c_q(essentially the mode amplitudes) in the special case where the source of theperturbations is a particle falling into the black hole along the symmetryaxis. we compare this calculation with numerical integrations of theperturbation equations, and we show quantitatively how the addition of higherovertones improves the agreement with the numerical waveforms. our resultsshould find applications in models of the ringdown stage and in theconstruction of semianalytical template banks for gravitational-wave detectors,especially for binaries with large mass ratios and/or fast-spinning blackholes.

1307.5111	nonspinning black hole-neutron star mergers: a model for the amplitude  of gravitational waveforms	black hole-neutron star binary mergers display a much richer phenomenologythan black hole-black hole mergers, even in the relatively simple case -considered in this paper - in which both the black hole and the neutron starare nonspinning. when the neutron star is tidally disrupted, the gravitationalwave emission is radically different from the black hole-black hole case and itcan be broadly classified in two groups, depending on the spatial extent of thedisrupted material. we present a phenomenological model for the gravitationalwaveform amplitude in the frequency domain that encompasses the three possibleoutcomes of the merger: no tidal disruption, "mild", and "strong" tidaldisruption. the model is calibrated to general relativistic numericalsimulations using piecewise polytropic neutron star equations of state. itshould prove useful to extract information on the nuclear equation of statefrom future gravitational-wave observations, and also to obtain more accurateestimates of black hole-neutron star merger event rates in second- andthird-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. we plan toextend and improve the model as longer and more accurate gravitationalwaveforms become available, and we will make it publicly available online as amathematica package. we also present in appendix analytical fits of theprojected kagra noise spectral density, that should be useful in data analysisapplications.

1307.7315	scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of kerr-newman  black holes in the slow-rotation limit	in einstein-maxwell theory, according to classic uniqueness theorems, themost general stationary black-hole solution is the axisymmetric kerr-newmanmetric, which is defined by three parameters: mass, spin and electric charge.the radial and angular dependence of gravitational and electromagneticperturbations in the kerr-newman geometry do not seem to be separable. in thispaper we circumvent this problem by studying scalar, electromagnetic andgravitational perturbations of kerr-newman black holes in the slow-rotationlimit. we extend (and provide details of) the analysis presented in a recentletter [arxiv:1304.1160]. working at linear order in the spin, we present thefirst detailed derivation of the axial and polar perturbation equations in thegravito-electromagnetic case, and we compute the corresponding quasinormalmodes for any value of the electric charge. our study is the firstself-consistent stability analysis of the kerr-newman metric, and in principleit can be extended to any order in the small rotation parameter. we findnumerical evidence that the axial and polar sectors are isospectral at firstorder in the spin, and speculate on the possible implications of this result.

1307.8086	quasinormal modes of nearly extremal kerr spacetimes: spectrum  bifurcation and power-law ringdown	we provide an in-depth investigation of quasinormal-mode oscillations of kerrblack holes with nearly extremal angular momenta. we first discuss in greaterdetail the two distinct types of quasinormal mode frequencies presented in arecent paper (arxiv:1212.3271). one set of modes, that we call "zero-dampingmodes", has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit, and exists for allcorotating perturbations (i.e., modes with azimuthal index m beingnonnegative). the other set (the "damped modes") retains a finite decay rateeven for extremal kerr black holes, and exists only for a subset of corotatingmodes. as the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequencyspectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modesare present. we discuss the physical reason for the mode branching bydeveloping and using a bound-state formulation for the perturbations of generickerr black holes. we also numerically explore the specific case of thefundamental l=2 modes, which have the greatest astrophysical interest. usingthe results of these investigations, we compute the quasinormal mode responseof a nearly extremal kerr black hole to perturbations. we show that manysuperimposed overtones result in a slow power-law decay of the quasinormalringing at early times, which later gives way to exponential decay. thisexceptional early-time power-law decay implies that the ringdown phase islong-lived for black holes with large angular momentum, which could provide apromising strong source for gravitational-wave detectors.

0802.0025	cosmological black hole spin evolution by mergers and accretion	using recent results from numerical relativity simulations of black holemergers, we revisit previous studies of cosmological black hole spin evolution.we show that mergers are very unlikely to yield large spins, unless alignmentof the spins of the merging holes with the orbital angular momentum is veryefficient. we analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spinevolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolongedaccretion episodes, (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic)accretion episodes. we study how different diagnostics can distinguish betweenthese evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power ofgravitational-wave measurements and x-ray spectroscopy. gravitational radiationcan produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding respectivelythe spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spinof the merger remnant (as encoded in the ringdown waves), and the spin of``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (emri) of compactobjects. the latter spin population is also accessible to iron-linemeasurements. we compute and compare the spin distributions relevant for thesedifferent observations. if iron-line measurements and gravitational-waveobservations of emris only yield dimensionless spins j=j/m^2&gt;0.9, thenprolonged accretion should be responsible for spin-up, and chaotic accretionscenarios would be very unlikely. if only a fraction of the whole population oflow-redshift black holes spins rapidly, spin-alignment during binary mergers(rather than prolonged accretion) could be responsible for spin-ups.

1403.7147	distinguishing black-hole spin-orbit resonances by their  gravitational-wave signatures	if binary black holes form following the successive core collapses ofsufficiently massive binary stars, precessional dynamics may align their spins$\mathbf s_1$ and $\mathbf s_2$ and the orbital angular momentum $\mathbf l$into a plane in which they jointly precess about the total angular momentum$\mathbf j$. these spin orientations are known as spin-orbit resonances since$\mathbf s_1$, $\mathbf s_2$, and $\mathbf l$ all precess at the same frequencyto maintain their planar configuration. two families of such spin-orbitresonances exist, alike in dignity but differentiated by whether the componentsof the two spins in the orbital plane are either aligned or antialigned. thefraction of binary black holes in each family is determined by the stellarevolution of their progenitors, so if gravitational-wave detectors couldmeasure this fraction they could provide important insights into astrophysicalformation scenarios for binary black holes. in this paper, we show that evenunder the conservative assumption that binary black holes are observed alongthe direction of $\mathbf j$ (where precession-induced modulations to thegravitational waveforms are minimized), the waveforms of many members of eachresonant family can be distinguished from all members of the opposing family inevents with signal-to-noise ratios $\rho \simeq 10$, typical of those expectedfor the first detections with advanced ligo/virgo. we hope that our preliminaryfindings inspire a greater appreciation of the capability of gravitational-wavedetectors to constrain stellar astrophysics and stimulate further studies ofthe distinguishability of spin-orbit resonant families in more expanded regionsof binary black-hole parameter space.

1405.4547	i-love-q, spontaneously: slowly rotating neutron stars in scalar-tensor  theories	we construct models of slowly rotating, perfect-fluid neutron stars byextending the classical hartle-thorne formalism to generic scalar-tensortheories of gravity. working at second order in the dimensionless angularmomentum, we compute the mass m, radius r, scalar charge q, moment of inertia iand spin-induced quadrupole moment q, as well as the tidal and rotational lovenumbers. our formalism applies to generic scalar-tensor theories, but we focusin particular on theories that allow for spontaneous scalarization. it wasrecently discovered that the moment of inertia, quadrupole moment and lovenumbers are connected by approximately universal (i.e., equation-of-stateindependent) "i-love-q" relations. we find that similar relations hold also forspontaneously scalarized stars. more interestingly, the i-love-q relations inscalar-tensor theories coincide with the general relativistic ones within lessthan a few percent, even for spontaneously scalarized stars with the largestcouplings allowed by current binary-pulsar constraints. this implies thatastrophysical measurements of these parameters cannot be used to discriminatebetween general relativity and scalar-tensor theories, even if spontaneousscalarization occurs in nature. because of the well known equivalence betweenf(r) theories and scalar-tensor theories, the theoretical framework developedin this paper can be used to construct rotating compact stellar models in f(r)gravity. our slow-rotation expansion can also be used as a benchmark fornumerical calculations of rapidly spinning neutron stars in genericscalar-tensor theories.

0803.1853	accuracy of the post-newtonian approximation: optimal asymptotic  expansion for quasi-circular, extreme-mass ratio inspirals	we study the accuracy of the post-newtonian (pn) approximation and its formalregion of validity, by investigating its optimal asymptotic expansion for thequasi-circular, adiabatic inspiral of a point particle into a schwarzschildblack hole. by comparing the pn expansion of the energy flux to numericalcalculations in the perturbative teukolsky formalism, we show that (i) theinclusion of higher multipoles is necessary to establish the accuracy ofhigh-order pn terms, and (ii) the region of validity of pn theory is largest atrelative o(1/c^6) (3pn order). the latter result suggests that the seriesdiverges beyond 3pn order, at least in the extreme mass-ratio limit, probablydue to the appearance of logarithmic terms in the energy flux. the studypresented here is a first formal attempt to determine the region of validity ofthe pn approximation using asymptotic analysis. therefore, it should serve as atemplate to perform similar studies on other systems, such as comparable-massquasi-circular inspirals computed by high-accuracy numerical relativisticsimulations.

1410.2511	torsional oscillations of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theory of  gravity	we study torsional oscillations of neutron stars in the scalar-tensor theoryof gravity using the relativistic cowling approximation. we compute unperturbedneutron star models adopting realistic equations of state for the neutronstar's core and crust. for scalar-tensor theories that allow for spontaneousscalarization, the crust thickness can be significantly smaller than in generalrelativity. we derive the perturbation equation describing torsionaloscillations in scalar-tensor theory, and we solve the corresponding eigenvalueproblem to find the oscillation frequencies. the fundamental mode (overtone)frequencies become smaller (larger) than in general relativity for scalarizedstellar models. torsional oscillation frequencies may yield information on thecrust microphysics if microphysics effects are not degenerate withstrong-gravity effects, such as those due to scalarization. to address thisissue, we consider two different models for the equation of state of the crustand we look at the effects of electron screening. the effect of scalarizationon torsional oscillation frequencies turns out to be smaller than uncertaintiesin the microphysics for all spontaneous scalarization models allowed by binarypulsar observations. our study shows that the observation of quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos) following giant flares can be used to constrain themicrophysics of neutron star crusts, whether spontaneous scalarization occursor not.

1411.6286	slowly rotating anisotropic neutron stars in general relativity and  scalar-tensor theory	some models (such as the skyrme model, a low-energy effective field theoryfor qcd) suggest that the high-density matter prevailing in neutron starinteriors may be significantly anisotropic. anisotropy is known to affect thebulk properties of nonrotating neutron stars in general relativity. in thispaper we study the effects of anisotropy on slowly rotating stars in generalrelativity. we also consider one of the most popular extensions of einstein'stheory, namely scalar-tensor theories allowing for spontaneous scalarization (aphase transition similar to spontaneous magnetization in ferromagneticmaterials). anisotropy affects the moment of inertia of neutron stars (aquantity that could potentially be measured in binary pulsar systems) in boththeories. we find that the effects of scalarization increase (decrease) whenthe tangential pressure is bigger (smaller) than the radial pressure, and wepresent a simple criterion to determine the onset of scalarization bylinearizing the scalar-field equation. our calculations suggest that binarypulsar observations may constrain the degree of anisotropy or even, moreoptimistically, provide evidence for anisotropy in neutron star cores.

1504.02455	post-tolman-oppenheimer-volkoff formalism for relativistic stars	besides their astrophysical interest, compact stars also provide an arena forunderstanding the properties of theories of gravity that differ from einstein'sgeneral relativity. numerous studies have shown that different modifiedtheories of gravity can modify the bulk properties (such as mass and radius) ofneutron stars for given assumptions on the microphysics. what is not usuallystressed though is the strong degeneracy in the predictions of these theoriesfor the stellar mass and radius. motivated by this observation, in this paperwe take an alternative route and construct a stellar structure formalism which,without adhering to any particular theory of gravity, describes in a simpleparametrized form the departure from compact stars in general relativity. this"post-tolman-oppenheimer-volkoff (tov)" formalism for spherical static stars isinspired by the well-known parametrized post-newtonian theory, extended tosecond post-newtonian order by adding suitable correction terms to the fullyrelativistic tov equations. we show how neutron star properties are modifiedwithin our formalism, paying special attention to the effect of each correctionterm. we also show that the formalism is equivalent to general relativity withan "effective" (gravity-modified) equation of state.

1506.09116	precessional instability in binary black holes with aligned spins	binary black holes on quasicircular orbits with spins aligned with theirorbital angular momentum have been testbeds for analytic and numericalrelativity for decades, not least because symmetry ensures that suchconfigurations are equilibrium solutions to the spin-precession equations. inthis work, we show that these solutions can be unstable when the spin of thehigher-mass black hole is aligned with the orbital angular momentum and thespin of the lower-mass black hole is anti-aligned. spins in theseconfigurations are unstable to precession to large misalignment when the binaryseparation $r$ is between the values $r_{\rm ud\pm}= (\sqrt{\chi_1} \pm \sqrt{q\chi_2})^4 (1-q)^{-2} m$, where $m$ is the total mass, $q \equiv m_2/m_1$ isthe mass ratio, and $\chi_1$ ($\chi_2$) is the dimensionless spin of the more(less) massive black hole. this instability exists for a wide range of spinmagnitudes and mass ratios and can occur in the strong-field regime nearmerger. we describe the origin and nature of the instability using recentlydeveloped analytical techniques to characterize fully generic spin precession.this instability provides a channel to circumvent astrophysical spin alignmentat large binary separations, allowing significant spin precession prior tomerger affecting both gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signatures ofstellar-mass and supermassive binary black holes.

1509.06209	gravitational-wave cutoff frequencies of tidally disruptive neutron  star-black hole binary mergers	tidal disruption has a dramatic impact on the outcome of neutron star-blackhole mergers. the phenomenology of these systems can be divided in threeclasses: nondisruptive, mildly disruptive or disruptive. the cutoff frequencyof the gravitational radiation produced during the merger (which is potentiallymeasurable by interferometric detectors) is very different in each regime, andwhen the merger is disuptive it carries information on the neutron starequation of state. here we use semianalytical tools to derive a formula for thecritical binary mass ratio $q=m_{\rm bh}/m_{\rm ns}$ below which mergers aredisruptive as a function of the stellar compactness $\mathcal{c}=m_{\rmns}/r_{\rm ns}$ and the dimensionless black hole spin $\chi$. we then employ anew gravitational waveform amplitude model, calibrated to $134$ generalrelativistic numerical simulations of binaries with black hole spin(anti-)aligned with the orbital angular momentum, to obtain a fit to thegravitational-wave cutoff frequency in the disruptive regime as a function of$\mathcal{c}$, $q$ and $\chi$. our findings are important to buildgravitational wave template banks, to determine whether neutron star-black holemergers can emit electromagnetic radiation (thus helping multimessengersearches), and to improve event rate calculations for these systems.

gr-qc;0504017	testing general relativity and probing the merger history of massive  black holes with lisa	observations of binary inspirals with lisa will allow us to place bounds onalternative theories of gravity and to study the merger history of massiveblack holes (mbh). these possibilities rely on lisa's parameter estimationaccuracy. we update previous studies of parameter estimation includingnon-precessional spin effects. we work both in einstein's theory and inalternative theories of gravity of the scalar-tensor and massive-gravitontypes. inclusion of non-precessional spin terms in mbh binaries has littleeffect on the angular resolution or on distance determination accuracy, but itdegrades the estimation of the chirp mass and reduced mass by between one andtwo orders of magnitude. the bound on the coupling parameter of scalar-tensorgravity is significantly reduced by the presence of spin couplings, while thereduction in the graviton-mass bound is milder. lisa will measure theluminosity distance of mbhs to better than ~10% out to z~4 for a (10^6+10^6)msun binary, and out to z~2 for a (10^7+10^7) msun binary. the chirp mass of ambh binary can always be determined with excellent accuracy. ignoring spineffects, the reduced mass can be measured within ~1% out to z=10 and beyond fora (10^6+10^6) msun binary, but only out to z~2 for a (10^7+10^7) msun binary.present-day mbh coalescence rate calculations indicate that most detectableevents should originate at z~2-6: at these redshifts lisa can be used tomeasure the two black hole masses and their luminosity distance with sufficientaccuracy to probe the merger history of mbhs. if the low-frequency lisa noisecan only be trusted down to 10^-4 hz, parameter estimation for mbhs (and lisa'sability to perform reliable cosmological observations) will be significantlydegraded.

gr-qc;0605118	quasinormal ringing of kerr black holes: the excitation factors	distorted black holes radiate gravitational waves. in the so-called ringdownphase radiation is emitted in a discrete set of complex quasinormalfrequencies, whose values depend only on the black hole's mass and angularmomentum. ringdown radiation could be detectable with large signal-to-noiseratio by the laser interferometer space antenna lisa. if more than one mode isdetected, tests of the black hole nature of the source become possible. thedetectability of different modes depends on their relative excitation, which inturn depends on the cause of the perturbation (i.e. on the initial data). a``universal'', initial data-independent measure of the relative mode excitationis encoded in the poles of the green's function that propagates smallperturbations of the geometry (``excitation factors''). we compute for thefirst time the excitation factors for general-spin perturbations of kerr blackholes. we find that for corotating modes with $l=m$ the excitation factors tendto zero in the extremal limit, and that the contribution of the overtonesshould be more significant when the black hole is fast rotating. we alsopresent the first analytical calculation of the large-damping asymptotics ofthe excitation factors for static black holes, including the schwarzschild andreissner-nordstrom metrics. this is an important step to determine theconvergence properties of the quasinormal mode expansion.

gr-qc;0701086	mining information from binary black hole mergers: a comparison of  estimation methods for complex exponentials in noise	the ringdown phase following a binary black hole merger is usually assumed tobe well described by a linear superposition of complex exponentials(quasinormal modes). in the strong-field conditions typical of a binary blackhole merger, non-linear effects may produce mode coupling. artificial modecoupling can also be induced by the black hole's rotation, if the radiationfield is expanded in terms of spin-weighted spherical (rather than spheroidal)harmonics. observing deviations from linear black hole perturbation theoryrequires optimal fitting techniques to extract ringdown parameters fromnumerical waveforms, which are inevitably affected by errors. so far,non-linear least-squares fitting methods have been used as the standardworkhorse to extract frequencies from ringdown waveforms. these methods areknown not to be optimal for estimating parameters of complex exponentials.furthermore, different fitting methods have different performance in thepresence of noise. the main purpose of this paper is to introduce thegravitational wave community to modern variations of a linear parameterestimation technique first devised in 1795 by prony: the kumaresan-tufts andmatrix pencil methods. using "test" damped sinusoidal signals in gaussian whitenoise we illustrate the advantages of these methods, showing that they havevariance and bias at least comparable to standard non-linear least-squarestechniques. then we compare the performance of different methods onunequal-mass binary black hole merger waveforms. the methods we discuss shouldbe useful both theoretically (to monitor errors and search for non-linearitiesin numerical relativity simulations) and experimentally (for parameterestimation from ringdown signals after a gravitational wave detection).

gr-qc;0703053	inspiral, merger and ringdown of unequal mass black hole binaries: a  multipolar analysis	we study the inspiral, merger and ringdown of unequal mass black holebinaries by analyzing a catalogue of numerical simulations for seven differentvalues of the mass ratio (from q=m2/m1=1 to q=4). we compare numerical andpost-newtonian results by projecting the waveforms onto spin-weighted sphericalharmonics, characterized by angular indices (l,m). we find that thepost-newtonian equations predict remarkably well the relation between the waveamplitude and the orbital frequency for each (l,m), and that the convergence ofthe post-newtonian series to the numerical results is non-monotonic. to leadingorder the total energy emitted in the merger phase scales like eta^2 and thespin of the final black hole scales like eta, where eta=q/(1+q)^2 is thesymmetric mass ratio. we study the multipolar distribution of the radiation,finding that odd-l multipoles are suppressed in the equal mass limit. highermultipoles carry a larger fraction of the total energy as q increases. weintroduce and compare three different definitions for the ringdown startingtime. applying linear estimation methods (the so-called prony methods) to theringdown phase, we find resolution-dependent time variations in the fittedparameters of the final black hole. by cross-correlating information fromdifferent multipoles we show that ringdown fits can be used to obtain preciseestimates of the mass and spin of the final black hole, which are in remarkableagreement with energy and angular momentum balance calculations.
