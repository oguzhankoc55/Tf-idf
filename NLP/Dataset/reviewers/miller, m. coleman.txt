0812.4874	reaction of accretion disks to abrupt mass loss during binary black hole  merger	the association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair ofsupermassive black holes would have many important implications. for example,it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions indynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminositydistance that would enable precise cosmological tests. a proposal first made bybode &amp; phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves duringthe final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass ofthe central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that cansteepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristicway. we evaluate this process analytically and numerically. we find that shocksonly occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) ofthe disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thindisks which are thus at low eddington ratios. this strongly limits theeffective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the naturalvariations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.however, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreatof the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.this decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for aduration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive futurex-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, orpossibly a wide-field radio array such as the square kilometer array, if thedisk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.

0904.3326	mass segregation in ngc 2298: limits on the presence of an intermediate  mass black hole	[abridged] theoretical investigations have suggested the presence ofintermediate mass black holes (imbhs, with masses in the 100-10000 msun range)in the cores of some globular clusters (gcs). in this paper we present thefirst application of a new technique to determine the presence or absence of acentral imbh in globular clusters that have reached energy equipartition viatwo-body relaxation. the method is based on the measurement of the radialprofile for the average mass of stars in the system, using the fact that aquenching of mass segregation is expected when an imbh is present. here wemeasure the radial profile of mass segregation using main-sequence stars forthe globular cluster ngc 2298 from resolved source photometry based on hst-acsdata. the observations are compared to expectations from direct n-bodysimulations of the dynamics of star clusters with and without an imbh. the masssegregation profile for ngc 2298 is quantitatively matched to that inferredfrom simulations without a central massive object over all the radial rangeprobed by the observations, that is from the center to about two half-massradii. profiles from simulations containing an imbh more massive than ~ 300-500msun (depending on the assumed total mass of ngc 2298) are instead inconsistentwith the data at about 3 sigma confidence, irrespective of the imf and binaryfraction chosen for these runs. while providing a null result in the quest ofdetecting a central black hole in globular clusters, the data-model comparisoncarried out here demonstrates the feasibility of the method which can also beapplied to other globular clusters with resolved photometry in their cores.

0907.3223	khz quasi-periodic oscillations in the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 0614+09	we report on a comprehensive analysis of the kilohertz (above 300 hz)quasi-periodic oscillations (khz qpos) detected from the neutron star low-massx-ray binary 4u0614+09 with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). with a muchlarger data set than previously analyzed (all archival data from february 1996up to october 2007), we first investigate the reality of the 1330 hz qporeported by van straaten et al. (2000). this qpo would be of particularinterest since it has the highest frequency reported for any source. a thoroughanalysis of the same observation fails to confirm the detection. on the otherhand, over our extended data set, the highest qpo frequency we measure for theupper khz qpo is at about 1224 hz; a value which is fully consistent with themaximum values observed in similar systems. second, we demonstrate that thefrequency dependence of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower and upperkhz qpos follow the systematic trends seen in similar systems (barret et al.,2006). in particular, 4u0614+09 shows a drop of the quality factor of the lowerkhz qpo above 700 hz. if this is due to an approach to the innermost stablecircular orbit, it implies a neutron star mass of about 1.9 solar masses.finally, when analyzing the data over fixed durations, we have found a gap inthe frequency distribution of the upper qpo, associated with a local minimum ofits amplitude. a similar gap is not present in the distribution of the lowerqpo frequencies, suggesting some cautions when interpreting frequency ratiodistributions, based on the occurrence of the lower qpo only.

0907.5450	exploring intermediate and massive black-hole binaries with the einstein  telescope	we discuss the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector such asthe einstein telescope (et) to enhance our astrophysical knowledge throughdetections of gravitational waves emitted by binaries includingintermediate-mass and massive black holes. the design target for suchinstruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies, specifically inthe ~ 1-10 hz range. this will allow the detection of gravitational wavesgenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~100-1000 solar masses. we primarily discuss two different source types --mergers between two intermediate mass black holes (imbhs) of comparable mass,and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (imris) of smaller compact objects withmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into imbhs. imbhs may form via two channels: (i) indark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse ofvery massive metal-poor population iii stars, or (ii) via runaway stellarcollisions in globular clusters. in this paper, we will discuss both formationchannels, and both classes of merger in each case. we review existing rateestimates where these exist in the literature, and provide some newcalculations for the approximate numbers of events that will be seen by adetector like the einstein telescope. these results indicate that the et maysee a few to a few thousand comparable-mass imbh mergers and as many as severalhundred imri events per year. these observations will significantly enhance ourunderstanding of galactic black-hole growth, of the existence and properties ofimbhs and of the astrophysics of globular clusters. we finish our review with adiscussion of some more speculative sources of gravitational waves for the et,including hypermassive white dwarfs and eccentric stellar-mass compact-objectbinaries.

0908.0023	modeling flows around merging black hole binaries	coalescing massive black hole binaries are produced by the mergers ofgalaxies. the final stages of the black hole coalescence produce stronggravitational radiation that can be detected by the space-borne lisa. in caseswhere the black hole merger takes place in the presence of gas and magneticfields, various types of electromagnetic signals may also be produced. modelingsuch electromagnetic counterparts of the final merger requires evolving thebehavior of both gas and fields in the strong-field regions around the blackholes. we have taken a step towards solving this problem by mapping the flow ofpressureless matter in the dynamic, 3-d general relativistic spacetime aroundthe merging black holes. we find qualitative differences in collision andoutflow speeds, including a signature of the merger when the net angularmomentum of the matter is low, between the results from single and binary blackholes, and between nonrotating and rotating holes in binaries. if futuremagnetohydrodynamic results confirm these differences, it may allow assessmentof the properties of the binaries as well as yielding an identifiableelectromagnetic counterpart to the attendant gravitational wave signal.

0908.4245	systematic variation in the apparent burning area of thermonuclear  bursts and its implication for neutron star radius measurement	precision measurements of neutron star radii can provide a powerful probe ofthe properties of cold matter beyond nuclear density. beginning in the late1970s it was proposed that the radius could be obtained from the apparent orinferred emitting area during the decay portions of thermonuclear (type i)x-ray bursts. however, this apparent area is generally not constant, preventingreliable measurement of the source radius. here we report for the first time acorrelation between the variation of the inferred area and the burstproperties, measured in a sample of almost 900 bursts from 43 sources. we foundthat the rate of change of the inferred area during decay is anticorrelatedwith the burst decay duration. a spearman rank correlation test shows that thisrelation is significant at the &lt;10^{-45} level for our entire sample, and atthe 7x10^{-37} level for the 625 bursts without photospheric radius expansion.this anticorrelation is also highly significant for individual sourcesexhibiting a wide range of burst durations, such as 4u 1636-536 and aql x-1. wesuggest that variations in the colour factor, which relates the colourtemperature resulted from the scattering in the neutron star atmosphere to theeffective temperature of the burning layer, may explain the correlation. thisin turn implies significant variations in the composition of the atmospherebetween bursts with long and short durations.

1003.5850	super-eddington fluxes during thermonuclear x-ray bursts	it has been known for nearly three decades that the energy spectra ofthermonuclear x-ray bursts are often well-fit by planck functions withtemperatures so high that they imply a super-eddington radiative flux at theemitting surface, even during portions of bursts when there is no evidence ofphotospheric radius expansion. this apparent inconsistency is usually set asideby assuming that the flux is actually sub-eddington and that the fittedtemperature is so high because the spectrum has been distorted by theenergy-dependent opacity of the atmosphere. here we show that the spectrapredicted by currently available conventional atmosphere models appearincompatible with the highest-precision measurements of burst spectra madeusing the rossi x-ray timing explorer, such as during the 4u 1820-30 superburstand a long burst from gx 17+2. in contrast, these measurements are well-fit bybose-einstein spectra with high temperatures and modest chemical potentials.such spectra are very similar to planck spectra. they imply surface radiativefluxes more than a factor of three larger than the eddington flux. we find thatsegments of many other bursts from many sources are well-fit by similarbose-einstein spectra, suggesting that the radiative flux at the emittingsurface also exceeds the eddington flux during these segments. we suggest thatburst spectra can closely approximate bose-einstein spectra and have fluxesthat exceed the eddington flux because they are formed by comptonization in anextended, low-density radiating gas supported by the outward radiation forceand confined by a tangled magnetic field.

1005.4928	a deep chandra observation of the x-shaped radio galaxy 4c +00.58: a  candidate for merger-induced reorientation?	although rapid reorientation of a black hole spin axis (lasting less than afew myr) has been suggested as a mechanism for the formation of wings inx-shaped radio galaxies (xrgs), to date no convincing case of reorientation hasbeen found in any xrg. alternative wing formation models such as thehydrodynamic backflow models are supported by observed trends indicating thatxrgs form preferentially with jets aligned along the major axis of thesurrounding medium and wings along the minor axis. in this letter, we present adeep chandra observation of 4c +00.58, an oddball xrg with its jet orientedalong the minor axis. by using the x-ray data in tandem with available radioand optical data, we estimate relevant timescales with which to evaluate wingformation models. the hydrodynamic models have difficulty explaining the longwings, whereas the presence of x-ray cavities (suggesting jet activity along aprior axis) and a potential stellar shell (indicating a recent merger) favor amerger-induced reorientation model.

1009.1882	low-frequency oscillations in global simulations of black hole accretion	we have identified the presence of large-scale, low-frequency dynamo cyclesin a long-duration, global, magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulation of black holeaccretion. such cycles had been seen previously in local shearing boxsimulations, but we discuss their evolution over 1,500 inner disk orbits of aglobal pi/4 disk wedge spanning two orders of magnitude in radius and sevenscale heights in elevation above/below the disk midplane. the observed cyclesmanifest themselves as oscillations in azimuthal magnetic field occupying aregion that extends into a low-density corona several scale heights above thedisk. the cycle frequencies are ten to twenty times lower than the localorbital frequency, making them potentially interesting sources of low-frequencyvariability when scaled to real astrophysical systems. furthermore, powerspectra derived from the full time series reveal that the cycles manifestthemselves at discrete, narrow-band frequencies that often share power acrossbroad radial ranges. we explore possible connections between these simulatedcycles and observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (lfqpos) ingalactic black hole binary systems, finding that dynamo cycles have theappropriate frequencies and are located in a spatial region associated withx-ray emission in real systems. derived observational proxies, however, fail tofeature peaks with rms amplitudes comparable to lfqpo observations, suggestingthat further theoretical work and more sophisticated simulations will berequired to form a complete theory of dynamo-driven lfqpos. nonetheless, thiswork clearly illustrates that global mhd dynamos exhibit quasi-periodicbehavior on timescales much longer than those derived from test particleconsiderations.

1009.6013	extreme mass-ratio inspirals in the effective-one-body approach:  quasi-circular, equatorial orbits around a spinning black hole	we construct effective-one-body waveform models suitable for data analysiswith lisa for extreme-mass ratio inspirals in quasi-circular, equatorial orbitsabout a spinning supermassive black hole. the accuracy of our model isestablished through comparisons against frequency-domain, teukolsky-basedwaveforms in the radiative approximation. the calibration of eight high-orderpost-newtonian parameters in the energy flux suffices to obtain a phase andfractional amplitude agreement of better than 1 radian and 1 % respectivelyover a period between 2 and 6 months depending on the system considered. thisagreement translates into matches higher than 97 % over a period between 4 and9 months, depending on the system. better agreements can be obtained if alarger number of calibration parameters are included. higher-order mass ratioterms in the effective-one-body hamiltonian and radiation-reaction introducephase corrections of at most 30 radians in a one year evolution. thesecorrections are usually one order of magnitude larger than those introduced bythe spin of the small object in a one year evolution. these results suggestthat the effective-one-body approach for extreme mass ratio inspirals is a goodcompromise between accuracy and computational price for lisa data analysispurposes.

1010.1721	the effect of massive perturbers on extreme mass-ratio inspiral  waveforms	extreme mass ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass object merges with asupermassive black hole, are prime sources for space-based gravitational wavedetectors because they will facilitate tests of strong gravity and probe thespacetime around rotating compact objects. in the last few years of suchinspirals, the total phase is in the millions of radians and details of thewaveforms are sensitive to small perturbations. we show that one potentiallydetectable perturbation is the presence of a second supermassive black holewithin a few tenths of a parsec. the acceleration produced by the perturber onthe extreme mass-ratio system produces a steady drift that causes the waveformto deviate systematically from that of an isolated system. if the perturber isa few tenths of a parsec from the extreme-mass ratio system (plausible in asmany as a few percent of cases) higher derivatives of motion might also bedetectable. in that case, the mass and distance of the perturber can be derivedindependently, which would allow a new probe of merger dynamics.

1011.4601	the drop of the coherence of the lower khz qpos is also observed in xte  j1701-462	we investigate the quality factor and rms amplitude of the lower khz qposfrom xte j1701-462, a unique x-ray source which was observed in both theso-called z and atoll states. correcting for the frequency drift of the qpo, weshow that, as in all sources for which such a correction can be applied, thequality factor and rms amplitude drops sharply above above a criticalfrequency. for xte j1701-462 this frequency is estimated to be ~800 hz, wherethe quality factor reaches a maximum of ~200 (e.g. a value consistent with theone observed from more classical systems, such as 4u~1636-536). such a drop hasbeen interpreted as the signature of the innermost stable circular orbit, andthat interpretation is consistent with the observations we report here. the khzqpos in the z state are much less coherent and lower amplitude than they are inthe atoll state. we argue that the change of the qpo properties between the twosource states is related to the change of the scale height of the accretiondisk; a prediction of the toy model proposed by barret et al. (2007). as aby-product of our analysis, we also increased the significance of the upper khzqpo detected in the atoll phase up to 4.8 sigma (single trial significance),and show that the frequency separation (266.5+/-13.1 hz) is comparable with theone measured from simultaneous twin qpos the z phase.

1106.1429	tidal disruptions of separated binaries in galactic nuclei	several galaxies have exhibited x-ray flares that are consistent with thetidal disruption of a star by a central supermassive black hole. in theoreticaltreatments of this process it is usually assumed that the star was initially ona nearly parabolic orbit relative to the black hole. such an assumption leadsin the simplest approximation to a $t^{-5/3}$ decay of the bolometricluminosity and this is indeed consistent with the relatively poorly sampledlight curves of such flares. we point out that there is another regime in whichthe decay would be different: if a binary is tidally separated and the starthat remains close to the hole is eventually tidally disrupted from a moderateeccentricity orbit, the decay is slower, typically $\sim t^{-1.2}$. as aresult, careful sampling of the light curves of such flares could distinguishbetween these processes and yield insight into the dynamics of binaries as wellas single stars in galactic centres. we explore this process using three-bodysimulations and analytic treatments and discuss the consequences forpresent-day x-ray detections and future gravitational wave observations.

1111.0828	gamma-ray pulsar light curves in vacuum and force-free geometry	recent studies have shown that gamma-ray pulsar light curves are verysensitive to the geometry of the pulsar magnetic field. pulsar magnetic fieldgeometries, such as the retarded vacuum dipole and force-free magnetosphereshave distorted polar caps that are offset from the magnetic axis in thedirection opposite to rotation. since this effect is due to the sweepback offield lines near the light cylinder, offset polar caps are a generic propertyof pulsar magnetospheres and their effects should be included in gamma-raypulsar light curve modeling. in slot gap models (having two-pole causticgeometry), the offset polar caps cause a strong azimuthal asymmetry of theparticle acceleration around the magnetic axis. we have studied the effect ofthe offset polar caps in both retarded vacuum dipole and force-free geometry onthe model high-energy pulse profiles. we find that, compared to the profilesderived from symmetric caps, the flux in the pulse peaks, which are causticsformed along the trailing magnetic field lines, increases significantlyrelative to the off-peak emission, formed along leading field lines. theenhanced contrast produces improved slot gap model fits to fermi pulsar lightcurves like vela, with vacuum dipole fits being more favorable.

1206.6167	an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of relaxed stellar systems  without massive black holes	massive black holes have been discovered in all closely examined galaxieswith high velocity dispersion. the case is not as clear for lower-dispersionsystems such as low-mass galaxies and globular clusters. here we suggest thatabove a critical velocity dispersion of roughly 40 km/s, massive central blackholes will form in relaxed stellar systems at any cosmic epoch. this is becauseabove this dispersion primordial binaries cannot support the system againstdeep core collapse. if, as previous simulations show, the black holes formed inthe cluster settle to produce a dense subcluster, then given the extremely highdensities reached during core collapse the holes will merge with each other.for low velocity dispersions and hence low cluster escape speeds, mergers willtypically kick out all or all but one of the holes due to three-body kicks orthe asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. if one hole remains, itwill tidally disrupt stars at a high rate. if none remain, one is formed afterrunaway collisions between stars, then it tidally disrupts stars at a highrate. the accretion rate after disruption is many orders of magnitude aboveeddington. if, as several studies suggest, the hole can accept matter at thatrate because the generated radiation is trapped and advected, then it will growquickly and form a massive central black hole.

1211.6738	sowing the seeds of massive black holes in small galaxies: young  clusters as the building blocks of ultra-compact-dwarf galaxies	interacting galaxies often have complexes of hundreds of young stellarclusters of individual masses $\sim 10^{4-6}~m_\odot$ in regions that are a fewhundred parsecs across. these cluster complexes interact dynamically, and theircoalescence is a candidate for the origin of some ultracompact dwarf galaxies(ucds). individual clusters with short relaxation times are candidates for theproduction of intermediate-mass black holes of a few hundred solar masses, viarunaway stellar collisions prior to the first supernovae in a cluster. it istherefore possible that a cluster complex hosts multiple intermediate-massblack holes that may be ejected from their individual clusters due to mergersor binary processes, but bound to the complex as a whole. here we explore thedynamical interaction between initially free-flying massive black holes andclusters in an evolving cluster complex. we find that, after hitting someclusters, it is plausible that the massive black hole will be captured in anultracompact dwarf forming near the center of the complex. in the process, thehole typically triggers electromagnetic flares via stellar disruptions, and isalso likely to be a prominent source of gravitational radiation for theadvanced ground-based detectors ligo and virgo. we also discuss otherimplications of this scenario, notably that the central black hole could beconsiderably larger than expected in other formation scenarios for ultracompactdwarfs.

1303.0248	testing the rotating hot spot model using x-ray burst oscillations from  4u 1636-536	precise and accurate measurements of neutron star masses and radii wouldprovide valuable information about the still uncertain properties of coldmatter at supranuclear densities. one promising approach to making suchmeasurements involves analysis of the x-ray flux oscillations often seen duringthermonuclear (type 1) x-ray bursts. these oscillations are almost certainlyproduced by emission from hotter regions on the stellar surface modulated bythe rotation of the star. one consequence of the rotation is that theoscillation should appear earlier at higher photon energies than at lowerenergies. ford (1999) found compelling evidence for such a hard lead in thetail oscillations of one type 1 burst from aql x-1. we have therefore analyzedindividually the oscillations observed in the tails of the four type 1 burstsfrom 4u 1636-536 that, when averaged, provided the strongest evidence for asoft lead in the analysis by muno et al. (2003). we have also analyzed theoscillation observed during the superburst from this star. we find that thedata from these five bursts, treated both individually and jointly, are fullyconsistent with a rotating hot spot model. unfortunately, the uncertainties inthese data are too large to provide interesting constraints on the mass andradius of this star.

1304.2330	determining neutron star masses and radii using energy-resolved  waveforms of x-ray burst oscillations	simultaneous, precise measurements of the mass $m$ and radius $r$ of neutronstars can yield uniquely valuable information about the still uncertainproperties of cold matter at several times the density of nuclear matter. onemethod that could be used to measure $m$ and $r$ is to analyze theenergy-dependent waveforms of the x-ray flux oscillations seen during somethermonuclear bursts from some neutron stars. these oscillations are thought tobe produced by x-ray emission from hotter regions on the surface of the starthat are rotating at or near the spin frequency of the star. here we explorehow well $m$ and $r$ could be determined by generating, and analyzing usingbayesian techniques, synthetic energy-resolved x-ray data that we produceassuming a future space mission having 2--30 kev energy coverage and aneffective area of 10 m$^2$, such as the proposed \textit{loft} or\textit{axtar} missions.  we find that if the hot spot is within 10$^\circ$ of the rotation equator,both $m$ and $r$ can usually be determined with an uncertainty of about 10% ifthere are $10^6$ total counts from the spot, whereas waveforms from spotswithin 20$^\circ$ of the rotation pole provide no useful constraints. theseconstraints can usually be achieved even if the burst oscillations vary withtime and data from multiple bursts must be used to obtain 10$^6$ counts fromthe hot spot. this is therefore a promising method to constrain $m$ and $r$tightly enough to discriminate strongly between competing models of cold,high-density matter.

1307.6569	alignment of supermassive black hole binary orbits and spins	recent studies of accretion onto supermassive black hole binaries suggestthat much, perhaps most, of the matter eventually accretes onto one hole or theother. if so, then for binaries whose inspiral from ~1 pc to 0.001 - 0.01 pc isdriven by interaction with external gas, both the binary orbital axis and theindividual black hole spins can be reoriented by angular momentum exchange withthis gas. here we show that, unless the binary mass ratio is far from unity,the spins of the individual holes align with the binary orbital axis in a timefew-100 times shorter than the binary orbital axis aligns with the angularmomentum direction of the incoming circumbinary gas; the spin of the secondaryaligns more rapidly than that of the primary by a factor ~(m_1/m_2)^{1/2}&gt;1.thus the binary acts as a stabilizing agent, so that for gas-driven systems,the black hole spins are highly likely to be aligned (or counteraligned ifretrograde accretion is common) with each other and with the binary orbitalaxis. this alignment can significantly reduce the recoil speed resulting fromsubsequent black hole merger.

1402.4863	a wind accretion model for hlx-1	the brightest ultraluminous x-ray source currently known, hlx-1, has beenobserved to undergo five outburst cycles. the periodicity of these outbursts,and their high inferred maximum accretion rates of $\sim{\rm few}\times 10^{-4}m_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$, naturally suggest roche lobe overflow at the pericenterof an eccentric orbit. it is, however, difficult for the roche lobe overflowmodel to explain the apparent trend of decreasing decay times over thedifferent outbursts while the integrated luminosity also drops. thus if thetrend is real rather than simply being a reflection of the complex physics ofaccretion disks, a different scenario may be necessary. we present aspeculative model in which, within the last decade, a high-mass giant star hadmost of its envelope tidally stripped by the $\sim 10^{4-5} m_\odot$ black holein hlx-1, and the remaining core plus low-mass hydrogen envelope now feeds thehole with a strong wind. this model can explain the short decay time of thedisk, and could explain the fast decrease in decay time if the wind speedincreases with time. a key prediction of this model is that there will beexcess line absorption due to the wind; our analysis does in fact find a fluxdeficit in the $\sim 0.9-1.1$ kev range that is consistent with predictions,albeit at low significance. if this idea is correct, we also expect that withintens of years the bound material from the original disruption will return andwill make hlx-1 a persistently bright source.

1402.7098	observational signatures of binary supermassive black holes	observations indicate that most massive galaxies contain a supermassive blackhole, and theoretical studies suggest that when such galaxies have a majormerger, the central black holes will form a binary and eventually coalesce.here we discuss two spectral signatures of such binaries that may helpdistinguish them from ordinary agn. these signatures are expected when the massratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinarydisk. one such signature is a notch in the thermal continuum that has beenpredicted by other authors; we point out that it should be accompanied by aspectral revival at shorter wavelengths and also discuss its dependence onbinary properties such as mass, mass ratio, and separation. in particular, wenote that the wavelength $\lambda_n$ at which the notch occurs depends on thesethree parameters in such a way as to make the number of systems displayingthese notches $\propto \lambda_n^{16/3}$; longer wavelength searches aretherefore strongly favored. a second signature, first discussed here, is hardx-ray emission with a wien-like spectrum at a characteristic temperature $\sim100$ kev produced by compton cooling of the shock generated when streams fromthe circumbinary disk hit the accretion disks around the individual blackholes. we investigate the observability of both signatures. the hard x-raysignal may be particularly valuable as it can provide an indicator of blackhole merger a few decades in advance of the event.

1403.0677	the formation and gravitational-wave detection of massive stellar  black-hole binaries	if binaries consisting of two 100 msun black holes exist they would serve asextraordinarily powerful gravitational-wave sources, detectable to redshifts ofz=2 with the advanced ligo/virgo ground-based detectors. large uncertaintiesabout the evolution of massive stars preclude definitive rate predictions formergers of these massive black holes. we show that rates as high as hundreds ofdetections per year, or as low as no detections whatsoever, are both possible.it was thought that the only way to produce these massive binaries was viadynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. this view has been challengedby the recent discovery of several stars with mass above 150 msun in the r136region of the large magellanic cloud. current models predict that when stars ofthis mass leave the main sequence, their expansion is insufficient to allowcommon envelope evolution to efficiently reduce the orbital separation. theresulting black-hole--black-hole binary remains too wide to be able to coalescewithin a hubble time. if this assessment is correct, isolated very massivebinaries do not evolve to be gravitational-wave sources. however, otherformation channels exist. for example, the high multiplicity of massive stars,and their common formation in relatively dense stellar associations, opens updynamical channels for massive black hole mergers (e.g., via kozai cycles orrepeated binary-single interactions). we identify key physical factors thatshape the population of very massive black-hole--black-hole binaries. advancedgravitational-wave detectors will provide important constraints on theformation and evolution of very massive stars.

1407.2579	determining neutron star properties by fitting oblate-star waveforms to  x-ray burst oscillations	we describe sophisticated new bayesian analysis methods that make it possibleto estimate quickly the masses and radii of rapidly rotating, oblate neutronstars by fitting oblate-star waveform models to energy-resolved observations ofthe x-ray oscillations produced by a hot spot on such stars. we conclude thatmodels that take the oblate shape of the star into account should be used forstars with large radii and rotation rates $&gt;300$ hz. we find that a 25%variation of the temperature of the hot spot with latitude does notsignificantly bias estimates of the mass $m$ and equatorial radius $r_{\rm eq}$derived by fitting a model that assumes a uniform-temperature spot. our resultsshow that fits of oblate-star waveform models to waveform data cansimultaneously determine $m$ and $r_{\rm eq}$ with uncertainties $\lesssim\,$7%if (1) the star's rotation rate is $\gtrsim\,$$600$ hz; (2) the spot center andobserver's sightline are both within $30^\circ$ of the star's rotationalequator; (3) the oscillations have a fractional rms amplitude $\gtrsim\,$10%;and (4) $\gtrsim$$10^7$ counts are collected from the star. this is a realisticfractional amplitude, and this many counts could be obtained from a single starby the accepted nicer and proposed loft and axtar space missions by combiningdata from many x-ray bursts. these uncertainties are small enough to improvesubstantially our understanding of cold, ultradense matter.

1408.4145	the masses and spins of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes	stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars represent extremes in gravity,density, and magnetic fields. they therefore serve as key objects in the studyof multiple frontiers of physics. in addition, their origin (mainly incore-collapse supernovae) and evolution (via accretion or, for neutron stars,magnetic spindown and reconfiguration) touch upon multiple open issues inastrophysics.  in this review, we discuss current mass and spin measurements and theirreliability for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, as well as theoverall importance of spins and masses for compact object astrophysics. currentmasses are obtained primarily through electromagnetic observations of binaries,although future microlensing observations promise to enhance our understandingsubstantially. the spins of neutron stars are straightforward to measure forpulsars, but the birth spins of neutron stars are more difficult to determine.in contrast, even the current spins of stellar-mass black holes are challengingto measure. as we discuss, major inroads have been made in black hole spinestimates via analysis of iron lines and continuum emission, with reasonableagreement when both types of estimate are possible for individual objects, andfuture x-ray polarization measurements may provide additional independentinformation. we conclude by exploring the exciting prospects for mass and spinmeasurements from future gravitational wave detections, which are expected torevolutionize our understanding of strong gravity and compact objects.

0804.2783	mergers of stellar-mass black holes in nuclear star clusters	mergers between stellar-mass black holes will be key sources of gravitationalradiation for ground-based detectors. however, the rates of these events arehighly uncertain, given that such systems are invisible. one formation scenarioinvolves mergers in field binaries, where our lack of complete understanding ofcommon envelopes and the distribution of supernova kicks has led to rateestimates that range over a factor of several hundred. a different, and highlypromising, channel involves multiple encounters of binaries in globularclusters or young star clusters. however, we currently lack solid evidence forblack holes in almost all such clusters, and their low escape speeds raise thepossibility that most are ejected because of supernova recoil. here we proposethat a robust environment for mergers could be the nuclear star clusters foundin the centers of small galaxies. these clusters have millions of stars, blackhole relaxation times well under a hubble time, and escape speeds that areseveral times those of globulars, hence they retain most of their black holes.we present simulations of the three-body dynamics of black holes in thisenvironment and estimate that, if most nuclear star clusters do not havesupermassive black holes that interfere with the mergers, at least several tensof events per year will be detectable with advanced ligo.

1502.03284	disk winds as an explanation for slowly evolving temperatures in tidal  disruption events	among the many intriguing aspects of optically discovered tidal disruptionevents (tdes) is that their temperatures are lower than expected and that thetemperature does not evolve as rapidly with decreasing fallback rate as wouldbe expected in standard disk theory. we show that this can be explainedqualitatively using an idea proposed by laor &amp; davis in the context of normalactive galactic nuclei: that larger accretion rates imply stronger winds andthus that the accretion rate through the inner disk only depends weakly on theinflow rate at the outer edge of the disk. we also show that reasonablequantitative agreement with data requires that, as has been suggested in recentpapers, the circularization radius of the tidal stream is approximately equalto the semimajor axis of the most bound orbit of the debris rather than twicethe pericenter distance as would be expected without rapid angular momentumredistribution. if this explanation is correct, it suggests that the evolutionof tdes may test both non-standard disk theory and the details of theinteractions of the tidal stream.

1505.00231	an upper bound on neutron star masses from models of short gamma-ray  bursts	the discovery of two neutron stars with gravitational masses $\approx2~m_\odot$ has placed a strong lower limit on the maximum mass of nonrotatingneutron stars, and with it a strong constraint on the properties of cold matterbeyond nuclear density. current upper mass limits are much looser. here we notethat, if most short gamma-ray bursts are produced by the coalescence of twoneutron stars, and if the merger remnant collapses quickly, then the upper masslimit is constrained tightly. if the rotation of the merger remnant is limitedonly by mass-shedding (which seems probable based on numerical studies), thenthe maximum gravitational mass of a nonrotating neutron star is $\approx2-2.2~m_\odot$ if the masses of neutron stars that coalesce to producegamma-ray bursts are in the range seen in galactic double neutron star systems.these limits would be increased by $\sim 4$% in the probably unrealistic casethat the remnants rotate at $\sim 30$% below mass-shedding, and by $\sim 15$%in the extreme case that the remnants do not rotate at all. future coincidentdetection of short gamma-ray bursts with gravitational waves will strengthenthese arguments because they will produce tight bounds on the masses of thecomponents for individual events. if these limits are accurate then areasonable fraction of double neutron star mergers might not produce gamma-raybursts. in that case, or in the case that many short bursts are producedinstead by the mergers of neutron stars with black holes, the implied rate ofgravitational wave detections will be increased.

0805.2950	on the time variability of geometrically-thin black hole accretion disks  i : the search for modes in simulated disks	we present a detailed temporal analysis of a set of hydrodynamic andmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) simulations of geometrically-thin (h/r~0.05) blackhole accretion disks. the black hole potential is approximated by thepaczynski-wiita pseudo-newtonian potential. in particular, we use oursimulations to critically assess two widely discussed models for high-frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations, global oscillation modes (diskoseismology) andparametric resonance instabilities. we find that initially disturbedhydrodynamic disks clearly display the trapped global g-mode oscillationpredicted by linear perturbation theory. in contrast, the sustained turbulenceproduced in the simulated mhd disks by the magneto-rotational instability doesnot excite these trapped g-modes. we cannot say at present whether the mhdturbulence actively damps the hydrodynamic g-mode. our simulated mhd disks alsofail to display any indications of a parametric resonance instability betweenthe vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies. on the other hand, we do seecharacteristic frequencies at any given radius in the disk corresponding tolocal acoustic waves. we also conduct a blind search for any quasi-periodicoscillation in a proxy lightcurve based on the instantaneous mass accretionrate of the black hole, and place an upper limit of 2% on the total power inany such feature. we highlight the importance of correcting for secular changesin the simulated accretion disk when performing temporal analyses.

1507.04333	soft x-ray temperature tidal disruption events from stars on deep  plunging orbits	one of the puzzles associated with tidal disruption event candidates (tdes)is that there is a dichotomy between the color temperatures of ${\rm few}\times10^4$~k for tdes discovered with optical and uv telescopes, and the colortemperatures of ${\rm few}\times 10^5 - 10^6$~k for tdes discovered with x-raysatellites. here we propose that high-temperature tdes are produced when thetidal debris of a disrupted star self-intersects relatively close to thesupermassive black hole, in contrast to the more distant self-intersection thatleads to lower color temperatures. in particular, we note from simple ballisticconsiderations that greater apsidal precession in an orbit is the key to closerself-intersection. thus larger values of $\beta$, the ratio of the tidal radiusto the pericenter distance of the initial orbit, are more likely to lead tohigher temperatures of more compact disks which are super-eddington andgeometrically and optically thick. for a given star and $\beta$, apsidalprecession also increases for larger black hole masses, but larger black holemasses imply a lower temperature at the eddington luminosity. thus the expecteddependence of the temperature on the mass of the black hole is non-monotonic.we find that in order to produce a soft x-ray temperature tde, a deep plungingstellar orbit with $\beta&gt; 3$ is needed and a black hole mass of $\lesssim5\times 10^6 m_\odot$ is favored. although observations of tdes arecomparatively scarce and are likely dominated by selection effects, it isencouraging that both expectations are consistent with current data.

1510.06348	flows of x-ray gas reveal the disruption of a star by a massive black  hole	tidal forces close to massive black holes can violently disrupt stars thatmake a close approach. these extreme events are discovered via bright x-ray andoptical/uv flares in galactic centers. prior studies based on modeling decayingflux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the massaccretion rate. here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized x-raygas in high-resolution x-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event.variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas isrelatively close to the black hole. narrow line widths indicate that the gasdoes not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume fillingfactor. modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second areobserved, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set byvariability. the gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,super-eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament ofdisrupted stellar gas near to the apocenter of an elliptical orbit. flows ofthis sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory and more recentnumerical simulations.

0806.4187	intermediate mass black hole induced quenching of mass segregation in  star clusters	in many theoretical scenarios it is expected that intermediate-mass blackholes (imbhs, with masses m ~ 100-10000 solar masses) reside at the centers ofsome globular clusters. however, observational evidence for their existence islimited. several previous numerical investigations have focused on the impactof an imbh on the cluster dynamics or brightness profile. here we insteadpresent results from a large set of direct n-body simulations including singleand binary stars. these show that there is a potentially more detectable imbhsignature, namely on the variation of the average stellar mass between thecenter and the half-light radius. we find that the existence of an imbhquenches mass segregation and causes the average mass to exhibit only modestradial variation in collisionally relaxed star clusters. this differs from whenthere is no imbh. to measure this observationally requires high resolutionimaging at the level of that already available from the hubble space telescope(hst) for the cores of a large sample of galactic globular clusters. with amodest additional investment of hst time to acquire fields around thehalf-light radius, it will be possible to identify the best candidate clustersto harbor an imbh. this test can be applied only to globulars with a half-lightrelaxation time less than or equal to 1 gyr, which is required to guaranteeefficient energy equipartition due to two-body relaxation.

astro-ph;0001544	oscillation waveforms and amplitudes from hot spots on neutron stars	the discovery of high-amplitude brightness oscillations during type i x-raybursts from six low-mass x-ray binaries has provided a powerful new tool tostudy the properties of matter at supranuclear densities, the effects of stronggravity, and the propagation of thermonuclear burning. there is substantialevidence that these brightness oscillations are produced by spin modulation ofone or two localized hot spots confined to the stellar surface. it is thereforeimportant to calculate the expected light curves produced by such hot spotsunder various physical assumptions, so that comparison with the observed lightcurves may most sensitively yield information about the underlying physicalquantities. in this paper we make general relativistic calculations of thelight curves and oscillation amplitudes produced by a rotating neutron starwith one or two hot spots as a function of spot size, stellar compactness,rotational velocity at the stellar surface, spot location, orientation of theline of sight of the observer, and the angular dependence of the surfacespecific intensity. we find that stellar rotation and beaming of the emissiontend to increase the observed oscillation amplitudes whereas greatercompactness and larger spot size tend to decrease them. by applying theseresults to 4u 1636--536, we show that this source must have two emitting spotsand place strong constraints on the neutron star's magnetic field geometry. wealso show that the data on the phase lags between photons of different energiesin the persistent pulsations in sax j1808--58 can be fit well with a model inwhich the observed hard leads are due to doppler beaming.

astro-ph;0003176	reionization constraints on the contribution of primordial compact  objects to dark matter	many lines of evidence suggest that nonbaryonic dark matter constitutesroughly 30% of the critical closure density, but the composition of this darkmatter is unknown. one class of candidates for the dark matter is compactobjects formed in the early universe, with typical masses m between 0.1 and 1solar masses to correspond to the mass scale of objects found with microlensingobserving projects. specific candidates of this type include black holes formedat the epoch of the qcd phase transition, quark stars, and boson stars. here weshow that accretion onto these objects produces substantial ionization in theearly universe, with an optical depth to thomson scattering out to z=1100 ofapproximately tau=2-4 [f_co\epsilon_{-1}(m/msun)]^{1/2} (h_0/65)^{-1}, where\epsilon_{-1} is the accretion efficiency \epsilon\equiv l/{\dot m}c^2 dividedby 0.1 and f_co is the fraction of matter in the compact objects. the currentupper limit to the scattering optical depth, based on the anisotropy of themicrowave background, is approximately 0.4. therefore, if accretion onto theseobjects is relatively efficient, they cannot be the main component ofnonbaryonic dark matter.

astro-ph;0007234	attenuation of beaming oscillations near neutron stars	observations with rxte have revealed kilohertz quasi-periodic brightnessoscillations (qpos) from nearly twenty different neutron-star low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs). these frequencies often appear as a pair of kilohertz qpos ina given power density spectrum. in many models the higher-frequency of theseqpos is a beaming oscillation at the frequency of a nearly circular orbit atsome radius near the neutron star. in such models it is expected that therewill also be beaming oscillations at the stellar spin frequency and atovertones of the orbital frequency, but no strong qpos have been detected atthese frequencies. we therefore examine the processes that can attenuatebeaming oscillations near neutron stars, and in doing so extend the work onthis subject that was initiated by the discovery of lower-frequency qpos fromlmxbs. among our main results are (1)in a spherical scattering cloud, allovertones of rotationally modulated beaming oscillations are attenuatedstrongly, not just the even harmonics, and (2)it is possible to have arelatively high-amplitude modulation near the star at, e.g., the stellar spinfrequency, even if no peak at that frequency is detectable in a power densityspectrum taken at infinity. we discuss the application of these results tomodeling of kilohertz qpos.

astro-ph;0202298	four-body effects in globular cluster black hole coalescence	in the high density cores of globular clusters, multibody interactions areexpected to be common, with the result that black holes in binaries arehardened by interactions. it was shown by sigurdsson &amp; hernquist (1993) andothers that 10 solar mass black holes interacting exclusively by three-bodyencounters do not merge in the clusters themselves, because recoil kicks thebinaries out of the clusters before the binaries are tight enough to merge.here we consider a new mechanism, involving four-body encounters. numericalsimulations by a number of authors suggest that roughly 20-50% of binary-binaryencounters will eject one star but leave behind a stable hierarchical triple.if the orbital plane of the inner binary is strongly tilted with respect to theorbital plane of the outer object, a secular kozai resonance, firstinvestigated in the context of asteroids in the solar system, can increase theeccentricity of the inner body significantly. we show that in a substantialfraction of cases the eccentricity is driven to a high enough value that theinner binary will merge by gravitational radiation, without a strongaccompanying kick. thus the merged object remains in the cluster; depending onthe binary fraction of black holes and the inclination distribution ofnewly-formed hierarchical triples, this mechanism may allow massive black holesto accumulate through successive mergers in the cores of globular clusters. itmay also increase the likelihood that stellar-mass black holes in globularclusters will be detectable by their gravitational radiation.

0808.4159	a model for the waveform behavior of accreting millisecond pulsars:  nearly aligned magnetic fields and moving emission regions	we investigate further a model of the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars weproposed earlier. in this model, the x-ray-emitting regions of these pulsarsare near their spin axes but move. this is to be expected if the magnetic polesof these stars are close to their spin axes, so that accreting gas is channeledthere. as the accretion rate and the structure of the inner disk vary, gas ischanneled along different field lines to different locations on the stellarsurface, causing the x-ray-emitting areas to move. we show that this "nearlyaligned moving spot model" can explain many properties of the accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars, including their generally low oscillation amplitudesand nearly sinusoidal waveforms; the variability of their pulse amplitudes,shapes, and phases; the correlations in this variability; and the similarity ofthe accretion- and nuclear-powered pulse shapes and phases in some. it may alsoexplain why accretion-powered millisecond pulsars are difficult to detect, whysome are intermittent, and why all detected so far are transients. this modelcan be tested by comparing with observations the waveform changes it predicts,including the changes with accretion rate.

astro-ph;0412107	the shapes of atomic lines from the surfaces of weakly magnetic rotating  neutron stars and their implications	motivated by the report by cottam et al. (2002) of iron resonance scatteringlines in the spectra of thermonuclear bursts from exo 0748-676, we haveinvestigated the information about neutron star structure and the geometry ofthe emission region that can be obtained by analyzing the profiles of atomiclines formed at the surface of the star. we have calculated the detailedprofiles of such lines, taking into account the star's spin and the fulleffects of special and general relativity, including light-bending andframe-dragging. we discuss the line shapes produced by rotational dopplerbroadening and magnetic splitting of atomic lines, for the spin rates andmagnetic fields expected in neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binary systems. weshow that narrow lines are possible even for rapidly spinning stars, if theemission region or the line of sight are close to the spin axis. for mostneutron stars in low-mass systems, magnetic splitting is too small to obscurethe effects of special and general relativity. we show that the ratio of thestar's mass to its equatorial radius can be determined to within 5% usingatomic line profiles, even if the lines are broad and skewed. this is theprecision required to constrain strongly the equation of state of neutron starmatter. we show further that if the radius and latitude of emission are knownto ~ 5-10% accuracy, then frame-dragging has a potentially detectable effect onthe profiles of atomic lines formed at the stellar surface.

astro-ph;0505094	prompt mergers of neutron stars with black holes	mergers of neutron stars with black holes have been suggested as candidatesfor short gamma-ray bursts. they have also been studied for their potential asgravitational wave sources observable with ground-based detectors. for thesepurposes, it is important to know under what circumstances such a merger couldleave an accretion disk or result in a period of stable mass transfer. we showthat, consistent with recent numerical simulations, it is expected that mergersbetween neutron stars and black holes will be prompt, with no accretion diskand no stable mass transfer, if the black hole has a mass greater than that ofthe neutron star and is spinning slowly. the reason is that for comparablemasses, angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation starts a plunge orbitwell outside the innermost stable circular orbit, causing direct merging ratherthan extended mass transfer. even when the black hole is spinning rapidly andexactly prograde with respect to the orbit, we show that it is possible withincurrent understanding that no accretion disk will form under any circumstances,but resolution of this will require full general relativistic numericalsimulations with no approximations.

astro-ph;0507133	binary encounters with supermassive black holes: zero-eccentricity lisa  events	current simulations of the rate at which stellar-mass compact objects mergewith supermassive black holes (called extreme mass ratio inspirals, or emris)focus on two-body capture by emission of gravitational radiation. thegravitational wave signal of such events will likely involve a significanteccentricity in the sensitivity range of the laser interferometer space antenna(lisa). we show that tidal separation of stellar-mass compact object binariesby supermassive black holes will instead produce events whose eccentricity isnearly zero in the lisa band. compared to two-body capture events, tidalseparations have a high cross section and result in orbits that have a largepericenter and small apocenter. therefore, the rate of interactions per binaryis high and the resulting systems are very unlikely to be perturbed by otherstars into nearly radial plunges. depending on the fraction of compact objectsthat are in binaries within a few parsecs of the center, the rate oflow-eccentricity lisa events could be comparable to or larger than the rate ofhigh-eccentricity events.

astro-ph;0510094	drop of coherence of the lower kilo-hz qpo in neutron stars: is there a  link with the innermost stable circular orbit?	using all available archival data from the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte), we follow the frequency of the kilo-hz qpos in three low luminosityneutron star low mass x-ray binaries; namely 4u 1636-536, 4u 1608-522, and4u1735-44. following earlier work, we focus our analysis on the lower kilo-hzqpo, for which we study the dependency of its quality factor (q) amplitude as afunction of frequency over a range covering from 500 hz to 1000 hz. aspreviously found for 4u 1636-536, we show that the quality factor of the lowerkilo-hz increases with frequency up to a maximum frequency around 800 hz,beyond which an abrupt drop of its coherence is observed down to a limitingfrequency where the qpo disappears completely. simultaneously the amplitude ofthe qpos is almost constant below the peak frequency and starts to decreasesmoothly afterwards. the peak frequency is 850 hz, 820 hz, 740 hz whereas thelimiting frequency is 920 hz, 900 hz and 830 hz for 4u 1636-536, 4u 1608-522and 4u 1735-44 respectively. a ceiling of the lower qpo frequencies is alsoseen clearly in a frequency versus count rate diagram for all sources. thisbehavior is reproducible within an object and between objects. we suggest herethat the drop of coherence of the lower qpo may be a geometry-related effect,which could be related to the last stable circular orbit.

astro-ph;0512194	constraints on alternatives to supermassive black holes	observations of the centers of galaxies continue to evolve, and it is usefulto take a fresh look at the constraints that exist on alternatives tosupermassive black holes at their centers. we discuss constraints complementaryto those of maoz (1998) and demonstrate that an extremely wide range of otherpossibilities can be excluded. in particular, we present the new argument thatfor the velocity dispersions inferred for many galactic nuclei, even binariesmade of point masses cannot stave off core collapse because hard binaries areso tight that they merge via emission of gravitational radiation before theycan engage in three-body or four-body interactions. we also show that underthese conditions core collapse leads inevitably to runaway growth of a centralblack hole with a significant fraction of the initial mass, regardless of themasses of the individual stars. for clusters of noninteracting low-mass objects(from low-mass stars to elementary particles), relaxation of stars and compactobjects that pass inside the dark region will be accelerated by interactionswith the dark mass. if the dark region is instead a self-supported object suchas a fermion ball, then if stellar-mass black holes exist they will collidewith the object, settle, and consume it. the net result is that the keyholethrough which alternatives to supermassive black holes must pass issubstantially smaller and more contrived than it was even a few years ago.

astro-ph;0603204	getting a kick out of numerical relativity	recent developments in numerical relativity have made it possible to followreliably the coalescence of two black holes from near the innermost stablecircular orbit to final ringdown. this opens up a wide variety of excitingastrophysical applications of these simulations. chief among these is the netkick received when two unequal mass or spinning black holes merge. themagnitude of this kick has bearing on the production and growth of supermassiveblack holes during the epoch of structure formation, and on the retention ofblack holes in stellar clusters. here we report the first accurate numericalcalculation of this kick, for two nonspinning black holes in a 1.5:1 massratio, which is expected based on analytic considerations to give a significantfraction of the maximum possible recoil. we have performed multiple runs withdifferent initial separations, orbital angular momenta, resolutions, extractionradii, and gauges. the full range of our kick speeds is 86--116 km s$^{-1}$,and the most reliable runs give kicks between 86 and 97 km s$^{-1}$. this isintermediate between the estimates from two recent post-newtonian analyses andsuggests that at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, halos with masses $\lesssim 10^9m_\odot$ will have difficulty retaining coalesced black holes after majormergers.

astro-ph;0605486	the coherence of khz quasi-periodic oscillations in the x-rays from  accreting neutron stars	we study in a systematic way the quality factor of the lower and upper khzqpos in a sample of low luminosity neutron star x-ray binaries, showing bothqpos varying over a wide frequency range. the sample includes 4u 1636-536, 4u1608-522, 4u 1735-44, 4u 1728-34, 4u 1820-303 and 4u 0614+09. we find that allsources except 4u 0614+091 show evidence of a drop in the quality factor oftheir lower khz qpos at high frequency. for 4u 0614+091 only the rising part ofthe quality factor versus frequency curve has been sampled so far. at the sametime, in all sources but 4u 1728-34, the quality factor of the upper kilo-hzqpo increases all the way to the highest detectable frequencies. we show thatthe high-frequency behaviours of both the lower and upper khz qpo qualityfactors are consistent with what is expected if the drop is produced by theapproach of an active oscillating region to the innermost stable circularorbit: the existence of which is a key feature of general relativity in thestrong field regime. within this interpretation, our results implygravitational masses around 2 solar masses for the neutron stars in thosesystems.

astro-ph;0701312	supporting evidence for the signature of the innermost stable circular  orbit in rossi x-ray data from 4u1636-536	analysis of archival rxte data on neutron stars binaries has shown that forseveral sources the quality factor (q) of the lower kilohertz quasi-periodicoscillations (qpo) drops sharply beyond a certain frequency. this is onepossible signature of the approach to the general relativistic innermost stablecircular orbit (isco), but the implications of such an interpretation forstrong gravity and dense matter are important enough that it is essential toexplore alternate explanations. in this spirit, mendez has recently proposedthat q depends fundamentally on mass accretion rate (as measured by spectralhardness) rather than the frequency of the qpo. we test this hypothesis for4u1636-536 by measuring precisely spectral colors simultaneously with the lowerqpo frequency and q after correction for the frequency drift, over a data setspanning eight years of rxte observations. we find that in this source there isno correlation between q and spectral hardness. in particular, no apparentchanges in hardness are observed when q reaches its maximum before droppingoff. we perform a similar analysis on 4u1608-522; another source showing asharp drop in the quality factor of its lower khz qpo. we find that for thissource, positive and negative correlations are observed between spectralhardness, frequency and q. consequently, if we are to search for a commonexplanation for the sharp drop in the quality factor seen in both sources, thespectral hardness is not a good candidate for the independent variable whereasthe frequency remains. therefore, we conclude that the isco explanation isviable for 4u1636-536, and thus possibly for others.

astro-ph;0702390	modeling kicks from the merger of non-precessing black-hole binaries	several groups have recently computed the gravitational radiation recoilproduced by the merger of two spinning black holes. the results suggest thatspin can be the dominant contributor to the kick, with reported recoil speedsof hundreds to even thousands of kilometers per second. the parameter space ofspin kicks is large, however, and it is ultimately desirable to have a simpleformula that gives the approximate magnitude of the kick given a mass ratio,spin magnitudes, and spin orientations. as a step toward this goal, we performa systematic study of the recoil speeds from mergers of black holes with massratio $q\equiv m_1/m_2=2/3$ and dimensionless spin parameters of $a_1/m_1$ and$a_2/m_2$ equal to 0 or 0.2, with directions aligned or anti-aligned with theorbital angular momentum. we also run an equal-mass $a_1/m_1=-a_2/m_2=0.2$case, and find good agreement with previous results. we find that, forcurrently reported kicks from aligned or anti-aligned spins, a simple kickformula inspired by post-newtonian analyses can reproduce the numerical resultsto better than $\sim$10%.

astro-ph;9609157	sonic-point model of kilohertz quasi-periodic brightness oscillations in  low-mass x-ray binaries	strong, coherent, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations (qpos) withfrequencies ranging from about 300 hz to 1200 hz have been discovered with therossi x-ray timing explorer in the x-ray emission from some fifteen neutronstars in low-mass binary systems. two simultaneous kilohertz qpos differing infrequency by 250 to 350 hertz have been detected in twelve of the fifteensources. here we propose a model for these qpos. in this model the x-ray sourceis a neutron star with a surface magnetic field of 10^7 to 10^10 g and a spinfrequency of a few hundred hertz, accreting gas via a keplerian disk. thefrequency of the higher-frequency qpo in a kilohertz qpo pair is the keplerianfrequency at a radius near the sonic point at the inner edge of the keplerianflow whereas the frequency of the lower-frequency qpo is approximately thedifference between the keplerian frequency at a radius near the sonic point andthe stellar spin frequency. this model explains naturally many properties ofthe kilohertz qpos, including their frequencies, amplitudes, and coherence. weshow that if the frequency of the higher-frequency qpo in a pair is an orbitalfrequency, as in the sonic-point model, the frequencies of these qpos placeinteresting upper bounds on the masses and radii of the neutron stars in thekilohertz qpo sources and provide new constraints on the equation of state ofmatter at high densities. further observations of these qpos may providecompelling evidence for the existence of a marginally stable orbit, confirminga key prediction of general relativity in the strong-field regime.

astro-ph;9711325	bounds on the compactness of neutron stars from brightness oscillations	the discovery of high-amplitude brightness oscillations at the spin frequencyor its first overtone in six neutron stars in low-mass x-ray binaries duringtype~1 x-ray bursts provides a powerful new way to constrain the compactness ofthese stars, and hence to constrain the equation of state of the dense matterin all neutron stars. here we present the results of general relativisticcalculations of the maximum fractional rms amplitudes that can be observedduring bursts. in particular, we determine the dependence of the amplitude onthe compactness of the star, the angular dependence of the emission from thesurface, the rotational velocity at the stellar surface, and whether there areone or two emitting poles. we show that if two poles are emitting, as isstrongly indicated by independent evidence in 4u 1636-536 and ks 1731-26, theresulting limits on the compactness of the star can be extremely restrictive.we also discuss the expected amplitudes of x-ray color oscillations and theobservational signatures necessary to derive convincing constraints on neutronstar compactness from the amplitudes of burst oscillations.

astro-ph;9801295	effects of radiation forces on the frequency of gravitomagnetic  precession near neutron stars	gravitomagnetic precession near neutron stars and black holes has receivedmuch recent attention, particularly as a possible explanation of 15--60 hzquasi-periodic brightness oscillations (qpos) from accreting neutron stars inlow-mass x-ray binaries, and of somewhat higher-frequency qpos from accretingstellar-mass black holes. previous analyses of this phenomenon have eitherignored radiation forces or assumed for simplicity that the radiation field isisotropic, and in particular that there is no variation of the radiation fieldwith angular distance from the rotational equatorial plane of the compactobject. however, in most realistic accretion geometries (e.g., those in whichthe accretion proceeds via a geometrically thin disk) the radiation fielddepends on latitude. here we show that in this case radiation forces typicallyhave an important, even dominant, effect on the precession frequency of testparticles in orbits that are tilted with respect to the star's rotationalequator. indeed, we find that even for accretion luminosities only a fewpercent of the eddington critical luminosity, the precession frequency near aneutron star can be changed by factors of up to $\sim 10$. radiation forcesmust therefore be included in analyses of precession frequencies near compactobjects, in such varied contexts as low-frequency qpos, warp modes of disks,and trapped oscillation modes. we discuss specifically the impact of radiationforces on models of low-frequency qpos involving gravitomagnetic precession,and show that such models are rendered much less plausible by the effects ofradiation forces.

astro-ph;9809235	evidence for antipodal hot spots during x-ray bursts from 4u 1636-536	the discovery of high-frequency brightness oscillations in thermonuclearx-ray bursts from several neutron-star low-mass x-ray binaries has importantimplications for the beat frequency model of kilohertz quasi-periodicbrightness oscillations, the propagation of nuclear burning, the structure ofthe subsurface magnetic fields in neutron stars, and the equation of state ofhigh-density matter. these implications depend crucially on whether theobserved frequency is the stellar spin frequency or its first overtone. here wereport an analysis of five bursts from 4u 1636-536 which exhibit strongoscillations at approximately 580 hz. we show that combining the data from thefirst 0.75 seconds of each of the five bursts yields a signal at 290 hz that issignificant at the $4\times 10^{-5}$ level when the number of trials is takeninto account. this strongly indicates that 290 hz is the spin frequency of thisneutron star and that 580 hz is its first overtone, in agreement with otherarguments about this source but in contrast to suggestions in the literaturethat 580 hz is the true spin frequency. the method used here, which is analgorithm for combining time series data from the five bursts so that thephases of the 580 hz oscillations are aligned, may be used in any source tosearch for weak oscillations that have frequencies related in a definite way tothe frequency of a strong oscillation.

astro-ph;9903105	on the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring interpretations  of the horizontal branch oscillation in the z sources	we study the horizontal branch oscillations (hbo) and the two simultaneouskilohertz qpos comparing their properties in five z sources with thepredictions of the magnetospheric beat-frequency and lense-thirring precessionmodels. we find that the variation of the hbo frequency with accretion ratepredicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolarstellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion diskagrees well with the observed variation. this model implies that the neutronstars in the z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magneticfield strengths are ~10^9-10^10 g, and that the critical fastness parameter forthese sources is &gt;0.8. if the frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo is anorbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequencymodel requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couplestrongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead driftsslowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers ofthe neutron star surface. the lense-thirring precession model is consistentwith the observed magnitudes of the hbo frequencies only if the moments ofinertia of the neutron stars in the z sources are 4-5 times larger than thelargest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. thetrend of the correlation between the hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies is notconsistent with this model. we argue that the change in the slope of thecorrelation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and thefrequency of the upper kilohertz qpo, when the latter is greater than 850 hz,is directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz qpos.

astro-ph;9904093	a characterization of the brightness oscillations during thermonuclear  bursts from 4u 1636-536	the discovery of nearly coherent brightness oscillations during thermonuclearx-ray bursts from six neutron-star low-mass x-ray binaries has opened up a newway to study the propagation of thermonuclear burning, and may ultimately leadto greater understanding of thermonuclear propagation in other astrophysicalcontexts, such as in type ia supernovae. here we report detailed analyses ofthe ~580 hz brightness oscillations during bursts from 4u 1636-536. weinvestigate the bursts as a whole and, in more detail, the initial portions ofthe bursts. we analyze the ~580 hz oscillations in the initial 0.75 seconds ofthe five bursts that were used in a previous search for a brightnessoscillation at the expected ~290 hz spin frequency, and find that if the samefrequency model describes all five bursts there is insufficient data to requiremore than a constant frequency or, possibly, a frequency plus a frequencyderivative. therefore, although it is appropriate to use an arbitrarilycomplicated model of the ~580 hz oscillations to generate a candidate waveformfor the ~290 hz oscillations, models with more than two parameters are notrequired by the data. for the bursts as a whole we show that thecharacteristics of the brightness oscillations vary greatly from burst toburst. we find, however, that in at least one of the bursts, and possibly inthree of the four that have strong brightness oscillations throughout theburst, the oscillation frequency reaches a maximum several seconds into theburst and then decreases. this behavior has not been reported previously forburst brightness oscillations, and it poses a challenge to the standard burninglayer expansion explanation for the frequency changes.

0809.4016	origin of intermittent accretion-powered x-ray oscillations in neutron  stars with millisecond spin periods	we have shown previously that many of the properties of persistentaccretion-powered millisecond pulsars can be understood if their x-ray emittingareas are near their spin axes and move as the accretion rate and structure ofthe inner disk vary. here we show that this "nearly aligned moving spot model"may also explain the intermittent accretion-powered pulsations that have beendetected in three weakly magnetic accreting neutron stars. we show thatmovement of the emitting area from very close to the spin axis to about 10degrees away can increase the fractional rms amplitude from less than about 0.5percent, which is usually undetectable with current instruments, to a fewpercent, which is easily detectable. the second harmonic of the spin frequencyusually would not be detected, in agreement with observations. the modelproduces intermittently detectable oscillations for a range of emitting areasizes and beaming patterns, stellar masses and radii, and viewing directions.intermittent oscillations are more likely in stars that are more compact. inaddition to explaining the sudden appearance of accretion-powered millisecondoscillations in some neutron stars with millisecond spin periods, the modelexplains why accretion-powered millisecond oscillations are relatively rare andpredicts that the persistent accretion-powered millisecond oscillations ofother stars may become undetectable for brief intervals. it suggests whymillisecond oscillations are frequently detected during the x-ray bursts ofsome neutron stars but not others and suggests mechanisms that could explainthe occasional temporal association of intermittent accretion-poweredoscillations with thermonuclear x-ray bursts.

0812.0365	on the time variability of geometrically-thin black hole accretion disks  ii: viscosity-induced global oscillation modes in simulated disks	we examine the evolution and influence of viscosity-induced diskoseismicmodes in simulated black hole accretion disks. understanding the origin andbehavior of such oscillations will help us to evaluate their potential role inproducing astronomically observed high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations inaccreting black hole binary systems.  our simulated disks are geometrically-thin with a constant half-thickness offive percent the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. apseudo-newtonian potential reproduces the relevant effects of generalrelativity, and an alpha-model viscosity achieves angular momentum transportand the coupling of orthogonal velocity components in an otherwise idealhydrodynamic numerical treatment.  we find that our simulated viscous disks characteristically develop andmaintain trapped global mode oscillations with properties similar to thoseexpected of trapped g-modes and inner p-modes in a narrow range of frequenciesjust below the maximum radial epicyclic frequency. although the modes aredriven in the inner portion of the disk, they generate waves that propagate atthe trapped mode frequencies out to larger disk radii. this finding iscontrasted with the results of global magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations, inwhich such oscillations are not easily identified. such examples underscorefundamental physical differences between accretion systems driven by themagneto-rotational instability and those for which alpha viscosity serves as aproxy for the physical processes that drive accretion, and we explore potentialapproaches to the search for diskoseismic modes in full magnetohydrodynamicdisks.
