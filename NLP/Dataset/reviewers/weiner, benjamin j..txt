0902.0363	aegis: the clustering of x-ray agn relative to galaxies at z~1	we measure the clustering of non-quasar x-ray agn at z=0.7-1.4 in the aegisfield. using the cross-correlation of 113 chandra-selected agn, with a medianlog l_x=42.8 erg s^-1, with ~5,000 deep2 galaxies, we find that the x-ray agnare fit by a power law with a clustering scale length of r_0=5.95 +/-0.90 h^-1mpc and slope gamma=1.66 +/-0.22. x-ray agn have a similar clustering amplitudeas red, quiescent and `green' transition galaxies at z~1 and are significantlymore clustered than blue, star-forming galaxies. the x-ray agn clusteringstrength is primarily determined by the host galaxy color; agn in red hostgalaxies are significantly more clustered than agn in blue host galaxies, witha relative bias that is similar to that of red to blue deep2 galaxies. wedetect no dependence of clustering on optical brightness, x-ray luminosity, orhardness ratio within the ranges probed here. we find evidence for galaxieshosting x-ray agn to be more clustered than a sample of galaxies with matchingjoint optical color and magnitude distributions. this implies that galaxieshosting x-ray agn are more likely to reside in groups and more massive darkmatter halos than galaxies of the same color and luminosity without an x-rayagn. in comparison to optically-selected quasars in the deep2 fields, we findthat x-ray agn at z~1 are more clustered than optically-selected quasars (witha 2.6-sigma significance) and therefore likely reside in more massive darkmatter halos. our results are consistent with galaxies undergoing a quasarphase while in the blue cloud before settling on the red sequence with alower-luminosity x-ray agn, if they are similar objects at differentevolutionary stages.

0903.3971	astronomical software wants to be free: a manifesto	astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members ofour community. purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasksbecomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations.however, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards arenot always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing softwarepublicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead tosignificant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. weidentify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety ofapproaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality ofastronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providingbenefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by openaccess to large survey and simulation datasets. our aim is to open aconversation on how to move forward. we advocate that: (1) the astronomicalcommunity consider software as an integral and fundable part of facilityconstruction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered asintegral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication anddata release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing andcollaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) thatwe seek structural incentives to make the release of software and relatedpublications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways offunding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink ourvalues to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just atechnical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.

0905.0162	mid-ir luminosities and uv/optical star formation rates at z&lt;1.4	uv continuum and mid-ir emission constitute two widely used star formationindicators at intermediate and high redshifts. we study 2430 galaxies withz&lt;1.4 in the extended groth strip with mips 24 mic observations from fidel,spectroscopy from deep2, and uv, optical, and near-ir photometry from aegis.the data are coupled with stellar population models and bayesian sed fitting toestimate dust-corrected sfrs. in order to probe the dust heating from stellarpopulations of various ages, the derived sfrs were averaged over varioustimescales--from 100 myr for "current" sfr to 1--3 gyr for long-timescale sfrs.these sed-based uv/optical sfrs are compared to total infrared luminositiesextrapolated from 24 mic observations. we find that for the blue, actively starforming galaxies the correlation between the ir luminosity and the uv/opticalsfr shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer sfr-averagingtimescales. we interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellarpopulations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. this holds overthe entire redshift range. many so-called green valley galaxies are simplydust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. however, there exist 24mic-detected galaxies, some with l&gt;10^11 l_sun, yet with little current starformation. for them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light issufficient to produce the observed levels of ir. in our sample optical andx-ray agns do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-irluminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "ir excess"galaxies (abridged).

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0907.0231	galaxies probing galaxies: cool halo gas from a z = 0.47 post-starburst  galaxy	we study the cool gas around a galaxy at z = 0.4729 using keck/lrisspectroscopy of a bright (b = 21.7) background galaxy at z = 0.6942 at atransverse distance of 16.5/h_70 kpc. the background galaxy spectrum revealsstrong feii, mgii, mgi, and caii absorption at the redshift of the foregroundgalaxy, with a mgii 2796 rest equivalent width of 3.93 +/- 0.08 angstroms,indicative of a velocity width exceeding 400 km/s. because the backgroundgalaxy is large (&gt; 4/h_70 kpc), the high covering fraction of the absorbing gassuggests that it arises in a spatially extended complex of cool clouds withlarge velocity dispersion. spectroscopy of the massive (log m_*/m_sun = 11.15+/- 0.08) host galaxy reveals that it experienced a burst of star formationabout 1 gyr ago and that it harbors a weak agn. we discuss the possible originsof the cool gas in its halo, including multiphase cooling of hot halo gas, coldinflow, tidal interactions, and galactic winds. we conclude the absorbing gaswas most likely ejected or tidally stripped from the interstellar medium of thehost galaxy or its progenitors during the past starburst event. adopting thelatter interpretation, these results place one of only a few constraints on theradial extent of cool gas driven or stripped from a galaxy in the distantuniverse. future studies with integral field unit spectroscopy of spatiallyextended background galaxies will provide multiple sightlines throughforeground absorbers and permit analysis of the morphology and kinematics ofthe gas surrounding galaxies with a diverse set of properties and environments.

0912.2343	the persistence of cool galactic winds in high stellar mass galaxies  between z~1.4 and ~1	we present an analysis of the mgii 2796, 2803 and feii 2586, 2600 absorptionline profiles in coadded spectra of 468 galaxies at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. the galaxysample, drawn from the team keck treasury redshift survey of the goods-n field,has a range in stellar mass (m_*) comparable to that of the sample at z~1.4analyzed in a similar manner by weiner et al. (2009; w09), but extends to lowerredshifts and has specific star formation rates which are lower by ~0.6 dex. weidentify outflows of cool gas from the doppler shift of the mgii absorptionlines and find that the equivalent width (ew) of absorption due to outflowinggas increases on average with m_* and star formation rate (sfr). we attributethe large ews measured in spectra of the more massive, higher-sfr galaxies tooptically thick absorbing clouds having large velocity widths. the outflowshave hydrogen column densities n(h) &gt; 10^19.3 cm^-2, and extend to velocitiesof ~500 km/s. while galaxies with sfr &gt; 10 msun/yr host strong outflows in boththis and the w09 sample, we do not detect outflows in lower-sfr (i.e., logm_*/msun &lt; 10.5) galaxies at lower redshifts. using a simple galaxy evolutionmodel which assumes exponentially declining sfrs, we infer that strong outflowspersist in galaxies with log m_*/msun &gt; 10.5 as they age between z=1.4 and z~1,presumably because of their high absolute sfrs. finally, using high resolutionhst/acs imaging in tandem with our spectral analysis, we find evidence for aweak trend (at 1 sigma significance) of increasing outflow absorption strengthwith increasing galaxy sfr surface density.

0708.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: color and luminosity dependence of  galaxy clustering at z~1	we present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxyclustering at z~1 in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey. using volume-limitedsubsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) theclustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and isas strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. we find no dependence of theclustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but asignificant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) forgalaxies in the range l/l*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependenceis seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. thesmall-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for bluegalaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p&lt;0.5 mpc/h.3) redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scaledistortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) while the clusteringlength, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), itspower-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the redsequence. the intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includestransitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on largescales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infallkinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxypopulation. 5) we compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelapplied to the millenium run simulation. differences between the data and themodel suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently insatellite galaxies.

1003.5425	absorption-line probes of the prevalence and properties of outflows in  present-day star-forming galaxies	we analyze star forming galaxies drawn from sdss dr7 to show how theinterstellar medium (ism) na i 5890, 5896 (na d) absorption lines depend ongalaxy physical properties, and to look for evidence of galactic winds. wecombine the spectra of galaxies with similar geometry/physical parameters tocreate composite spectra with signal-to-noise ~300. the stellar continuum ismodeled using stellar population synthesis models, and the continuum-normalizedspectrum is fit with two na i absorption components. we find that: (1) ism na dabsorption lines with equivalent widths ew &gt; 0.8a are only prevalent in diskgalaxies with specific properties -- large extinction (av), high star formationrates (sfr), high star formation rate per unit area ($\sigma_{\rm sfr}$), orhigh stellar mass (m*). (2) the ism na d absorption lines can be separated intotwo components: a quiescent disk-like component at the galaxy systemic velocityand an outflow component; (3) the disk-like component is much stronger in theedge-on systems, and the outflow component covers a wide angle but is strongerwithin 60deg of the disk rotation axis; (4) the ew and covering factor of thedisk component correlate strongly with dust attenuation, highlighting theimportance that dust shielding may play the survival of na i. (5) the ew of theoutflow component depends primarily on $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ and secondarily onav; (6) the outflow velocity varies from ~120 to 160km/s but shows little hintof a correlation with galaxy physical properties over the modest dynamic rangethat our sample probes (1.2 dex in log$\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ and 1 dex in log m*).

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1108.2503	calibrating the star formation rate at z=1 from optical data	we present a star-formation rate calibration based on optical data that isconsistent with average observed rates in both the red and blue galaxypopulations at z~1. the motivation for this study is to calculate sfrs fordeep2 redshift survey galaxies in the 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift range, but our resultsare generally applicable to similar optically-selected galaxy samples withoutrequiring uv or ir data. using sfrs fit from uv/optical seds in the aegissurvey, we explore the behavior of restframe b-band magnitude, observed [oii]luminosity, and restframe (u-b) color with sed-fit sfr for both red sequenceand blue cloud galaxies. we find that a sfr calibration can be calculated forall z~1 deep2 galaxies using a simultaneous fit in m_b and restframe colorswith residual errors that are within the sfr measurement error. the resultingsfr calibration produces fit residual errors of 0.3 dex rms scatter for thefull color-independent sample with minimal correlated residual error in l[oii]or stellar mass. we then compare the calibrated z~1 sfrs to two diagnosticsthat use l[oii] as a tracer in local galaxies and correct for dust extinctionat intermediate redshifts through either galaxy b-band luminosity or stellarmass. we find that a l[oii] - m_b sfr calibration commonly used in theliterature agrees well with our calculated sfrs after correcting for theaverage b-band luminosity evolution in l* galaxies. however, we find betteragreement with a local l[oii]-based sfr calibration that includes stellar massto correct for reddening effects, indicating that stellar mass is a bettertracer of dust extinction for all galaxy types and less affected by systematicevolution than galaxy luminosity from z=1 to the current epoch.

1108.2869	systematic blueshift of line profiles in the type iin supernova 2010jl:  evidence for post-shock dust formation?	type iin sne show spectral evidence for strong interaction between theirblast wave and dense circumstellar material (csm) around the progenitor star.sn2010jl was the brightest core-collapse sn in 2010, and it was a type iinexplosion with strong csm interaction. andrews et al. recently reportedevidence for an ir excess in sn2010jl, indicating either new dust formation orthe heating of csm dust in an ir echo. here we report multi-epoch spectra ofsn2010jl that reveal the tell-tale signature of new dust formation:emission-line profiles becoming systematically more blueshifted as the red sideof the line is blocked by increasing extinction. the effect is seen clearly inthe intermediate-width (400--4000 km/s) component of h$\alpha$ beginningroughly 30d after explosion. moreover, we present near-ir spectra demonstratingthat the asymmetry in the hydrogen-line profiles is wavelength dependent,appearing more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. this evidence suggests thatnew dust grains had formed quickly in the post-shock shell of sn 2010jl arisingfrom csm interaction. since the observed dust temperature has been attributedto an ir echo and not to new dust, either (1) ir excess emission at $\lambda &lt;5 \mu$m is not a particularly sensitive tracer of new dust formation in sne, or(2) some assumptions about expected dust temperatures might require furtherstudy. lastly, we discuss one possible mechanism other than dust that mightlead to increasingly blueshifted line profiles in sneiin, although thewavelength dependence of the asymmetry argues against this hypothesis in thecase of sn2010jl.

1111.2862	kiloparsec-scale spatial offsets in double-peaked narrow-line active  galactic nuclei. i. markers for selection of compelling dual active galactic  nucleus candidates	merger-remnant galaxies with kpc-scale separation dual active galactic nuclei(agns) should be widespread as a consequence of galaxy mergers and triggeredgas accretion onto supermassive black holes, yet very few dual agns have beenobserved. galaxies with double-peaked narrow agn emission lines in the sloandigital sky survey are plausible dual agn candidates, but their double-peakedprofiles could also be the result of gas kinematics or agn-driven outflows andjets on small or large scales. to help distinguish between these scenarios, wehave obtained spatial profiles of the agn emission via follow-up long-slitspectroscopy of 81 double-peaked narrow-line agns in sdss at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.36using lick, palomar, and mmt observatories. we find that all 81 systems exhibitdouble agn emission components with ~kpc projected spatial separations on thesky, which suggests that they are produced by kpc-scale dual agns or kpc-scaleoutflows, jets, or rotating gaseous disks. in addition, we find that thesubsample (58%) of the objects with spatially compact emission components maybe preferentially produced by dual agns, while the subsample (42%) withspatially extended emission components may be preferentially produced by agnoutflows. we also find that for 32% of the sample the two agn emissioncomponents are preferentially aligned with the host galaxy major axis, asexpected for dual agns orbiting in the host galaxy potential. our results bothnarrow the list of possible physical mechanisms producing the double agncomponents, and suggest several observational criteria for selecting the mostpromising dual agn candidates from the full sample of double-peaked narrow-lineagns. using these criteria, we determine the 17 most compelling dual agncandidates in our sample.

1111.6693	akari observation of the north ecliptic pole (nep) supercluster at z =  0.087: mid-infrared view of transition galaxies	we present the mid-infrared (mir) properties of galaxies within asupercluster in the north ecliptic pole region at z?0.087 observed with theakari satellite. we use data from the akari nep-wide (5.4 deg2) ir survey andthe clusters of galaxies evolution studies (clevl) mission program. we showthat near-ir (3 {\mu}m)-mid- ir (11 {\mu}m) color can be used as an indicatorof the specific star formation rate and the presence of intermediate agestellar populations. from the mir observations, we find that red-sequencegalaxies consist not only of passively evolving red early-type galaxies, butalso of 1) "weak-sfg" (disk-dominated star-forming galaxies which have starformation rates lower by \sim 4 \times than blue-cloud galaxies), and 2)"intermediate- mxg" (bulge-dominated galaxies showing stronger mir dustemission than normal red early-type galaxies). those two populations can be aset of transition galaxies from blue, star-forming, late-type galaxies evolvinginto red, quiescent, early-type ones. we find that the weak-sfg are predominantat intermediate masses (1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1010.5m\odot) and are typicallyfound in local densities similar to the outskirts of galaxy clusters. as muchas 40% of the supercluster member galaxies in this mass range can be classifiedas weak-sfgs, but their proportion decreases to &lt; 10% at larger masses (m\star&gt; 1010.5 m\odot) at any galaxy density. the fraction of the intermediate-mxgamong red- sequence galaxies at 1010m\odot &lt; m\star &lt; 1011m\odot also decreasesas the density and mass increase. in particular, \sim42% of the red-sequencegalaxies with early-type morphologies are classified as intermediate-mxg atintermediate densities. these results suggest that the star formation activityis strongly dependent on the stellar mass, but that the morphologicaltransformation is mainly controlled by the environment.

1203.1625	dependence of galaxy quenching on halo mass and distance from its centre	we study the dependence of star-formation quenching on galaxy mass andenvironment, in the sdss (z~0.1) and the aegis (z~1). it is crucial that wedefine quenching by low star-formation rate rather than by red colour, giventhat one third of the red galaxies are star forming. we address stellar massm*, halo mass mh, density over the nearest n neighbours deltan, and distance tothe halo centre d. the fraction of quenched galaxies appears more stronglycorrelated with mh at fixed m* than with m* at fixed mh, while for satellitesquenching also depends on d. we present the m*-mh relation for centrals at z~1.at z~1, the dependence of quenching on m* at fixed mh is somewhat morepronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloesare less massive. for satellites, m*-dependent quenching is noticeable at highd, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently capturedsatellites. at small d, where satellites likely fell in more than a few gyrago, quenching strongly depends on mh, and not on m*. the mh-dependence ofquenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating inmassive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,causing quenching. the interpretation of deltan is complicated by the fact thatit depends on the number of observed group members compared to n, motivatingthe use of d as a better measure of local environment.

1203.3192	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: design, observations, data reduction,  and redshifts	we describe the design and data sample from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey,the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z ~ 1completed to date. the survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massivegalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down toabsolute magnitude m_b = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on thedeimos spectrograph at keck observatory. deep2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude ofr_ab=24.1. objects with z &lt; 0.7 are rejected based on bri photometry in threeof the four deep2 fields, allowing galaxies with z &gt; 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. approximatelysixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. most of thetargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z~ 1.45. the deimos 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers highspectral resolution (r~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and uniqueinternal kinematic information. extensive ancillary data are available in thedeep2 fields, particularly in the extended groth strip, which has evolved intoone of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. deep2 surpasses otherdeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshiftaccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. we alsoprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the deep2 survey thus far.this paper is intended as a handbook for users of the deep2 data release 4,which includes all deep2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for thepublicly-available deep2 deimos data reduction pipelines.

(2005). in the optimization effort, we have taken particular careto ensure that the mock catalogs resemble the data as closely as possible, andwe have fine-tuned our methods separately on mocks constructed for the egs andthe rest of deep2. we have also probed the effect of the assumed cosmology onour inferred group-finding efficiency by performing our optimization on threedifferent mock catalogs with different background cosmologies, finding largedifferences in the group-finding success we can achieve for these differentmocks. using the mock catalog whose background cosmology is most consistentwith current data, we estimate that the deep2 group catalog is 72% complete and61% pure (74% and 67% for the egs) and that the group-finder correctlyclassifies 70% of galaxies that truly belong to groups, with an additional 46%of interloper galaxies contaminating the catalog (66% and 43% for the egs).(abridged)

1206.5552	demographics and physical properties of gas out/inflows at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4	we present keck/lris spectra of over 200 galaxies with well-determinedredshifts between 0.4 and 1.4. we combine new measurements of near-ultraviolet,low-ionization absorption lines with previously measured masses, luminosities,colors, and star formation rates to describe the demographics and properties ofgalactic flows. among star-forming galaxies with blue colors, we find a netblueshift of the feii absorption greater than 200 km/s (100 km/s) towards 2.5%(20%) of the galaxies. the fraction of blueshifted spectra does not varysignificantly with stellar mass, color, or luminosity but does decline atspecific star formation rates less than roughly 0.8 gyr^{-1}. the insensitivityof the blueshifted fraction to galaxy properties requires collimated outflowsat these redshifts, while the decline in outflow fraction with increasingblueshift might reflect the angular dependence of the outflow velocity. the lowdetection rate of infalling gas, 3 to 6% of the spectra, suggests an origin in(enriched) streams favorably aligned with our sightline. we find 4 of these 9infalling streams have projected velocities commensurate with the kinematics ofan extended disk or satellite galaxy. the strength of the mgii absorptionincreases with stellar mass, b-band luminosity, and u-b color, trends arisingfrom a combination of more interstellar absorption at the systemic velocity andless emission filling in more massive galaxies. our results provides a newquantitative understanding of gas flows between galaxies and the circumgalacticmedium over a critical period in galaxy evolution.

1209.1405	deep slitless infrared spectroscopic surveys with hst/wfc3	hst is commonly thought of as an optical-ir imaging or uv-spectroscopyobservatory. however, the advent of wfc3-ir made it possible to do slitlessinfrared spectroscopic surveys over an area significant for galaxy evolutionstudies (~0.15 deg^2). slitless infrared spectroscopy is uniquely possible fromspace due to the reduced background. redshift surveys with wfc3-ir offer probesof the astrophysics of the galaxy population at z=1-3 from line features, andthe true redshift and spatial distribution of galaxies, that cannot be donewith photometric surveys alone. while hst slitless spectroscopy is low spectralresolution, its high multiplex advantage makes it competitive with futureground based ir spectrographs, its flux calibration is stable, and its highspatial resolution allows measuring the spatial extent of emission lines, whichonly hst can do currently for large numbers of objects. a deeper slitless irspectroscopic survey over hundreds of arcmin^2 (eg one or more goods fields) isone of the remaining niches for large galaxy evolution studies with hst, andwould produce a sample of thousands of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3 to h=25 and beyond, of great interest to a large community ofinvestigators. finally, although jwst multislit spectroscopy will outstrip hstin resolution and sensitivity, i believe it is critical to have a spectroscopicsample in hand before jwst flies. this applies scientifically, to be preparedfor the questions we want to answer with jwst, and observationally, becausejwst's lifetime is limited and a classic problem in targeted spectroscopy hasbeen the turn-around time for designing surveys and for deciding which classesof objects to target. this white paper is released publicly to stimulate opendiscussion of future large hst programs.

1210.4173	the dependence of quenching upon the inner structure of galaxies at  0.5&lt;z&lt; 0.8 in the deep2/aegis survey	the shutdown of star formation in galaxies is generally termed `quenching'.although quenching may occur through a variety of processes, the exactmechanism(s) that is in fact responsible for quenching is still in question.this paper addresses quenching by searching for traces of possible quenchingprocesses through their effects on galaxy structural parameters such as surfacestellar mass density and sersic index (n). we analyze the rest-frame u-b colorcorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies inthe redshift range 0.5&lt; z&lt;0.8 from the deep2/aegis survey. we find that sersicindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters andresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. there exists,however, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. we hypothesize that their sersicvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, agns, and/or poor fits,leading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternativeto sersic index. not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tightrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies ismost physically linked with quenching. furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority ofthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since theirgim2d bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses ofsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass mustabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. we discuss atwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates arecontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and asecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellarmass build-up.

1305.0268	sinfoni/vlt 3d spectroscopy of massive galaxies: evidence of rotational  support at z~1.4	there is cumulative evidence showing that, for the most massive galaxies, thefraction of disk-like objects compared to those with spheroidal propertiesincreases with redshift. however, this evolution is thus far based on thesurface brightness study of these objects. to explore the consistency of thisscenario, it is necessary to measure the dynamical status of these galaxies.with this aim we have obtained seeing-limited near-infrared integral fieldspectra in the h-band for 10 massive galaxies (m_{stellar} &gt;10^{11} h_{70}^-2m_{sun}) at z~1.4 with sinfoni at the vlt. our sample is selected by theirstellar mass and ew[oii] &gt; 15 \aa, to secure their kinematic measurements, butwithout accounting for any morphological or flux criteria a priori. throughthis 3d kinematic spectroscopy analysis we find that half (i.e. 50+/-7%) of ourgalaxies are compatible with being rotationally supported disks, in agreementwith previous morphological expectations. this is a factor of approximately twohigher than what is observed in the present universe for objects of the samestellar mass. strikingly, the majority of our sample of massive galaxies showextended and fairly high rotational velocity maps, implying that massivegalaxies acquire rapidly rotational support and hence gravitationalequilibrium. our sample also show evidence for ongoing interactions andmergers. summarizing, massive galaxies at high-z show a significant diversityand must have continued evolution beyond the fading of stellar populations, tobecome their present day counterparts.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1310.6040	the evolution of dust-obscured star formation activity in galaxy  clusters relative to the field over the last 9 billion years	we compare the star formation (sf) activity in cluster galaxies to the fieldfrom z=0.3-1.5 using $herschel$ spire 250$\mu$m imaging. we utilize 274clusters from the irac shallow cluster survey (iscs) selected as rest-framenear-infrared overdensities over the 9 square degree bootes field . thisanalysis allows us to quantify the evolution of sf in clusters over a longredshift baseline without bias against active cluster systems. using a stackinganalysis, we determine the average star formation rates (sfrs) andspecific-sfrs (ssfr=sfr/m$_{\star}$) of stellar mass-limited (m&gt;1.3x10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$), statistical samples of cluster and field galaxies, probing boththe star forming and quiescent populations. we find a clear indication that theaverage sf in cluster galaxies is evolving more rapidly than in the field, withfield sf levels at z&gt;1.2 in the cluster cores (r&lt;0.5 mpc), in good agreementwith previous iscs studies. by quantifying the sf in cluster and field galaxiesas an exponential function of cosmic time, we determine that cluster galaxiesare evolving ~2 times faster than the field. additionally, we see enhanced sfabove the field level at z~1.4 in the cluster outskirts (r&gt;0.5 mpc). thesegeneral trends in the cluster cores and outskirts are driven by the lower massgalaxies in our sample. blue cluster galaxies have systematically lower ssfrsthan blue field galaxies, but otherwise show no strong differential evolutionwith respect to the field over our redshift range. this suggests that thecluster environment is both suppressing the star formation in blue galaxies onlong time-scales and rapidly transitioning some fraction of blue galaxies tothe quiescent galaxy population on short time-scales. we argue that our resultsare consistent with both strangulation and ram pressure stripping acting inthese clusters, with merger activity occurring in the cluster outskirts.

1310.8298	tracing the evolution of active galactic nuclei host galaxies over the  last 9 gyrs of cosmic time	we present the results of a combined galaxy population analysis for the hostgalaxies of active galactic nuclei (agn) identified at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 within thesdss, bootes and deep2 surveys. we identified agn in a uniform and unbiasedmanner at x-ray, infrared and radio wavelengths. supermassive black holesundergoing radiatively-efficient accretion (detected as x-ray and/or infraredagn) appear to be hosted in a separate and distinct galaxy population than agnundergoing powerful mechanically dominated accretion (radio agn). consistentwith some previous studies, radiatively efficient agn appear to bepreferentially hosted in modest star-forming galaxies, with little dependenceon agn or galaxy luminosity. agn exhibiting radio-emitting jets due tomechanically-dominated accretion are almost exclusively observed in massive,passive galaxies. crucially, we now provide strong evidence that the observedhost-galaxy trends are independent of redshift. in particular, these differentaccretion-mode agn have remained as separate galaxy populations throughout thelast 9 gyr. furthermore, it appears that galaxies hosting agn have evolvedalong the same path as galaxies that are not hosting agn with little evidencefor distinctly separate evolution.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1403.7524	star-forming blue etgs in two newly discovered galaxy overdensities in  the hudf at z=1.84 and 1.9: unveiling the progenitors of passive etgs in  cluster cores	we present the discovery of two galaxy overdensities in the hubble spacetelescope udf: a proto-cluster, hudfj0332.4-2746.6 at $z = 1.84 \pm 0.01$, anda group, hudfj0332.5-2747.3 at $z =1.90 \pm 0.01$. assuming viralization, thevelocity dispersion of hudfj0332.4-2746.6 implies a mass of $m_{200}= (2.2 \pm1.8) \times 10^{14} m_{\odot}$, consistent with the lack of extended x-rayemission. neither overdensity shows evidence of a red sequence. about $50\%$ oftheir members show interactions and/or disturbed morphologies, which aresignatures of merger remnants or disk instability. most of their etgs have bluecolors and show recent star-formation. these observations reveal for the firsttime large fractions of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming blue etgs inproto-clusters at $z\approx 2$. these star-forming etgs are most likely amongthe progenitors of the quiescent population in clusters at more recent epochs.their mass-size relation is consistent with that of passive etgs in clusters at$z\sim0.7-1.5$. if these galaxies are the progenitors of cluster etgs at theselower redshifts, their size would evolve according to a similar mass-sizerelation. it is noteworthy that quiescent etgs in clusters at $z=1.8-2$ also donot show any significant size evolution over this redshift range, contrary tofield etgs. the etg fraction is $\lesssim 50\%$, compared to the typicalquiescent etg fraction of $\approx 80\%$ in cluster cores at $z&lt; 1$. thefraction, masses, and colors of the newly discovered etgs imply that othercluster etgs will be formed/accreted at a later time.

1406.5187	kinematic evolution of simulated star-forming galaxies	recent observations have shown that star-forming galaxies like our own milkyway evolve kinematically into ordered thin disks over the last ~8 billion yearssince z=1.2, undergoing a process of "disk settling." for the first time, westudy the kinematic evolution of a suite of four state of the art "zoom in"hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in a fullycosmological context and compare with these observations. until now, robustmeasurements of the internal kinematics of simulated galaxies were lacking asthe simulations suffered from low resolution, overproduction of stars, andoverly massive bulges. the current generation of simulations has made greatprogress in overcoming these difficulties and is ready for a kinematicanalysis. we show that simulated galaxies follow the same kinematic trends asreal galaxies: they progressively decrease in disordered motions (sigma_g) andincrease in ordered rotation (vrot) with time. the slopes of the relationsbetween both sigma_g and vrot with redshift are consistent between thesimulations and the observations. in addition, the morphologies of thesimulated galaxies become less disturbed with time, also consistent withobservations, and they both have similarly large scatter. this match betweenthe simulated and observed trends is a significant success for the currentgeneration of simulations, and a first step in determining the physicalprocesses behind disk settling.

1407.1834	the interstellar medium and feedback in the progenitors of the compact  passive galaxies at z~2	quenched galaxies at z&gt;2 are nearly all very compact relative to z~0,suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,rapid cessation of star-formation. we present restframe uv spectra oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors ofquenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes andhigh surface density of star-formation. we compare their uv properties to thoseof more extended lbgs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).we find that candidate progenitors have faster ism gas velocities and higherequivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocityspread among absorbing clouds. candidates deviate from the relationship betweenequivalent widths of lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in thattheir lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,possibly indicating that the neutral hi fraction is patchy such thatlyman-alpha photons can escape. we detect stronger civ p-cygni features(emission and absorption) and heii emission in candidates, indicative of largerpopulations of metal rich wolf-rayet stars compared to non-candidates. thefaster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and lyman-alpha propertiesof candidates are consistent with their ism being subject to more energeticfeedback than non-candidates. together with their larger metallicity (implyingmore evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, ifspeculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them asprogenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. we propose that massive, compact galaxiesundergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gasaccretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized lbgsat these early epochs.

1407.7525	no more active galactic nuclei in clumpy disks than in smooth galaxies  at z~2 in candels / 3d-hst	we use candels imaging, 3d-hst spectroscopy, and chandra x-ray data toinvestigate if active galactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially fueled byviolent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4. weselect galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number ofclumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. the candels visual classificationsystem is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matchedcomparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. we notethat, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates,the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulgescompared to the clumpy galaxies. the lack of smooth extended disks is probablya general feature of the z~2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directlycompare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift.we find that z~2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced agn fractions selectedby integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatiallyresolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena ratherthan nuclear agns. meanwhile the x-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, andintermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable agn fractions derived fromboth individual detections and stacked non-detections. the data demonstratethat agn fueling modes at z~1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities orsecular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpygalaxies.

1410.3489	the clustering and halo masses of star forming galaxies at z&lt;1	we present clustering measurements and halo masses of star forming galaxiesat 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. after excluding agn, we construct a sample of 22553 24 {\mu}msources selected from 8.42 deg^2 of the spitzer mips agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey of bo\"otes. mid-infrared imaging allows us to observe galaxies with thehighest star formation rates (sfrs), less biased by dust obscuration afflictingthe optical bands. we find that the galaxies with the highest sfrs have opticalcolors which are redder than typical blue cloud galaxies, with many residingwithin the green valley. at z &gt; 0.4 our sample is dominated by luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^11 lsun) and is comprised entirely oflirgs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^12 lsun) at z &gt;0.6. we observe weak clustering of r_0 = 3-6 mpc/h for almost all of our starforming samples. we find that the clustering and halo mass depend on l_tir atall redshifts, where galaxies with higher l_tir (hence higher sfrs) havestronger clustering. galaxies with the highest sfrs at each redshift typicallyreside within dark matter halos of m_halo ~ 10^12.9 msun/h. this is consistentwith a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated,although we cannot exclude that ulirgs reside within higher mass halos. bymodeling the clustering evolution of halos, we connect our star forming galaxysamples to their local descendants. most star forming galaxies at z &lt; 1.0 arethe progenitors of l &lt; 2.5l* blue galaxies in the local universe, but starforming galaxies with the highest sfrs (l_tir &gt;10^11.7 lsun) at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 arethe progenitors of early-type galaxies in denser group environments.

1502.02659	a wfc3 grism emission line redshift catalog in the goods-south field	we combine hst/wfc3 imaging and g141 grism observations from the candels and3d-hst surveys to produce a catalog of grism spectroscopic redshifts forgalaxies in the candels/goods-south field. the wfc3/g141 grism spectra cover awavelength range of 1.1&lt;lambda&lt;1.7 microns with a resolving power of r~130 forpoint sources, thus providing rest-frame optical spectra for galaxies out toz~3.5. the catalog is selected in the h-band (f160w) and includes both galaxieswith and without previously published spectroscopic redshifts. grism spectraare extracted for all h-band detected galaxies with h&lt;24 and a candelsphotometric redshift z_phot &gt; 0.6. the resulting spectra are visually inspectedto identify emission lines and redshifts are determined using cross-correlationwith empirical spectral templates. to establish the accuracy of our redshifts,we compare our results against high-quality spectroscopic redshifts from theliterature. using a sample of 411 control galaxies, this analysis yields aprecision of sigma_nmad=0.0028 for the grism-derived redshifts, which isconsistent with the accuracy reported by the 3d-hst team. our final catalogcovers an area of 153 square arcmin and contains 1019 redshifts for galaxies ingoods-s. roughly 60% (608/1019) of these redshifts are for galaxies with nopreviously published spectroscopic redshift. these new redshifts span a rangeof 0.677 &lt; z &lt; 3.456 and have a median redshift of z=1.282. the catalogcontains a total of 234 new redshifts for galaxies at z&gt;1.5. in addition, wepresent 20 galaxy pair candidates identified for the first time using the grismredshifts in our catalog, including four new galaxy pairs at z~2, nearlydoubling the number of such pairs previously identified.

0804.4686	ubiquitous outflows in deep2 spectra of star-forming galaxies at z=1.4	galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of theintergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolutionof galaxies and the nature of qso absorption line systems. we use a sample of1406 galaxy spectra at z~1.4 from the deep2 redshift survey to show thatblueshifted mg ii 2796, 2803 a absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxiesat this epoch. this is the first detection of frequent outflowing galacticwinds at z~1. the presence and depth of absorption are independent of agnspectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisitefor driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. outflows are found incoadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x instar formation rate (sfr), calibrated from k-band and from mips ir fluxes. theoutflows have column densities of order n_h ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristicvelocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in themost massive, highest sfr galaxies. the velocities suggest that the outflowinggas can escape into the igm and that massive galaxies can producecosmologically and chemically significant outflows. both the mg ii equivalentwidth and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar massand sfr, with v_wind ~ sfr^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshiftir-luminous galaxies. the high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxypopulation at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors ofmassive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. the increase of outflowvelocity with mass and sfr constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolutionthat include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven modelsfor the wind physics.

0805.0004	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: environments of poststarburst galaxies  at z~0.1 and z~0.8	postststarburst (k+a) galaxies are candidates for galaxies in transition froma star-forming phase to a passively-evolving phase. we have spectroscopicallyidentified large samples of k+a galaxies both in the sdss at z~0.1 and in thedeep2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in hbetaemission rather than the more problematic [oii] 3727. based on measurements ofthe overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that k+a galaxiesbrighter than 0.4l*_b at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishableenvironment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments,but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. however, at higher-z, theenvironment distribution of k+a galaxies is more similar to red galaxies thanto blue galaxies. we conclude that the quenching of star formation and thebuild-up of the red sequence through the k+a phase is happening in relativelyoverdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0.although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing withtime, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same alongwith the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of allgalaxies has to grow with time. in addition, we do not find any significantdependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of k+as. the existenceof a large k+a population in the field at both redshifts indicates thatcluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which thesegalaxies are formed. we also demonstrates that studying k+a-environmentrelations by measuring the k+a fraction in different environments is highlynon-robust. statistical comparisons of the overall environment distributions ofdifferent populations are much better behaved.

1505.03866	a steep slope and small scatter for the high-mass end of the l-$\sigma$  relation at $z\sim0.55$	we measure the intrinsic relation between velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) andluminosity ($l$) for massive, luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at redshift $z \sim0.55$. we achieve unprecedented precision by using a sample of 600,000 galaxieswith spectra from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of thethird sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii), covering a range of stellar masses$m_* \gtrsim 10^{11} m_{\odot}$. we deconvolve the effects of photometricerrors, limited spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio, and red--blue galaxyconfusion using a novel hierarchical bayesian formalism that is generallyapplicable to any combination of photometric and spectroscopic observables. foran l-$\sigma$ relation of the form $l \propto \sigma^{\beta}$, we find $\beta =7.8 \pm 1.1$ for $\sigma$ corrected to the effective radius, and a very smallintrinsic scatter of $s = 0.047 \pm 0.004$ in $\log_{10} \sigma$ at fixed $l$.no significant redshift evolution is found for these parameters. the evolutionof the zero-point within the redshift range considered is consistent with thepassive evolution of a galaxy population that formed at redshift $z=2-3$,assuming single stellar populations. an analysis of previously reported resultsseems to indicate that the passively-evolved high-mass l-$\sigma$ relation at$z\sim0.55$ is consistent with the one measured at $z=0.1$. our results, incombination with those presented in montero-dorta et al. (2014), provide adetailed description of the high-mass end of the red sequence (rs) at$z\sim0.55$. this characterization, in the light of previous literature,suggest that the high-mass rs distribution corresponds to the "core" ellipticalpopulation.

1510.07049	leveraging 3d-hst grism redshifts to quantify photometric redshift  performance	we present a study of photometric redshift accuracy in the 3d-hst photometriccatalogs, using 3d-hst grism redshifts to quantify and dissect trends inredshift accuracy for galaxies brighter than $h_{f140w}&lt;24$ with anunprecedented and representative high-redshift galaxy sample. we find anaverage scatter of $0.0197\pm0.0003(1+z)$ in the skelton et al. (2014)photometric redshifts. photometric redshift accuracy decreases with magnitudeand redshift, but does not vary monotonically with color or stellar mass. the1-$\sigma$ scatter lies between $0.01-0.03$(1+z) for galaxies of all masses andcolors below $z&lt;2.5$ (for $h_{f140w}{&lt;}24$), with the exception of a populationof very red ($u-v &gt; 2$), dusty star-forming galaxies for which the scatterincreases to $\sim0.1(1+z)$. although the overall photometric redshift accuracyfor quiescent galaxies is better than for star-forming galaxies, scatterdepends more strongly on magnitude and redshift than on galaxy type. we verifythese trends using the redshift distributions of close pairs and extend theanalysis to fainter objects, where photometric redshift errors further increaseto $\sim0.046(1+z)$ at $h_{f160w}=26$. we demonstrate that photometric redshiftaccuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiplefilter combinations. we evaluate the widths of redshift probabilitydistribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by afactor of $\sim1.1-1.6$, but that uniformly broadening the distribution doesnot adequately account for fitting outliers. finally, we suggest possibleapplications of these data in planning for current and future surveys andsimulate photometric redshift performance in the lsst, des, and combined desand vhs surveys.

astro-ph;0008204	the disk and dark halo mass of the barred galaxy ngc 4123. i.  observations	the non-circular streaming motions in barred galaxies are sensitive to themass of the bar and can be used to lift the degeneracy between disk and darkmatter halo encountered when fitting axisymmetric rotation curves of diskgalaxies. in this paper, we present photometric and kinematic observations ofngc 4123, a barred galaxy of modest size (v_rot = 130 km/sec, l = 0.7 l_*),which reveal strong non-circular motions. the bar has straight dust lanes andan inner lindblad resonance. the disk of ngc 4123 has no sign of truncation outto 10 scale lengths, and star-forming regions are found well outside r_25. afabry-perot h-alpha velocity field shows velocity jumps of &gt;100 km/sec at thelocation of the dust lanes within the bar, indicating shocks in the gas flow.vla observations yield the velocity field of the h i disk. axisymmetric massmodels yield good fits to the rotation curve outside the bar regionfor diski-band m/l of 2.25 or less, and dark halos with either isothermal or power-lawprofiles can fit the data well. in a companion paper, we model the full 2-dvelocity field, including non-circular motions, to determine the stellar m/land the mass of the dark halo.

astro-ph;0008205	the disk and dark halo mass of the barred galaxy ngc 4123. ii.  fluid-dynamical models	we report a dynamical determination of the separate contributions of disk anddark halo masses to the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy. we usefluid-dynamical models of gas flow in the barred galaxy ngc 4123 to constrainthe dynamical properties of the galaxy: disk m/l, bar pattern speed, and thecentral density and scale radius of the dark halo. we derive a realistic barredpotential directly from the light distribution. for each model we assume avalue of the stellar m/l and a bar pattern speed omega_p and add a dark halo tofit the rotation curve. we then compute the gas flow velocities with a 2-d gasdynamical code, and compare the model flow patterns to a 2-d velocity fieldderived from fabry-perot observations. the strong shocks and non-circularmotions in the observed gas flow require a high stellar m/l and a fast-rotatingbar. models with i-band disk m/l of 2.0 -- 2.5 h_75, or 80 -- 100% of themaximum disk value, are highly favored. the corotation radius of the bar mustbe &lt;= 1.5 times the bar semi-major axis. these results contradict some recentclaimed ``universal'' galaxy disk/halo relations, since ngc 4123 is of modestsize (rotation curve maximum 145 km/sec, and v_flat = 130 km/sec) yet is quitedisk-dominated. the dark halo of ngc 4123 is less concentrated than favored bycurrent models of dark halos based on cosmological simulations. since some 30%of bright disk galaxies are strongly barred and have dust lanes indicatingshock morphology similar to that of ngc 4123, it is likely that they also havehigh stellar m/l and low density halos. we suggest that luminous matterdominates inside the optical radius r_25 of high surface brightness diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0109055	optical emission from high velocity clouds and the ionization sources in  the galactic halo	optical emission lines have now been detected from about 20 high velocityclouds. these emission lines -- primarily h-alpha, secondarily [n ii] and [sii] -- are very faint and diffuse, spread over the surfaces of the clouds. wecompile emission line measurements and present a model in which the h-alpha isrecombination caused by photoionizing radiation escaping the milky way. in sucha model, we infer hvc distances of 5--30 kpc. the photoionization model failsto explain the relatively strong h-alpha emission from the magellanic stream,and the o vi absorption seen by fuse in hvcs and the ms, which require a secondsource of ionization (likely collisional). regardless of mechanism, the factthat hvcs are detectable in h-alpha indicates they are not far away enough tobe local group objects. adopting the hvc distances from the model, there appearto be two classes of hvcs: h-alpha-bright clouds with low velocity deviationsfrom galactic rotation, and often strong [n ii], which are presumablyaffiliated with the galactic disk; and h-alpha-faint clouds with high velocitydeviations, which are likely to be infalling gas.

astro-ph;0205025	the deep groth strip survey ii. hubble space telescope structural  parameters of galaxies in the groth strip	the quantitative morphological classification of distant galaxies isessential to the understanding of the evolution of galaxies over the history ofthe universe. this paper presents hubble space telescope wfpc2 f606w and f814wphotometric structural parameters for 7450 galaxies in the ``groth strip.''these parameters are based on a two-dimensional bulge+disk surface brightnessmodel and were obtained using an automated reduction and analysis pipelinedescribed in detail here. a first set of fits was performed separately in eachbandpass, and a second set of fits was performed simultaneously on bothbandpasses. the information produced by these two types of fits can be used toexplore different science goals. systematic and random fitting errors in allstructural parameters as well as bulge and disk colors are carefullycharacterized through extensive sets of simulations. the results of thesesimulations are given in catalogs similar to the real science catalogs so thatboth real and simulated measurements can be sampled according to the sameselection criteria to show biases and errors in the science data subset ofinterest. the effects of asymmetric structures on the recovered bulge+diskfitting parameters are also explored through simulations. the fullmultidimensional photometric survey selection function of the groth strip isalso computed. this selection function, coupled to bias maps from simulations,provides a complete and objective reproduction of the observational limits, andthese limits can be applied to theoretical predictions from galaxy evolutionmodels for direct comparisons with the data.

astro-ph;0305587	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: spectral classification of galaxies at  z~1	we present a principal component analysis (pca)-based spectralclassification, eta, for the first 5600 galaxies observed in the deep2 redshiftsurvey. this parameter provides a very pronounced separation between absorptionand emission dominated galaxy spectra - corresponding to passively evolving andactively star-forming galaxies in the survey respectively. in addition it isshown that despite the high resolution of the observed spectra, this parameteralone can be used to quite accurately reconstruct any given galaxy spectrum,suggesting there are not many `degrees of freedom' in the observed spectra ofthis galaxy population. it is argued that this form of classification, eta,will be particularly valuable in making future comparisons between high andlow-redshift galaxy surveys for which very large spectroscopic samples are nowreadily available, particularly when used in conjunction with high-resolutionspectral synthesis models which will be made public in the near future. we alsodiscuss the relative advantages of this approach to distant galaxyclassification compared to other methods such as colors and morphologies.finally, we compare the classification derived here with that adopted for the2df galaxy redshift survey and in so doing show that the two systems are verysimilar. this will be particularly useful in subsequent analyses when makingcomparisons between results from each of these surveys to study evolution inthe galaxy populations and large-scale structure.

(2) a maximum-likelihood analysis shows that lya absorbers of logn(hi) &lt; 13.6 are consistent with being more randomly distributed with respectto known galaxies. finally, (3) we find based on this single sightline that theamplitude of xi_{ga} does not depend sensitively on n(hi) for strong absorbersof log n(hi) &gt;= 13.6.

astro-ph;0602027	dark and baryonic matter in bright spiral galaxies: ii. radial  distributions for 34 galaxies	we decompose the rotation curves of 34 bright spiral galaxies into baryonicand dark matter components. stellar mass profiles are created by applyingcolor-m/l relations to near-infrared and optical photometry. we find that theradial profile of the baryonic-to-dark-matter ratio is self-similar for allgalaxies, when scaled to the radius where the contribution of the baryonic massto the rotation curve equals that of the dark matter (r_x). we argue that thisis due to the quasi-exponential nature of disks and rotation curves that arenearly flat after an initial rise. the radius r_x is found to correlate moststrongly with baryonic rotation speed, such that galaxies with r_x measurementsthat lie further out in their disks rotate faster. this quantity alsocorrelates very strongly with stellar mass, hubble type, and observed rotationspeed; b-band central surface brightness is less related to r_x than theseother galaxy properties. most of the galaxies in our sample appear to be closeto maximal disk. for these galaxies, we find that maximum observed rotationspeeds are tightly correlated with maximum rotation speeds predicted from thebaryon distributions, such that one can create a tully-fisher relation based onsurface photometry and redshifts alone. finally, we compare our data to the nfwparameterization for dark matter profiles with and without including adiabaticcontraction as it is most commonly implemented. fits are generally poor, andall but 2 galaxies are better fit if adiabatic contraction is not performed. inorder to have better fits, and especially to accommodate adiabatic contraction,baryons would need to contribute very little to the total mass in the innerparts of galaxies, seemingly in contrast with other observational constraints.

astro-ph;0607512	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: evolution of the color-density  relation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.35	using a sample of 19,464 galaxies drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 1.35. we find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence dependsstrongly on local environment out to z &gt; 1, being larger in regions of greatergalaxy density. at all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measuredoverdensity. the observed correlations between the red fraction and localoverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z &gt; 1 detected at agreater than 5-\sigma level. over the entire redshift regime studied, we findthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies morestrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequencecounterparts at high redshift. at z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weaklycorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to theclustering of ~ l* galaxies at that epoch must be small. our findings addweight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequencehas occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) atz &lt; 1.5. the strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.35suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-densityand color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms(i.e., "nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by "nature'') uponthe galaxy population during their epoch of formation.

astro-ph;0608569	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the evolution of the blue fraction in  groups and the field	we explore the behavior of the blue galaxy fraction over the redshift range0.75 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.3 in the deep2 survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxiesin groups. the primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in drivingthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. the colour segregation observedbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: deep2groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. at fixed z,there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, suchthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in thefield. in addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction andgroup richness. in terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and thefield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshiftthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field bluefractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. careful tests indicate that thiseffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. to furtherensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock deep2catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensityrelation observed in deep2 and use these to test our methods. the convergencebetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that deep2 galaxygroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this resultis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models ofgalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

astro-ph;0609090	a survey of galaxy kinematics to z ~ 1 in the tkrs/goods-n field. i.  rotation and dispersion properties	we present kinematic measurements of a large sample of galaxies from the tkrssurvey in the goods-n field. we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions fromintegrated emission for 1089 galaxies with median z=0.637, and spatiallyresolved kinematics for a subsample of 380 galaxies. this is the largest sampleof galaxies to z ~ 1 with kinematics to date, and allows us to measurekinematic properties without morphological pre-selection. emission linewidthsprovide kinematics for the bulk of blue galaxies. to fit the spatially resolvedkinematics, we fit models with both line-of-sight rotation amplitude andvelocity dispersion. integrated linewidth correlates well with a combination ofthe rotation gradient and dispersion, and is a robust measure of galaxykinematics. the spatial extents of emission and continuum are similar and thereis no evidence that linewidths are affected by nuclear or clumpy emission. themeasured rotation gradient depends strongly on slit pa alignment with galaxymajor axis, but integrated linewidth does not. even for galaxies withwell-aligned slits, some have kinematics dominated by dispersion (v/sigma&lt;1)rather than rotation. these are probably objects with disordered velocityfields, not dynamically hot stellar systems. about 35% of the resolved sampleare dispersion dominated; galaxies that are both dispersion dominated andbright exist at high redshift but appear rare at low redshift. this kinematicmorphology is linked to photometric morphology in hst/acs images: dispersiondominated galaxies include a higher fraction of irregulars and chain galaxies,while rotation dominated galaxies are mostly disks and irregulars. onlyone-third of chain/hyphen galaxies are dominated by rotation; high-z elongatedobjects cannot be assumed to be inclined disks.

astro-ph;0609091	a survey of galaxy kinematics to z ~ 1 in the tkrs/goods-n field. ii.  evolution in the tully-fisher relation	we use kinematic measurements of a large sample of galaxies from the teamkeck redshift survey in the goods-n field to measure evolution in the opticaland near-ir tully-fisher relations to z = 1.2. we construct tully-fisherrelations with integrated line-of-sight velocity widths of ~ 1000 galaxies in band ~ 670 in j-band; these relations have large scatter, and we derive amaximum-likelihood least squares method for fitting in the presence of scatter.the b-band tully-fisher relations, from z=0.4 to z=1.2, show evolution of ~1.0-1.5 mag internal to our sample without requiring calibration to a local tfrelation. there is evolution in both tully-fisher intercept and slope,suggesting differential luminosity evolution. in j-band, there is evolution inslope but little evolution in overall luminosity. the slope measurements implythat bright, massive blue galaxies fade {\it more strongly} than fainter bluegalaxies from z ~ 1.2 to now. this conclusion runs counter to some previousmeasurements and to our naive expectations, but we present a simple set of starformation histories to show that it arises naturally if massive galaxies haveshorter timescales of star formation, forming most of their stars before z ~ 1,while less massive galaxies form stars at more slowly declining rates. thismodel predicts that the higher global star formation rate at z ~ 1 is mostlydue to higher sfr in massive galaxies. the amount of fading in b-bandconstrains star formation timescale more strongly than redshift of formation.tully-fisher and color-magnitude relations can provide global constraints onthe luminosity evolution and star formation history of blue galaxies.

astro-ph;0610842	aegis: extinction and star formation tracers from line emission	strong nebular emission lines are a sensitive probe of star formation andextinction in galaxies, and the [o ii] line detects star forming populationsout to z&gt;1. however, star formation rates from emission lines depend oncalibration of extinction and the [o ii]/h-alpha line ratio, and separatingstar formation from agn emission. we use calibrated line luminosities from thedeep2 survey and palomar k magnitudes to show that the behavior of emissionline ratios depends on galaxy magnitude and color. for galaxies on the blueside of the color bimodality, the vast majority show emission signatures ofstar formation, and there are strong correlations of extinction and [oii]/h-alpha with restframe h magnitude. the conversion of [o ii] toextinction-corrected h-alpha and thus to star formation rate has a significantslope with m_h, 0.23 dex/mag. red galaxies with emission lines have a muchhigher scatter in their line ratios, and more than half show agn signatures. weuse 24 micron fluxes from spitzer/mips to demonstrate the differing populationsprobed by nebular emission and by mid-ir luminosity. although extinction iscorrelated with luminosity, 98% of ir-luminous galaxies at z~1 are stilldetected in the [o ii] line. mid-ir detected galaxies are mostly bright andintermediate color, while fainter, bluer galaxies with high [o ii] luminosityare rarely detected at 24 microns.

astro-ph;0702643	the stellar mass tully-fisher relation to z=1.2 from aegis	we combine newly measured rotation velocities, velocity dispersions, andstellar masses to construct stellar mass tully-fisher relations (m*tfrs) for544 galaxies with strong emission lines at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2 from the all wavelengthextended groth strip international survey (aegis) and the deep extragalacticevolutionary probe 2 survey (deep2). the conventional m*tfr using only rotationvelocity (vrot) shows large scatter (~1.5 dex in velocity). the scatter andresiduals are correlated with morphology in the sense that disturbed, compact,and major merger galaxies have lower velocities for their masses. we constructan m*tfr using the kinematic estimator s_0.5 which is defined as sqrt(0.5vrot^2+ sigma_g^2) and accounts for disordered or non-circular motions through thegas velocity dispersion (sigma_g). the new m*tfr, termed s_0.5/m*tfr, isremarkably tight over 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2 with no detectable evolution of its interceptor slope with redshift. the average best fit relation has 0.47 dex scatter instellar mass, corresponding to ~1.2 'magnitudes,' assuming a constantmass-to-light ratio. interestingly, the s_0.5/m*tfr is consistent with theabsorption-line based stellar mass faber-jackson relation for nearby ellipticalgalaxies in terms of slope and intercept, which might suggest a physicalconnection between the two relations.

astro-ph;9512017	detection of h-alpha emission from the magellanic stream: evidence for  an extended gaseous galactic halo	we have detected faint, diffuse h$\alpha emission from several points alongthe magellanic stream, using the rutgers fabry--perot interferometer at thectio 1.5-m telescope. at points on the leading edges of the h i clouds ms ii,ms iii, and ms iv, we detect h$\alpha emission of surface brightness $0.37 \pm0.02$ rayleighs, $0.21 \pm 0.04$ r, and $0.20 \pm 0.02$ r respectively,corresponding to emission measures of 1.0 to 0.5 \cmsixpc. we have observedseveral positions near the ms iv concentration, and find that the strongestemission is on the sharp leading-edge density gradient. there is less emissionat points away from the gradient, and halfway between ms iii and ms iv theh$\alpha surface brightness is $&lt; 0.04$ r.  we attribute the h$\alpha emission at cloud leading edges to heating of thestream clouds by ram pressure from ionized gas in the halo of the galaxy. theseobservations suggest that ram pressure from halo gas plays a large role instripping the stream out of the magellanic clouds. they also suggest thepresence of a relatively large density of gas, $n_{\rm h} \sim 10^{-4}cm^{-3}$, in the galactic halo at $\sim 50$ kpc radius, and far above thegalactic plane, $b \sim -80\deg$. this implies that the galaxy has a very largebaryonic, gaseous extent, and supports models of lyman-$\alpha and metal-lineqso absorption lines in which the absorption systems reside in extendedgalactic halos.

astro-ph;9904130	the properties of the galactic bar implied by gas kinematics in the  inner milky way	longitude-velocity (l-v) diagrams of h i and co gas in the inner milky wayhave long been known to be inconsistent with circular motion in an axisymmetricpotential. several lines of evidence suggest that the galaxy is barred, and gasflow in a barred potential could be consistent with the observed ``forbidden''velocities and other features in the data. we compare the h i observations tol-v diagrams synthesized from 2-d fluid dynamical simulations of gas flows in afamily of barred potentials. the gas flow pattern is very sensitive to theparameters of the assumed potential, which allows us to discriminate amongmodels. we present a model that reproduces the outer contour of the h i l-vdiagram reasonably well; this model has a strong bar with a semimajor axis of3.6 kpc, an axis ratio of approximately 3:1, an inner lindblad resonance (ilr),and a pattern speed of 42 km/s/kpc, and matches the data best when viewed from34\deg to the bar major axis. the behavior of the models, combined with theconstraint that the shocks in the milky way bar should resemble those inexternal barred galaxies, leads us to conclude that wide ranges of parameterspace are incompatible with the observations. in particular we suggest that thebar must be fairly strong, must have an ilr, and cannot be too end-on, with thebar major axis at 35\deg +/- 5\deg to the line of sight. the h i data exhibitlarger forbidden velocities over a wider longitude range than are seen inmolecular gas; this important difference is the reason our favored modeldiffers so significantly from other recently proposed models.
