0906.4195	svom: a new mission for gamma-ray burst studies	we present the svom (space-based multi-band astronomical variable objectmonitor) mission, that is being developed in cooperation between the chinesenational space agency (cnsa), the chinese academy of science (cas) and thefrench space agency (cnes). its scientific objectives include the study of thegrb phenomenon, grb physics and progenitors, cosmology, and fundamentalphysics. svom is designed to detect all known types of gamma-ray bursts (grbs),to provide fast and reliable grb positions, to measure the broadband spectralcharacteristics and temporal properties of the grb prompt emission. this willbe obtained in first place thanks to a set of four space flown instruments. awide field (~2 sr) coded mask telescope (eclairs), operating in the 4-250 kevenergy range, will provide the triggers and localizations, while a gamma-raynon-imaging spectrometer (grm), sensitive in the 50 kev-5 mev domain, willextend the prompt emission energy coverage. after a satellite slew, in order toplace the grb direction within field of view of the two narrow fieldinstruments - a soft x-ray (xiao), and a visible telescope (vt) - the grbposition will be refined and the study of the early phases of the grb afterglowwill be possible. a set of three ground based dedicated instruments, tworobotic telescopes (gfts) and a wide angle optical monitor (gwac), willcomplement the space borne instruments. thanks to the low energy triggerthreshold (~4 kev) of the eclairs, svom is ideally suited for the detection ofsoft, hence potentially most distant, grbs. its observing strategy is optimizedto facilitate follow-up observations from the largest ground based facilities.

0907.0087	a multiwavelength study of swift grb 060111b constraining the origin of  its prompt optical emission	in this work, we present the results obtained from a multi-wavelengthcampaign, as well as from the public swift/bat, xrt, and uvot data of grb060111b for which a bright optical emission was measured with good temporalresolution during the prompt phase. we identified the host galaxy at r~25 mag;its featureless spectral continuum and brightness, as well as the non-detectionof any associated supernova 16 days after the trigger and other independentredshift estimates, converge to z~1-2. from the analysis of the early afterglowsed, we find that non-negligible host galaxy dust extinction, in addition tothe galactic one, affects the observed flux in the optical regime. theextinction-corrected optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distribution duringthe prompt emission shows a flux density ratio $f_{\gamma}/f_{opt}$=0.01-0.0001with spectral index $\beta_{\gamma,opt}&gt; \beta_{\gamma}$, strongly suggesting aseparate origin of the optical and gamma-ray components. this result issupported by the lack of correlated behavior in the prompt emission lightcurves observed in the two energy domains. the properties of the prompt opticalemission observed during grb 060111b favor interpretation of this optical lightas radiation from the reverse shock in a thick shell limit and in the slowcooling regime. the expected peak flux is consistent with the observed onecorrected for the host extinction, likely indicating that the starting time ofthe tarot observations is very near to or coincident with the peak time. theestimated fireball initial lorentz factor is &gt;260-360 at z=1-2, similar to thelorentz factors obtained from other grbs. grb 060111b is a rare, good test caseof the reverse shock emission mechanism in both the x-ray and optical energyranges.

0908.3808	photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey fields	we present the photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey (snls)fields. the snls aims at measuring the distances to sne ia at (0.3&lt;z&lt;1) usingmegacam, the 1 deg^2 imager on the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). theuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates thesystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the darkenergy equation of state. the photometric calibration of the snls requiresobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science fieldstars in each survey band (sdss-like ugriz bands) with respect to standardswith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the ubvrilandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby sne from the literaturenecessary to produce cosmological constraints. the spatial non-uniformities ofthe imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of densestellar fields. photometric zero-points against landolt standards are obtained.the linearity of the instrument is studied. we show that the imager filters andphotometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. we presentmodels of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of theposition on the focal plane. we define a natural magnitude system for megacam.we show that the systematics affecting the magnitude-to-flux relations can bereduced if we use the spectrophotometric standard star bd +17 4708 instead ofvega as a fundamental flux standard. we publish ugriz catalogs of tertiarystandards for all the snls fields.

0909.3316	the eso/vlt 3rd year type ia supernova data set from the supernova  legacy survey	we present 139 spectra of 124 type ia supernovae (sneia) that were observedat the eso/vlt during the first three years of the canada-france-hawaitelescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). this homogeneous data set isused to test for redshift evolution of sneia spectra, and will be used in thesnls 3rd year cosmological analyses.  spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that usesphotometric information from deep cfht legacy survey (cfht-ls) reference imagesto trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on thespectrogram as a function of wavelength. it also separates the supernova andits host light in 60% of cases. the identification of the supernova candidatesis performed using a spectrophotometric snia model.  a total of 124 sneia, roughly 50% of the overall snls spectroscopic sample,have been identified using the eso/vlt during the first three years of thesurvey. their redshifts range from z=0.149 to z=1.031. the average redshift ofthe sample is z=0.63+/-0.02. this constitutes the largest snia spectral set todate in this redshift range. the spectra are presented along with theirbest-fit spectral snia model and a host model where relevant. in the lattercase, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. we produce average spectrafor pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z&lt;0.5 and z&gt;=0.5sneia. we find that z&lt;0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass elementabsorptions than z&gt;= 0.5 spectra. the differences with redshift are consistentwith the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.

0912.1646	the type ia supernova rate in radio and infrared galaxies from the cfht  supernova legacy survey	we have combined the large sn ia database of the canada-france-hawaiitelescope supernova legacy survey and catalogs of galaxies with photometricredshifts, vla 1.4 ghz radio sources, and spitzer infrared sources. we presenteight sne ia in early-type host galaxies which have counterparts in the radioand infrared source catalogs. we find the sn ia rate in subsets of radio andinfrared early-type galaxies is ~1-5 times the rate in all early-type galaxies,and that any enhancement is always &lt;~ 2 sigma. rates in these subsets areconsistent with predictions of the two component "a+b" sn ia rate model. sinceinfrared properties of radio sn ia hosts indicate dust obscured star formation,we incorporate infrared star formation rates into the "a+b" model. we also showthe properties of sne ia in radio and infrared galaxies suggest the hostscontain dust and support a continuum of delay time distributions for sne ia,although other delay time distributions cannot be ruled out based on our data.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1002.1374	constraining dark matter halo properties using lensed snls supernovae	this paper exploits the gravitational magnification of sne ia to measureproperties of dark matter haloes. the magnification of individual sne ia can becomputed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halomodels. we model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singularisothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeyingluminosity dependent scaling laws. a homogeneously selected sample of 175 sneia from the first 3-years of the supernova legacy survey (snls) in the redshiftrange 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloesassociated with foreground galaxies. the best-fitting velocity dispersionscaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. we furtherfind that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and starforming galaxies are consistent with empirical faber-jackson and tully-fisherrelations, respectively. if we make no assumption on the normalisation of theserelations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 percent confidence level. using recent models of dust extinction we deduce thatthe impact of this effect on our results is very small. we also investigate thebrightness scatter of sne ia due to gravitational lensing. the gravitationallensing scatter is approximately proportional to the sn ia redshift. we findthe constant of proportionality to be b = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (b &lt; 0.12 magat the 95 per cent confidence level). if this model is correct, thecontribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of sne ia issmall for the snls sample.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1006.2254	real-time analysis and selection biases in the supernova legacy survey	the supernova legacy survey (snls) has produced a high-quality, homogeneoussample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. in itsfirst four years of full operation (to june 2007), the snls discovered morethan 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmedspectroscopically as sne ia. use of these sne ia in precision cosmologycritically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in thesnls survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying sn ia population.this paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures,and uses detailed monte carlo simulations to examine the effects of malmquistbias and spectroscopic sampling. such sampling effects are found to becomeapparent at z~0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of thespectroscopically confirmed sn ia sample towards brighter values for z&gt;0.75. wedescribe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-yearsnls cosmological analysis (snls3), and present a breakdown of the systematicuncertainties involved.

1010.4312	spectroscopic confirmation of a galaxy at redshift z=8.6	galaxies had their most significant impact on the universe when theyassembled their first generations of stars. energetic photons emitted by young,massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surroundingtheir host galaxies, cleared sight-lines along which the light of the younggalaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of theintergalactic gas in the universe continuously until the present day.observations of the cosmic microwave background, and of galaxies and quasars atthe highest redshifts, suggest that the universe was reionised through acomplex process that was completed about a billion years after the big bang, byredshift z~6. detecting ionizing ly-alpha photons from increasingly distantgalaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of thesources responsible for reionisation. here we report the detection of ly-aphotons emitted less than 600 million years after the big bang. udfy-38135539is at a redshift z=8.5549+-0.0002, which is greater than those of thepreviously known most distant objects, at z=8.2 and z=6.97. we find that thissingle source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volumenecessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contributionfrom other, probably fainter galaxies nearby.

1104.1444	snls3: constraints on dark energy combining the supernova legacy survey  three year data with other probes	we present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using thesupernova legacy survey three year sample (snls3) of guy et al. (2010) andconley et al. (2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1109.5757	the rise-time of normal and subluminous type ia supernovae	we calculate the average stretch-corrected rise-time of type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the supernova legacy survey. we use the aggregate lightcurves ofspectroscopic and photometrically identified sne ia to fit the rising part ofthe lightcurve with a simple quadratic model. we obtain a lightcurve shapecorrected, i .e. stretch-corrected, fiducial rise-time of 17.02^{+0.18}_{-0.28}(stat) days. the measured rise-time differs from an earlier finding by the snls(conley et al. 2006) due to the use of different sn ia templates. we compare itto nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the earlypart of the lightcurve of sne ia up to z=1. we search for variations amongdifferent populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the samplein stretch. bright and slow decliners (s&gt;1.0) have consistent stretch-correctedrise-times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0); they areshorter by 0.57^{+0.47}_{-0.50} (stat) days. subluminous sne ia (here definedas objects with s&lt;0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with arise-time of 18.03^{+0.81}_{-1.37} (stat) days. we study several systematicbiases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect theaverage rise-time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. basedon our results, we estimate that subluminous sne ia are powered by 0.05-0.35solar masses of radioactive nickel synthesized in the explosion. ourconclusions are the same for the single-stretch and two-stretchparameterizations of the lightcurve.

1111.3473	search for neutrino emission from gamma-ray flaring blazars with the  antares telescope	the antares telescope is well-suited to detect neutrinos produced inastrophysical transient sources as it can observe a full hemisphere of the skyat all times with a high duty cycle. radio-loud active galactic nuclei withjets pointing almost directly towards the observer, the so-called blazars, areparticularly attractive potential neutrino point sources. the all-sky monitorlat on board the fermi satellite probes the variability of any given gamma-raybright blazar in the sky on time scales of hours to months. assuming hadronicmodels, a strong correlation between the gamma-ray and the neutrino fluxes isexpected. selecting a narrow time window on the assumed neutrino productionperiod can significantly reduce the background.  an unbinned method based on the minimization of a likelihood ratio wasapplied to a subsample of data collected in 2008 (61 days live time). bysearching for neutrinos during the high state periods of the agn light curve,the sensitivity to these sources was improved by about a factor of two withrespect to a standard time-integrated point source search. first results on thesearch for neutrinos associated with ten bright and variable fermi sources arepresented.

1111.6482	acoustic and optical variations during rapid downward motion episodes in  the deep north-western mediterranean sea	an acoustic doppler current profiler (adcp) was moored at the deep-sea siteof the antares neutrino telescope near toulon, france, thus providing a uniqueopportunity to compare high-resolution acoustic and optical observationsbetween 70 and 170 m above the sea bed at 2475 m. the adcp measured downwardvertical currents of magnitudes up to 0.03 m s-1 in late winter and earlyspring 2006. in the same period, observations were made of enhanced levels ofacoustic reflection, interpreted as suspended particles including zooplankton,by a factor of about 10 and of horizontal currents reaching 0.35 m s-1. theseobservations coincided with high light levels detected by the telescope,interpreted as increased bioluminescence. during winter 2006 deep dense-waterformation occurred in the ligurian subbasin, thus providing a possibleexplanation for these observations. however, the 10-20 days quasi-periodicepisodes of high levels of acoustic reflection, light and large verticalcurrents continuing into the summer are not direct evidence of this process. itis hypothesized that the main process allowing for suspended material to bemoved vertically later in the year is local advection, linked with topographicboundary current instabilities along the rim of the 'northern current'.

0710.3896	verifying the cosmological utility of type ia supernovae: implications  of a dispersion in the ultraviolet spectra	we analyze the mean rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) spectrum of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and its dispersion using high signal-to-noise keck-i/lris-bspectroscopy for a sample of 36 events at intermediate redshift (z=0.5)discovered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey(snls). we introduce a new method for removing host galaxy contamination in ourspectra, exploiting the comprehensive photometric coverage of the snls sne andtheir host galaxies, thereby providing the first quantitative view of the uvspectral properties of a large sample of distant sne ia. although the mean snia spectrum has not evolved significantly over the past 40% of cosmic history,precise evolutionary constraints are limited by the absence of a comparablesample of high quality local spectra. within the high-redshift sample, wediscover significant uv spectral variations and exclude dust extinction as theprimary cause by examining trends with the optical sn color. althoughprogenitor metallicity may drive some of these trends, the variations we seeare much larger than predicted in recent models and do not follow expectedpatterns. an interesting new result is a variation seen in the wavelength ofselected uv features with phase. we also demonstrate systematic differences inthe sn ia spectral features with sn light curve width in both the uv and theoptical. we show that these intrinsic variations could represent a statisticallimitation in the future use of high-redshift sne ia for precision cosmology.we conclude that further detailed studies are needed, both locally and atmoderate redshift where the rest-frame uv can be studied precisely, in orderthat future missions can confidently be planned to fully exploit sne ia ascosmological probes [abridged].

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1209.1502	the silicon micro-strip detector plane for the loft/wide field monitor	the main objective of the wide field monitor (wfm) on the loft mission is toprovide unambiguous detection of the high-energy sources in a large field ofview, in order to support science operations of the loft primary instrument,the lad. the monitor will also provide by itself a large number of results onthe timing and spectral behaviour of hundreds of galactic compact objects,active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. the wfm is based on the codedaperture concept where a position sensitive detector records the shadow of amask projected by the celestial sources. the proposed wfm detector plane, basedon double sided micro-strip silicon detectors (dssd), will allow proper2-dimensional recording of the projected shadows. indeed the positioning of thephoton interaction in the detector with equivalent fine resolution in bothdirections insures the best imaging capability compatible with the allocatedbudgets for this telescope on loft. we will describe here the overallconfiguration of this 2d-wfm and the design and characteristics of the dssddetector plane including its imaging and spectral performances. we will alsopresent a number of simulated results discussing the advantages that thisconfiguration offers to loft. a dssd-based wfm will in particular reducesignificantly the source confusion experienced by the wfm in crowded regions ofthe sky like the galactic center and will in general increase the observatoryscience capability of the mission.

1212.2392	the ultra-long gamma-ray burst 111209a: the collapse of a blue  supergiant?	we present optical, x-ray and gamma-ray observations of grb 111209a, at aredshift of z = 0.677. we show that this event was active in its prompt phasefor about 25000 seconds, making it the longest burst ever observed. this rareevent could have been detected up to z ~ 1.4. compared to other long grbs, grb111209a is a clear outlier in the energy-fluence and duration plane. thehigh-energy prompt emission shows no sign of a strong black body component, asexpected if the event was caused by a tidal disruption event or a supernovashock breakout. given the extreme longevity of this event, and a lack of asupernova signature, we propose that grb 111209a is a relatively rare stellarcollapse of a low metallicity blue super giant star. only this progenitor cansupply mass to the central engine over a duration of thousands of seconds.hence, grb 111209a could have more in common with population iii stellarexplosions, rather than normal long gamma ray bursts.

0712.4149	uv/optical detections of candidate tidal disruption events by galex and  cfhtls	we present two luminous uv/optical flares from the nuclei of apparentlyinactive early-type galaxies at z=0.37 and 0.33 that have the radiativeproperties of a flare from the tidal disruption of a star. in this paper wereport the second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the uv by thegalex deep imaging survey, and present simultaneous optical light curves fromthe cfhtls deep imaging survey for both uv flares. the first few months of theuv/optical light curves are well fitted with the canonical t^(-5/3) power-lawdecay predicted for emission from the fallback of debris from a tidallydisrupted star. chandra acis x-ray observations during the flares detect softx-ray sources with t_bb= (2-5) x 10^5 k or gamma &gt; 3 and place limits on hardx-ray emission from an underlying agn down to l_x (2-10 kev) &lt;~ 10^41 ergs/s.blackbody fits to the uv/optical spectral energy distributions of the flaresindicate peak flare luminosities of &gt; 10^44-10^45 ergs/s. the temperature,luminosity, and light curves of both flares are in excellent agreement withemission from a tidally disrupted main sequence star onto a central black holeof several times 10^7 msun. the observed detection rate of our search over ~2.9 deg^2 of galex deep imaging survey data spanning from 2003 to 2007 isconsistent with tidal disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and weuse these models to make predictions for the detection rates of the nextgeneration of optical synoptic surveys.

1308.1001	the diversity of progenitors and emission mechanisms for ultra-long  bursts	grb 111209a is the longest ever recorded burst. this burst was detected byswift and konus-wind, and we obtained too time from xmm-newton as well asprompt data from tarot. we made a common reduction using data from theseinstruments together with other ones. this allows for the first time a precisestudy at high signal-to-noise ratio of the prompt to afterglow transition. weshow that several mechanisms are responsible of this phase. in its promptphase, we show that its duration is longer than 20 000 seconds. this, combinedwith the fact that the burst fluence is among the top 5% of what is observedfor other events, makes this event extremely energetic. we discuss the possibleprogenitors that could explain the extreme duration properties of this burst aswell as its spectral properties. we present evidences that this burst belong toa new, previously unidentified, class of grbs. the most probable progenitor ofthis new class is a low metalicity blue super-giant star. we show thatselection effects could prevent the detection of other bursts at largerredshift and conclude that this kind of event is intrinsically rare in thelocal universe. the afterglow presents similar features to other normal longgrbs and a late rebrightening in the optical wavelengths, as observed in otherlong grbs. a broad band sed from radio to x-rays at late times does not showsignificant deviations from the expected standard fireball afterglowsynchrotron emission.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

1506.07354	search for muon-neutrino emission from gev and tev gamma-ray flaring  blazars using five years of data of the antares telescope	the antares telescope is well-suited for detecting astrophysical transientneutrino sources as it can observe a full hemisphere of the sky at all timeswith a high duty cycle. the background due to atmospheric particles can bedrastically reduced, and the point-source sensitivity improved, by selecting anarrow time window around possible neutrino production periods. blazars, beingradio-loud active galactic nuclei with their jets pointing almost directlytowards the observer, are particularly attractive potential neutrino pointsources, since they are among the most likely sources of the very high-energycosmic rays. neutrinos and gamma rays may be produced in hadronic interactionswith the surrounding medium. moreover, blazars generally show high timevariability in their light curves at different wavelengths and on various timescales. this paper presents a time-dependent analysis applied to a selection offlaring gamma-ray blazars observed by the fermi/lat experiment and by tevcherenkov telescopes using five years of antares data taken from 2008 to 2012.the results are compatible with fluctuations of the background. upper limits onthe neutrino fluence have been produced and compared to the measured gamma-rayspectral energy distribution.

1508.01180	optical and x-ray early follow-up of antares neutrino alerts	high-energy neutrinos could be produced in the interaction of charged cosmicrays with matter or radiation surrounding astrophysical sources. even with therecent detection of extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos by the icecubeexperiment, no astrophysical neutrino source has yet been discovered. transientsources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, or active galacticnuclei are promising candidates. multi-messenger programs offer a uniqueopportunity to detect these transient sources. by combining the informationprovided by the antares neutrino telescope with information coming from otherobservatories, the probability of detecting a source is enhanced, allowing thepossibility of identifying a neutrino progenitor from a single detected event.a method based on optical and x-ray follow-ups of high-energy neutrino alertshas been developed within the antares collaboration. this program, denoted astatoo, triggers a network of robotic optical telescopes (tarot and rotse) andthe swift-xrt with a delay of only a few seconds after a neutrino detection,and is therefore well-suited to search for fast transient sources. to identifyan optical or x-ray counterpart to a neutrino signal, the images provided bythe follow-up observations are analysed with dedicated pipelines. a total of 42alerts with optical and 7 alerts with x-ray images taken with a maximum delayof 24 hours after the neutrino trigger have been analysed. no optical or x-raycounterparts associated to the neutrino triggers have been found, and upperlimits on transient source magnitudes have been derived. the probability toreject the gamma-ray burst origin hypothesis has been computed for each alert.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

0805.3983	clustering of supernova ia host galaxies	for the first time the cross-correlation between type ia supernova hostgalaxies and surrounding field galaxies is measured using the supernova legacysurvey sample. over the z=0.2 to 0.9 redshift range we find that supernovahosts are correlated an average of 60% more strongly than similarly selectedfield galaxies over the 3-100 arcsec range and about a factor of 3 morestrongly below 10 arcsec. the correlation errors are empirically establishedwith a jackknife analysis of the four snls fields. the hosts are morecorrelated than the field at a significance of 99% in the fitted amplitude andslope, with the point-by-point difference of the two correlation functionshaving a reduced $\chi^2$ for 8 degrees of freedom of 4.3, which has aprobability of random occurrence of less than 3x10^{-5}. the correlation angleis 1.5+/-0.5 arcsec, which deprojects to a fixed co-moving correlation lengthof approximately 6.5+/- 2/h mpc. weighting the field galaxies with the mass andstar formation rate supernova frequencies of the simple a+b model produces goodagreement with the observed clustering. we conclude that these supernovaclustering differences are primarily the expected outcome of the dependence ofsupernova rates on galaxy masses and stellar populations with their clusteringenvironment.

astro-ph;0510857	photometric selection of high-redshift type ia supernovae	we present a method for selecting high-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia)located via rolling sn searches. the technique, using both color and magnitudeinformation of events from only 2-3 epochs of multi-band real-time photometry,is able to discriminate between sne ia and core collapse sne. furthermore, forthe sne ia, the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase and light-curveparameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. wedemonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of sne iaand core-collapse sne, where the selection method effectively rejects mostcore-collapse sne while retaining sne ia. we also apply the selection code toreal-time data acquired as part of the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey (snls). during the period may 2004 to january 2005 in the snls,440 sn candidates were discovered of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopicallyas sne ia and 15 as core-collapse events. for this test dataset, the selectiontechnique correctly identifies 100% of the identified sne ii as non-sne ia withonly a 1-2% false rejection rate. the predicted parameterization of the sne iahas a precision of |delta_z|/(1+z_spec)&lt;0.09 in redshift, and +/- 2-3rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planningspectroscopic follow-up observations. we also investigate any bias introducedby this selection method on the ability of surveys such as snls to measurecosmological parameters (e.g., w and omega matter), and find any effect to benegligible.

astro-ph;0605455	rates and properties of type ia supernovae as a function of mass and  star-formation in their host galaxies	(abridged) we show that type ia supernovae (sne ia) are formed within bothvery young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on thestellar mass and mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of their host galaxies.models where the sn ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass areruled out with 99% confidence. our analysis is based on 100spectroscopically-confirmed sne ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,all from the supernova legacy survey (snls) and distributed over 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.75.using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and sfrs for the sn iahost galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions withthe galaxy spectral synthesis code, pegase.2. we show that the sn ia rate perunit mass is proportional to the specific sfr of the parent galaxies -- morevigorously star-forming galaxies host more sne ia per unit stellar mass,broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing sn ia rate in later-type galaxiesseen in the local universe. following earlier suggestions for a simple"two-component" model approximating the sn ia rate, we find bivariate lineardependencies of the sn ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean sfrs ofthe host systems. we also demonstrate a dependence of distant sn ia light-curveshapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observedlocally. passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially hostfaster-declining/dimmer sne ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are onlyfound in systems with ongoing star-formation. we model the light-curve widthdistribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and anold component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0612069	ultraviolet detection of the tidal disruption of a star by a  supermassive black hole	a supermassive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy will be revealed when astar passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces and a flare ofradiation is emitted by the stream of stellar debris that plunges into theblack hole. since common active galactic nuclei have accreting black holes thatcan also produce flares, a convincing demonstration that a stellar tidaldisruption has occurred generally begins with a ``normal'' galaxy that has noevidence of prior nuclear activity. here we report a luminous uv flare from anelliptical galaxy at z = 0.37 in the groth field of the galex deep imagingsurvey that has no evidence of a seyfert nucleus from optical spectroscopy andx-ray imaging obtained during the flare. multiwavelength data collected at thetime of the event, and for 2 years following, allow us to constrain, for thefirst time, the spectral energy distribution of a candidate tidal disruptionflare from optical through x-rays. the luminosity and temperature of theradiation and the decay curve of the flare are in excellent agreement withtheoretical predictions for the tidal disruption of a star, and provide thestrongest empirical evidence for a stellar disruption event to date.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.
