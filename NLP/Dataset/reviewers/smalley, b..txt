0901.4705	discovery and characterization of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass  planet transiting a solar-type star	we report the discovery of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass planettransiting every 3.3610060 +0.0000022-0.0000035 days a mildly metal-poorsolar-type star of magnitude v=11.9. a combined analysis of the waspphotometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocitiesyield a planetary mass m_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 m_jup and radius r_p = 1.224+0.051-0.052 r_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. themass and radius for the host star are m_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 m_sun and r_s =0.870 +0.025-0.036 r_sun. the non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidalheating ~1 gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.high-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measurea sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis beta = 11+14-18 deg. in addition to similar published measurements, this result favors adominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetarydisk.

0908.0189	the main-sequence rotation-colour relation in the coma berenices open  cluster	we present the results of a photometric survey of rotation rates in the comaberenices (melotte 111) open cluster, using data obtained as part of thesuperwasp exoplanetary transit-search programme. the goal of the coma surveywas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence f, g and k dwarfs inthis intermediate-age (~600 myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to whichmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. we find atight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and j-k colour with aroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. the relation is similar to thatseen among f, g and k stars in the hyades. such strong convergence can only beexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from areservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. we conclude thatthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinningradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter thanthe cluster age, and that from the age of coma onward, stars rotate effectivelyas solid bodies. the existence of a tight relationship between stellar mass androtation period at a given age supports the use of stellar rotation period asan age indicator in f, g and k stars of hyades age and older. we demonstratethat individual stellar ages can be determined within the coma population withan internal precision of order 9 percent (rms), using a standard magneticbraking law in which rotation period increases with the square root of stellarage. we find that a slight modification to the magnetic-braking power law, pproportional to t^0.56, yields rotational and asteroseismological ages in goodagreement for the sun and other stars of solar age for which p-mode studies andphotometric rotation periods have been published.

0908.1553	wasp-17b: an ultra-low density planet in a probable retrograde orbit	we report the discovery of the transiting giant planet wasp-17b, theleast-dense planet currently known. it is 1.6 saturn masses but 1.5-2 jupiterradii, giving a density of 6-14 per cent that of jupiter. wasp-17b is in a3.7-day orbit around a sub-solar metallicity, v = 11.6, f6 star. preliminarydetection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect suggests that wasp-17b is in aretrograde orbit (lambda ~ -150 deg), indicative of a violent history involvingplanet-planet or star-planet scattering.  wasp-17b's bloated radius could be due to tidal heating resulting from recentor ongoing tidal circularisation of an eccentric orbit, such as the highlyeccentric orbits that typically result from scattering interactions. it willthus be important to determine more precisely the current orbital eccentricityby further high-precision radial velocity measurements or by timing thesecondary eclipse, both to reduce the uncertainty on the planet's radius and totest tidal-heating models. owing to its low surface gravity, wasp-17b'satmosphere has the largest scale height of any known planet, making it a goodtarget for transmission spectroscopy.

1001.0403	wasp-19b: the shortest period transiting exoplanet yet discovered	we report on the discovery of a new extremely short period transitingextrasolar planet, wasp-19b. the planet has mass mpl = 1.15 \pm 0.08 mj, radiusrpl = 1.31 \pm 0.06 rj, and orbital period p = 0.7888399 \pm 0.0000008 days.through spectroscopic analysis, we determine the host star to be a slightlysuper-solar metallicity ([m/h] = 0.1 \pm 0.1 dex) g-dwarf with teff = 5500 \pm100 k. in addition, we detect periodic, sinusoidal flux variations in the lightcurve which are used to derive a rotation period for the star of prot = 10.5\pm 0.2 days. the relatively short stellar rotation period suggests that eitherwasp-19 is somewhat young (~ 600 myr old) or tidal interactions between the twobodies have caused the planet to spiral inward over its lifetime resulting inthe spin-up of the star. due to the detection of the rotation period, thissystem has the potential to place strong constraints on the stellar tidalquality factor, q's, if a more precise age is determined.

1002.4268	accurate fundamental parameters for 23 bright solar-type stars	we combine results from interferometry, asteroseismology and spectroscopy todetermine accurate fundamental parameters of 23 bright solar-type stars, fromspectral type f5 to k2 and luminosity classes iii to v. for some stars we canuse direct techniques to determine the mass, radius, luminosity and effectivetemperature, and we compare with indirect methods that rely on photometriccalibrations or spectroscopic analyses. we use the asteroseismic informationavailable in the literature to infer an indirect mass with an accuracy of 4-15percent. from indirect methods we determine luminosity and radius to 3 percent.for teff we find a slight offset of -40+-20 k between the spectroscopic methodand the direct method, meaning the spectroscopic temperatures are too high.  from the spectroscopic analysis we determine the detailed chemicalcomposition for 13 elements, including li, c and o. we find no significantoffset between the spectroscopic surface gravity and the value from combiningasteroseismology with radius estimates. from the spectroscopy we also determinevsini and we present a new calibration of macro- and microturbulence. from thecomparison between the results from the direct and spectroscopic methods weclaim that we can determine teff, log g, and [fe/h] with absolute accuracies of80 k, 0.08 dex, and 0.07 dex. the indirect methods are important to obtainreliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of relatively faint stars wheninterferometry cannot be used. our study is the first to compare direct andindirect methods for a large sample of stars, and we conclude that indirectmethods are valid, although slight corrections may be needed.

1004.1514	wasp-22 b: a transiting "hot jupiter" planet in a hierarchical triple  system	we report the discovery of a transiting planet orbiting the star tyc6446-326-1. the star, wasp-22, is a moderately bright (v=12.0) solar-type star(teff = 6000 +/- 100 k, [fe/h] = -0.05 +/- 0.08). the lightcurve of the starobtained with the wasp-south instrument shows periodic transit-like featureswith a depth of about 1 and a duration of 0.14 days. the presence of atransit-like feature in the lightcurve is confirmed using z-band photometryobtained with faulkes telescope south. high resolution spectroscopy obtainedwith the coralie and harps spectrographs confirm the presence of a planetarymass companion with an orbital period of 3.533 days in a near-circular orbit.from a combined analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data assumingthat the star is a typical main-sequence star we estimate that the planet has amass m_p = 0.56 +/- 0.02 m_jup and a radius r_p = 1.12 +/- 0.04 r_jup. inaddition, there is a linear trend of 40 m/s/yr in the radial velocitiesmeasured over 16 months, from which we infer the presence of a third body witha long period orbit in this system. the companion may be a low mass m-dwarf, awhite dwarf or a second planet.

1004.4551	line-profile tomography of exoplanet transits -- ii. a gas-giant planet  transiting a rapidly-rotating a5 star	most of our knowledge of extrasolar planets rests on precise radial-velocitymeasurements, either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetaryorigin of photometric transit signals. this has limited our exploration of theparameter space of exoplanet hosts to solar- and later-type, sharp-lined stars.here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to includehot, fast-rotating stars. planet-like transits have previously been reported inthe lightcurve obtained by the superwasp survey of the a5 star hd15082(wasp-33; v=8.3, v sin i = 86 km/sec). here we report further photometry andtime-series spectroscopy through three separate transits, which we use toconfirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1.22d inorbit around hd15082. from the photometry and the properties of the planetsignal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit wedirectly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of itsorbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of thestar. this kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planetsaround a whole new class of young, early-type stars, hence under differentphysical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than insharp-lined late-type stars. the reflex orbital motion of the star caused bythe transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 jupitermasses on the planet. we also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar massin the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. inhd 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radialpulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. this raises theintriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite oramplify the pulsations in such stars.

1009.1919	the exotic eclipsing nucleus of the ring planetary nebula suwt2	suwt2 is a planetary nebula (pn) consisting of a bright ionized thin ringseen nearly edge-on. it has a bright (v=12) central star, too cool to ionizethe pn, which we discovered to be an eclipsing binary. a spectrum from iue didnot reveal a uv source. we present extensive ground-based photometry andspectroscopy of the central binary collected over the ensuing two decades,resulting in the determination that the orbital period of the eclipsing pair is4.9 d, and consists of two nearly identical a1 v stars, each of mass ~2.7m_sun. the physical parameters of the a stars, combined with evolutionarytracks, show that both are in the short-lived "blue-hook" evolutionary phasethat occurs between the main sequence and the hertzsprung gap, and that the ageof the system is about 520 myr. one puzzle is that the stars' rotationalvelocities are different from each other, and considerably slower thansynchronous with the orbital period. it is possible that the center-of-massvelocity of the eclipsing pair is varying with time, suggesting that there isan unseen third orbiting body in the system. we propose a scenario in which thesystem began as a hierarchical triple, consisting of a ~2.9 m_sun star orbitingthe close pair of a stars. upon reaching the agb stage, the primary engulfedthe pair into a common envelope, leading to a rapid contraction of the orbitand catastrophic ejection of the envelope into the orbital plane. in thispicture, the exposed core of the initial primary is now a white dwarf of ~0.7m_sun, orbiting the eclipsing pair, which has already cooled below thedetectability possible by iue at our derived distance of 2.3 kpc and areddening of e(b-v)=0.40. the suwt2 system may be destined to perish as a typeia supernova.

1012.4373	regularities in frequency spacings of delta scuti stars: the kepler star  kic 9700322	in the faint star kic 9700322 observed by the kepler satellite, 76frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29000 ppm were detected. the twodominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 c/d (113.3 and 145.5 \mu hz),interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number ofcombination frequencies. a small additional modulation with a 0.16 c/dfrequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of thestar. the corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrumfrom which v sin i = 19 \pm 1 km/s is obtained. the analysis of the spectrumshows that the star is one of the coolest {\delta} sct variables. we alsodetermine teff = 6700 \pm 100 k and log g = 3.7 \pm 0.1, compatible with theobserved frequencies of the radial modes. normal solar abundances are found. an\ell = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separationconsistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. a remarkableresult is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to anamplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against mostforms of nonradial pulsation. the frequency spectrum of this star emphasizesthe need for caution in interpreting low frequencies in {\delta} sct stars asindependent gravity modes. a low frequency peak at 2.7763 c/d in kic 9700322is, in fact, the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and isrepeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the twodominant modes. the relative phases of the combination frequencies show astrong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this resultis not clear.

1102.3599	kepler photometry of kic 10661783: a binary star with total eclipses and  delta scuti pulsations	we present kepler satellite photometry of kic 10661783, a short-period binarystar system which shows total eclipses and multi-periodic delta scutipulsations. a frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve revealsat least 68 frequencies of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsationmodes. the main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution withinthe 27-day short-cadence light curve. most of the variability signal lies inthe frequency range 18 to 31 c/d, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. oneharmonic term (2.f) and a few combination frequencies (f_i+f_j) have beendetected. from a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase we assign thepulsations to the primary star in the system. the pulsations were removed fromthe short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using thewilson-devinney code. we are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residualeffects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessingin the light curve model. a model where the secondary star fills its roche lobeis favoured, which means that kic 10661783 can be classified as an oea system.further photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow the masses andradii of the two stars to be measured to high precision and hundreds of deltascuti pulsation frequencies to be resolved. this could lead to uniqueconstraints on theoretical models of delta scuti stars, if the evolutionaryhistory of kic 10661783 can be accounted for.

1103.3599	are falling planets spinning up their host stars?	we investigate the effects of tidal interactions on the planetary orbits andstellar spin rates of the wasp-18 and wasp-19 planetary systems using a forwardintegration scheme. by fitting the resulting evolutionary tracks to theobserved eccentricity, semi-major axis and stellar rotation rate, and to thestellar age derived from isochronal fitting, we are able to place constraintson the stellar and planetary reduced tidal quality factors, q's and q'p. wefind that for wasp-18, log(q's)=8.21+0.90-0.52 and log(q'p)=7.77+1.54-1.25,implying a system age of 0.579+0.305-0.250 gyr. for wasp-19 we obtain values oflog(q's)=6.47+2.19-0.95 and log(q'p)=6.75+1.86-1.77, suggesting a system age of1.60+2.84-0.79 gyr and a remaining lifetime of 0.0067+1.1073-0.0061 gyr. weinvestigate a range of evolutionary histories consistent with these results andthe observed parameters for both systems, and find that the majority imply thatthe stars have been spun up through tidal interactions as the planets spiraltowards their roche limits. we examine a variety of evidence for wasp-19 a'sage, both for the value above and for a younger age consistent withgyrochronology, and conclude that the older estimate is more likely to becorrect. this suggests that wasp-19 b might be in the final stages of thespiral-in process, although we are unable to rule out the possibility that ithas a substantial remaining lifetime.

1107.0335	the kepler characterization of the variability among a- and f-type  stars. i. general overview	the kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data withmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of a-f type stars. we present a firstgeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of a-f type stars asobserved in the kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate a-f typestars. we propose three main groups to describe the observed variety inpulsating a-f type stars: gamma dor, delta sct, and hybrid stars. we assign 63%of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part asrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectraltype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has beenobserved before. we characterize for the first time a large number of a-f typestars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,and typical pulsation amplitudes. the majority of hybrid stars show frequencieswith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma dor and delta sct range, alsobetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. we findindications for the existence of delta sct and gamma dor stars beyond the edgesof the current observational instability strips. the hybrid stars occupy theentire region within the delta sct and gamma dor instability strips, andbeyond. non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. thelocation of gamma dor and delta sct classes in the (teff,logg)-diagram has beenextended. we investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma dor and delta sctstars. our results suggest a revision of the current observational instabilitystrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplementthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.

1107.4986	discovery of a stripped red giant core in a bright eclipsing binary  system	we have identified a star in the wasp archive photometry with an unusuallightcurve due to the total eclipse of a small, hot star by an apparentlynormal a-type star and with an orbital period of only 0.668d. from an analysisof the wasp lightcurve together with v-band and i_c-band photometry of theeclipse and a spectroscopic orbit for the a-type star we estimate that thecompanion star has a mass of (0.23+-0.03)msun and a radius of (0.33+-0.01)rsun,assuming that the a-type star is a main-sequence star with the metalicityappropriate for a thick-disk star. the effective temperature of the companionis (13400+-1200)k from which we infer a luminosity of (3+-1)lsun. from acomparison of these parameters to various models we conclude that the companionis most likely to be the remnant of a red giant star that has been veryrecently stripped of its outer layers by mass transfer onto the a-type star. inthis scenario, the companion is currently in a shell hydrogen-burning phase ofits evolution, evolving at nearly constant luminosity to hotter effectivetemperatures prior to ceasing hydrogen burning and fading to become a low-masswhite dwarf composed of helium (he-wd). the system will then resemble thepre-he-wd/he-wd companions to a-type and b-type stars recently identified fromtheir kepler satellite lightcurves (koi-74, koi-81 and kic10657664). this newlydiscovered binary offers the opportunity to study the evolution of a strippedred giant star through the pre-he-wd stage in great detail.

1201.2789	the trappist survey of southern transiting planets. i. thirty eclipses  of the ultra-short period planet wasp-43 b	we present twenty-three transit light curves and seven occultation lightcurves for the ultra-short period planet wasp-43 b, in addition to eight newmeasurements of the radial velocity of the star. thanks to this extensive dataset, we improve significantly the parameters of the system. notably, thelargely improved precision on the stellar density (2.41+-0.08 rho_sun) combinedwith constraining the age to be younger than a hubble time allows us to breakthe degeneracy of the stellar solution mentioned in the discovery paper. theresulting stellar mass and size are 0.717+-0.025 m_sun and 0.667+-0.011 r_sun.our deduced physical parameters for the planet are 2.034+-0.052 m_jup and1.036+-0.019 r_jup. taking into account its level of irradiation, the highdensity of the planet favors an old age and a massive core. our deduced orbitaleccentricity, 0.0035(-0.0025,+0.0060), is consistent with a fully circularizedorbit. we detect the emission of the planet at 2.09 microns at better than11-sigma, the deduced occultation depth being 1560+-140 ppm. our detection ofthe occultation at 1.19 microns is marginal (790+-320 ppm) and moreobservations are needed to confirm it. we place a 3-sigma upper limit of 850ppm on the depth of the occultation at ~0.9 microns. together, these resultsstrongly favor a poor redistribution of the heat to the night-side of theplanet, and marginally favor a model with no day-side temperature inversion.

1202.0686	discovery of a stripped red giant core in a bright eclipsing binary star	we report the serendipitous discovery from wasp archive photometry of abinary star in which an apparently normal a-type star (j0247-25a) eclipses asmaller, hotter subdwarf star (j0247-25b). the kinematics of j0247-25a showthat it is a blue-straggler member of the galactic thick-disk. we presentfollow-up photometry and spectroscopy from which we derive approximate valuesfor the mass, radius and luminosity for j0247-25b assuming that j0247-25a hasthe mass appropriate for a normal thick-disk star. we find that the propertiesof j0247-25b are well matched by models for a red giant stripped of its outerlayers and currently in a shell hydrogen-burning stage. in this scenario,j0247-25b will go on to become a low mass white dwarf (m~0.25 solar masses)composed mostly of helium. j0247-25b can be studied in much greater detail thanthe handful of pre helium white dwarfs (pre-he-wd) identified to-date. theseresults have been published by maxted et al., 2011. we also present apreliminary analysis of more recent observations of j0247-25 with the uvesspectrograph, from which we derive much improved masses for both stars in thebinary. we find that both stars are more massive than expected and thatj0247-25a rotates sub-synchronously by a factor of about 2. we also presentlightcurves for 5 new eclipsing pre-he-wd subsequently identified from the wasparchive photometry, 4 of which have mass estimates for the subdwarf companionbased on a pair of radial velocity measurements.

1203.0611	accurate parameters of 93 solar-type kepler targets	we present a detailed spectroscopic study of 93 solar-type stars that aretargets of the nasa/kepler mission and provide detailed chemical composition ofeach target. we find that the overall metallicity is well-represented by felines. relative abundances of light elements (cno) and alpha-elements aregenerally higher for low-metallicity stars. our spectroscopic analysis benefitsfrom the accurately measured surface gravity from the asteroseismic analysis ofthe kepler light curves. the log g parameter is known to better than 0.03 dexand is held fixed in the analysis. we compare our teff determination with arecent colour calibration of v-k (tycho v magnitude minus 2mass ks magnitude)and find very good agreement and a scatter of only 80 k, showing that for othernearby kepler targets this index can be used. the asteroseismic log g valuesagree very well with the classical determination using fe1-fe2 balance,although we find a small systematic offset of 0.08 dex (asteroseismic log gvalues are lower). the abundance patterns of metals, alpha elements, and thelight elements (cno) show that a simple scaling by [fe/h] is adequate torepresent the metallicity of the stars, except for the stars with metallicitybelow -0.3, where alpha-enhancement becomes important. however, this is onlyimportant for a very small fraction of the kepler sample. we thereforerecommend that a simple scaling with [fe/h] be employed in the asteroseismicanalyses of large ensembles of solar-type stars.

0711.0126	wasp-3b: a strongly-irradiated transiting gas-giant planet	we report the discovery of wasp-3b, the third transiting exoplanet to bediscovered by the wasp and sophie collaboration. wasp-3b transits its host starusno-b1.0 1256-0285133 every 1.846834+-0.000002 days. our high precisionradial-velocity measurements present a variation with amplitude characteristicof a planetary-mass companion and in-phase with the light-curve. adaptiveoptics imaging shows no evidence for nearby stellar companions, andline-bisector analysis excludes faint, unresolved binarity and stellar activityas the cause of the radial-velocity variations. we make a preliminaryspectroscopic analysis of the host star finding it to have teff = 6400+-100 kand log g = 4.25+-0.05 which suggests it is most likely an unevolved mainsequence star of spectral type f7-8v. our simultaneous modelling of the transitphotometry and reflex motion of the host leads us to derive a mass of 1.76+0.08 -0.14 m_j and radius 1.31 +0.07-0.14 r_j for wasp-3b. the proximity andrelative temperature of the host star suggests that wasp-3b is one of thehottest exoplanets known, and thus has the potential to place stringentconstraints on exoplanet atmospheric models.

1203.4971	rossiter-mclaughlin effect measurements for wasp-16, wasp-25 and wasp-31	we present new measurements of the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect for threewasp planetary systems, wasp-16, wasp-25 and wasp-31, from a combined analysisof their complete sets of photometric and spectroscopic data. we find a lowamplitude rm effect for wasp-16 (teff = 5700 \pm 150k), suggesting that thestar is a slow rotator and thus of an advanced age, and obtain a projectedalignment angle of lambda = -4.2 degrees +11.0 -13.9. for wasp-25 (teff =5750\pm100k) we detect a projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 14.6 degrees\pm6.7. wasp-31 (teff = 6300\pm100k) is found to be well-aligned, with aprojected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 2.8degrees \pm3.1. a circular orbit isconsistent with the data for all three systems, in agreement with theirrespective discovery papers. we consider the results for these systems in thecontext of the ensemble of rm measurements made to date. we find that whilstwasp-16 fits the hypothesis of winn et al. (2010) that 'cool' stars (teff &lt;6250k) are preferentially aligned, wasp-31 has little impact on the proposedtrend. we bring the total distribution of the true spin-orbit alignment angle,psi, up to date, noting that recent results have improved the agreement withthe theory of fabrycky &amp; tremaine (2007) at mid-range angles. we also suggest anew test for judging misalignment using the bayesian information criterion,according to which wasp-25 b's orbit should be considered to be aligned.

1210.2329	wasp-54b, wasp-56b and wasp-57b: three new sub-jupiter mass planets from  superwasp	we present three newly discovered sub-jupiter mass planets from the superwaspsurvey: wasp-54b is a heavily bloated planet of mass 0.636$^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$\mj and radius 1.653$^{+0.090}_{-0.083}$ \rj. it orbits a f9 star, evolving offthe main sequence, every 3.69 days. our mcmc fit of the system yields aslightly eccentric orbit ($e=0.067^{+0.033}_{-0.025}$) for wasp-54b. weinvestigated further the veracity of our detection of the eccentric orbit forwasp-54b, and we find that it could be real. however, given the brightness ofwasp-54 v=10.42 magnitudes, we encourage observations of a secondary eclipse todraw robust conclusions on both the orbital eccentricity and the thermalstructure of the planet. wasp-56b and wasp-57b have masses of0.571$^{+0.034}_{-0.035}$ \mj and $0.672^{+0.049}_{-0.046}$ \mj, respectively;and radii of $1.092^{+0.035}_{-0.033}$ \rj for wasp-56b and$0.916^{+0.017}_{-0.014}$ \rj for wasp-57b. they orbit main sequence stars ofspectral type g6 every 4.67 and 2.84 days, respectively. wasp-56b and wasp-57bshow no radius anomaly and a high density possibly implying a large core ofheavy elements; possibly as high as $\sim$50 m$_{\oplus}$ in the case ofwasp-57b. however, the composition of the deep interior of exoplanets remainstill undetermined. thus, more exoplanet discoveries such as the ones presentedin this paper, are needed to understand and constrain giant planets' physicalproperties.

1210.5585	spitzer 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron full-orbit lightcurves of wasp-18	we present new lightcurves of the massive hot jupiter system wasp-18 obtainedwith the spitzer spacecraft covering the entire orbit at 3.6 micron and 4.5micron. these lightcurves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase ofthe thermal phase effect for wasp-18b. we find that our results for the thermalphase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01% by systematic noisesources of unknown origin. at this level of accuracy we find that the thermalphase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondaryeclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs atthe same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 degrees at 3.6 micron andto within about 10 degrees at 4.5 micron. the shape and amplitude of thethermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within theatmosphere of the planet. we also perform a separate analysis to determine thesystem geometry by fitting a lightcurve model to the data covering theoccultation and the transit. the secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6micron and 4.5 micron are in good agreement with previous measurements andimply a very low albedo for wasp-18b. the parameters of the system (masses,radii, etc.) derived from our analysis are in also good agreement with thosefrom previous studies, but with improved precision. we use new high-resolutionimaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocityto check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect ourresults. we find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution tothe flux at spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to wasp-18. we findthat there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linearephemeris greater than about 100 seconds over 3 years.

1210.5931	accurate spectroscopic parameters of wasp planet host stars	we have made a detailed spectral analysis of eleven wide angle search forplanets (wasp) planet host stars using high signal-to-noise (s/n) harpsspectra. our line list was carefully selected from the spectra of the sun andprocyon, and we made a critical evaluation of the atomic data. the spectrallines were measured using equivalent widths. the procedures were tested on thesun and procyon prior to be being used on the wasp stars. the effectivetemperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity weredetermined for all the stars. we show that abundances derived from high s/nspectra are likely to be higher than those obtained from low s/n spectra, asnoise can cause the equivalent width to be underestimated. we also show thatthere is a limit to the accuracy of stellar parameters that can be achieved,despite using high s/n spectra, and the average uncertainty in effectivetemperature, surface gravity, microturbulent velocity and metallicity is 83 k,0.11 dex, 0.11 km/s and 0.10 dex respectively.

1211.0810	wasp-52b, wasp-58b, wasp-59b, and wasp-60b: four new transiting close-in  giant planets	we present the discovery of four new transiting hot jupiters, detected mainlyfrom superwasp-north and sophie observations. these new planets, wasp-52b,wasp-58b, wasp-59b, and wasp-60b, have orbital periods ranging from 1.7 to 7.9days, masses between 0.46 and 0.94 m_jup, and radii between 0.73 and 1.49r_jup. their g1 to k5 dwarf host stars have v magnitudes in the range11.7-13.0. the depths of the transits are between 0.6 and 2.7%, depending onthe target. with their large radii, wasp-52b and 58b are new cases oflow-density, inflated planets, whereas wasp-59b is likely to have a large,dense core. wasp-60 shows shallow transits. in the case of wasp-52 we alsodetected the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly via time-resolved spectroscopy of atransit. we measured the sky-projected obliquity lambda = 24 (+17/-9) degrees,indicating that wasp-52b orbits in the same direction as its host star isrotating and that this prograde orbit is slightly misaligned with the stellarequator. these four new planetary systems increase our statistics on hotjupiters, and provide new targets for follow-up studies.

1211.3045	wasp-71b: a bloated hot jupiter in a 2.9-day, prograde orbit around an  evolved f8 star	we report the discovery by the wasp transit survey of a highly-irradiated,massive (2.242 +/- 0.080 mjup) planet which transits a bright (v = 10.6),evolved f8 star every 2.9 days. the planet, wasp-71b, is larger than jupiter(1.46 +/- 0.13 rjup), but less dense (0.71 +/- 0.16 {\rho}jup). we also reportspectroscopic observations made during transit with the coralie spectrograph,which allow us to make a highly-significant detection of therossiter-mclaughlin effect. we determine the sky-projected angle between thestellar-spin and planetary-orbit axes to be {\lambda} = 20.1 +/- 9.7 degrees,i.e. the system is 'aligned', according to the widely-used alignment criteriathat systems are regarded as misaligned only when {\lambda} is measured to begreater than 10 degrees with 3-{\sigma} confidence. wasp-71, with an effectivetemperature of 6059 +/- 98 k, therefore fits the previously observed patternthat only stars hotter than 6250 k are host to planets in misaligned orbits. weemphasise, however, that {\lambda} is merely the sky-projected obliquity angle;we are unable to determine whether the stellar-spin and planetary-orbit axesare misaligned along the line-of-sight. with a mass of 1.56 +/- 0.07 msun,wasp-71 was previously hotter than 6250 k, and therefore might have beensignificantly misaligned in the past. if so, the planetary orbit has beenrealigned, presumably through tidal interactions with the cooling star'sgrowing convective zone.

(2010), wasp-26bis predicted to host a thermal inversion. the brightness temperatures deducedfrom the eclipse depths are consistent with an isothermal atmosphere, althoughit is within the uncertainties that the planet may host a weak thermalinversion. the data are equally well fit by atmospheric models with or withouta thermal inversion. we find that variation in activity of solar-like starsdoes not change enough over the time-scales of months or years to change theinterpretation of the knutson et al.

1310.5654	three sub-jupiter-mass planets: wasp-69b &amp; wasp-84b transit active k  dwarfs and wasp-70ab transits the evolved primary of a g4+k3 binary	we report the discovery of the transiting exoplanets wasp-69b, wasp-70ab andwasp-84b, each of which orbits a bright star (v~10). wasp-69b is a bloatedsaturn-mass planet (0.26 m$_{\rm jup}$, 1.06 r$_{\rm jup}$) in a 3.868-d periodaround an active mid-k dwarf. we estimate a stellar age of 1 gyr from bothgyrochronological and age-activity relations, though an alternativegyrochronological relation suggests an age of 3 gyr. rosat detected x-rays at adistance of 60$\pm$27 arcsec from wasp-69. if the star is the source then theplanet could be undergoing mass-loss at a rate of ~10$^{12}$ g s$^{-1}$. thisis 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the evaporation rate estimated for hd209458b and hd 189733b, both of which have exhibited anomalously-largelyman-{\alpha} absorption during transit. wasp-70ab is a sub-jupiter-massplanet (0.59 m$_{\rm jup}$, 1.16r$_{\rm jup}$) in a 3.713-d orbit around theprimary of a spatially-resolved g4+k3 binary, with a separation of 3.3 arcsec($\geq$800 au). we exploit the binary nature of the system to construct a h-rdiagram, from which we estimate its age to be 9-10 gyr. wasp-84b is asub-jupiter-mass planet (0.69 m$_{\rm jup}$, 0.94 r$_{\rm jup}$) in an 8.523-dorbit around an active early-k dwarf. of the transiting planets discovered fromthe ground to date, wasp-84b has the third-longest period. from a combinationof gyrochronological and age-activity relations we estimate the age of wasp-84to be ~1 gyr.  for both the active stars wasp-69 and wasp-84 we find a modulation of theradial velocities with a period similar to the photometrically-determinedstellar rotation period. we fit the residuals with a low-order harmonic seriesand subtract the best fit from the rvs prior to deriving the system parameters.in each case the solution is essentially unchanged, with much less than a1-{\sigma} change to the planetary mass. we found...

1311.3482	absolute dimensions of detached eclipsing binaries. iii. the  metallic-lined system yz cassiopeiae	the bright binary system yz cassiopeiae is a remarkable laboratory forstudying the am phenomenon. it consists of a metallic-lined a2 star and an f2dwarf on a circular orbit, which undergo total and annular eclipses. we presentan analysis of 15 published light curves and 42 new high-quality echellespectra, resulting in measurements of the masses, radii, effective temperaturesand photospheric chemical abundances of the two stars. the masses and radii aremeasured to 0.5% precision: m_a = 2.263 +/- 0.012 msun, m_b = 1.325 +/- 0.007msun, r_a = 2.525 +/- 0.011 rsun and r_b = 1.331 +/- 0.006 rsun. we determinethe abundance of 20 elements for the primary star, of which all except scandiumare super-solar by up to 1 dex. the temperature of this star (9520 +/- 120 k)makes it one of the hottest am stars. we also measure the abundances of 25elements for its companion (teff = 6880 +/- 240 k), finding all to be solar orslightly above solar. the photospheric abundances of the secondary star shouldbe representative of the bulk composition of both stars. theoretical stellarevolutionary models are unable to match these properties: the masses, radii andtemperatures imply a half-solar chemical composition (z = 0.009 +/- 0.003) andan age of 490-550 myr. yz cas therefore presents a challenge to stellarevolutionary theory.

1403.4764	hd 54272, a classical lambda bootis star and gamma doradus pulsator	we detect the second known lambda bootis star (hd 54272) which exhibits gammadoradus-type pulsations. the star was formerly misidentified as a rr lyraevariable. the lambda bootis stars are a small group (only 2 per cent) of late bto early f-type, population i stars which show moderate to extreme (up to afactor 100) surface underabundances of most fe-peak elements and solarabundances of lighter elements (c, n, o, and s). the photometric data from thewide angle search for planets (wasp) and all sky automated survey (asas)projects were analysed. they have an overlapping time base of 1566 d and 2545d, respectively. six statistically significant peaks were identified (f1 =1.410 116 c/d, f2 = 1.283 986 c/d, f3 = 1.293 210 c/d, f4 = 1.536 662 c/d, f5 =1.157 22 c/d and f6 = 0.226 57 c/d). the spacing between f1 and f2, f1 and f4,f5 and f2 is almost identical. since the daily aliasing is very strong, theinterpretation of frequency spectra is somewhat ambiguous. from spectroscopicdata, we deduce a high rotational velocity (250+-25 km/s) and a metaldeficiency of about -0.8 to -1.1 dex compared to the sun. a comparison with thesimilar star, hr 8799, results in analogous pulsational characteristics butwidely different astrophysical parameters. since both are lambda bootis-typestars, the main mechanism of this phenomenon, selective accretion, may severelyinfluence gamma doradus-type pulsations.

1406.6942	wasp-117b: a 10-day-period saturn in an eccentric and misaligned orbit	we report the discovery of wasp-117b, the first planet with a period beyond10 days found by the wasp survey. the planet has a mass of $m_p= 0.2755 \pm0.0089 \, m_{j}$, a radius of $r_p= 1.021_{-0.065}^{+0.076}\, r_{j}$ and is inan eccentric ($ e= 0.302 \pm 0.023 $), $ 10.02165 \pm 0.00055 $~d orbit arounda main-sequence f9 star. the host star's brightness (v=10.15 mag) makeswasp-117 a good target for follow-up observations, and with a periastronplanetary equilibrium temperature of $t_{eq}= 1225_{-39}^{+36}$ k and a lowplanetary mean density ($\rho_p= 0.259_{-0.048}^{+0.054} \, \rho_{j}$) it isone of the best targets for transmission spectroscopy among planets withperiods around 10 days. from a measurement of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect,we infer a projected angle between the planetary orbit and stellar spin axes of$\beta = -44 \pm 11$ deg, and we further derive an orbital obliquity of $\psi =69.6 ^{+4.7}_{-4.1}$ deg. owing to the large orbital separation, tidal forcescausing orbital circularization and realignment of the planetary orbit with thestellar plane are weak, having had little impact on the planetary orbit overthe system lifetime. wasp-117b joins a small sample of transiting giant planetswith well characterized orbits at periods above ~8 days.

1409.6335	the well-aligned orbit of wasp-84b: evidence for disc migration	we report the sky-projected orbital obliquity (spin-orbit angle) of wasp-84b,a 0.70-$m_{\rm jup}$ planet in a 8.52-day orbit around a g9v/k0v star, to be$\lambda = 0.3 \pm 1.7^\circ$. we obtain a true obliquity of $\psi = 14.8 \pm8.0^\circ$ from a measurement of the inclination of the stellar spin axis withrespect to the sky plane. due to the young age and the weak tidal forcing ofthe system, we suggest that the orbit of wasp-84b is unlikely to have bothrealigned and circularised from the misaligned and/or eccentric orbit likely tohave arisen from high-eccentricity migration. therefore we conclude that theplanet probably migrated via interaction with the protoplanetary disc. thiswould make it the first short-orbit, giant planet to have been shown to havemigrated via this pathway. further, we argue that the distribution ofobliquities for planets orbiting cool stars ($t_{\rm eff}$ &lt; 6250 k) suggeststhat high-eccentricity migration is an important pathway for the formation ofshort-orbit, giant planets.

1507.01516	kic 4768731: a bright long-period roap star in the kepler field	we report the identification of 61.45 d^-1 (711.2 mu hz) oscillations, withamplitudes of 62.6-mu mag, in kic 4768731 (hd 225914) using kepler photometry.this relatively bright (v=9.17) chemically peculiar star with spectral type a5vp srcr(eu) has previously been found to exhibit rotational modulation with aperiod of 5.21 d. fourier analysis reveals a simple dipole pulsator with anamplitude that has remained stable over a 4-yr time span, but with a frequencythat is variable. analysis of high-resolution spectra yields stellar parametersof t_eff = 8100 +/- 200 k, log g = 4.0 +/- 0.2, [fe/h] = +0.31 +/- 0.24 and vsin i = 14.8 +/- 1.6 km/s. line profile variations caused by rotation are alsoevident. lines of sr, cr, eu, mg and si are strongest when the star isbrightest, while y and ba vary in anti-phase with the other elements. theabundances of rare earth elements are only modestly enhanced compared to otherroap stars of similar t_eff and log g. radial velocities in the literaturesuggest a significant change over the past 30 yr, but the radial velocitiespresented here show no significant change over a period of 4 yr.

1508.06391	lamost observations in the kepler field. database of low-resolution  spectra	the nearly continuous light curves with micromagnitude precision provided bythe space mission kepler are revolutionising our view of pulsating stars. theyhave revealed a vast sea of low-amplitude pulsation modes that wereundetectable from earth. the long time base of kepler light curves allows anaccurate determination of frequencies and amplitudes of pulsation modes neededfor in-depth asteroseismic modeling. however, for an asteroseismic study to besuccessful, the first estimates of stellar parameters need to be known and theycan not be derived from the kepler photometry itself. the kepler input catalog(kic) provides values for the effective temperature, the surface gravity andthe metallicity, but not always with a sufficient accuracy. moreover,information on the chemical composition and rotation rate is lacking. we arecollecting low-resolution spectra for objects in the kepler field of view withthe large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope (lamost, xinglongobservatory, china). all of the requested fields have now been observed atleast once. in this paper we describe those observations and provide a databaseof use to the whole astronomical community.

astro-ph;0207388	using balmer line profiles to investigate convection in a and f stars	balmer lines are an important diagnostic of stellar atmospheric structure,since they are formed at a wide range of depths within the atmosphere. thedifferent balmer lines are formed at slightly different depths making themuseful atmospheric diagnostics. the low sensitivity to surface gravity forstars cooler than ~8000 k makes them excellent diagnostics in the treatment ofatmospheric convection. for hotter stars balmer profiles are sensitive to botheffective temperature and surface gravity. provided we know the surface gravityof these stars from some other method (e.g. from eclipsing binary systems), wecan use them to determine effective temperature.  in previous work, we have found no significant systematic problems with usinguvby photometry to determine atmospheric parameters of fundamental (andstandard) stars. in fact, uvby was found to be very good for obtaining bothteff and log g. using halpha and hbeta profiles, we have found that both thecanuto &amp; mazzitteli and standard kurucz mixing-length theory withoutapproximate overshooting are both in agreement to within the uncertainties ofthe fundamental stars. overshooting models were always clearly discrepant. someevidence was found for significant disagreement between all treatments ofconvection and fundamental values around 8000~9000k, but these results were forfundamental stars without fundamental surface gravities. we have used starswith fundamental values of both teff and log g to explore this region in moredetail.

astro-ph;0207489	lithium 6104a in population ii stars	we have obtained echelle spectroscopy of 14 population ii objects selectedfrom those previously observed by bonifacio &amp; molaro (1997). for one object, hd140283, we obtained exquisite data with the high dispersion spectrograph on thesubaru telescope, with s/n exceeding 1000 per 0.018a pixel. li abundances havebeen determined by spectral synthesis from both the 6708a resonance line andalso from 6104a subordinate feature. firm detections of the weak line have beenmade in seven objects, and upper limits are reported for the remainder. our6708a abundances agree with those reported by bonifacio &amp; molaro at the99%-confidence level. abundances from the 6104a line hint at a higher liabundance than that determined from the resonance feature, but this evidence ismixed; the weakness of the 6104a line and the large number of upper limits makeit difficult to draw firm conclusions. nlte-corrections increase (rather thaneliminate) the size of the (potential) discrepancy, and binarity appearsunlikely to affect any abundance difference. the effect of multi-dimensionalatmospheres on the line abundances was also considered, although it appearsthat use of 3-d (lte) models could again act to increase the discrepancy, ifone is indeed present.

astro-ph;0312242	eclipsing binaries in open clusters. i. v615 per and v618 per in h per	we derive absolute dimensions for two early-type main sequence detachedeclipsing binaries in the young open cluster h persei (ngc 869). v615 perseihas a spectral type of b7v and a period of 13.7d. v618 persei is a2v and has aperiod of 6.4d. new ephemerides are calculated for both systems. the masses ofthe component stars have been derived using high-resolution spectroscopy andare 4.08+/-0.06 msun and 3.18+/-0.05 msun for v615 per and 2.33+/-0.03 msun and1.56+/-0.02 msun for v618 per. the radii have been measured by fitting theavailable light curves using ebop and are 2.29+/-0.14 rsun and 1.90+/-0.09 rsunfor v615 per and 1.64+/-0.07 rsun and 1.32+/-0.07 rsun for v618 per. bycomparing the observed spectra of v615 per to synthetic spectra from modelatmospheres we find that the effective temperatures of the two stars are15000+/-500 k and 11000+/-500 k. the equatorial rotational velocities of theprimary and secondary components of v615 per are 28+/-5 km/s and 8+/-5 km/s,respectively. both components of v618 per rotate at 10+/-5 km/s. the equatorialrotational velocities for synchronous rotation are about 10 km/s for all fourstars. the timescales for orbital circularisation for both systems, and thetimescale for rotational synchronisation of v615 per, are much greater than theage of h per. their negligible eccentricities and equatorial rotationalvelocities therefore support the hypothesis that they were formed by 'delayedbreakup'. we have compared the radii of these stars to models by the granadaand the padova groups for stars of the same masses but different compositions.we conclude that the metallicity of the stars is about z=0.01. this appears tobe the first estimate of the bulk metallicity of h per. recent photometricstudies have assumed a solar metallicity so their results should be reviewed.

astro-ph;0403439	warm high velocity co in the wind of sakurai's object (= v4334 sgr)	we present ukirt uist spectra of sakurai's object (=v4334 sgr) showing cofundamental band absorption features around 4.7 microns. the line-centres areat heliocentric radial velocity of -170+/-30 km/s. the number and relativestrengths of the lines indicate a co gas temperature of 400+/-100 k and cocolumn density of 7(+3/-2)x10^17 per square cm. the gas was moving away fromthe central star at an average speed of 290+/-30 km/s in 2003 september. thelines appeared sometime between mid 1999 (well after the opaque dust shellformed) and mid 2000 and may have been somewhat more blue--shifted initiallythan they are now. the observed co velocity and temperature indicate thecontinued presence of a fast wind in the object, previously seen in the he i1.083 micron line beginning just prior to massive dust formation, and morerecently in atomic and ionized lines. the dust continuum is consistent with atemperature of 350+/-30 k, indicating continued cooling of the shell. thesimilar co temperature suggests that the bulk of the co absorption occurs justoutside of the dust continuum surface.

astro-ph;0403572	eclipsing binaries in open clusters. ii. v453 cyg in ngc 6871	we derive absolute dimensions of the early b-type detached eclipsing binaryv453 cygni (b0.4 iv + b0.7 iv, p=3.89d), a member of the open cluster ngc 6871.  from the analysis of new, high-resolution, spectroscopy and the ubv lightcurves of cohen (1974) we find the masses to be 14.36 +/- 0.20 and 11.11 +/-0.13 msun, the radii to be 8.55 +/- 0.06 and 5.49 +/- 0.06 rsun, and theeffective temperatures to be 26600 +/- 500 and 25 500 +/- 800 k for the primaryand secondary stars, respectively. the surface gravities of 3.731 +/- 0.012 and4.005 +/- 0.015 indicate that v453 cyg is reaching the end of its main sequencelifetime. we have determined the apsidal motion period of the system to be 66.4+/- 1.8 yr using the technique of lacy (1992) extended to include spectroscopicdata as well as times of minimum light, giving a density concentrationcoefficient of log(k_2) = -2.226 +/- 0.024. contaminating (third) light hasbeen detected for the first time in the light curve of v453 cyg; previousanalyses without this effect systematically underestimate the ratio of theradii of the two stars. the absolute dimensions of the system have beencompared to the stellar evolution models of the granada, geneva, padova andcambridge groups. all model sets fit the data on v453 cyg for solar helium andmetal abundances and an age of 10.0 +/- 0.2 myr. the granada models also agreefully with the observed log(k_2) once general relativistic effects have beenaccounted for. the cambridge models with convective core overshooting fit v453cyg better than those without. given this success of the theoreticalpredictions, we briefly discuss which eclipsing binaries should be studied inorder to further challenge the models.

astro-ph;0408223	the li overabundance of j37: diffusion or accretion?	in september 2002 the discovery of a super li-rich f-dwarf (j37) in ngc 6633,an iron poor analogue of the better studied hyades and praecepe open clusters,was announced. this unique star was thought to be the smoking gun for theaction of diffusion, models of which predict a narrow "li-peak" atapproximately the correct temperature. however, with more detailed studies intoj37s abundance pattern this star provides firm evidence for the accretion ofplanetesimals or other material from the circumstellar environment of new bornstars.  thanks to the specific predictions made about the behaviour of be abundances,(the most striking of which being no be in super-li-rich dwarfs subject todiffusion) the opposing diffusion/accretion predictions can be tested.  initial modelling of the be line indicates that j37 is as be rich as it is lirich; log n(be) = 2.25 +/- 0.25, and so is broadly consistent with anaccretion-fuelled enhancement. however, that both li and be are enhanced bymuch more than the iron-peak elements (as determined in previous studies)suggests that diffusion also plays a role in increasing the abundances of liand be specifically.  furthermore, a new data set from the uves/ut2 combination has allowed theelemental abundance of iron to be measured, and the set of preliminary stellarparameters determined; teff ~ 7340 k, log g ~ 4.1, microturbulence ~ 4.3 km/s,[fe/h] ~ 0.50. this again provides distinct evidence for the effects ofaccretion in j37 and requires a new synthesis of the be doublet.

astro-ph;0409281	eclipsing binaries in open clusters. iii. v621 per in chi persei	v621 persei is a detached eclipsing binary in the open cluster chi perseiwhich is composed of an early b-type giant star and a main sequence secondarycomponent. from high-resolution spectroscopic observations and radialvelocities from the literature, we determine the orbital period to be 25.5 daysand the primary velocity semiamplitude to be k = 64.5 +/- 0.4 km/s. no trace ofthe secondary star has been found in the spectrum. we solve the discovery lightcurves of this totally-eclipsing binary and find that the surface gravity ofthe secondary star is log(g_b) = 4.244 +/- 0.054 (cm/s). we compare theabsolute masses and radii of the two stars in the mass--radius diagram, fordifferent possible values of the primary surface gravity, to the predictions ofstellar models. we find that log(g_a) is approximately 3.55, in agreement withvalues found from fitting balmer lines with synthetic profiles. the expectedmasses of the two stars are 12 msun and 6 msun, and the expected radii are 10rsun and 3 rsun. the primary component is near the blue loop stage in itsevolution.

astro-ph;0508125	beryllium enhancement as evidence for accretion in a lithium-rich f  dwarf	the early f dwarf star ``j37'' in the open cluster ngc6633 shows an unusualpattern of photospheric abundances, including an order of magnitude enhancementof lithium and iron-peak elements, but an under-abundance of carbon. as aconsequence of its thin convection zone these anomalies have been attributed toeither radiative diffusion or the accretion of hydrogen-depleted material. bycomparing high resolution vlt/uves spectra of j37 (and other f stars in ngc6633) with syntheses of the be ii doublet region at 3131 ang, we establish thatj37 also has a be abundance (a(be)=3.0+/-0.5) that is at least ten times thecosmic value. this contradicts radiative diffusion models that produce a liover-abundance, as they also predict photospheric be depletion. instead, sincebe is a highly refractory element, it supports the notion that j37 is the firstclear example of a star that has accreted volatile-depleted material with acomposition similar to chondritic meteorites, although some diffusion may benecessary to explain the low c and o abundances.

astro-ph;0508606	elemental abundances in the blanco 1 open cluster	high resolution spectroscopy is used to determine the detailed chemicalabundances of a group of eight f- and g-type stars in the young open clusterblanco 1. an average [fe/h] of +0.04 +/- 0.02 (internal error) +/- 0.04(external error) is found, considerably lower than a previous spectroscopicestimate for this cluster. the difference is due mainly to our adoption ofsignificantly cooler temperatures which are consistent with both photometricand spectroscopic constraints. blanco~1 exhibits sub-solar [ni/fe] (-0.18 +/-0.01 +/- 0.01), [si/fe] (-0.09$ +/- 0.02 +/- 0.03), [mg/fe] (-0.14 +/- 0.02 +/-0.03) and [ca/fe] (-0.09 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.03); ratios which are not observedamong nearby field stars. the material from which blanco 1 formed may not havebeen well mixed with interstellar matter in the galactic disc, which tallieswith its current location about 240pc below the galactic plane. a simultaneousdeficit of ni and alpha elements with respect to fe is hard to reconcile withmost published models of yields from supernovae of types ia and ii. the revisedabundances for blanco 1 indicate that overall radiative opacities in its stars,and hence convective zone properties at a given mass, are similar to those inthe pleiades at approximately the same age. this can explain a previousobservation that the li depletion patterns of g- and k-type stars in the twoclusters are indistinguishable. the lower overall metallicity of blanco 1 nowmake it less attractive as a target for discovering transiting, short periodexoplanets.
