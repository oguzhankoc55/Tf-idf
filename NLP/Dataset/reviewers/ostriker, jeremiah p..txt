0903.1636	minor mergers and the size evolution of elliptical galaxies	using a high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of theformation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies canbe very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recentobservations. accretion of stripped in-falling stellar material increases thesize of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced bydynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. in a specific case of aspheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of $1.5 \times 10^{11} m_{\odot}$we find that the effective radius $r_e$ increases from $0.7 \pm 0.2 \rm kpc$ atz = 3 to $r_e = 2.4 \pm 0.4 \rm kpc$ at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease inthe effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the centralvelocity dispersion by approximately 20% over this time interval. a simpleargument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weaklybound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of themass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. byundergoing minor mergers compact high redshift spheroids can evolve intopresent-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed localellipticals. this indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for thelate evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.

0903.2840	gravitational heating helps make massive galaxies red and dead	we study the thermal formation history of four simulated galaxies that wereshown in naab et al. (2007) to reproduce a number of observed properties ofelliptical galaxies. the temperature of the gas in the galaxies is steadilyincreasing with decreasing redshift, although much of the gas has a coolingtime shorter than the hubble time. the gas is being heated and kept hot bygravitational heating processes through the release of potential energy frominfalling stellar clumps. the energy is dissipated in supersonic collisions ofinfalling gas lumps with the ambient gas and through the dynamical capturing ofsatellite systems causing gravitational wakes that transfer energy to thesurrounding gas. furthermore dynamical friction from the infalling clumpspushes out dark matter, lowering the central dark matter density by up to afactor of two from z=3 to z=0. in galaxies in which the late formation history(z&lt;2) is dominated by minor merging and accretion the energy released(e~5x10^{59} ergs) from gravitational feedback is sufficient to form red anddead elliptical galaxies by z~1 even in the absence of supernova and agnfeedback.

0904.3098	a new test of the statistical nature of the brightest cluster galaxies	a novel statistic is proposed to examine the hypothesis that all clustergalaxies are drawn from the same luminosity distribution (ld). in such a"statistical model" of galaxy ld, the brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) aresimply the statistical extreme of the galaxy population. using a large sampleof nearby clusters, we show that bcgs in high luminosity clusters (e.g., l_tot&gt; 4x10^11 l_sun) are unlikely (probability &lt;3x10^-4) to be drawn from the lddefined by all red cluster galaxies more luminous than m_r=-20. on the otherhand, bcgs in less luminous clusters are consistent with being the statisticalextreme. applying our method to the second brightest galaxies, we show thatthey are consistent with being the statistical extreme, which implies that thebcgs are also distinct from non-bcg luminous, red, cluster galaxies. we pointout some issues with the interpretation of the classical tests proposed bytremaine &amp; richstone (1977) that are designed to examine the statistical natureof bcgs, investigate the robustness of both our statistical test and those oftr against difficulties in photometry of galaxies of large angular size, anddiscuss the implication of our findings on surveys that use the luminous redgalaxies to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation features in the galaxypower spectrum.

0905.3748	exploring the energetics of intracluster gas with a simple and accurate  model	the state of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies is investigated with a setof model clusters, created by assuming a polytropic equation of state(gamma=1.2) and hydrostatic equilibrium inside gravitational potential wellsdrawn from a dark matter simulation. star formation, energy input, andnonthermal pressure support are included. to match the gas fractions seen innon-radiative hydrodynamical simulations, roughly 5% of the binding energy ofthe dark matter must be transferred to the gas during cluster formation; thepresence of nonthermal pressure support increases this value. in order to matchx-ray observations, scale-free behavior must be broken. this can be due toeither variation of the efficiency of star formation with cluster mass m_500,or the input of additional energy proportional to the formed stellar mass m_f.these two processes have similar effects on x-ray scalings. if 9% of the gas isconverted into stars, independent of cluster mass, then feedback energy inputof 1.2e-5*m_fc^2 (or ~1.0 kev per particle) is required to match observedclusters. alternatively, if the stellar mass fraction varies as m_500^-0.26then a lower feedback of 4e-6*m_fc^2 is needed, and if the stellar fractionvaries as steeply as m_500^-0.49 then no additional feedback is necessary. themodel clusters reproduce the observed trends of gas temperature and gas massfraction with cluster mass, as well as observed entropy and pressure profiles;thus they provide a calibrated basis with which to interpret upcoming szsurveys. one consequence of the increased gas energy is that the baryonfraction inside the virial radius is less than roughly 90% of the cosmic mean,even for the most massive clusters.

0905.4294	feedback from central black holes in elliptical galaxies. ii: can purely  mechanical energy feedback models work?	by using high-resolution 1d hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate theeffects of purely mechanical feedback from super massive black holes (smbhs) inthe evolution of elliptical galaxies for a broad range of feedback efficienciesand compare the results to four major observational constraints. in particular,we focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy,2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed inthe host galaxy within the last gyr, and 4) the x-ray luminosity of the hotdiffuse gas. as a result, we try to pin down the most successful range ofmechanical feedback efficiencies. we find that while low feedback efficienciesresult in too much growth of the smbh, high efficiencies totally blow out thehot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermalx-ray luminosity well below the observed range. the net lifetime of the quasarphase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between smbh and its host galaxy,while the x-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formationwithin the last gyr. when considering the popularly adopted model of theconstant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambientmedium should be more than 0.01% of the smbh accretion energy to be consistentwith the smbh mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe. yet, the x-rayluminosity of the hot gas favors about 0.005% of the accretion energy as themechanical agn feedback energy. we conclude that the purely mechanical feedbackmode is unlikely to be simultaneously compatible with all four observabletests, even allowing a broad range of feedback efficiencies, and that includingboth radiative and mechanical feedback together may be a solution to comply theobservational constraints.

0909.0276	the effects of the ionizing radiation background on galaxy evolution	we find that the amount and nature of the assumed ionizing background canstrongly affect galaxy formation and evolution. galaxy evolution simulationstypically incorporate an ultraviolet background which falls off rapidly abovez=3; e.g., that of haardt &amp; madau (1996). however, this decline may be toosteep to fit the wmap constraints on electron scattering optical depth orobservations of intermediate redshift (z ~ 2-4) ly-alpha forest transmission.as an alternative, we present simulations of the cosmological formation ofindividual galaxies with uv backgrounds that decline more slowly at highredshift: both a simple intensity rescaling and the background recently derivedby faucher-giguere (2009), which softens the spectrum at higher redshifts. wealso test an approximation of the x-ray background with a similar z-dependence.we find for the test galaxies that an increase in either the intensity orhardness of ionizing radiation generically pushes star formation towards lowerredshifts: although overall star formation in the simulation boxes is reducedby 10-25%, the galaxies show a factor of ~2 increase in the fraction of starswithin a 30 kpc radius that are formed after z=1. other effects include lategas inflows enhanced up to 30 times, stellar half-mass radii decreased by up to30%, central velocity dispersions increased up to 40%, and a strong reductionin substructure. the magnitude of the effects depends on theenvironmental/accretion properties of the particular galaxy.

1002.0585	dissipational versus dissipationless galaxy formation and the dark  matter content of galaxies	we examine two extreme models for the build-up of the stellar component ofluminous elliptical galaxies. in one case, we assume the build-up of stars isdissipational, with centrally accreted gas radiating away its orbital andthermal energy; the dark matter halo will undergo adiabatic contraction and thecentral dark matter density profile will steepen. for the second model, weassume the central galaxy is assembled by a series of dissipationless mergersof stellar clumps that have formed far from the nascent galaxy. in order to beaccreted, these clumps lose their orbital energy to the dark matter halo viadynamical friction, thereby heating the central dark matter and smoothing thedark matter density cusp. the central dark matter density profiles differdrastically between these models. for the isolated elliptical galaxy, ngc 4494,the central dark matter densities follow the power-laws r^(-0.2) and r^(-1.7)for the dissipational and dissipationless models, respectively. by matching thedissipational and dissipationless models to observations of the stellarcomponent of elliptical galaxies, we examine the relative contributions ofdissipational and dissipationless mergers to the formation of ellipticalgalaxies and look for observational tests that will distinguish between thesemodels. comparisons to strong lensing brightest cluster galaxies yield medianm*/l_b ratios of 2.1+/-0.8 and 5.2+/-1.7 at z=0.39 for the dissipational anddissipationless models, respectively. for ngc 4494, the best-fit dissipationaland dissipationless models have m*/l_b=2.97 and 3.96. comparisons to expectedstellar mass-to-light ratios from passive evolution and population synthesesappear to rule out a purely dissipational formation mechanism for the centralstellar regions of giant elliptical galaxies.

1003.1108	environmental effects on the growth of super massive black holes and agn  feedback	we investigate how environmental effects by gas stripping alter the growth ofa super massive black hole (smbh) and its host galaxy evolution, by means of 1dhydrodynamical simulations that include both mechanical and radiative agnfeedback effects. by changing the truncation radius of the gas distribution(r_t), beyond which gas stripping is assumed to be effective, we simulatepossible environments for satellite and central galaxies in galaxy clusters andgroups. the continuous escape of gas outside the truncation radius stronglysuppresses star formation, while the growth of the smbh is less affected by gasstripping because the smbh accretion is primarily ruled by the density of thecentral region. as we allow for increasing environmental effects - thetruncation radius decreasing from about 410 to 50 kpc - we find that the finalsmbh mass declines from about 10^9 to 8 x 10^8 msol, but the outflowing mass isroughly constant at about 2 x 10^10 msol. there are larger change in the massof stars formed, which declines from about 2 x 10^10 to 2 x 10^9 msol, and thefinal thermal x-ray gas, which declines from about 10^9 to 5 x 10^8 msol, withincreasing environmental stripping. most dramatic is the decline in the totaltime that the objects would be seen as quasars, which declines from 52 myr (forr_t = 377 kpc) to 7.9 myr (for r_t = 51 kpc). the typical case might beinterpreted as a red and dead galaxy having episodic cooling flows followed byagn feedback effects resulting in temporary transitions of the overall galaxycolor from red to green or to blue, with (cluster) central galaxies spending amuch larger fraction of their time in the elevated state than do satellitegalaxies.(abridged)

1004.2923	momentum driving: which physical processes dominate agn feedback?	the deposition of mechanical feedback from a supermassive black hole (smbh)in an active galactic nucleus (agn) into the surrounding galaxy occurs viabroad-line winds which must carry mass and radial momentum as well as energy.the effect can be summarized by the dimensionless parameter$\eta=dot{m_outflow}/dot{m_accretion}= (2 \epsilon_w c^2)/v_w^2$ where($\epslion_w \equiv dot{e}_w/(dot{m_accretion} c^2)$) is the efficiency bywhich accreted matter is turned into wind energy in the disc surrounding thecentral smbh. the outflowing mass and omentum are proportional to $\eta$, andmany prior treatments have essentially assumed that $\eta=0$. we perform one-and two-dimensional simulations and find that the growth of the central smbh isvery sensitive to the inclusion of the mass and momentum driving but isinsensitive to the assumed mechanical efficiency. for example in representativecalculations, the omission of momentum and mass feedback leads to an hundredfold increase in the mass of the smbh to over $10^{10} \msun$. when allowanceis made for momentum driving, the final smbh mass is much lower and the windefficiencies which lead to the most observationally acceptable results arerelatively low with $\epsilon_w \lesssim 10^{-4}$.

1010.1381	the two phases of galaxy formation	cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a two-phasecharacter with a rapid early phase at z&gt;2 during which in-situ stars are formedwithin the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase sincez&lt;3 during which ex-situ stars are primarily accreted. in the latter phasemassive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smallersatellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z&gt;3) outside of thevirial radius of the forming central galaxy. these tentative conclusions areobtained from high resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in afull cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7e11m_sun h^-1 &lt; m_vir &lt; 2.7e13 m_sun h^-1 and central galaxy masses between 4.5e10m_sun h^-1 &lt; m_* &lt; 3.6e11 m_sun h^-1. the simulations include the effects of auniform uv background, radiative cooling, star formation and energetic feedbackfrom snii. the importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass andtowards lower redshift. in our simulations lower mass galaxies ($m_* &lt; 9e10m_sun h^-1) accrete about 60 per cent of their present-day stellar mass. highmass galaxy ($m_* &gt; 1.7e11 m_sun h^-1) assembly is dominated by accretion andmerging with about 80 per cent of the stars added by the present-day. ingeneral the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z=1. formassive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant starformation. the majority of the in-situ created stars is formed at z&gt;2,primarily out of cold gas flows. we recover the observational result ofarchaeological downsizing, where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldeststars. we find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structureformation. most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smallerstructures, the galaxies themselves are assembled late.

0708.4037	dynamics of rotating accretion flows irradiated by a quasar	we study the axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamics of rotating flowsthat are under the influence of supermassive black hole gravity and radiationfrom an accretion disk surrounding the black hole. this work is an extension ofthe earlier work presented by proga, where nonrotating flows were studied.here, we consider effects of rotation, a position-dependent radiationtemperature, density at large radii, and uniform x-ray background radiation. asin the non-rotating case, the rotating flow settles into a configuration withtwo components (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow withthe outflow leaving the system along the pole. however, with rotation the flowdoes not always reach a steady state. in addition, rotation reduces the outflowcollimation and the outward flux of mass and kinetic energy. moreover rotationincreases the outward flux of the thermal energy and can lead to fragmentationand time-variability of the outflow. we also show that a position-dependentradiation temperature can significantly change the flow solution. inparticular, the inflow in the equatorial region can be replaced by a thermallydriven outflow. generally, as it have been discussed and shown in the past, wefind that self-consistently determined preheating/cooling from the quasarradiation can significantly reduce the rate at which the central bh is fed withmatter. however, our results emphasize also a little appreciated feature.namely, quasar radiation drives a non-spherical, multi-temperature and verydynamic flow. these effects become dominant for luminosities in excess of 0.01of the eddington luminosity.

0709.0524	effect of primordial black holes on the cosmic microwave background and  cosmological parameter estimates	we investigate the effect of non-evaporating primordial black holes (pbhs) onthe ionization and thermal history of the universe. x-rays emitted by gasaccretion onto pbhs modify the cosmic recombination history, producingmeasurable effects on the spectrum and anisotropies of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). using the third-year wmap data and firas data we improveexisting upper limits on the abundance of pbhs with masses &gt;0.1 msun by severalorders of magnitude. fitting wmap3 data with cosmological models that do notallow for non-standard recombination histories, as produced by pbhs or otherearly energy sources, may lead to an underestimate of the best-fit values ofthe amplitude of linear density fluctuations (sigma_8) and the scalar spectralindex (n_s). cosmological parameter estimates are affected because models withpbhs allow for larger values of the thomson scattering optical depth, whosecorrelation with other parameters may not be correctly taken into account whenpbhs are ignored. values of tau_e=0.2, n_s=1 and sigma_8=0.9 are allowed at 95%cf. this result that may relieve recent tension between wmap3 data and clustersdata on the value of sigma_8. pbhs may increase the primordial molecularhydrogen abundance by up to two orders of magnitude, this promoting cooling andstar formation. the suppression of galaxy formation due to x-ray heating isnegligible for models consistent with the cmb data. thus, the formation rate ofthe first galaxies and stars would be enhanced by a population of pbhs.

1206.5004	how do minor mergers promote inside-out growth of ellipticals,  transforming the size, density profile and dark matter fraction?	there is observational evidence for inside-out growth of elliptical galaxiessince $z \gtrsim 2-3$, which is not driven by in-situ star formation. manysystems at high redshift have small sizes $\sim 1kpc$ and surface brightnessprofiles with low sersic indices n. the most likely descendants have, onaverage, grown by a factor of two in mass and a factor of four in size,indicating $r \propto m^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \gtrsim 2$. they also havesurface brightness profiles with $n \gtrsim 5$. this evolution can bequalitatively explained on the basis of two assumptions: compact ellipticalspredominantly grow by collisionless minor or intermediate 'dry' mergers, andthey are embedded in massive dark matter halos. we draw these conclusions fromidealized collisionless mergers spheroidal galaxies - with and without darkmatter - with mass ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10. the sizes evolve as $r \proptom^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha &lt; 2$ for mass-ratios of 1:1. for minor mergers ofgalaxies embedded in dark matter halos, the sizes grow significantly faster andthe profile shapes change more rapidly. mergers with moderate mass-ratios of1:5 give $\alpha \sim 2.3$ and a final sersic index of $n = 9.5$ after doublingthe stellar mass. this is accompanied by a significant increase of the darkmatter fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, driven by the strong sizeincrease probing larger, dark matter dominated regions. only a few intermediatemass-ratio mergers of galaxies embedded in massive dark matter halos can resultin the observed concurrent inside-out growth and the rapid evolution in profileshapes. apart from negative stellar metallicity gradients such a 'minor' mergerscenario also predicts significantly lower dark matter fractions for $z \sim 2$compact quiescent galaxies and their rare present day analogues (abbreviated).

0712.0824	thermal balance in the intracluster medium: is agn feedback necessary?	a variety of physical heating mechanisms are combined with radiative coolingto explore, via one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, the expected thermalproperties of the intracluster medium (icm) in the context of the cooling flowproblem. energy injection from type ia supernovae, thermal conduction, anddynamical friction (df) from orbiting satellite galaxies are considered. thenovel feature of this work is the exploration of a wide range of efficienciesof each heating process. while the latter two can provide a substantial amountof energy, neither mechanism operating alone can produce nor maintain an icm inthermal balance over cosmological timescales, in stark contrast withobservations. for simulated clusters with initially isothermal temperatureprofiles, both mechanisms acting in combination result in long-term thermalbalance for a range of icm temperatures and for central electron densities lessthan n_e~0.02 cm^-3; at greater densities catastrophic cooling invariablyoccurs. furthermore, these heating mechanisms can neither produce nor maintainclusters with a declining temperature profile in the central regions, implyingthat the observed "cooling-core'' clusters, which have such decliningtemperature profiles, cannot be maintained with these mechanisms alone. thus,while there appears to be an abundant supply of energy capable of heating theicm in clusters, it is extremely difficult for the energy deposition to occurin such a way that the icm remains in thermal balance over cosmologicaltime-scales. these results strongly suggest that a more dynamic heating processsuch as feedback from a central black hole is required to generate theproperties of observed intracluster media.

1211.5377	gravitational waves and stalled satellites from massive galaxy mergers  at z &lt;= 1	we present a model for merger-driven evolution of the mass function formassive galaxies and their central supermassive black holes at late times. wediscuss the current observational evidence in favor of merger-driven massivegalaxy evolution during this epoch, and demonstrate that the observed evolutionof the mass function can be reproduced by evolving an initial mass functionunder the assumption of negligible star formation. we calculate the stochasticgravitational wave signal from the resulting black-hole binary mergers in thelow redshift universe (z &lt;= 1) implied by this model, and find that thispopulation has a signal-to-noise ratio as much as ~5x larger than previousestimates for pulsar timing arrays, with an expectation value for thecharacteristic strain h_c (f=1 yr^{-1}) = 4.1 x 10^{-15} that may already be intension with observational constraints, and a {2-sigma, 3-sigma} lower limitwithin this model of h_c (f=1 yr^{-1}) = {1.1 x 10^{-15}, 6.8 x 10^{-16}}. thestrength of this signal is sufficient to make it detectable with highprobability under conservative assumptions within the next several years, ifthe principle assumption of merger-driven galaxy evolution since z = 1 holdstrue. for cases where a galaxy merger fails to lead to a black hole merger, weestimate the probability for a given number of satellite unmerged black holesto remain within a massive host galaxy, and interpret the result in light ofulx observations. in particular, we find that the brightest cluster galaxiesshould have 1-2 such sources with luminosities above 10^{39} erg/s, which isconsistent with the statistics of observed ulxs.

1304.4689	radiation driven outflow in active galactic nuclei: the feedback effects  of scattered and reprocessed photons	we perform time-dependent, 2dhd numerical simulations to study the dynamicsof a slowly rotating accretion flow from sub-pc to pc scales under theirradiation from the central agn. compared to previous work, we improve thecalculation of the radiative force due to x-rays. more importantly, in additionto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the centralagn, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scatteredand reprocessed photons. we find that the accretion flow properties changesignificantly due to this "re-radiation" effect. the inflow rate at the innerboundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhancedby about one order of magnitude. this effect is more significant when thedensity at the outer boundary is higher. the properties of outflows such asvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and theaccretion rate, are calculated. we find that the efficiency of transferring theradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, farbelow the value of $\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmologicalsimulations. the effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary($t_0$) is investigated. when $t_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of theaccretion flow oscillates. this is because in this case the gas around thebondi radius can be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature dueto its high internal energy. another question we hope to address is theso-called "sub-eddington" puzzle. observationally, the luminosity of almost allagns are sub-eddington, while theoretically the luminosity of an accretion flowcan easily be super-eddington. we find that even when the re-radiation effectis included and outflow does become much stronger, the luminosity, whilereduced, can still be super-eddington.

1308.0021	co-evolution of galactic nuclei and globular cluster systems	we revisit the hypothesis that dense galactic nuclei are formed frominspiraling globular clusters. recent advances in understanding of thecontinuous formation of globular clusters over cosmic time and the concurrentevolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to construct a simplemodel that matches the observed spatial and mass distributions of clusters inthe galaxy and the giant elliptical galaxy m87. in order to compare withobservations, we model the effects of dynamical friction and dynamicalevolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidaldisruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus. we find thatinspiraling globular clusters form a dense central structure, with mass andradius comparable to the typical values in observed nuclear star clusters(nscs) in late-type and low-mass early-type galaxies. the density contrastassociated with the nsc is less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. ourresults indicate that the nsc mass as a fraction of mass of the galaxy stellarspheroid scales as m_nsc/m_* = 0.0025 m_{*,11}^{-0.5}. thus disrupted globularclusters could contribute most of the mass of nscs in galaxies with stellarmass below 10^{11} msun. the inner part of the accumulated cluster may seed thegrowth of a central black hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, therebyrelieving the problem of how to form luminous quasars at high redshift. theseed black hole may reach about 10^5 msun within 1 gyr of the beginning ofglobular cluster formation.

1308.3719	consequences of mechanical and radiative feedback from black holes in  disc galaxy mergers	we study the effect of agn mechanical and radiation feedback on the formationof bulge dominated galaxies via mergers of disc galaxies. the merging galaxieshave mass-ratios of 1:1 to 6:1 and include pre-existing hot gaseous halos toproperly account for the global impact of agn feedback. using smoothed particlehydrodynamics simulation code (gadget-3) we compare three models with differentagn feedback models: (1) no black hole and no agn feedback; (2) thermal agnfeedback; and (3) mechanical and radiative agn feedback. the last model ismotivated by observations of broad line quasars which show winds with initialvelocities of $v_w \ge$ 10,000 km/s and also heating associated with thecentral agn x-ray radiation. the primary changes in gas properties due tomechanical agn feedback are lower thermal x-ray luminosity from the finalgalaxy - in better agreement with observations - and galactic outflows withhigher velocity $\sim 1000$ km/s similar to recent direct observations ofnearby merger remnants. the kinetic energy of the outflowing gas is a factor of$\sim$ 20 higher than in the thermal feedback case. all merger remnants withmomentum-based agn feedback with $v_w \sim 10,000$ km/s and $\epsilon_w=2\times 10^{-3}$, independent of their progenitor mass-ratios, reproduce theobserved relations between stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass($m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$) as well as x-ray luminosity ($l_x - \sigma$) with$10^{37.5}$ erg/s $\lesssim l_x (0.3-8~{\rm kev}) \lesssim 10^{39.2}$ erg/s forvelocity dispersions in the range of 120 km/s $\lesssim \sigma \lesssim$ 190km/s. in addition, the mechanical feedback produces a much greater agnvariability. we also show that gas is more rapidly and impulsively strippedfrom the galactic centres driving a moderate increase in galaxy size anddecrease in central density with the mechanical agn feedback model.

1309.2946	the effect of metal enrichment and galactic winds on galaxy formation in  cosmological zoom simulations	we investigate the differential effects of metal cooling and galactic stellarwinds on the cosmological formation of individual galaxies with three sets ofcosmological, hydrodynamical zoom simulations of 45 halos in the mass range10^11&lt;m_halo&lt;10^13m_sun. models including both galactic winds and metal cooling(i) suppress early star formation at z&gt;1 and predict reasonable star formationhistories, (ii) produce galaxies with high cold gas fractions (30-60 per cent)at high redshift, (iii) significantly reduce the galaxy formation efficienciesfor halos (m_halo&lt;10^12m_sun) at all redshifts in agreement with observationaland abundance matching constraints, (iv) result in high-redshift galaxies withreduced circular velocities matching the observed tully-fisher relation at z~2,and (v) significantly increase the sizes of low-mass galaxies(m_stellar&lt;3x10^10m_sun) at high redshift resulting in a weak size evolution -a trend in agreement with observations. however, the low redshift (z&lt;0.5) starformation rates of massive galaxies are higher than observed (up to ten times).no tested model predicts the observed size evolution for low-mass and high-massgalaxies simultaneously. due to the delayed onset of star formation in the windmodels, the metal enrichment of gas and stars is delayed and agrees well withobservational constraints. metal cooling and stellar winds are both found toincrease the ratio of in situ formed to accreted stars - the relativeimportance of dissipative vs. dissipationless assembly. for halo masses below~10^12m_sun, this is mainly caused by less stellar accretion and compares wellto predictions from semi-analytical models but still differs from abundancematching models. for higher masses, the fraction of in situ stars isover-predicted due to the unrealistically high star formation rates at lowredshifts.

1402.6325	grain physics and ir dust emission in agn environments	we study the effects of a detailed dust treatment on the properties andevolution of early-type galaxies containing central black holes, as determinedby agn feedback. we find that during cooling flow episodes, radiation pressureon the dust in and interior to infalling shells of cold gas can greatly impactthe amount of gas able to be accreted and therefore the frequency of agnbursts. however, the overall hydrodynamic evolution of all models, includingmass budget, is relatively robust to the assumptions on dust. we find that irre-emission from hot dust can dominate the bolometric luminosity of the galaxyduring the early stages of an agn burst, reaching values in excess of $10^{46}$erg/s. the agn-emitted uv is largely absorbed, but the optical depth in the irdoes not exceed unity, so the radiation momentum input never exceeds $l_{\rmbh}/c$. we constrain the viability of our models by comparing the agn dutycycle, broadband luminosities, dust mass, black hole mass, and other modelpredictions to current observations. these constraints force us to modelswherein the dust to metals ratios are $\simeq 1%$ of the galactic value, andonly models with a dynamic dust to gas ratio are able to produce both quiescentgalaxies consistent with observations and high obscured fractions during agn"on" phases. during agn outbursts, we predict that a large fraction of the firluminosity can be attributed to warm dust emission ($\simeq100$ k) from densedusty gas within $\leq 1$ kpc reradiating the agn uv emission.

1403.0670	agn feedback in an isolated elliptical galaxy: the effect of strong  radiative feedback in the kinetic mode	based on two-dimensional high resolution hydrodynamic numerical simulation,we study the mechanical and radiative feedback effects from the central agn onthe cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy. physical processessuch as star formation and supernovae are considered. the inner boundary of thesimulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial bondi radius isresolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determinedself-consistently. in analogy to previous works, we assume that the specificangular momentum of the galaxy is low. it is well-known that when the accretionrates are high and low, the central agns will be in cold and hot accretionmodes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes,respectively. the emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder thanthat from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher comptontemperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according toprevious theoretical works. such a difference of the compton temperaturebetween the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected inprevious works. significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are foundas a result of the stronger compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic.more importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growthand agn duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored modelparameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes withdecreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being $\simeq 10^{-3.5}$) andx-ray compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although modelswith fixed mechanical efficiency and compton temperature can be found that aresatisfactory as well. we conclude that radiative feedback in the kinetic modeis much more important than previously thought.

1403.1257	the impact of mechanical agn feedback on the formation of massive  early-type galaxies	we employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the effectsof agn feedback on the formation of massive galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of $m_{stel} = 8.8 \times 10^{10} - 6.0 \times 10^{11} m_{sun}$. usingsmoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with a pressure-entropy formulationthat allows an improved treatment of contact discontinuities and fluid mixing,we run three sets of simulations of 20 halos with different agn feedbackmodels: (1) no feedback, (2) thermal feedback, and (3) mechanical and radiationfeedback. we assume that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs atthe centre of emerging dark matter halos and trace their mass growth via gasaccretion and mergers with other black holes. both feedback models successfullyrecover the observed m_bh - sigma relation and black hole-to-stellar mass ratiofor simulated central early-type galaxies. the baryonic conversion efficienciesare reduced by a factor of two compared to models without any agn feedback atall halo masses. however, massive galaxies simulated with thermal agn feedbackshow a factor of ~10-100 higher x-ray luminosities than observed. themechanical/radiation feedback model reproduces the observed correlation betweenx-ray luminosities and velocity dispersion, e.g. for galaxies with sigma = 200km/s, the x-ray luminosity is reduced from $10^{42}$ erg/s to $10^{40}$ erg/s.it also efficiently suppresses late time star formation, reducing the specificstar formation rate from $10^{-10.5}$ $yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-14}$ $yr^{-1}$ onaverage and resulting in quiescent galaxies since z=2, whereas the thermalfeedback model shows higher late time in-situ star formation rates thanobserved.

0803.4372	global compton heating and cooling in hot accretion flows	the hot accretion flow is usually optically thin in the radial direction,therefore the photons produced at one radius can travel for a long distancewithout being absorbed. these photons thus can heat or cool electrons at otherradii via compton scattering. this effect has been ignored in most previousworks on hot accretion flows and is the focus of this paper. if the massaccretion rate is described by $\dot{m}=\dot{m}_0(r/r_{\rm out})^{0.3}$ and$r_{\rm out}=10^4r_{\rm s}$, we find that the compton scattering will play acooling and heating role at $r\la 5\times 10^3 r_{\rm s}$ and $r\ga 5\times10^3 r_{\rm s}$, respectively. specifically, when $\dot{m}_0&gt;0.1l_{\rmedd}/c^2$, the compton cooling rate is larger than the local viscous heatingrate at certain radius; therefore the cooling effect is important. when$\dot{m}_0&gt;2l_{\rm edd}/c^2$, the heating effect at $r_{\rm out}$ is important.we can obtain the self-consistent steady solution with the global comptoneffect included only if $\dot{m}_0\la l_{\rm edd}/c^2$ for $r_{\rmout}=50r_{\rm s}$, which corresponds to $l\la 0.02l_{\rm edd}$. above this ratethe compton cooling is so strong at the inner region that hot solutions can notexist. on the other hand, for $r_{\rm out}= 10^5r_{\rm s}$, we can only get theself-consistent solution when $\dot{m}_0\la l_{\rm edd}/c^2$ and $l&lt;0.01l_{\rmedd}$. above this accretion rate the equilibrium temperature of electrons at$r_{\rm out}$ is higher than the virial temperature as a result of strongcompton heating, so the accretion is suppressed. in this case the activity ofthe black hole will likely "oscillate" between an active and an inactivephases, with the oscillation timescale being the radiative timescale of the gasat $r_{\rm out}$.

1410.2244	the stellar accretion origin of stellar population gradients in massive  galaxies at large radii	we investigate the evolution of stellar population gradients from $z=2$ to$z=0$ in massive galaxies at large radii ($r &gt; 2r_{\mathrm{eff}}$) using tencosmological zoom simulations of halos with $6 \times 10^{12} m_{\odot} &lt;m_{\mathrm{halo}} &lt; 2 \times 10^{13}m_{\odot}$. the simulations follow metalcooling and enrichment from snii, snia and agb winds. we explore thedifferential impact of an empirical model for galactic winds that reproducesthe mass-metallicity relation and its evolution with redshift. at larger radiithe galaxies, for both models, become more dominated by stars accreted fromsatellite galaxies in major and minor mergers. in the wind model, fewer starsare accreted, but they are significantly more metal poor resulting in steepglobal metallicity ($\langle \nabla z_{\mathrm{stars}} \rangle= -0.35$ dex/dex)and color (e.g. $\langle \nabla g-r \rangle = -0.13$ dex/dex) gradients inagreement with observations. in contrast, colour and metallicity gradients ofthe models without winds are inconsistent with observations. age gradients arein general mildly positive at $z=0$ ($\langle \nabla age_{\mathrm{stars}}\rangle= 0.04$ dex/dex) with significant differences between the models athigher redshift. we demonstrate that for the wind model, stellar accretion issteepening existing in-situ metallicity gradients by about 0.2 dex by thepresent day and helps to match observed gradients of massive early-typegalaxies at large radii. colour and metallicity gradients are significantlysteeper for systems which have accreted stars in minor mergers, while galaxieswith major mergers have relatively flat gradients, confirming previous results.this study highlights the importance of stellar accretion for stellarpopulation properties of massive galaxies at large radii, which can provideimportant constraints for formation models.

1410.3822	kinetic energy from supernova feedback in high-resolution galaxy  simulations	we describe a new method for adding a prescribed amount of kinetic energy tosimulated gas modeled on a cartesian grid by directly altering grid cells' massand velocity in a distributed fashion. the method is explored in the context ofsupernova feedback in high-resolution ($\sim 10$ pc) hydrodynamic simulationsof galaxy formation. resolution-dependence is a primary consideration in ourapplication of the method and simulations of isolated explosions (performed atdifferent resolutions) motivate a resolution-dependent scaling for the injectedfraction of kinetic energy that we apply in cosmological simulations of a$10^9$ msun dwarf halo. we find that in high density media ($\gtrsim$ 50cm$^{-3}$) with coarse resolution ($\gtrsim 4$ pc per cell), results aresensitive to the initial kinetic energy fraction due to early and rapidcooling. in our galaxy simulations, the deposition of small amounts ofsupernova energy in kinetic form (as little as 1%) has a dramatic impact on theevolution of the system, resulting in an order of magnitude suppression ofstellar mass. the overall behavior of the galaxy in the two highest resolutionsimulations we perform appears to converge. we discuss the resultingdistribution of stellar metallicities, an observable sensitive to galactic windproperties, and find that while the new method demonstrates increased agreementwith observed systems, significant discrepancies remain, likely due tosimplistic assumptions that neglect contributions from type ia supernovae andstellar winds.

1503.07533	a two-parameter matching scheme for massive galaxies and dark matter  haloes	halo abundance matching has been used to construct a one-parameter mappingbetween galaxies and dark matter haloes by assuming that halo mass and galaxyluminosity (or stellar mass) are monotonically related. while this approach hasbeen reasonably successful, it is known that galaxies must be described by atleast two parameters, as can be seen from the two-parameter fundamental planeon which massive early-type galaxies lie. in this paper, we derive a connectionbetween initial dark matter density perturbations in the early universe andpresent-day virialized dark matter haloes by assuming simple spherical collapsecombined with conservation of mass and energy. we find that $z = 0$ haloconcentration, or alternatively the inner slope of the halo density profile$\alpha$, is monotonically and positively correlated with the collapse redshiftof the halo. this is qualitatively similar to the findings of some previousworks based on numerical simulations, with which we compare our results. wethen describe how the halo mass and concentration (or inner slope $\alpha$) canbe used as two halo parameters in combination with two parameters of early-typegalaxies to create an improved abundance matching scheme.

1506.07180	supernova feedback and the hot gas filling fraction of the interstellar  medium	supernovae (sn), the most energetic stellar feedback mechanism, are crucialfor regulating the interstellar medium (ism) and launching galactic winds. weexplore how supernova remnants (snrs) create a multiphase medium by performing3d hydrodynamical simulations at various sn rates, $s$, and ism averagedensities, $\bar{n}$. the evolution of a snr in a self-consistently generatedthree-phase ism is qualitatively different from that in a uniform or atwo-phase warm/cold medium. by travelling faster and further in the low-densityhot phase, the domain of a snr increases by $&gt;10^{2.5}$. varying $\bar{n}$ and$s$, we find that a steady state can only be achieved when the hot gas volumefraction $f_{\rm{v,hot}}\lesssim 0.6 \pm 0.1 $. above that level, overlappingsnrs render connecting topology of the hot gas, and the ism is subjected tothermal runaway. photoelectric heating (peh) has a surprisingly strong impacton $f_{\rm{v,hot}}$. for $\bar{n}\gtrsim 3 \cm-3 $, a reasonable peh rate isable to suppress the thermal runaway. overall, we determine the critical snrate for the onset of thermal runaway to be $s_{\rm{crit}} = 200(\bar{n}/1\cm-3)^k (e_{\rm{sn}}/10^{51}\erg)^{-1} \kpc^{-3} \myr-1$, where $k =(1.2,2.7)$ for $\bar{n} \leq 1$ and $&gt; 1\cm-3 $, respectively. we present afitting formula of the ism pressure $p(\bar{n}$, $s$), which can be used as aneffective equation of state in cosmological simulations. despite the 5 ordersof magnitude span of $(\bar{n},s)$, the average mach number varies little:$\mathcal{m} \approx \ 0.5\pm 0.2, \ 1.2\pm 0.3,\ 2.3\pm 0.9$ for the hot, warmand cold phases, respectively.

astro-ph;0001446	preheated advection dominated accretion flow	all high temperature accretion solutions including adaf are physically thick,so outgoing radiation interacts with the incoming flow, sharing as much or moreresemblance with classical spherical accretion flows as with disk flows. weexamine this interaction for the popular adaf case. we find that withoutallowance for compton preheating, a very restricted domain of adaf solution ispermitted and with compton preheating included a new high temperature padafbranch appears in the solution space. in the absence of preheating, hightemperature flows do not exist when the mass accretion rate mdot == mdot c^2 /l_e &gt;~ 10^-1.5. below this mass accretion rate, a roughly conical region aroundthe hole cannot sustain high temperature ions and electrons for all flowshaving mdot &gt;~ 10^-4, which may lead to a funnel possibly filled with a tenuoushot outgoing wind. if the flow starts at large radii with the usual equilibriumtemperature ~10^4 k, the critical mass accretion rate is much lower, mdot\~10^-3.7 above which level no self-consistent adaf (without preheating) canexist. however, above this critical mass accretion rate, the flow can beself-consistently maintained at high temperature if compton preheating isconsidered. these solutions constitute a new branch of solutions as inspherical accretion flows. high temperature padaf flows can exist above thecritical mass accretion rate in addition to the usual cold thin disk solutions.we also find solutions where the flow near the equatorial plane accretesnormally while the flow near the pole is overheated by compton preheating,possibly becoming, a polar wind, solutions which we designate wadaf.

astro-ph;0005444	properties of cosmic shock waves in large scale structure formation	we have examined the properties of shock waves in simulations of large scalestructure formation for two cosmological scenarios (a scdm and a lcdm withomega =1). large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments andgalaxy clusters (gcs) on a scale of circa 5 mpc/h in both cases. energeticmotions, both residual of past accretion history and due to current asymmetricinflow along filaments, generate additional, common shocks on a scale of about1 mpc/h, which penetrate deep inside gcs. also collisions between substructuresinside gcs form merger shocks. consequently, the topology of the shocks is verycomplex and highly connected. during cosmic evolution the comoving shocksurface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process inboth scenarios. accretion shocks have very high mach numbers (10-10^3), whenphoto-heating of the pre-shock gas is not included. the typical shock speed isof order v_{sh}(z) =h(z)lambda_{nl}(z), with lambda_{nl}(z) the wavelengthscale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch. however, the machnumber for shocks occuring within clusters is usually smaller (3-10), due tothe fact that the intracluster gas is already hot. statistical fits of shockspeed around gcs as a function of gcs temperature give power-law's in accordwith 1-d predictions. however, a very different result is obtained for fits ofthe shock radius, reflecting the very complex shock structures forming in 3-dsimulations. the in-flowing kinetic energy across such shocks, giving the poweravailable for cosmic-ray acceleration, is comparable to the cluster x-rayluminosity emitted from a central region of radius 0.5 mpc/h. considering theirlarge size and long lifetimes, those shocks are potentially interesting sitesfor cosmic-ray acceleration, if modest magnetic fields exist within them.

astro-ph;0010253	cosmic mach number as a function of overdensity and galaxy age	we carry out an extensive study of the cosmic mach number (\mach) on scalesof r=5, 10 and 20h^-1mpc using an lcdm hydrodynamical simulation. weparticularly put emphasis on the environmental dependence of \mach onoverdensity, galaxy mass, and galaxy age. we start by discussing the differencein the resulting \mach according to different definitions of \mach anddifferent methods of calculation. the simulated mach numbers are slightly lowerthan the linear theory predictions even when a non-linear power spectrum wasused in the calculation, reflecting the non-linear evolution in the simulation.we find that the observed \mach is higher than the simulated mean by more than2-standard deviations, which suggests either that the local group is in arelatively low-density region or that the true value of \omega_m is ~ 0.2,significantly lower than the simulated value of 0.37. we show from oursimulation that the mach number is a weakly decreasing function of overdensity.we also investigate the correlations between galaxy age, overdensity and \machfor two different samples of galaxies --- dwarfs and giants. older systemscluster in higher density regions with lower \mach, while younger ones tend toreside in lower density regions with larger \mach, as expected from thehierarchical structure formation scenario. however, for dwarfs, the correlationis weakened by the fact that some of the oldest dwarfs are left over inlow-density regions during the structure formation history. for giant systems,one expects blue-selected samples to have higher \mach than red-selected ones.we briefly comment on the effect of the warm dark matter on the expected machnumber.

astro-ph;0010432	semi-analytical models for lensing by dark halos: i. splitting angles	we use the semi-analytical approach to analyze gravitational lensing ofquasars by dark halos in various cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies, in orderto determine the sensitivity of the prediction probabilities of imagesseparations to the input assumptions regarding halos and cosmologies. the massfunction of dark halos is assumed to be given by the press-schechter function.the mass density profile of dark halos is alternatively taken to be thesingular isothermal sphere (sis), the navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, or thegeneralized nfw profile. the cosmologies include: the einstein-de sitter model(scdm), the open model (ocdm), and the flat \lambda-model (lcdm). as expected,we find that the lensing probability is extremely sensitive to the mass densityprofile of dark halos, and somewhat less so to the mean mass density in theuniverse, and the amplitude of primordial fluctuations. nfw halos are very muchless effective in producing multiple images than sis halos. however, none ofthese models can completely explain the current observations: the sis modelspredict too many large splitting lenses, while the nfw models predict too fewsmall splitting lenses. this indicates that there must be at least twopopulations of halos in the universe. a combination of sis and nfw halos canreasonably reproduce the current observations if we choose the mass for thetransition from sis to nfw to be ~ 10^{13} solar masses. additionally, there isa tendency for cdm models to have too much power on small scales, i.e. too muchmass concentration; and it appears that the cures proposed for other apparentdifficulties of cdm would help here as well, an example being the warm darkmatter (wdm) variant which is shown to produce large splitting lenses fewerthan the corresponding cdm model by one order of magnitude.

astro-ph;0010436	limits on collisional dark matter from elliptical galaxies in clusters	the dynamical evolution of galaxies in clusters is modified if dark matter isself-interacting. heat conduction from the hot cluster halo leads toevaporation of the relatively cooler galactic halos. the stellar distributionwould adiabatically expand as it readjusts to the loss of dark matter, reducingthe velocity dispersion and increasing the half-light radius. if the darkmatter content within that radius was f_dm = 25-50% of the total, as indicatedby current observations, the ellipticals in clusters would be offset from thefundamental plane relation beyond the observational scatter. the requirementthat their halos survive for a hubble time appears to exclude just that rangeof the dark matter cross-section, 0.3 &lt; sigma/m &lt; 10^4 cm^2/g, thought to beoptimal for reducing central halo cusps, unless f_dm &lt; 15%. if thecross-section is allowed to vary with the relative velocity of dark matterparticles, sigma \propto v^{-2 delta}, a new problem of evaporation of darkmatter arises in the dwarf galaxies with low velocity dispersion. the halos oflarge galaxies in clusters and dwarf galaxies in the local group can bothsurvive only if delta &lt; 1.1 or delta &gt; 1.8. in either case the problem ofcentral density cusps remains.

astro-ph;0011376	evolution of the cluster mass function: gpc^3 dark matter simulations	high-resolution n-body simulations of four popular cold dark mattercosmologies (lcdm, ocdm, qcdm, and tilted scdm), each containing 10^5 clustersof galaxies in a cubic gigaparsec volume, are used to determine the evolutionof the cluster mass function from z=3 to z=0. the large volume and highresolution of these simulations allow an accurate measure of the evolution ofcosmologically important (but rare) massive clusters at high redshift. thesimulated mass function is presented for cluster masses within several radiitypically used observationally (r=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mpc/h, both comoving andphysical) in order to enable direct comparison with current and futureobservations. the simulated evolution is compared with current observations ofmassive clusters at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8. the omega_m=1 tilted scdm model, whichexhibits very rapid evolution of the cluster abundance, produces too fewclusters at z&gt;0.3 and no massive clusters at z&gt;0.5, in stark contradiction withobservations. the omega_m=0.3 models- lcdm, ocdm, and qcdm- all exhibitconsiderably weaker evolution and are consistent with current data. among theselow density models, ocdm evolves the least. these trends are enhanced at highredshift and can be used to discriminate between flat and open low densitymodels. the simulated mass functions are compared with the press-schechterapproximation. standard press-schechter predicts too many low mass clusters atz=0, and too few clusters at higher redshift. we modify the approximation by asimple parameterization of the density contrast threshold for collapse, whichhas a redshift dependence. this modified press-schechter approximation providesa good fit to the simulated mass functions.

astro-ph;0102180	evolution of the luminosity function and colors of galaxies in a  lambda-cdm universe	the luminosity function of galaxies is derived from a cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulation of a lambda cold dark matter (cdm) universe with theaid of a stellar population synthesis model. at z=0, the resulting b bandluminosity function has a flat faint end slope of \alpha \approx -1.15 with thecharacteristic luminosity and the normalization in a fair agreement withobservations, while the dark matter halo mass function is steep with a slope of\alpha \approx -2. the colour distribution of galaxies also agrees well withlocal observations. we also discuss the evolution of the luminosity function,and the colour distribution of galaxies from z=0 to 5. a large evolution of thecharacteristic mass in the stellar mass function due to number evolution iscompensated by luminosity evolution; the characteristic luminosity increasesonly by 0.8 mag from z=0 to 2, and then declines towards higher redshift, whilethe b band luminosity density continues to increase from z=0 to 5 (but onlyslowly at z&gt;3).

astro-ph;0102304	constraints on warm dark matter from cosmological reionization	we study the constraints that high-redshift structure formation in theuniverse places on warm dark matter (wdm) dominated cosmological models. wemodify the extended press-schechter formalism to derive the halo mass functionin wdm models. we show that our predictions agree with recent numericalsimulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. applying ourmodel to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power onsmall scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, resultsin strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion v_rms of the wdmparticles at z=0. for fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits areequivalent to constraints on the mass m_x of the particles. the presence of a 4billion solar mass black hole at z=5.8, believed to power the quasar sdss1044-1215, implies m_x &gt; 0.5 kev (or v_rms &lt; 0.10 km/s), assuming that thequasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the eddington limit. reionizationby z=5.8 also implies a limit on m_x. if high-redshift galaxies produceionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their z=3 counterparts, we findm_x &gt; 1.2 kev (or v_rms &lt; 0.03 km/s). however, given the uncertainties incurrent measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background atredshift 3, values of m_x as low as 0.75 kev (v_rms = 0.06 km/s) are not ruledout. the limit weakens further if, instead, the ionizing-photon productionefficiency is greater at high z, but this limit will tighten considerably ifreionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. wdmmodels with m_x &lt; 1 kev (v_rms &gt; 0.04 km/s) produce a low-luminosity cutoff inthe high-redshift galaxy luminosity function which is directly detectable withthe next generation space telescope (abridged).

astro-ph;0103050	warm dark matter, small scale crisis, and the high redshift universe	warm dark matter (wdm) models have recently been resurrected to resolveapparent conflicts of cold dark matter (dm) models with observations. endowingthe dm particles with non-negligible velocities causes free-streaming, whichsuppresses the primordial power spectrum on small scales. the choice of aroot-mean-square velocity dispersion v(rms) = 0.05 km/s at redshift z=0(corresponding to a particle mass of 1 kev if the wdm particles are fermionsdecoupling while relativistic) helps alleviate most, but probably not all, ofthe small-scale problems faced by cdm. an important side-effect of the particlevelocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at highredshift. this is caused both by the loss of small-scale power, and by thedelay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos (with masses near theeffective jeans mass of the dm). the presence of early halos is required inorder (1) to host either early quasars or galaxies that can reionize theuniverse by redshift z=5.8, and (2) to allow the growth of the supermassiveblack hole believed to power the recently discovered quasar sdss 1044-1215 atthis redshift. we quantify these constraints using a modified press-schechterformalism, and find v(rms) &lt; 0.04 km/s (or m_x &gt; 1 kev). if future observationsuncover massive black holes at z &gt; 10, or reveal that reionization occurred atz &gt; 10, this could conclusively rule out wdm models as the solution to thesmall-scale crisis of the cdm paradigm.

astro-ph;0103149	rayleigh scattering and microwave background fluctuations	during the recombination epoch, cosmic background photons couple not only tofree electrons through thompson scattering, but also to the neutral hydrogenthrough rayleigh scattering. this latter is ~2% effect for photons near thepeak of the photon energy distribution at z=800 and a ~0.2% effect at z=1100.including rayleigh scattering in the calculation reduces silk damping at fixedredshift, alters the position of the surface of last scattering and alters thepropagation of acoustic waves. we estimate the amplitude of these effects. forthe microwave anisotropy probe (map), rayleigh scattering increases theanisotropy spectrum by 0.1% at the most. for the highest frequencies of theplanck surveyor, the effects of rayleigh scattering are much more dramatic(decreasing the anisotropy spectrum by 3% at \nu~550ghz and l~1000). therelative difference between the spectra of low and high frequencies is imposedby an oscillation with a function of multipole l and the oscillation amplitudeis up to 0.5% between 100 and 550ghz. rayleigh scattering also slows thedecoupling between radiation and matter, but the effect is undetectably small.

astro-ph;0103359	the expected mass function for low mass galaxies in a cdm cosmology: is  there a problem?	it is well known that the mass function for_halos_ in cdm cosmology is arelatively steep power law for low masses, possibly too steep to be consistentwith observations. but how steep is the_galaxy_ mass function? we have analyzedthe stellar and gas mass functions of the first massive luminous objects formedin a \lambda cdm universe, as calculated in the numerical simulation describedin gnedin (2000ab). we found that while the dark matter mass function is steep,the stellar and gas mass functions are flatter for low mass objects. thestellar mass function is consistently flat at the low mass end. moreover, whilethe gas mass function follows the dark matter mass function until reionizationat z~7, between z=7 and z=4, the gas mass function also flattens considerablyat the low mass end. at z=4, the gas and stellar mass functions are fit by aschechter function with \alpha ~ -1.2 +/- 0.1, significantly shallower than thedark matter halo mass function and consistent with some recent observations.the baryonic mass functions are shallower because (a) the dark matter halo massfunction is consistent with the press-schechter formulation at low masses n(m)  m^-2 and (b) heating/cooling and ionization processes appear to cause baryonsto collect in halos with the relationship m_b m_d^4 at low masses. combining(a) and (b) gives n(m_b) m_b^-5/4, comparable to the simulation results. thus,the well known observational fact that low mass galaxies are underabundant ascompared to expectations from numerical dark matter simulations orpress-schechter modeling of cdm universes emerges naturally from these results,implying that perhaps no ``new physics'' beyond the standard model is needed.

astro-ph;0106204	revealing the warm-hot intergalactic medium with ovi absorption	hydrodynamic simulations of growth of cosmic structure suggest that 30-50% ofthe total baryons at z=0 may be in a warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) withtemperatures ~10^5-10^7k. the o vi \lambda \lambda 1032, 1038 absorption linedoublet in the fuv portion of qso spectra provides an important probe of thisgas. utilizing recent hydrodynamic simulations, it is found that there shouldbe ~5 o vi absorption lines per unit redshift with equivalent widths &gt;= 35 ma,decreasing rapidly to ~0.5 per unit redshift at &gt;= 350 ma. about 10% of thetotal baryonic matter or 20-30% of the whim is expected to be in the o viabsorption line systems with equivalent width &gt;= 20 ma; the remaining whim gasmay be too hot or have too low metallicity to be detected in o vi. we find thatthe simulation results agree well with observations with regard to the lineabundance and total mass contained in these systems. some of the o vi systemsare collisionally ionized and some are photoionized, but most of the mass is inthe collisionally ionized systems. we show that the gas that produces the o viabsorption lines does not reside in virialized regions such as galaxies,groups, or clusters of galaxies, but rather has an overdensity of 10-40 timesthe average density. these regions form a somewhat connected network offilaments. the typical metallicity of these regions is 0.1-0.3zsun.

astro-ph;0108203	observational constraints on the self interacting dark matter scenario  and the growth of supermassive black holes	we consider the consequences of sidm for a velocity dependent cross sectionper unit mass. accretion of sidm onto seed black holes can produce supermassiveblack holes that are too large for certain combinations of parameters,which isused to obtain a new constraint on the dark matter interaction. constraints dueto other considerations are presented and previous ones are generalized. theblack hole constraint is extremely sensitive to the slope \alpha, of the innerdensity profile of dark halos. for the most probable value of \alpha=1.3, thereexists a narrow range in parameter space, such that all constraints aresatisfied. however, the adiabatic compression of the dark halo by baryons asthey cool and contract in normal galaxies yields a steeper cusp, \alpha=1.7.this gives a tighter constraint, which would exclude sidm as a possiblesolution to the purported problems with cdm in the absence of other dynamicalprocesses. nevertheless, sidm with parameters consistent with this strongerconstraint, can explain the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the centersof galaxies. a ``best fit'' model is presented which reproduces thesupermassive black hole masses and their observed correlations with thevelocity dispersion of the host bulges. specifically, the fourth powerdependence of black hole mass on velocity dispersion is a direct consequence ofthe power spectrum having an index of n=-2. although the dark matter collisionrates for this model are too small to directly remedy problems with cdm,mergers between dark halos harboring supermassive black holes at high redshiftcould ameliorate the cuspy halo problem. this scenario also explains the lackof comparable supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies like m33.

astro-ph;0203524	metallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha systems in lambda cdm  cosmology	utilizing a new, high mass resolution hydrodynamic simulation we compute themetallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) and find areasonable agreement with observations. in particular, the observed slowevolution of the dla metallicity occurs naturally in the simulation due to thecombined effects of physical and observational selection. the slow metallicityevolution is caused by the steady transformation, with increasing time, of thehighest metallicity systems to "galaxies", thus depleting this category, whileall the lower metallicity systems show, individually, an increase inmetallicity. although the trend of dla metallicity with redshift is in goodagreement with observations, it appears that the average metallicity ofsimulated dlas is higher than observed by 0.3-0.5 dex in the probed redshiftrange (z=0-5). our study indicates that this difference may be attributed toobservational selection effects due to dust obscuration. if we allow for a dustobscuration effect, our model reproduces the observed metallicity evolution inboth amplitude and slope. we find that dlas are not a simple population butprobe a range of different systems and the mix changes with redshift. about 50%of all metals in the gaseous phase is in dlas at all times from z=5 to z=1,making a rapid downturn at z\le 1 to ~20% by z=0, as metals are swept into thehotter components of the igm as well as locked up in stars. while not theprimary focus of this study, we find that the model provides good matches toobservations with respect to column density distribution and evolution ofneutral gas content, if the same dust obscuration is taken into account. wefind omega_{dla,comp}=(1-3)e-3, depending on the effect of dust obscuration.

astro-ph;0208555	compton heated outflow from cdafs	convection-dominated accretion flows (cdaf) are expected to have a shallowerdensity profile and a higher radiation efficiency as compared toadvection-dominated accretion flows (adaf). both solutions have been developedto account for the observed properties of the low luminosity, high temperaturex-ray sources believed to involve accretion onto massive black holes.self-similar cdafs also have steeper poloidal density gradients andtemperatures close to the virial temperature. all these characteristics makecdafs more capable of producing polar outflows driven by compton heating ascompared to other classical accretion disks. we investigate the conditions forproducing such outflows in cdafs and look for the mass accretion rate, or,equally, the luminosity of cdafs for which such outflows will exist. when theelectron temperature saturates around 10^11 k at the inner region, polaroutflows are probable for 8x10^-7 &lt;~ l/l_e &lt;~ 4x10^-5, where l_e is theeddington luminosity. outflows are well collimated with small opening angles.the luminosity range for which outflow solutions exist is narrower for lowerelectron temperature flows and disappears completely for electron temperature&lt;~ 6x10^9 k. when the magnetic field is present, we find that outflows arepossible if the magnetic field is less than from 10% to 1% of the equipartitionfield. we also find that outflows are more likely to be produced when theviscosity parameter alpha is small. the tendency for jet-like collimatedoutflows for these solutions is presumably astrophysically relevant given thehigh frequency of jets from agns.

astro-ph;0212310	gravitational lensing by a compound population of halos: standard models	based on observed rotation curves of galaxies and theoretical simulations ofdark matter halos, there are reasons for believing that at least threedifferent types of dark matter halos exist in the universe classified by theirmasses m and the inner slope of mass density -\alpha: population a (galaxies):10^{10} h^{-1} m_\odot &lt; m &lt; 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} m_\odot, \alpha = 2;population b (cluster halos): m &gt; 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} m_\odot, \alpha =1.3; and population c (dwarf halos): m &lt; 10^{10} h^{-1} m_\odot, \alpha = 1.3.in this paper we calculate the lensing probability produced by such a compoundpopulation of dark halos, for both image separation and time delay, assumingthat the mass function of halos is given by the press-schechter function andthe universe is described by an lcdm, ocdm, or scdm model. the lcdm model isnormalized to the wmap observations, ocdm and scdm models are normalized to theabundance of rich clusters. we compare the predictions of the differentcosmological models with observational data and show that, both lcdm and ocdmmodels are marginally consistent with the current available data, but the scdmmodel is ruled out. the fit of the compound model to the observed correlationbetween splitting angle and time delay is excellent but the fit to the numbervs splitting angle relation is only adequate using the small number of sourcesin the objective jvas/class survey. a larger survey of the same type would havegreat power in discriminating among cosmological models. furthermore,population c in an lcdm model has a unique signature in the time domain, anadditional peak at ~3 seconds potentially observable in grbs, which makes itdistinguishable from variants of cdm scenarios, such as warm dark matter,repulsive dark matter, or collisional dark matter.

astro-ph;0304129	reasoning from fossils: learning from the local black hole population  about the evolution of quasars	we discuss a simple model for the growth of supermassive black holes (bhs) atthe center of spheroidal stellar systems. in particular, we assess thehypotheses that (1) star formation in spheroids and bh fueling are proportionalto one another, and (2) the bh accretion luminosity stays near the eddingtonlimit during luminous quasar phases. with the aid of this simple model, we areable to interpret many properties of the qso luminosity function, including thepuzzling steep decline of the characteristic luminosity from redshift z=2 to toz=0: indeed the residual star formation in spheroidal systems is today limitedto a small number of bulges, characterized by stellar velocity dispersions afactor of 2-3 smaller those of the elliptical galaxies hosting qsos at z &gt; 2. asimple consequence of our hypotheses is that the redshift evolution of the qsoemissivity and of the star formation history in spheroids should be roughlyparallel. we find this result to be broadly consistent with our knowledge ofthe evolution of both the global star formation rate, and of the evolution ofthe qso emissivity, but we identify interesting discrepancies at both low andhigh redshifts, to which we offer tentative solutions. finally, our hypothesesallow us to present a robust method to derive the duty cycle of qso activity,based on the observed qso luminosity function, and on the present-day relationbetween the masses of supermassive bhs and those of their spheroidal hoststellar systems. the duty cycle is found to be substantially less than unity,with characteristic values in the range (3-6)x10^(-3), and we compute that theaverage bolometric radiative efficiency is epsilon=0.07. finally, we find thatthe growth in mass of individual black holes at high redshift (z&gt;2) can bedominated by mergers, and is therefore not necessarily limited by accretion.

astro-ph;0306088	giant arc statistics in concordance with a concordance lcdm universe	the frequency of giant arcs - highly distorted and strongly gravitationallylensed background galaxies - is a powerful test for cosmological models.previous comparisons of arc statistics for the currently favored concordancecosmological model (a flat lambda-dominated universe) with observations haveshown an apparently large discrepancy. we present here new ray-shootingresults, based on a high resolution (1024^3 particles in a 320 mpc/h box)large-scale structure simulation normalized to the wmap observations. we followlight rays through a pseudo-3d matter distribution approximated by up to 38lens planes, and evaluate the occurrence of arcs for various source redshifts.we find that the frequency of strongly lensed background sources is a steepfunction of source redshift: the optical depth for giant arcs increases by afactor of five when the background sources are moved from redshift z_s = 1.0 toz_s = 1.5. this is a consequence of a moderate decrease of the critical surfacemass density for lensing, combined with the very steep cluster mass function atthe high mass end. our results are consistent with those of bartelmann et al.(1998) if we - as they did - restrict all sources to be exactly at z_s = 1. butif we allow for a more realistic distribution of source redshifts extending toor beyond z_s &gt; 1.5, the apparent discrepancy vanishes: the frequency of arcsis increased by about a factor of ten as compared to previous estimates, andresults in roughly one arc per 20 square degrees over the sky. this predictionfor an lcdm model is then in good agreement with the observed frequency ofarcs. hence we consider the ``missing arc'' problem for a concordance lcdmcosmology to be solved.

astro-ph;0403352	properties of cold dark matter halos at z&gt;6	we compute the properties of dark matter halos with mass $10^{6.5}-10^9\msun$at redshift $z=6-11$ in the standard cold dark matter cosmological model,utilizing a very high resolution n-body simulation. we find that dark matterhalos in these mass and redshift ranges are significantly biased over matterwith a bias factor in the range 2-6. the dark matter halo mass functiondisplays a slope of $2.05\pm 0.15$ at the small mass end. we do not find auniversal dark matter density profile. instead, we find a significantdependence of the central density profile of dark matter halos on halo mass andepoch with $\alpha_0=0.4-1.0$; the high-mass ($m\ge 10^8\msun$) low-redshift($z\sim 6$) halos occupy the high end of the range and low-mass ($m\sim10^{7}\msun$) high-redshift ($z\sim 11$) halos occupy the low end.additionally, for fixed mass and epoch there is a significant dispersion in$\alpha_0$ due to the stochastic assembly of halos. our results fit arelationship of the form$\alpha_0=0.75((1+z)/7.0)^{-1.25}(m/10^7\msun)^{0.11(1+z)/7.0}$ with adispersion about this fit of $\pm 0.5$ and no systematic dependence of variancecorrelated with environment. the median spin parameter of dark matter halos is$0.03-0.04$ but with a large lognormal dispersion of $\sim 0.4$. variousquantities are tabulated or fitted with empirical formulae.

astro-ph;0404318	x-ray preionisation powered by accretion on the first black holes. ii:  cosmological simulations and observational signatures	we use cosmological simulations to study the x-ray ionisation and heating ofthe intergalactic medium by an early population of accreting black holes. byconsidering observational constraints from the x-ray background, we find anupper limit for the optical depth to thompson scattering tau_e~0.17. theredshifted soft x-ray background from these early sources produces:(i) fullyionised atomic hydrogen in the low density intergalactic medium before redshiftz~7 (consequently stellar reionisation is characterised by an instantaneousoverlap phase of hii regions),(ii) a second heii reionisation at z~3 and (iii)heats the intergalactic medium to near 10000 k at low redshifts. the typicalluminosity in the soft x-ray band of the galaxies hosting the black holes isabout one order of magnitude below the sensitivity limit of the chandra deepfield. about a thousand of these sources may be present per square arcmin ofthe sky, producing detectable fluctuations. few rarer objects could be luminousenough to be visible in the chandra deep field. xeus and con-x satellites willbe able to detect more of these sources that, if radio loud, could be used tostudy the 21cm forest in absorption.a signature of an early x-ray preionisationis the production of secondary cmb anisotropies on small angular scales. wefind that in these models the power spectrum of temperature fluctuationsincreases with decreasing angular scale (dt~16 muk at 1arcsec scales), whilefor stellar reionisation scenarios the power decreases on smaller scales. wealso show that the redshifted 21 cm radiation from neutral hydrogen can bemarginally detected in emission at redshifts 7&lt;z&lt;12. at a redshift of aboutz~30 a stronger and narrower (in redshift space) signal in absorption againstthe cmb, that is peculiar to these models,could be detectable.[abridged]

astro-ph;0405147	gravitational lensing in a concordance lcdm universe: the importance of  secondary matter along the line of sight	to date, in almost all strong gravitational lensing analyses for modelinggiant arc systems and multiple quasar images, it has been assumed that all thedeflecting matter is concentrated in one lens plane at a certain distance - thethin lens approximation. however, in a few observed cases, lenses at more thanone redshift have been identified as contributing to the image splitting.  here we report on a quantitative investigation of the importance andfrequency of significant multiple lensing agents. we use multi-lens planesimulations to evaluate how frequently two or more lens planes combined areessential for multiple imaging, as compared with the cases where a single lensplane alone provides enough focusing to be supercritical.  we find that the fraction of cases for which more than one lens planecontributes significantly to a multi-image lensing situation is a strongfunction of source redshift. for sources at redshift unity, 95% of lensesinvolve only a single mass concentration, but for a more typical scenario with,e.g., a source at a redshift of z_s = 3.8, as many as 38% of the stronglylensed quasars/arcs occur because of a significant matter contribution from oneor more additional lens planes. in the 30% to 40% of cases when additionalplanes make a significant contribution, the surface mass density of the primarylens will be overestimated by about 15% to 20%, if the additional contributionsare not recognized.

astro-ph;0407143	signatures of galactic superwinds: inhomogeneous metal enrichment of the  lyman alpha forest	we investigate possible signatures of feedback from galactic superwinds onthe metallicity of the lyman alpha forest, using a set of high resolutionhydrodynamic simulations of a lambda cold dark matter model. simulationsproduce metals self-consistently, based on one single parameter, the metalyield, which in turn is constrained by metallicity in the intra-cluster gas. wefollow metals as a separate density species. for the metallicity of lyman alphaclouds with column density of n_{hi}~10^{14.5}-10^{15.5}/cm^2 at z=2-4 we findreasonable agreement between simulations, both with and without gsw, andobservations (schaye et al). a unique signature and sensitive test of gsw is,however, provided by lower density regions with gas density of \rho/&lt;\rho&gt; =0.01-1.0 and a corresponding column density of 10^{12}-10^{14}/cm^2. withoutgsw we predict that both the mean and median metallicity of \lya clouds in thiscolumn density range at z=2-4 should have z&lt;10^{3}zsun, since these smallsystems support little star formation. gsw contaminate these regions, however,and also there is a significant fraction (~25%) of lyman alpha clouds in thiscolumn density range which have a high metallicity excess of 10^{-2}zsun,resulting in a mean metallicity of ~10^{-2}zsun. in addition, we find thatthere is a minimum in the median metallicity for clouds ofn_{hi}~10^{13}-10^{14}/cm^2 in the case with gsw, whereas without gsw themetallicity decreases monotonically and rapidly with decreasing column density.finally, we predict that the ratio of secondary (e.g., n) to primary metals(e.g., o,c) is expected to be smaller by a factor of 10 in clouds ofn_{hi}~10^{14.5}/cm^2 compared to that in large galaxies; this factor increasesto &gt;50 for n_{hi}&lt; 10^{13.5}/cm^2.

astro-ph;0411344	massive galaxies at redshift 2 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations	we study the properties of galaxies at z=2 in a lambda cold dark matteruniverse, using two different types of hydrodynamic simulation methods --eulerian tvd and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) -- and aspectrophotometric analysis in the u_n, g, r filter set. the simulated galaxiesat z=2 satisfy the color-selection criteria proposed by adelberger et al.(2004) and steidel et al. (2004) when we assume calzetti extinction withe(b-v)=0.15. we find that the number density of simulated galaxies brighterthan r&lt;25.5 at z=2 is about 1e-2 h^3 mpc^-3 for e(b-v)=0.15, which is roughlytwice that of the number density found by erb et al. (2004) for the uv brightsample. this suggests that roughly half of the massive galaxies with m*&gt;10^{10}msun/h at z=2 are uv bright population, and the other half is bright in theinfra-red wavelengths. the most massive galaxies at z=2 have stellar masses &gt;=10^{11-12} msun. they typically have been continuously forming stars with arate exceeding 30 msun/yr over a few gyrs from z=10 to z=2, together withsignificant contribution by starbursts reaching up to 1000 msun/yr which lie ontop of the continuous component. tvd simulations indicate a more sporadic starformation history than the sph simulations. our results do not imply thathierarchical galaxy formation fails to account for the observed massivegalaxies at z&gt;=1. the global star formation rate density in our simulationspeaks at z&gt;=5, a much higher redshift than predicted by the semianalyticmodels. this star formation history suggests early build-up of the stellar massdensity, and predicts that 70 (50, 30)% of the total stellar mass at z=0 hadalready been formed by z=1 (2, 3). upcoming observations by spitzer and swiftmight help to better constrain the star formation history at high redshift.

astro-ph;0411587	simulations of strong gravitational lensing with substructure	galactic sized gravitational lenses are simulated by combining a cosmologicaln-body simulation and models for the baryonic component of the galaxy. the lenscaustics, critical curves, image locations and magnification ratios arecalculated by ray-shooting on an adaptive grid. when the source is near a cuspin a smooth lens' caustic the sum of the magnifications of the three closestimages should be close to zero. it is found that in the observed cases this sumis generally too large to be consistent with the simulations implying thatthere is not enough substructure in the simulations. this suggests that otherfactors play an important role. these may include limited numerical resolution,lensing by structure outside the halo, selection bias and the possibility thata randomly selected galaxy halo may be more irregular, for example due torecent mergers, than the isolated halo used in this study. it is also shownthat, with the level of substructure computed from the n-body simulations, theimage magnifications of the einstein cross type lenses are very weak functionsof source size up to $\sim 1\kpc$. this is also true for the magnificationratios of widely separated images in the fold and cusp caustic lenses. thismeans that selected magnification ratios for different the emission regions ofa lensed quasar should agree with each other, barring microlensing by stars.the source size dependence of the magnification ratio between the closest pairof images is more sensitive to substructure.

astro-ph;0502001	massive galaxies &amp; eros at z=1-3 in cosmological hydrodynamic  simulations: near-ir properties	recent observations have revealed a population of red massive galaxies athigh redshift which are challenging to explain in hierarchical galaxy formationmodels. we analyze this ``massive galaxy problem'' with two different types ofhydrodynamic simulations -- eulerian tvd and sph -- of a concordance lambda cdmuniverse. we consider two separate but connected aspects of the problem posedby these extremely red objects (eros): (1) the mass-scale, and (2) red colors.we perform spectrophotometric analyses of simulated galaxies in b, z, r, i, js,ks, k filters, and compare their near-ir properties with observations atredshift z=1-3. we find that the simulated galaxies brighter than the magnitudelimit of k_vega=20 mag have stellar masses mstar &gt;= 10^{11} msun/h and a numberdensity of a few \times 10^{-4} h^3 mpc^{-3} at z~2, in good agreement with theobserved number density in the k20 survey. therefore, our hydrodynamicsimulations do not exhibit the ``mass-scale problem''. the answer to the``redness problem'' is less clear because of our poor knowledge of the amountof dust extinction in eros and the uncertain fraction of star-forming eros.however, our simulations can account for the observed comoving number densityof ~ 1e-4 mpc^{-3} at z=1-2 if we assume a uniform extinction of e(b-v)=0.4 forthe entire population of simulated galaxies. the critical question of theexistence of a significant population of old, passively evolving massive erosshould continue to be tested with future hydrodynamic simulations. upcomingobservations of the thermal emission of dust in 24 micron by the spitzer spacetelescope will help to better estimate the dust content of eros at z=1-3, andthus to further constrain the star formation history of the universe, andtheoretical models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0503674	galactic wind effects on the lyman-alpha absorption in the vicinity of  galaxies	we present predictions of ly-alpha forest-galaxy correlations at z=3 fromeulerian simulations that include the effects of galactic winds, drivenprimarily by supernova explosions. galactic winds produce expanding bubbles ofshock-heated gas within ~0.5 comoving mpc/h of luminous galaxies in thesimulation, which have space density similar to that of observed lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). however, most of the low-density intergalactic gas thatdetermines the observed properties of the ly-alpha forest is unaffected bywinds. the impact of winds on the ly-alpha optical depth near galaxies is lessdramatic than their impact on gas temperature because winds heat only a smallfraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies.hence, ly-alpha absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out overthe same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas. in general, ly-alphaabsorption is expected to be stronger than average near galaxies because of thehigh gas density. winds result in a modest reduction of this expected increaseof ly-alpha absorption. our predictions can be compared to future observationsto detect the wind effects and infer their strength, although with the caveatthat the results are still dependent on the correspondence of simulatedgalaxies and observed lbgs. we find that wind effects in our simulations arenot strong enough to reproduce the high ly-alpha transmission within 0.5 mpc/hcomoving of galaxies that has been suggested by recent observations; powerfulgalactic explosions or ejecta with hyper-escape velocities would be required,but these are unlikely to be produced by ordinary star formation and supernovaealone

astro-ph;0504334	a simple and accurate model for intra-cluster gas	starting with the well-known nfw dark matter halo distribution, we constructa simple polytropic model for the intracluster medium which is in goodagreement with high resolution numerical hydrodynamical simulations, apply thismodel to a very large scale concordance dark matter simulation, and compare theresulting global properties with recent observations of x-ray clusters,including the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. we makeallowances for a non-negligible surface pressure, removal of low entropy (shortcooling time) gas, energy injection due to feedback, and for a relativistic(non-thermal) pressure component. a polytropic index n=5 (gamma=1.2) provides agood approximation to the internal gas structure of massive clusters (except inthe very central regions where cooling becomes important), and allows one torecover the observed m_500-t, l_x-t, and t/n_e^{2/3} ~ t^0.65 relations. usingthese concepts and generalizing this method so that it can be applied to fullythree-dimensional n-body simulations, one can predict the global x-ray and szetrends for any specified cosmological model. we find a good fit to observationswhen assuming that twelve percent of the initial baryonic mass condenses intostars, the fraction of rest mass of this condensed component transferred backto the remaining gas (feedback) is 3.9e-5, and the fraction of total pressurefrom a nonthermal component is near ten percent.

astro-ph;0612663	accurate realizations of the ionized gas in galaxy clusters: calibrating  feedback	using the full, three-dimensional potential of galaxy cluster halos (drawnfrom an n-body simulation of the current, most favored cosmology), thedistribution of the x-ray emitting gas is found by assuming a polytropicequation of state and hydrostatic equilibrium, with constraints fromconservation of energy and pressure balance at the cluster boundary. theresulting properties of the gas for these simulated redshift zero clusters (thetemperature distribution, mass-temperature and luminosity-temperaturerelations, and the gas fraction) are compared with observations in the x-ray ofnearby clusters. the observed properties are reproduced only under theassumption that substantial energy injection from non-gravitational sources hasoccurred. our model does not specify the source, but star formation and agn maybe capable of providing this energy, which amounts to 3 to 5 x10^{-5} of therest mass in stars (assuming ten percent of the gas initially in the clusterforms stars). with the method described here it is possible to generaterealistic x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster maps and catalogs from n-bodysimulations, with the distributions of internal halo properties (and theirtrends with mass, location, and time) taken into account.

astro-ph;0702535	are disk galaxies the progenitors of giant ellipticals?	a popular formation scenario for giant elliptical galaxies proposes that theymight have formed from binary mergers of disk galaxies. difficulties with thescenario that emerged from earlier studies included providing the necessarystellar mass and metallicity, maintaining the tight color-magnitude relationand avoiding phase space limits. in this paper we revisit the issue and putconstraints on the binary disc merger scenario based on the stellar populationsof disc galaxies. we draw the following conclusions: low redshift collisionlessor gaseous mergers of present day milky way like disc galaxies do not formpresent day elliptical galaxies. binary mergers of the progenitors of presentday milky way like disc galaxies can have evolved into intermediate masselliptical galaxies ($m &lt; m_*$) if they have merged earlier than $\approx$ 3-4gyrs ago. assuming that most present day disk galaxies formed in a similar wayto the milky way model presented here, more massive giant ellipticals ingeneral can not have formed from binary mergers of the progenitors of presentday disc galaxies. a major reason for these conclusions is that the mass inmetals of typical disk galaxy is approximately a factor of 4-8 smaller than themass in metals of a typical early-type galaxy and this ratio grows to largervalues with increasing redshift.

astro-ph;9404011	a hydrodynamic approach to cosmology: the mixed dark matter cosmological  scenario	we compute the evolution of spatially flat, mixed cold and hot dark matter(``mdm") models containing both baryonic matter and two kinds of dark matter.the mean final zeldovich-sunyaev $y$ parameter is estimated to be $\bary=(5.4\pm 2.7)\times 10^{-7}$, with a rms fluctuation of approximately$\bar{\delta y}=(6.0\pm 3.0)\times 10^{-7}$ on arc minute scales. the rate ofgalaxy formation peaks at an even later epoch ($z\sim 0.3$) than in thestandard ($\omega=1$, $\sigma_8=0.67$) cdm model ($z\sim 0.5$) and, at aredshift of z=4 is nearly a factor of a hundred lower than for the cdm modelwith the same value of $\sigma_8$. the model yields a cluster mass functionwhich is about a factor of 4 higher than observed but a cluster-clustercorrelation length lower by a factor of 2 than what is observed but both arecloser to observations than in the cobe normalized cdm model. the onedimensional pairwise velocity dispersion is $605\pm 8$km/s at $1h^{-1}$separation, lower than that of the cdm model normalized to cobe, but stillsignificantly higher than observations (davis \&amp; peebles 1983). a plausiblevelocity bias $b_v=0.8\pm 0.1$ on this scale will reduce but not remove thediscrepancy. overall, the model is similar both on large and intermediatescales to the standard cdm model normalized to the same value of $\sigma_8$,but the problem with regard to late formation of galaxies is more severe inthis model than in that cdm model. adding hot dark matter significantlyimproves the ability of cobe normalized cdm scenario to fit existingobservations, but the model is in fact not as good as the cdm model with thesame $\sigma_8$ and is still probably unsatisfactory with regard to severalcritical tests.

astro-ph;9404012	x-ray clusters in a cdm$+\lambda$ universe: a direct, large-scale, high  resolution, hydrodynamic simulation	a new, three-dimensional, shock capturing, tvd hydrodynamic code is utilizedto determine the distribution of hot gas in a cdm$+\lambda$ model universe.this open model succeeds in matching local observations of clusters in contrastto the standard $\omega=1$, cdm model, which fails. it predicts an order ofmagnitude decline in the number density of bright ($h\nu = 2-10$kev) clustersfrom $z=0$ to $z=2$ in contrast to a slight increase in the number density forstandard $\omega=1$, cdm model. this cobe-normalized cdm$+\lambda$ modelproduces approximately the same number of x-ray clusters having$l_x&gt;10^{43}$erg/s as observed. the number density of bright clusters increasesto $z\sim 0.2-0.5$ and declines, but the luminosity per typical clusterdecreases monotonically with redshift, with the result that the number densityof bright clusters shows a broad peak near $z=0.5$, and then a rapid decline as$z\rightarrow 3$. the most interesting point which we find is that thetemperatures of clusters in this model freeze out at later times ($z\le 0.3$),while previously we found in the cdm model that there was a steep increaseduring the same interval of redshift. the trend should be detectable even witha relatively ``soft" x-ray instrument such as rosat, providing a powerfuldiscriminant between $\omega=1$ and $\omega&lt;1$ models. examining the ratio ofgas-to-total mass in the clusters, we find a slight antibias ($b=0.9$ or$({\omega_{gas}\over\omega_{tot}})_{cl} =0.083\pm 0.007$), which is consistentwith observations [$({\omega_{gas}\over\omega_{tot}})_{obs}=0.097\pm 0.019$ forthe coma cluster for the given value of $h$, \cf, white 1991].

(1991) and nityananda and padmanabhan (1994) have made anattempt in this direction by relating the mean relative pair velocities to themean correlation function in a useful manner. we investigate this relation andother closely related issues in detail for the case of six different powerspectra: power laws with spectral indexes $n=-2,-1$, cold dark matter (cdm),and hot dark matter models with density parameter $\omega=1$; cdm including acosmological constant ($\lambda$) with $\omega_{cdm}=0.4$,$\omega_{\lambda}=0.6$; and $n=-1$ model with $\omega=0.1$. we find that: (i)power law spectra lead to self-similar evolution in an $\omega=1$ universe.(ii) stable clustering does not hold in an $\omega=1$ universe to the extentour simulations can ascertain. (iii) stable clustering is a betterapproximation in the case of $\omega&lt;1$ universe in which structure formationfreezes out at some low redshift. (iv) the relation between dimensionless pairvelocity and the mean correlation function, $\bar\xi$, is only approximatelyindependent of the shape of the power spectrum. at the nonlinear end, theasymptotic value of the dimensionless pair velocity decreases with increasingsmall scale power, because the stable clustering assumption is not universallytrue. (v) the relation between the evolved $\bar\xi$ and the linear regime$\bar\xi$ is also not universal but shows a weak spectrum dependence. wepresent simple theoretical arguments for these conclusions.

astro-ph;9506052	topology of large-scale structure by galaxy type: hydrodynamic  simulations	the topology of large scale structure is studied as a function of galaxy typeusing the genus statistic. in hydrodynamical cosmological cdm simulations,galaxies form on caustic surfaces (zeldovich pancakes) then slowly drain ontofilaments and clusters. the earliest forming galaxies in the simulations(defined as ``ellipticals") are thus seen at the present epoch preferentiallyin clusters (tending toward a meatball topology), while the latest forminggalaxies (defined as ``spirals") are seen currently in a spongelike topology.the topology is measured by the genus (= number of ``donut" holes - number ofisolated regions) of the smoothed density-contour surfaces. the measured genuscurve for all galaxies as a function of density obeys approximately thetheoretical curve expected for random-phase initial conditions, but the earlyforming elliptical galaxies show a shift toward a meatball topology relative tothe late forming spirals. simulations using standard biasing schemes fail toshow such an effect. large observational samples separated by galaxy type couldbe used to test for this effect.

astro-ph;9612127	reionization of the universe and the early production of metals	we simulate a plausible cosmological model in considerable physical andnumerical detail through the successive phases of reheating (at 10&lt;z&lt;20),formation of pop iii stars at z=15 (due to molecular hydrogen cooling), withsubsequent reionization at z=7. we assume an efficiency of high mass starformation appropriate to leave the universe, after it becomes transparent, withan ionizing background j_21=0.4 (at z=4), near (and perhaps slightly below) theobserved value. since the same stars produce the ionizing radiation and thefirst generation of heavy elements, a mean metallicity of z/z_\sun=1/200 isproduced in this early phase, but there is a large variation about this mean,with the high density regions having z/z_\sun=1/30 and low density regionsessentially no metals.  reionization, when it occurs, is very rapid, which will leave a signaturewhich may be detectable by very large area meter-wavelength radio instruments.also, the background uv radiation field will show a sharp drop from 1ryd to4ryd due to absorption edges.  the simulated volume is too small to form l_* galaxies, but the smallerobjects which are found in the simulation obey the faber-jackson relation.  in order to explore theoretically this domain of "the end of the dark ages"quantitatively, numerical simulations must have a mass resolution of the orderof 10^{4.5} m_\sun} in baryons, high spatial resolution (1 kpc) to resolvestrong clumping, and allow for detailed and accurate treatment of both theradiation field and atomic/molecular physics.

astro-ph;9702030	dynamics of ``small galaxies'' in the hubble deep field	we have previously found in the hubble deep field a significant angularcorrelation of faint, high color-redshift objects on scales below onearcsecond, or several kiloparsecs in metric size. we examine the correlationand nearest neighbor statistics to conclude that 38% of these objects in thehdf have a companion within one arcsecond, three times the number expected in arandom distribution with the same number of objects. we examine three dynamicalscenarios for these object multiplets: 1) the objects are star-forming regionswithin normal galaxies, whose disks have been relatively dimmed by k-correctionand surface brightness dimming; 2) they are fragments merging into largegalaxies; 3) they are satellites accreting onto normal l_* galaxies. we findthat hypothesis 1 is most tenable. first, large galaxies in the process of amerger formation would have accumulated too much mass in their centers (5e12m_sun inside 2 kpc) to correspond to present day objects. second, accretion bydynamical friction occurs with a predictable density vs. radius slope, not seenamong the faint hdf objects. since the dynamical friction time is roughly (1gyr), a steady-state should have been reached by redshift z &lt; 5. star-formingregions within galaxies clearly present no dynamical problems. since largespirals would still appear as such in the hdf, we favor a scenario in which thefaint compact sources in the hdf are giant starforming regions within smallnormal galaxies, such as magellanic irregulars. finally we checked thatreduction in mass-to-light from induced star-formation cannot alone explain theluminosity overdensity.

astro-ph;9707248	the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion as a function of local density	the standard method of measuring the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion onsmall scales is heavily weighted by the densest regions in a way that isdifficult to calibrate. we propose a new statistic which measures thesmall-scale velocity dispersion as an explicit function of density. computingthis statistic for a volume-limited subsample of the optical redshift survey,we find that the small-scale velocity dispersion rises from 220 to 760 km/s asdensity increases. we calculate this statistic for a series of mock catalogsdrawn from a hydrodynamic simulation of an \omega h = 0.5 cold dark matteruniverse (standard cdm), and find that the observed velocity distribution lies~1 \sigma below the simulations in each of eight density bins, formally rulingout this model at the 7.4 \sigma level, quantifying the well-known problem thatthis model produces too high a velocity dispersion. this comparison isinsensitive to the normalization of the power spectrum, although it is quitesensitive to the density and velocity bias of galaxies relative to dark matteron small scales.

astro-ph;9708250	using cluster abundances and peculiar velocities to test the gaussianity  of the cosmological density field	(abridged) by comparing the frequency of typical events with that of unusualevents, one can test whether the cosmological density distribution function isconsistent with the normally made assumption of gaussianity. to this end, wecompare the consistency of the tail-inferred (from clusters) and measuredvalues (from large-scale flows) of the rms level of mass fluctuations for twodistribution functions: a gaussian, and a texture (positively-skewed) pdf.averaging the recent large-scale flow measurements, we find that observationsof the rms and the tail at the 10 h^-1 mpc scale disfavor a texture pdf at ~1.5sigma in all cases. however, taking only the most recent measurement of therms, that from willick et al. (1997b), the comparison disfavors textures forlow omega_0=0.3, and disfavors gaussian models if omega_0=1 (again at ~1.5sigma). predictions for evolution of high temperature clusters can also be madefor the models considered, and strongly disfavor omega_0=1 in gaussian modelsand marginally disfavor omega_0=1 in texture models. only omega_0=0.3 gaussianmodels are consistent with all the data considered.

astro-ph;9709108	on the clustering of lyman alpha clouds	we examine the correlational property of $\lya$ clouds in detail and compareit to that of mass and galaxies. we show that the correlation strength of$\lya$ clouds is somewhat weaker than that of the underlying matter, which inturn is weaker than that of galaxies (biased galaxy formation). on the scalesprobed, $10-300$km/s, for $\lya$ clouds, we find that higher density, higheroptical depth, higher column density regions are more strongly clustered thanlower density, lower optical depth, lower column density regions. thus, aconsistent picture seems to emerge: the correlation strength for a given set ofobjects is positively correlated with their characteristic global density andthe differences among the correlations of galaxies, $\lya$ clouds and massreflect the differences in density that each trace. significant positivecorrelations with a strength of $0.1-1.0$ are found for $\lya$ clouds in thevelocity range $50-300$km/s. among the correlational measures examined, anoptical depth correlation function (equation 5) proposed here may serve as thebest correlational measure. it reasonably faithfully represents the truecorrelation of the underlying matter, enabling a better indication of bothmatter correlation and the relationship between galaxies and $\lya$ clouds.furthermore, it appears to be an alternative to the conventional line-linecorrelation function with the virtue that it does not require ambiguouspost-observation fitting procedures such as those commonly employed in theconventional line-finding methods. neither does it depend sensitively on theobservational resolution (e.g., fwhm), insofaras the clouds are resolvedconveniently, it can be easily measured with the current observationalsensitivity without being contaminated significantly by the presence of noise.

astro-ph;9709161	tidal shocking by extended mass distributions	we derive expressions for the tidal field exerted by a spherically symmetricgalaxy having an extended mass distribution, and use our analysis to calculatetidal perturbations and heating of stars in a globular cluster or a satellitegalaxy orbiting in the external potential. we consider a hernquist model andseveral power-law models for the primary. we integrate the tidal force overaccurate orbits in the given potential by using the impulse approximation andby introducing adiabatic corrections that allow for the time variation of theforce. we compare these results with the conventional straight pathapproximation. we also check the results with direct n-body simulations andfind very good agreement. heating on highly eccentric orbits dominates as theadiabatic corrections strongly damp the energy change on low eccentricityorbits. the results are illustrated for the example of globular cluster ngc6712. for the orbital eccentricities higher than 0.9 the future lifetime of ngc6712 is less than 10^{10} yr. our analysis can be used to study tidalinteractions of star clusters and galaxies in a semi-analytical manner.

astro-ph;9803318	the effect of cooling on the density profile of hot gas in clusters of  galaxies: is additional physics needed?	we use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the densityprofile of hot gas in clusters of galaxies, adopting a variant of cold darkmatter cosmologies and employing a cosmological n-body/smoothed particlehydrodynamics code to follow the evolution of dark matter and gas. in additionto gravitational interactions, gas pressure, and shock heating, we includebremsstrahlung cooling in the computation. dynamical time, two-body relaxationtime, and cooling time in the simulations are examined to demonstrate that theresults are free from artificial relaxation effects and that the time step isshort enough to accurately follow the evolution of the system. in thesimulation with nominal resolution of 66h^{-1} kpc the computed cluster appearsnormal, but in a higher (by a factor 2) resolution run, cooling is so efficientthat the final gas density profile shows a steep rise toward the cluster centerthat is not observed in real clusters. also, the x-ray luminosity of7\times10^{45} ergs s^{-1} far exceeds that for any cluster of the computedtemperature. the most reasonable explanation for this discrepancy is that thereare some physical processes still missing in the simulations that actuallymitigate the cooling effect and play a crucial role in the thermal anddynamical evolution of the gas near the center. among the promising candidateprocesses are heat conduction and heat input from supernovae. we discuss theextent to which these processes can alter the evolution of gas.

astro-ph;9806245	effects of tidal shocks on the evolution of globular clusters	we present new fokker-planck models of the evolution of globular clusters,including gravitational tidal shocks. we extend our calculations beyond thecore collapse by adopting three-body binary heating. effects of the shocks areincluded by adding the tidal shock diffusion coefficients to the ordinaryfokker-planck equation: the first order heating term, &lt;de&gt;, and the secondorder energy dispersion term, &lt;de^2&gt;. as an example, we investigate theevolution of models for the globular cluster ngc 6254. using the hipparcosproper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in thegalaxy. tidal shocks accelerate significantly both core collapse and theevaporation of the cluster and shorten the destruction time from 24 gyr to 18gyr. we examine various types of adiabatic corrections and find that they arecritical for accurate calculation of the evolution. without adiabaticcorrections, the destruction time of the cluster is twice as short.  we examine cluster evolution for a wide range of the concentration and tidalshock parameters, and determine the region of the parameter space where tidalshocks dominate the evolution. we present fitting formulae for the corecollapse time and the destruction time, covering all reasonable initialconditions. in the limit of strong shocks, the typical value of the corecollapse time decreases from 10 t_{rh} to 3 t_{rh} or less, while thedestruction time is just twice that number. the effects of tidal shocks arerapidly self-limiting: as clusters lose mass and become more compact, theimportance of the shocks diminishes. this implies that tidal shocks were moreimportant in the past.

astro-ph;9806281	where are the baryons?	new, high resolution, large-scale, cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formationsimulations of a standard cold dark matter model (with a cosmological constant)are utilized to predict the distribution of baryons at the present and atmoderate redshift. it is found that the average temperature of baryons is anincreasing function of time, with most of the baryons at the present timehaving a temperature in the range 10^{5-7} k. thus, not only is the universedominated by dark matter, but more than one half of the normal matter is yet tobe detected. detection of this warm/hot gas poses an observational challenge,requiring sensitive euv and x-ray satellites. signatures include a soft, cosmicx-ray background, apparent warm components in hot clusters due to bothintrinsic warm intra-cluster gas and warm inter-cluster gas projected ontoclusters along the line of sight, absorption lines in x-ray and uv quasarspectra [e.g., o vi (1032,1038)a lines, ovii 574 ev line], strong emissionlines (e.g., o viii 653 ev line) and low redshift, broad, low column density$\lya$ absorption lines. we estimate that approximately 1/4 of theextragalactic soft x-ray background (sxrb) (at 0.7 kev) arises from thewarm/hot gas, half of it coming from $z&lt;0.65$ and three-quarters from $z&lt;1.00$,so the source regions should be identifiable on deep optical images.

astro-ph;9807029	the physical origin of scale dependent bias in cosmological simulations	using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations with heuristic criteria for galaxyformation, we investigate how the galaxy field is related to the mass densityand the gas temperature. we find that the bias b(r) = sigma_g(r)/sigma(r),where sigma_g(r) is the variance of galaxy counts in spheres of radius r andsigma(r) is the same for mass, varies from 2.6 at 1 h^{-1} mpc to 1.2 at 30h^{-1} mpc. including the dependence of the galaxy density on local gastemperature as well as on local mass density can fully account for this scaledependence. galaxy density depends on temperature because gas which is too hotcannot cool to form galaxies; this causes scale dependence of b(r) becauselocal gas temperature is related to the gravitational potential, and thuscontains information about the large scale density field. we show thattemperature dependence generally causes b(r) to vary on quasilinear andnonlinear scales, indicating that scale dependence of bias may be a genericeffect in realistic galaxy formation scenarios. we find that the relationshipbetween the galaxy and mass density fields is also a function of galaxy age. onlarge scales, the older galaxies are highly biased (b ~ 1.7) and highlycorrelated (r ~ 1.0) with the mass density field; younger galaxies are notbiased (b ~ 0.8) and are poorly correlated (r ~ 0.5) with the mass. we arguethat linear bias is inadequate to describe the relationship between galaxiesand mass.

astro-ph;9809370	physical bias of galaxies from large-scale hydrodynamic simulations	we analyze a new large-scale ($100h^{-1}$mpc) numerical hydrodynamicsimulation of the popular $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, including in ourtreatment dark matter, gas and star-formation, on the basis of standardphysical processes. the method, applied with a numerical resolution of$&lt;200h^{-1}$kpc (which is still quite coarse for following individual galaxies,especially in dense regions), attempts to estimate where and when galaxiesform. we then compare the smoothed galaxy distribution with the smoothed massdistribution to determine the "bias" defined as $b\equiv (\deltam/m)_{gal}/(\delta m/m)_{total}$ on scales large compared with the codenumerical resolution (on the basis of resolution tests given in the appendix ofthis paper). we find that (holding all variables constant except the quotedone) bias increases with decreasing scale, with increasing galactic age ormetallicity and with increasing redshift of observations. at the $8h^{-1}$mpcfiducial comoving scale bias (for bright regions) is 1.35 at $z=0$ reaching to3.6 at $z=3$, both numbers being consistent with extant observations. we alsofind that $(10-20)h^{-1}$mpc voids in the distribution of luminous objects areas observed (i.e., observed voids are not an argument against cdm-like models)and finally that the younger systems should show a colder hubble flow than dothe early type galaxies (a testable proposition). surprisingly, littleevolution is found in the amplitude of the smoothed galaxy-galaxy correlationfunction (as a function of {\it comoving} separation). testing this predictionvs observations will allow a comparison between this work and that of kauffmannet al which is based on a different physical modelingmethod.

astro-ph;9811248	accuracy of mesh based cosmological hydrocodes: tests and corrections	we perform a variety of tests to determine the numerical resolution of thecosmological tvd eulerian code developed by ryu et al (1993). tests include512^3 and 256^3 simulations of a pk=k^{-1} spectrum to check forself-similarity and comparison of results with those from higher resolution sphand grid-based calculations (frenk et al 1998). we conclude that in regionswhere density gradients are not produced by shocks the code degrades resolutionwith a gaussian smoothing (radius) length of 1.7 cells. at shock causedgradients (for which the code was designed) the smoothing length is 1.1 cells.finally, for \beta model fit clusters, we can approximately correct numericalresolution by the transformation r^2_{core}\to r^2_{core}-(c\delta l)^2, where\delta l is the cell size and c=1.1-1.7. when we use these corrections on ourpreviously published computations for the scdm and \lambda cdm models we findluminosity weighted, zero redshift, x-ray cluster core radii of (210\pm 86,280\pm 67)h^{-1}kpc, respectively, which are marginally consistent withobserved (jones &amp; forman 1992) values of 50-200h^{-1}kpc. using the correctedcore radii, the cobe normalized scdm model predicts the number of brightl_x&gt;10^{43}erg/s clusters too high by a factor of \sim 20 and the \lambda cdmmodel is consistent with observations.

astro-ph;9901243	thermal properties of two-dimensional advection dominated accretion flow	we study the thermal structure of the widely adopted two-dimensionaladvection dominated accretion flow (adaf) of narayan &amp; yi (1995a). the criticalradius for a given mass accretion rate, outside of which the optically thin hotsolutions do not exist in the equatorial plane, agrees with one-dimensionalstudy. however, we find that, even within the critical radius, there alwaysexists a conical region of the flow, around the pole, which cannot maintain theassumed high electron temperature, regardless of the mass accretion rate, inthe absence of radiative heating. this could lead to torus-like advectioninflow shape since, in general, the ions too will cool down. we also find thatcompton preheating is generally important and, if the radiative efficiency,defined as the luminosity output divided by the mass accretion rate times thevelocity of light squared, is above sim 4x10^-3, the polar region of the flowis preheated above the virial temperature by compton heating and it may resultin time-dependent behaviour or outflow while accretion continues in theequatorial plane. thus, under most relevant circumstances, adaf solutions maybe expected to be accompanied by polar outflow winds. while preheatinginstabilities exist in adaf, as for spherical flows, the former are to someextent protected by their characteristically higher densities and highercooling rates, which reduce their susceptibility to compton driven overheating.

astro-ph;9902326	on the self-consistent response of stellar systems to gravitational  shocks	we study the reaction of a globular star cluster to a time-varying tidalperturbation (gravitational shock) using self-consistent n-body simulations andaddress two questions. first, to what extent is the cluster interior protectedby adiabatic invariants. second, how much further energy change does thepostshock evolution of the cluster potential produce and how much does itaffect the dispersion of stellar energies. we introduce the adiabaticcorrection} as ratio of the energy change, &lt;de&gt;, to its value in the impulseapproximation. when the potential is kept fixed, the numerical results for theadiabatic correction for stars with orbital frequency \omega can beapproximated as (1 + \omega^2 \tau^2)^{-\gamma}. for shocks with thecharacteristic duration of the order the half-mass dynamical time of thecluster, \tau &lt; t_{dyn,h}, the exponent \gamma = 5/2. for more prolongedshocks, \tau &gt; 4 t_{dyn,h}, the adiabatic correction is shallower, \gamma =3/2. when we allow for self-gravity and potential oscillations which follow theshock, the energy of stars in the core changes significantly, while the totalenergy of the system is conserved. paradoxically, the postshock potentialfluctuations reduce the total amount of energy dispersion, &lt;de^2&gt;. the effectis small but real and is due to the postshock energy change being statisticallyanti-correlated with the shock induced heating. these results are to be appliedto fokker-planck models of the evolution of globular clusters.

astro-ph;9902372	luminosity density of galaxies and cosmic star formation rate from  lambda-cdm hydrodynamical simulations	we compute the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) and the rest-frame comovingluminosity density in various pass-bands as a function of redshift usinglarge-scale \lambda-cdm hydrodynamical simulations with the aim ofunderstanding their behavior as a function of redshift. to calculate theluminosity density of galaxies, we use an updated isochrone synthesis modelwhich takes metallicity variations into account. the computed sfr and theuv-luminosity density have a steep rise from z=0 to 1, a moderate plateaubetween z=1 - 3, and a gradual decrease beyond z=3. the raw calculated resultsare significantly above the observed luminosity density, which can be explainedeither by dust extinction or the possibly inappropriate input parameters of thesimulation. we model the dust extinction by introducing a parameter f; thefraction of the total stellar luminosity (not galaxy population) that isheavily obscured and thus only appears in the far-infrared to sub-millimeterwavelength range. when we correct our input parameters, and apply dustextinction with f=0.65, the resulting luminosity density fits variousobservations reasonably well, including the present stellar mass density, thelocal b-band galaxy luminosity density, and the fir-to-submm extragalacticbackground. our result is consistent with the picture that \sim 2/3 of thetotal stellar emission is heavily obscured by dust and observed only in thefir. the rest of the emission is only moderately obscured which can be observedin the optical to near-ir wavelength range. we also argue that the steepfalloff of the sfr from z=1 to 0 is partly due to the shock-heating of theuniverse at late times, which produces gas which is too hot to easily condenseinto star-forming regions.

astro-ph;9903165	time evolution of galaxy formation and bias in cosmological simulations	the clustering of galaxies relative to the mass distribution declines withtime because: first, nonlinear peaks become less rare events; second, thedensest regions stop forming new galaxies because gas there becomes too hot tocool and collapse; third, after galaxies form, they are gravitationally``debiased'' because their velocity field is the same as the dark matter. toshow these effects, we perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation andexamine the density field of recently formed galaxies as a function ofredshift. we find the bias b_* of recently formed galaxies (the ratio of therms fluctuations of these galaxies and mass), evolves from 4.5 at z=3 to around1 at z=0, on 8 h^{-1} mpc comoving scales. the correlation coefficient r_*between recently formed galaxies and mass evolves from 0.9 at z=3 to 0.25 atz=0. as gas in the universe heats up and prevents star formation, star-forminggalaxies become poorer tracers of the mass density field. after galaxies form,the linear continuity equation is a good approximation to the gravitationaldebiasing, even on nonlinear scales. the most interesting observationalconsequence of the simulations is that the linear regression of thestar-formation density field on the galaxy density field evolves from about 0.9at z=1 to 0.35 at z=0. these effects also provide a possible explanation forthe butcher-oemler effect, the excess of blue galaxies in clusters at redshiftz ~ 0.5. finally, we examine cluster mass-to-light ratio estimates of omega,finding that while omega(z) increases with z, one's estimate omega_est(z)decreases.

astro-ph;9909279	the structure of dark matter halos in hierarchical clustering theories	during hierarchical clustering, smaller masses generally collapse earlierthan larger masses and so are denser on the average. the core of a small masshalo could be dense enough to resist disruption and survive undigested, when itis incorporated into a bigger object. we explore the possibility that a nestedsequence of undigested cores in the center of the halo, which have survived thehierarchical, inhomogeneous collapse to form larger and larger objects,determines the halo structure in the inner regions. for a flat universe with$p(k) \propto k^n$, scaling arguments then suggest that the core densityprofile is, $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha = (9+3n)/(5+n)$. butwhether such behaviour obtains depends on detailed dynamics. we first examinethe dynamics using a fluid approach to the self-similar collapse solutions forthe dark matter phase space density, including the effect of velocitydispersions. we highlight the importance of tangential velocity dispersions toobtain density profiles shallower than $1/r^2$ in the core regions. iftangential velocity dispersions in the core are constrained to be less than theradial dispersion, a cuspy core density profile shallower than 1/r cannotobtain, in self-similar collapse. we then briefly look at the profiles of theouter halos in low density cosmological models where the total halo mass isconvergent. finally, we analyze a suite of dark halo density and velocitydispersion profiles obtained in cosmological n-body simulations of models withn= 0, -1 and -2. we find that the core-density profiles of dark halos, showconsiderable scatter in their properties, but nevertheless do appear to reflecta memory of the initial power spectrum, with steeper initial spectra producingflatter core profiles.

astro-ph;9912541	the tree-particle-mesh n-body gravity solver	the tree-particle-mesh (tpm) n-body algorithm couples the tree algorithm fordirectly computing forces on particles in an hierarchical grouping scheme withthe extremely efficient mesh based pm structured approach. the combined tpmalgorithm takes advantage of the fact that gravitational forces are linearfunctions of the density field. thus one can use domain decomposition to breakdown the density field into many separate high density regions containing asignificant fraction of the mass but residing in a very small fraction of thetotal volume. in each of these high density regions the gravitational potentialis computed via the tree algorithm supplemented by tidal forces from theexternal density distribution. for the bulk of the volume, forces are computedvia the pm algorithm; timesteps in this pm component are large compared toindividually determined timesteps in the tree regions. since each tree regioncan be treated independently, the algorithm lends itself to very efficientparallelization using message passing. we have tested the new tpm algorithm (arefinement of that originated by xu 1995) by comparison with results fromferrell &amp; bertschinger's p^3m code and find that, except in small clusters, thetpm results are at least as accurate as those obtained with thewell-established p^3m algorithm, while taking significantly less computingtime. production runs of 10^9 particles indicate that the new code has greatscientific potential when used with distributed computing resources.
