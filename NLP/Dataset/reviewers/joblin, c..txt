0706.1510	aromatic emission from the ionised mane of the horsehead nebula	we study the evolution of the aromatic infrared bands (aibs) emitters acrossthe illuminated edge of the horsehead nebula and especially their survival andproperties in the hii region. we present spectral mapping observations takenwith the infrared spectrograph (irs) at wavelengths 5.2-38 microns. a strongaib at 11.3 microns is detected in the hii region, relative to the other aibsat 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 microns. the intensity of this band appears to becorrelated with the intensity of the [neii] at 12.8 microns and of halpha,which shows that the emitters of the 11.3 microns band are located in theionised gas. the survival of pahs in the hii region could be due to themoderate intensity of the radiation field (g0 about 100) and the lack ofphotons with energy above about 25ev. the enhancement of the intensity of the11.3 microns band in the hii region, relative to the other aibs can beexplained by the presence of neutral pahs. our observations highlight atransition region between ionised and neutral pahs observed with idealconditions in our galaxy. a scenario where pahs can survive in hii regions andbe significantly neutral could explain the detection of a prominent 11.3microns band in other spitzer observations.

physics;0407119	stacked clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules	clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) molecules are modelledusing explicit all-atom potentials using a rigid body approximation. the pah'sconsidered range from pyrene (c10h8) to circumcoronene (c54h18), and clusterscontaining between 2 and 32 molecules are investigated. in addition to theusual repulsion-dispersion interactions, electrostatic point-chargeinteractions are incorporated, as obtained from density functional theorycalculations. the general electrostatic distribution in neutral or singlycharged pah's is reproduced well using a fluctuating charges analysis, whichprovides an adequate description of the multipolar distribution. globaloptimization is performed using a variety of methods, including basin-hoppingand parallel tempering monte carlo. we find evidence that stacking the pahmolecules generally yields the most stable motif. a structural transitionbetween one-dimensional stacks and three-dimensional shapes built from mutiplestacks is observed at larger sizes, and the threshold for this transitionincreases with the size of the monomer. larger aggregates seem to evolve towardthe packing observed for benzene in bulk.difficulties met in optimizing theseclusters are analysed in terms of the strong anisotropy of the molecules. wealso discuss segregation in heterogeneous clusters and vibrational propertiesin the context of astrophysical observations.

0904.3185	laboratory studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: the search for  interstellar candidates	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are considered as a major constituentof interstellar dust. they have been proposed as the carriers of the aromaticinfrared bands (aibs) observed in emission in the mid-ir. they likely have asignificant contribution to various features of the extinction curve such asthe 220 nm bump,the far-uv rise and the diffuse interstellar bands. emissionbands are also expected in the far-ir, which are better fingerprints ofmolecular identity than the aibs. they will be searched for with the herschelspace observatory. rotational emission is also expected in the mm range forthose molecules which carry significant dipole moments. despite spectroscopicstudies in the laboratory, no individual pah species could be identified. thisemphasises the need for an investigation on where interstellar pahs come fromand how they evolve due to environmental conditions: ionisation anddissociation upon uv irradiation, interactions with electrons, gas and dust.there is also evidence for pah species to contribute to the depletion of heavyatoms from the gas phase, in particular si and fe. this paper illustrates howlaboratory work can be inspired from observations. in particular there is aneed for understanding the chemical properties of pahs and pah-related species,including very small grains, in physical conditions that mimic those found ininterstellar space. this motivates a joint effort between astrophysicists,physicists and chemists. such interdisciplinary studies are currentlyperformed, taking advantage of the pirenea set-up, a cold ion trap dedicated toastrochemistry.

0905.1845	search for corannulene (c20h10) in the red rectangle	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) are widely accepted as the carriersof the aromatic infrared bands (aibs), but an unambiguous identification of anyspecific interstellar pah is still missing. for polar pahs, pure rotationaltransitions can be used as fingerprints for identification. combining dedicatedexperiments, detailed simulations and observations, we explored the mm domainto search for specific rotational transitions of corannulene (c20h10). weperformed high-resolution spectroscopic measurements and a simulation of theemission spectrum of uv-excited c20h10 in the environment of the red rectangle,calculating its synthetic rotational spectrum. based on these results, weconducted a first observational campaign at the iram 30m telescope towards thissource to search for several high-j rotational transitions of (c20h10). thelaboratory detection of the j = 112 &lt;- 111 transition of corannulene showedthat no centrifugal splitting is present up to this line. observations with theiram 30m telescope towards the red rectangle do not show any corannuleneemission at any of the observed frequencies, down to a rms noise level of tmb =8 mk for the j =135 -&gt; 134 transition at 137.615 ghz. comparing the noise levelwith the synthetic spectrum, we are able to estimate an upper limit to thefraction of carbon locked in corannulene of about 1.0x10(-5) relative to thetotal abundance of carbon in pahs. the sensitivity achieved shows that radiospectroscopy can be a powerful tool to search for polar pahs. we compare thisupper limit with models for the pah size distribution, emphasising that smallpahs are much less abundant than predicted. we show that this cannot beexplained by destruction but is more likely related to the chemistry of theirformation in the environment of the red rectangle.

0910.3935	mid-infrared pah and h2 emission as a probe of physical conditions in  extreme pdrs	mid-infrared (ir) observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) andmolecular hydrogen emission are a potentially powerful tool to derive physicalproperties of dense environments irradiated by intense uv fields. we presentnew, spatially resolved, \emph{spitzer} mid-ir spectroscopy of the highuv-field and dense photodissocation region (pdr) around monoceros r2, theclosest ultracompact \hii region, revealing the spatial structure of ionizedgas, pahs and h$_2$ emissions. using a pdr model and pah emission featurefitting algorithm, we build a comprehensive picture of the physical conditionsprevailing in the region. we show that the combination of the measurement ofpah ionization fraction and of the ratio between the h$_2$ 0-0 s(3) and s(2)line intensities, respectively at 9.7 and 12.3 $\mu$m, allows to derive thefundamental parameters driving the pdr: temperature, density and uv radiationfield when they fall in the ranges $t = 250-1500 $k, $n_h=10^4-10^6$cm$^{-3}$,$g_0=10^3-10^5$ respectively. these mid-ir spectral tracers thus provide a toolto probe the similar but unresolved uv-illuminated surface of protoplanetarydisks or the nuclei of starburst galaxies.

0910.4069	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with spica	thanks to high sensitivity and angular resolution and broad spectralcoverage, spica will offer a unique opportunity to better characterize thenature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and very small grains (vsgs),to better use them as probes of astrophysical environments. the angularresolution will enable to probe the chemical frontiers in the evolution processfrom vsgs to neutral pahs, to ionized pahs and to "grand-pahs" inphotodissotiation regions and hii regions, as a function of g$_0$/n (uvradiation field / density). high sensitivity will favor the detection of thefar-ir skeletal emission bands of pahs, which provide specific fingerprints andcould lead to the identification of individual pahs. this overallcharacterization will allow to use pah and vsg populations as tracers ofphysical conditions in spatially resolved protoplanetary disks and nearbygalaxies (using mid-ir instruments), and in high redshift galaxies (using thefar-ir instrument), thanks to the broad spectral coverage spica provides. basedon our previous experience with iso and spitzer we discuss how these goals canbe reached.

1003.0805	fusion between ground- and space-based mid-infrared observations	mid-infrared astronomy (operating at wavelengths ranging from 2 to 25 $\mu$m)has progressed significantly in the last decades, thanks to the improvement ofdetector techniques and the growing diameter of telescopes. space observatoriesbenefit from the absence of atmospheric absorption, allowing to reach the veryhigh sensitivities needed to perform 3d hyperspectral observations, buttelescopes are limited in diameter ($&lt; 1$ meter) and therefore provideobservations at low angular resolution (typically a few seconds of arc). on theother hand, ground-based facilities suffer from strong atmospheric absorptionbut use large telescopes (above 8m diameter) to perform sub-arcsecond angularresolution imaging through selected windows in the mid-infrared range. in thispaper, we present a method based on lee and seung's non-negative matrixfactorization (nmf) to merge data from space and ground based mid-infrared(mid-ir) telescopes in order to combine the best sensitivity, spectral coverageand angular resolution. we prove the efficiency of this technique when appliedto real mid-ir astronomical data. we suggest that this method can be applied toany combination of low and high spatial resolution positive hyperspectraldatasets, as long as the spectral variety of the data allows decomposition intocomponents using nmf.

1007.2148	detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds  with herschel/hifi: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas	we discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (hf)along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources w49n and w51. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the1232.4762 ghz j = 1 - 0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band 5areceiver. we detected foreground absorption by hf toward both sources over awide range of velocities. optically thin absorption components were detected onboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limiton - the column density of hf for the first time. as in previous observationsof hf toward the source g10.6-0.4, the derived hf column density is typicallycomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance ofoxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. we usedthe rather uncertain n(ch)-n(h2) relationship derived previously toward diffusemolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the cloudsexhibiting hf absorption. within the uncertainties, we find that the abundanceof hf with respect to h2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that hfis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. thus, hydrogenfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small h2 column density. indeed,the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of alow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the w51 sight line, at an lsrvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorptionline studies prior to the launch of herschel.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.1315	gas morphology and energetics at the surface of pdrs: new insights with  herschel observations of ngc 7023	we investigate the physics and chemistry of the gas and dust in densephoton-dominated regions (pdrs), along with their dependence on theilluminating uv field. using herschel-hifi observations, we study the gasenergetics in ngc 7023 in relation to the morphology of this nebula. ngc 7023is the prototype of a pdr illuminated by a b2v star and is one of the keytargets of herschel. our approach consists in determining the energetics of theregion by combining the information carried by the mid-ir spectrum (extinctionby classical grains, emission from very small dust particles) with that of themain gas coolant lines. in this letter, we discuss more specifically theintensity and line profile of the 158 micron (1901 ghz) [cii] line measured byhifi and provide information on the emitting gas. we show that both the [cii]emission and the mid-ir emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)arise from the regions located in the transition zone between atomic andmolecular gas. using the meudon pdr code and a simple transfer model, we findgood agreement between the calculated and observed [cii] intensities. hifiobservations of ngc 7023 provide the opportunity to constrain the energetics atthe surface of pdrs. future work will include analysis of the main coolant line[oi] and use of a new pdr model that includes pah-related species.

1105.2623	oh emission from warm and dense gas in the orion bar pdr	as part of a far-infrared (fir) spectral scan with herschel/pacs, we presentthe first detection of the hydroxyl radical (oh) towards the orion barphotodissociation region (pdr). five oh rotational lambda-doublets involvingenergy levels out to e_u/k~511 k have been detected (at ~65, ~79, ~84, ~119 and~163um). the total intensity of the oh lines is i(oh)~5x10^-4 erg s^-1 cm^-2sr^-1. the observed emission of rotationally excited oh lines is extended andcorrelates well with the high-j co and ch^+ j=3-2 line emission (but apparentlynot with water vapour), pointing towards a common origin. nonlocal, non-lteradiative transfer models including excitation by the ambient fir radiationfield suggest that oh arises in a small filling factor component of warm(tk~160-220 k) and dense (n_h~10^{6-7} cm^-3) gas with source-averaged ohcolumn densities of ~10^15 cm^-2. high density and temperature photochemicalmodels predict such enhanced oh columns at low depths (a_v&lt;1) and small spatialscales (~10^15 cm), where oh formation is driven by gas-phase endothermicreactions of atomic oxygen with molecular hydrogen. we interpret the extendedoh emission as coming from unresolved structures exposed to far-ultraviolet(fuv) radiation near the bar edge (photoevaporating clumps or filaments) andnot from the lower density "interclump" medium. photodissociation leads tooh/h2o abundance ratios (&gt;1) much higher than those expected in equally warmregions without enhanced fuv radiation fields.

1111.3653	spatial variation of the cooling lines in the orion bar from  herschel/pacs	we present spatially resolved herschel/pacs observations of the orion bar. wehave characterise the emission of the far-infrared fine-structure lines of[cii] (158um), [oi] (63 and 145um), and [nii] (122um) that trace the gas localconditions. the observed distribution and variation of the lines are discussedin relation to the underlying geometry and linked to the energetics associatedwith the trapezium stars. these observations enable us to map the spatialdistribution of these fine-structure lines with a spatial resolution between 4"and 11" and covering a total square area of about 120"x105". the spatialprofile of the emission lines are modelled using the radiative transfer codecloudy. we find that the spatial distribution of the [cii] line coincides withthat of the [oi] lines. the [nii] line peaks closer to the ionising star thanthe other three lines, but with a small region of overlap. we can distinguishseveral knots of enhanced emission within the bar indicating the presence of aninhomogenous and structured medium. the emission profiles cannot be reproducedby a single photo-dissociation region, clearly indicating that, besides thebar, there is a significant contribution from additional photo-dissociationregion(s) over the area studied. the combination of both the [nii] and [oi]145um lines can be used to estimate the [cii] emission and distinguish betweenits ionised or neutral origin. we have calculated how much [cii] emission comesfrom the neutral and ionised region, and find that at least 82% originates fromthe photo-dissocciation region. together, the [cii] 158um and [oi] 63 and 145umlines account for 90% of the power emitted by the main cooling lines in the bar(including co, h2, etc...), with [oi] 63um alone accounting for 72% of thetotal.

1301.6507	evolution of pahs in photodissociation regions: hydrogenation and charge  states	various studies have emphasized variations of the charge state andcomposition of the interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)population in photodissociation regions (pdrs). we aim to model the spatialevolution of the charge and hydrogenation states of pahs in pdrs. we focus onthe specific case of the north-west (nw) pdr of ngc 7023 and also discuss thecase of the diffuse interstellar medium (ism). the physical conditions in ngc7023 nw are modelled using a state-of-the-art pdr code. we then use a new pahchemical evolution model that includes recent experimental data on pahs anddescribes multiphoton events. we consider a family of compact pahs bearing upto 96 carbon atoms. the calculated ionization ratio is in good agreement withobservations in ngc 7023 nw. within the pdr, pahs evolve into three majorpopulations: medium-sized pahs (50&lt;nc&lt;90) are normally hydrogenated, largerpahs (nc&gt;90) can be superhydrogenated, and smaller species (nc&lt;50) are fullydehydrogenated. in the cavity, where the fullerene c60 was recently detected,all the studied pahs are found to be quickly fully dehydrogenated. pah chemicalevolution exhibits a complex non-linear behaviour as a function of the uvradiation field because of multiphoton events. steady state for hydrogenationis reached on timescales ranging from less than a year for small pahs, up to10000 years for large pahs at av=1. we identified critical reactions that needmore studies. our new model allows us to rationalize the observationalconstraints without any fitting parameter. pahs smaller than 50 carbon atomsare not expected to survive in the ngc 7023 nw pdr. a similar conclusion isobtained for the diffuse ism. carbon clusters turn out to be end products ofpah photodissociation, and the evolution of these clusters needs to beinvestigated further to evaluate their impact on the chemical and physicalevolution of pdrs.

1412.0417	the chemistry and spatial distribution of small hydrocarbons in  uv-irradiated molecular clouds: the orion bar pdr	we study the spatial distribution and chemistry of small hydrocarbons in theorion bar pdr. we used the iram-30m telescope to carry out a millimetre linesurvey towards the orion bar edge, complemented with ~2'x2' maps of the c2h andc-c3h2 emission. we analyse the excitation of the detected hydrocarbons andconstrain the physical conditions of the emitting regions with non-lteradiative transfer models. we compare the inferred column densities withupdated gas-phase photochemical models including 13cch and c13ch isotopomerfractionation. ~40% of the lines in the survey arise from hydrocarbons (c2h,c4h, c-c3h2, c-c3h, c13ch, 13cch, l-c3h and l-h2c3). we detect new lines froml-c3h+ and improve its rotational spectroscopic constants. anions or deuteratedhydrocarbons are not detected: [c2d]/[c2h]&lt;0.2%, [c2h-]/[c2h]&lt;0.007% and[c4h-]/[c4h]&lt;0.05%. our gas-phase models can reasonably match the observedcolumn densities of most hydrocarbons (within factors &lt;3). since the observedspatial distribution of the c2h and c-c3h2 emission is similar but does notfollow the pah emission, we conclude that, in high uv-flux pdrs,photodestruction of pahs is not a necessary requirement to explain the observedabundances of the smallest hydrocarbons. instead, gas-phase endothermicreactions (or with barriers) between c+, radicals and h2 enhance the formationof simple hydrocarbons. observations and models suggest that the [c2h]/[c-c3h2]ratio (~32 at the pdr edge) decreases with the uv field attenuation. theobserved low cyclic-to-linear c3h column density ratio (&lt;3) is consistent witha high electron abundance (xe) pdr environment. in fact, the poorly constrainedxe gradient influences much of the hydrocarbon chemistry in the moreuv-shielded gas. we propose that reactions of c2h isotopologues with 13c+ and hatoms can explain the observed [c13ch]/[13cch]=1.4(0.1) fractionation level.

1511.08725	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and molecular hydrogen in oxygen-rich  planetary nebulae: the case of ngc6720	evolved stars are primary sources for the formation of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs) and dust grains. their circumstellar chemistry is usuallydesignated as either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, although dual-dust chemistryobjects, whose infrared spectra reveal both silicate- and carbon-dust features,are also known. the exact origin and nature of this dual-dust chemistry is notyet understood. spitzer-irs mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging of the nearby,oxygen-rich planetary nebula ngc6720 reveals the presence of the 11.3 micronaromatic (pah) emission band. it is attributed to emission from neutral pahs,since no band is observed in the 7 to 8 micron range. the spatial distributionof pahs is found to closely follow that of the warm clumpy molecular hydrogenemission. emission from both neutral pahs and warm h2 is likely to arise fromphoto-dissociation regions associated with dense knots that are located withinthe main ring. the presence of pahs together with the previously derived highabundance of free carbon (relative to co) suggest that the local conditions inan oxygen-rich environment can also become conducive to in-situ formation oflarge carbonaceous molecules, such as pahs, via a bottom-up chemical pathway.in this scenario, the same stellar source can enrich the interstellar mediumwith both oxygen-rich dust and large carbonaceous molecules.

0809.0984	dehydrogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and uv bump	recent calculations have shown that the uv bump at about 217.5 nm in theextinction curve can be explained by a complex mixture of pahs in severalcharge states. other studies proposed that the carriers are a restrictedpopulation made of neutral and singly-ionised dehydrogenated coronene molecules(c24hn, n less than 3), in line with models of the hydrogenation state ofinterstellar pahs predicting that medium-sized species are highlydehydrogenated. to assess the observational consequences of the latterhypothesis we have undertaken a systematic study of the electronic spectra ofdehydrogenated pahs. we use our first results to see whether such spectra showstrong general trends upon dehydrogenation. we used state-of-the-art techniquesin the framework of the density functional theory (dft) to obtain theelectronic ground-state geometries, and of the time- dependent dft to evaluatethe electronic excited-state properties. we computed the absorptioncross-section of the species c24hn (n=12,10,8,6,4,2,0) in their neutral andcationic charge-states. similar calculations were performed for other pahs andtheir fullydehydrogenated counterparts. pi electron energies are always foundto be strongly affected by dehydrogenation. in all cases we examined,progressive dehydrogenation translates into a correspondingly progressive blueshift of the main electronic transitions. in particular, the pi-pi* collectiveresonance becomes broader and bluer with dehydrogenation. its calculated energyposition is therefore predicted to fall in the gap between the uv bump and thefar-uv rise of the extinction curve. since this effect appears to besystematic, it poses a tight observational limit on the column density ofstrongly dehydrogenated medium-sized pahs.

astro-ph;0606264	a general model for the identification of specific pahs in the far-ir	context. in the framework of the interstellar pah hypothesis, far-ir skeletalbands are expected to be a fingerprint of single species in this class. aims. adetailed model of the photophysics of interstellar pahs is required for suchsingle-molecule identification of their far-ir features in the presentlyavailable infrared space observatory data and in those of the forthcomingherschel space observatory mission. methods. we modelled the detailedphotophysics of a vast sample of species in different radiation fields, using acompendium of monte-carlo techniques and quantum-chemical calculations. thisenabled us to validate the use of purely theoretical data and assess theexpected accuracy and reliability of the resulting synthetic far-ir emissionspectra. results. we produce positions and intensities of the expected far-irfeatures which ought to be emitted by each species in the sample in theconsidered radiation fields. a composite emission spectrum for our sample iscomputed for one of the most favourable sources for detection, namely the redrectangle nebula. the resulting spectrum is compared with the estimated dustemission in the same source, to assess the dependence of detectability on keymolecular parameters. conclusions. identifying specific pahs from their far-irfeatures is going to be a difficult feat in general, still it may well bepossible under favourable conditions.

0809.1532	carriers of the mid-ir emission bands in pne reanalysed. evidence of a  link between circumstellar and interstellar aromatic dust	it has been shown that the diversity of the aromatic emission features can berationalized into different classes of objects, in which differences betweencircumstellar and interstellar matter are emphasised. we probe the linksbetween the mid-ir emitters observed in planetary nebulae (pne) and theircounterparts in the interstellar medium in order to probe a scenario in whichthe latter have been formed in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars.the mid-ir (6-14 um) emission spectra of pne and compact hii regions wereanalysed on the basis of previous work on photodissociation regions (pdrs).galactic, large magellanic cloud (lmc), and small magellanic cloud (smc)objects were considered in our sample.we show that the mid-ir emission of pnecan be decomposed as the sum of six components. some components made ofpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) and very small grain (vsg) populationsare similar to those observed in pdrs. others are fitted in an evolutionaryscenario involving the destruction of the aliphatic component observed in thepost-agb stage, as well as strong processing of pahs in the extreme conditionsof pne that leads to a population of very large ionized pahs. this speciescalled pah^x are proposed as the carriers of a characteristic band at 7.90 um.this band can be used as part of diagnostics that identify pne in nearbygalaxies and is also observed in galactic compact hii regions. these resultssupport the formation of the aromatic very small dust particles in theenvelopes of evolved stars, in the milky way, as well as in the lmc and smc,and their subsequent survival in the interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0609186	formation and destruction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon clusters in  the interstellar medium	the competition between the formation and destruction of coronene clustersunder interstellar conditions is investigated theoretically. the unimolecularnucleation of neutral clusters is simulated with an atomic model combining anexplicit classical force field and a quantum tight-binding approach.evaporation rates are calculated in the framework of the phase space theory andare inserted in an infrared emission model and compared with the growth rateconstants. it is found that, in interstellar conditions, most collisions leadto cluster growth. the time evolution of small clusters (containing up to 312carbon atoms) was specifically investigated under the physical conditions ofthe northern photodissociation region of ngc 7023. these clusters are found tobe thermally photoevaporated much faster than they are reformed, thus providingan interpretation for the lowest limit of the interstellar cluster sizedistribution inferred from observations. the effects of ionizing the clustersand density heterogeneities are also considered. based on our results, thepossibility that pah clusters could be formed in pdrs is critically discussed.

astro-ph;0703072	analysis of the emission of very small dust particles from spitzer  spectro-imagery data using blind signal separation methods	this work was conducted as part of the specpdr program, dedicated to thestudy of very small particles and astrochemistry, in photo-dissociation regions(pdrs). we present the analysis of the mid-ir spectro-imagery observations ofced 201, ncg 7023 east and north-west and rho-ophiuchi west filament. using thedata from all four modules of the infrared spectrograph onboard the spitzerspace telescope, we produced a spectral cube ranging from 5 to 35 um for eachone of the observed pdrs. the resulting cubes were analysed using blind signalseparation methods (nmf and fastica). for ced 201, rho-ophiuchi west filamentand ngc 7023 east, we find that two signals can be extracted from the originaldata cubes, which are 5 to 35 um spectra. the main features of the firstspectrum are a strong continuum emission at long wavelengths, and a broad 7.8um band. on the contrary, the second spectrum exhibits the classical aromaticinfrared bands (aibs) and no continuum. the reconstructed spatial distributionmaps show that the latter spectrum is mainly present at the cloud surface,close to the star whereas the first one is located slightly deeper inside thepdr. the study of the spectral energy distribution of ced 201 up to 100 umsuggests that, in cool pdrs, the 5-25 um continuum is carried by very smallgrains (vsgs). the aib spectra in the observed objects can be interpreted asthe contribution of neutral and positively-charged polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs). we extracted the 5 to 25 um emission spectrum of vsgs incool pdrs, these grains being most likely carbonaceous. we show that thevariations of the mid-ir (5-35 um) spectra of pdrs can be explained by thephoto-chemical processing of these vsgs and pahs, vsgs being the progenitors offree pah.

0811.2372	what can we learn about protoplanetary disks from analysis of  mid-infrared carbonaceous dust emission?	in this paper we analyze the mid-infrared (mid-ir) emission of very smalldust particles in a sample of 12 protoplanetary disks to see how they areconnected to interstellar dust particles and to investigate the possibilitythat their emission can be used as a probe of the physical conditions andevolution of the disk. we define a basis made of three mid-ir template spectrapah$^0$, pah$^+$ and vsgs that were derived from the analysis of reflectionnebulae, and an additional pah$^x$ spectrum that was introduced by joblin etal. (2008) for the analysis of the spectra of planetary nebulae. from theoptimization of the fit of 12 star+disk spectra, using a linear combination ofthe 4 template spectra, we found that an additional small grain component witha broad feature at 8.3 $\mu$m is needed. we find that the fraction of vsgemission in disks decreases with increasing stellar temperature. vsgs appear tobe destroyed by uv photons at the surface of disks, thus releasing free pahmolecules, which are eventually ionized as it is observed in photodissociationregions. on the opposite, we observe that the fraction of pah$^x$ increaseswith increasing star temperature except in the case of b stars where they areabsent. we argue that this is compatible with the identification of pah$^x$ aslarge ionized pahs, most likely emitting in regions of the disk that are closeto the star. finally, we provide a uv-dependant scheme to explain the evolutionof pahs and vsgs in protoplanetary disks. we show that a stars modify the sizespectrum of pahs and vsgs in favor of large pahs while b stars destroy even thelargest pahs up to large radii in the disk. these results allow us to put newconstrains on the properties of two sources: irs 48 and "gomez's hamburger"which are poorly characterized.

0811.2949	[sipah]+ pi-complexes in the interstellar medium	we investigate the presence of silicon atoms adsorbed on the surface ofinterstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) to form sipahpi-complexes. we use quantum chemistry calculations to obtain structural,thermodynamic and mid-ir properties of neutral and cationic sipah complexes.the binding energy was found to be at least 1.5 ev for [sipah]+ complexeswhereas it is roughly 0.5 ev for their neutral counterparts. from the spectralanalysis of the calculated ir spectra, we found that the coordination ofsilicon to pah+ does not strongly affect the intensities of the pah+ spectra,but systematically introduces blueshifts of the c-c in-plane and the c-hout-of-plane bands. the thermodynamic data calculated for [sipah]+ complexesshow that these species are stable and can be easily formed by radiativeassociation of si+ and pah species that are known to be abundant inphotodissociation regions. their mid-ir fingerprints show features induced bythe coordination of silicon that could account for (i) the blueshifted positionof the 6.2 micron aib and (ii) the presence of satellite bands observed on theblue side of the 6.2 and 11.2 micron aibs. from such an assignment, we candeduce that typically 1% of the cosmic silicon appears to be attached to pahs.

0812.1636	circumstellar disks around herbig be stars	we completed a search for circumstellar disks around herbig be stars usingthe nrao very large array (vla) and the iram plateau de bure (pdb)interferometers. we present our new vla and pdbi data for the three objects mwc297, z cma, and lkha 215. we constructed the sed from near-ir to centimeterwavelengths by adding our millimeter and centimeter data to the available dataat other wavelengths, mainly spitzer images. the entire sed was fitted using adisk+envelope model. in addition, we compiled all the disk millimeterobservations in the literature and completed a statistical analysis of all thedata. we show that the disk mass is usually only a small percentage (less than10%) of the mass of the entire envelope in hbe stars. for the disks, there arelarge source-to-source variations. two disks in our sample, r mon and z cma,have similar sizes and masses to those found in t tauri and herbig ae stars.the disks around mwc 1080 and mwc 297 are, however, smaller (rout&lt;100 au). wedid not detect the disks towards mwc 137 and lkha 215 at millimeterwavelengths, which limits the mass and the size of the possible circumstellardisks. a comparison between our data and previous results for t tauri andherbig ae stars indicates that although massive disks (0.1 msun) are found inyoung objects (10^4 yr), the masses of the disks around herbig be stars areusually 5-10 times lower than those around lower mass stars. we propose thatdisk photoevaporation is responsible for this behavior. in herbig be stars, theuv radiation disperses the gas in the outer disk on a timescale of a few 10^5yr. once the outer part of the disk has vanished, the entire gaseous disk isphotoevaporated on a very short timescale (10^5 yr) and only a small, dustydisk consisting of large grains remains.
