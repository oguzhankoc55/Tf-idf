0902.4694	increased complexity in interstellar chemistry: detection and chemical  modeling of ethyl formate and n-propyl cyanide in sgr b2(n)	in recent years, organic molecules of increasing complexity have been foundtoward the prolific galactic center source sagittarius b2. we wish to explorethe degree of complexity that the interstellar chemistry can reach instar-forming regions. we carried out a complete line survey of the hot coressgr b2(n) and (m) with the iram 30 m telescope in the 3 mm range. we analyzedthis spectral survey in the lte approximation. we modeled the emission of allknown molecules simultaneously, which allows us to search for less abundant,more complex molecules. we compared the derived column densities with thepredictions of a coupled gas-phase and grain-surface chemical code. we reportthe first detection in space of ethyl formate (c2h5ocho) and n-propyl cyanide(c3h7cn) toward sgr b2(n). the abundances of ethyl formate and n-propyl cyaniderelative to h2 are estimated to be 3.6e-9 and 1.0e-9, respectively. ourchemical modeling suggests that the sequential, piecewise construction of ethyland n-propyl cyanide from their constituent functional groups on the grainsurfaces is their most likely formation route. ethyl formate is primarilyformed on the grains by adding ch3 to functional-group radicals derived frommethyl formate, although ethanol may also be a precursor. the detection in sgrb2(n) of the next stage of complexity in two classes of complex molecule,esters and alkyl cyanides, suggests that greater complexity in other classes ofmolecule may be present in the interstellar medium. {abridged}

0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0908.3446	apex-champ+ high-j co observations of low-mass young stellar objects:  ii. distribution and origin of warm molecular gas	the origin and heating mechanisms of warm (50&lt;t&lt;200 k) molecular gas inlow-mass young stellar objects (ysos) are strongly debated. both passiveheating of the inner collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity as wellas active heating by shocks and by uv associated with the outflows or accretionhave been proposed. we aim to characterize the warm gas within protostellerobjects, and disentangle contributions from the (inner) envelope, bipolaroutflows and the quiescent cloud. high-j co maps (12co j=6--5 and 7--6) of theimmediate surroundings (up to 10,000 au) of eight low-mass ysos are obtainedwith the champ+ 650/850 ghz array receiver mounted on the apex telescope. inaddition, isotopologue observations of the 13co j=6--5 transition and [c i]3p_2-3p_1 line were taken. strong quiescent narrow-line 12co 6--5 and 7--6emission is seen toward all protostars. in the case of hh~46 and ced 110 irs 4,the on-source emission originates in material heated by uv photons scattered inthe outflow cavity and not just by passive heating in the inner envelope. warmquiescent gas is also present along the outflows, heated by uv photons fromshocks. shock-heated warm gas is only detected for class 0 flows and the moremassive class i sources such as hh~46. outflow temperatures, estimated from theco 6--5 and 3--2 line wings, are ~100 k, close to model predictions, with theexception of the l~1551 irs 5 and iras 12496-7650, for which temperatures &lt;50 kare found. apex-champ+ is uniquely suited to directly probe a protostar'sfeedback on its accreting envelope gas in terms of heating, photodissociation,and outflow dispersal by mapping 1'x1' regions in high-j co and [c i] lines.

0909.4683	deuterium chemistry in the orion bar pdr - "warm" chemistry starring  ch2d+	high levels of deuterium fractionation in gas-phase molecules are usuallyassociated with cold regions, such as prestellar cores. significantfractionation ratios are also observed in hot environments such as hot cores orhot corinos, where they are believed to be produced by the evaporation of theicy mantles surrounding dust grains, and thus are remnants of a previous cold(either gas-phase or grain surface) chemistry. the recent detection of dcntowards the orion bar, in a clump at a characteristic temperature of 70k, hasshown that high deuterium fractionation can also be detected in pdrs. the orionbar clumps thus appear as a good environment for the observational study ofdeuterium fractionation in luke-warm gas, allowing to validate chemistry modelsin a different temperature range, where dominating fractionation processes arepredicted to be different than in cold gas (&lt; 20k). we aimed at studyingobservationally in detail the chemistry at work in the orion bar pdr, tounderstand if dcn is produced by ice mantle evaporation, or is the result ofwarm gas-phase chemistry, involving the ch2d+ precursor ion (which surviveshigher temperatures than the usual h2d+ precursor). using the apex and the iram30m telescopes, we targetted selected deuterated species towards two clumps inthe orion bar. we confirmed the detection of dcn and detected two newdeuterated molecules (dco+ and hdco) towards one clump in the orion bar pdr.significant deuterium fractionations are found for hcn and h2co, but a lowfractionation in hco+. we also give upper limits for other molecules relevantfor the deuterium chemistry.

0704.1617	high-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the cep-a hw2 region	due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the cepheus a eaststar-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formationprocesses. based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattenedmolecular gas distribution around the yso hw2 may be a 350-au-radius massiveprotostellar disk. goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of thisstructure. we have employed the plateau de bure interferometer to acquire(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such asmethyl cyanide (ch3cn) and silicon monoxide (sio), towards the hw2 position. onthe 1-arcsecond (about 725 au) scale, the flattened distribution of moleculargas around hw2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the planeof the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one ispowering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line ofsight. the presence of a protostellar disk around hw2 is not ruled out, butsuch structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or usingdifferent molecular tracers.

1001.0894	h2co and ch3oh maps of the orion bar photodissociation region	a previous analysis of methanol and formaldehyde towards the orion barconcluded that the two molecular species may trace different physicalcomponents, methanol the clumpy material, and formaldehyde the interclumpmedium. to verify this hypothesis, we performed multi-line mapping observationsof the two molecules to study their spatial distributions. the observationswere performed with the iram-30m telescope at 218 and 241 ghz, with an angularresolution of ~11''. additional data for h2co from the plateau de bure arrayare also discussed. the data were analysed using an lvg approach.  both molecules are detected in our single-dish data. our data show that ch3ohpeaks towards the clumps of the bar, but its intensity decreases below thedetection threshold in the interclump material. when averaging over a largeregion of the interclump medium, the strongest ch3oh line is detected with apeak intensity of ~0.06k. formaldehyde also peaks on the clumps, but it is alsodetected in the interclump gas. we verified that the weak intensity of ch3oh inthe interclump medium is not caused by the different excitation conditions ofthe interclump material, but reflects a decrease in the column density ofmethanol. the abundance of ch3oh relative to h2co decreases by at least oneorder of magnitude from the dense clumps to the interclump medium.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1008.2513	the methanol lines and hot core of omc2-fir4, an intermediate-mass  protostar, with herschel-hifi	in contrast with numerous studies on the physical and chemical structure oflow- and high-mass protostars, much less is known about their intermediate-masscounterparts, a class of objects that could help to elucidate the mechanisms ofstar formation on both ends of the mass range. we present the first resultsfrom a rich hifi spectral dataset on an intermediate-mass protostar, omc2-fir4,obtained in the chess (chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions) keyprogramme. the more than 100 methanol lines detected between 554 and 961 ghzcover a range in upper level energy of 40 to 540 k. our physical interpretationfocusses on the hot core, but likely the cold envelope and shocked regions alsoplay a role in reality, because an analysis of the line profiles suggests thepresence of multiple emission components. an upper limit of 10^-6 is placed onthe methanol abundance in the hot core, using a population diagram, large-scalesource model and other considerations. this value is consistent with abundancespreviously seen in low-mass hot cores. furthermore, the highest energy lines atthe highest frequencies display asymmetric profiles, which may arise frominfall around the hot core.

1009.1450	detection of oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ towards orion~kl	we report observations of the reactive molecular ions oh$^+$, h$_2$o$^+$, andh$_3$o$^+$ towards orion kl with herschel/hifi. all three $n=1-0$fine-structure transitions of oh$^+$ at 909, 971, and 1033ghz and bothfine-structure components of the doublet {\it ortho}-h$_2$o$^+$ $1_{11}-0_{00}$transition at 1115 and 1139ghz were detected; an upper limit was obtained forh$_3$o$^+$. oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ are observed purely in absorption, showing anarrow component at the source velocity of 9 kms$^{-1}$, and a broadblueshifted absorption similar to that reported recently for hf and {\itpara}-h$_{2}^{18}$o, and attributed to the low velocity outflow of orion kl. weestimate column densities of oh$^+$ and h$_2$o$^+$ for the 9 km s$^{-1}$component of $9 \pm 3 \times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $7 \pm 2 \times10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$, and those in the outflow of $1.9 \pm 0.7 \times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $1.0 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$. upper limits of$2.4\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ and $8.7\times 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ were derived forthe column densities of {\it ortho} and {\it para}-h$_3$o$^+$ from transitionsnear 985 and 1657ghz. the column densities of the three ions are up to an orderof magnitude lower than those obtained from recent observations of w31c andw49n. the comparatively low column densities may be explained by a higher gasdensity despite the assumption of a very high ionization rate.

1010.3868	a study of three southern high-mass star-forming regions	based on color-selected iras point sources, we have started to conduct asurvey of 47 high-mass star-forming regions in the southern hemisphere in 870umdust continuum and molecular line emission in several frequency ranges between290 ghz and 806 ghz. this paper describes the pilot study of the three sourcesiras12326-6245, iras16060-5146, and iras16065-5158. to characterize thephysical and chemical properties of southern massive star-forming regions, thethree high-luminosity southern hemisphere hot cores were observed with apex infive frequency setups aimed at groups of lines from the following molecules:ch3oh, h2co, and ch3cn. using the lte approximation, temperatures, sourcesizes, and column densities were determined through modeling of syntheticspectra with the xclass program. dust continuum observations were done with thelarge apex bolometer camera (laboca) at 870um and the 3mm continuum was imagedwith the atca. based on the detection of high-excitation ch3cn lines and linesfrom complex organic species, the three sources are classified as line rich,hot core type sources. for all three, the modeling indicates that the lineemission emerges from a combination of an extended, cooler envelope, and a hotcompact component. all three sources show an overabundance of oxygen-bearingspecies compared to nitrogen-bearing species. based on the results obtained inthe three sources, which served as templates for the survey, the most promising(and feasible) frequency setups for the remaining 44 sources were decided upon.

1101.0805	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources: methanol as a probe of  physical conditions in orion kl	we have examined methanol emission from orion kl with of the {\emherschel}/hifi instrument, and detected two methanol bands centered at 524 ghzand 1061 ghz. the 524 ghz methanol band (observed in hifi band 1a) is dominatedby the isolated $\delta$j$=$0, k$=-4\rightarrow$-3, v$_t$$=$0 q branch, andincludes 25 e-type and 2 a-type transitions. the 1061 ghz methanol band(observed in hifi band 4b) is dominated by the $\delta$j$=$0,k$=7\rightarrow$6, v$_t$$=$0 q branch transitions which are mostly blended. wehave used the isolated e-type v$_t$$=$0 methanol transitions to explore thephysical conditions in the molecular gas. with hifi's high velocity resolution,the methanol emission contributed by different spatial components along theline of sight toward orion kl (hot core, low velocity flow, and compact ridge)can be distinguished and studied separately. the isolated transitions detectedin these bands cover a broad energy range (upper state energy ranging from 80 kto 900 k), which provides a unique probe of the thermal structure in eachspatial component. the observations further show that the compact ridge isexternally heated. these observations demonstrate the power of methanol linesas probes of the physical conditions in warm regions in close proximity toyoung stars.

1102.3460	w43: the closest molecular complex of the galactic bar?	we used a large database extracted from galaxy-wide surveys of h {\scriptsizei}, $^{13}$co 1-0, $8 \micron$ and $870 \micron$ continuum to trace diffuseatomic gas, low- to medium-density molecular gas, high-density molecular gas,and star formation activity which we complemented by dedicated $^{12}$co 2--1,3--2 observations of the w43 region. from the detailed 3d(space-space-velocity) analysis of the molecular and atomic cloud tracersthrough the region and despite its wide velocity range (\emph{fwhm}$\sim22.3\kms$ around $\vlsr\sim 95.9 \kms$), we identified w43 as a large (equivalentdiameter $\sim 140$ pc) and coherent complex of molecular clouds which issurrounded by an atomic gas envelope (equivalent diameter $\sim 290$ pc). wemeasured the total mass of this newly-identified molecular complex ($m_{{\tinytotal}}\sim 7.1 \times 10^6 \msun$), the mass contained in dense $870 \micron$clumps ($&lt;5$ pc dense cloud structures, $m_{{\tiny clumps}}\sim 8.4 \times 10^5\msun$) and conclude that w43 is particularly massive and concentrated. thedistance we assume for the w43 complex is 6 kpc from the sun, which may placeit at the meeting point of the scutum-centaurus (or scutum-crux) galactic armand the bar, a dynamically complex region where high-velocity streams couldeasily collide. the star formation rate of w43 is suggested not to be steadybut it is increasing from $\, \sim 0.01 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its$8\,\mu$m luminosity) to $\sim 0.1 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from itsmolecular content). from the global properties of w43, we claim it is anextreme molecular complex in the milky way and it could even be formingstarburst clusters in the near future.

1104.0857	on the kinematics of massive star forming regions: the case of iras  17233-3606	direct observations of accretion disks around high-mass young stellar objectswould help to discriminate between different models of formation of massivestars. however, given the complexity of massive star forming regions, suchstudies are still limited in number. additionally, there is still no generalconsensus on the molecular tracers to be used for such investigations. becauseof its close distance and high luminosity, iras 17233-3606 is a potential goodlaboratory to search for traces of rotation in the inner gas around theprotostar(s). therefore, we selected the source for a detailed analysis of itsmolecular emission at 230 ghz with the sma. we systematically investigated thevelocity fields of transitions in the sma spectra which are not affected byoverlap with other transitions, and searched for coherent velocity gradients tocompare them to the distribution of outflows in the region. beside co emissionwe also used high-angular h2 images to trace the outflow motions driven by theiras 17233-3606 cluster. we find linear velocity gradients in many transitionsof the same molecular species and in several molecules. we report the firstdetection of hnco in molecular outflows from massive ysos. we discuss the ch3cnvelocity gradient taking into account various scenarios: rotation, presence ofmultiple unresolved sources with different velocities, and outflow(s). althoughother interpretations cannot be ruled out, we propose that the ch3cn emissionmight be affected by the outflows of the region. higher angular observationsare needed to discriminate between the different scenarios. the presentobservations, with the possible association of ch3cn with outflows in a fewthousands au around the ysos' cluster, (i) question the choice of the tracer toprobe rotating structures, and (ii) show the importance of the use of h2 imagesfor detailed studies of kinematics.

1104.2202	high-mass star formation at high luminosities: w31 at &gt;10^6 l_sun	context: high-mass star formation has been a very active field over the lastdecade, however, most studies targeted regions of luminosities between 10^4 and10^5 l_sun. methods: we selected the w31 star-forming complex with a totalluminosity of ~6x10^6 l_sun for a multi-wavelength spectral line and continuumstudy covering wavelengths from the near- and mid-infrared via (sub)mmwavelength observations to radio data in the cm regime. results: while theoverall structure of the multi-wavelength continuum data resembles each otherwell, there are several intriguing differences. the 24mum emission stemminglargely from small dust grains follows tightly the spatial structure of the cmemission tracing the ionized free-free emission. hence warm dust resides inregions that are spatially associated with the ionized hot gas (~10^4 k) of thehii regions. furthermore, we find several evolutionary stages within the samecomplexes, ranging from infrared-observable clusters, via deeply embeddedregions associated with active star formation traced by 24\,$\mu$m and cmemission, to at least one high-mass gas clump devoid of any such signature. the13co(2-1) and c18o(2-1) spectral line observations reveal a large kinematicbreadth in the entire region with a total velocity range of approximately 90km/s. while the average virial mass ratio for w31 is close to unity, the linewidth analysis indicates large-scale evolutionary differences between thesouthern and northern sub-regions (g10.2-0.3 and g10.3-0.1) of the whole w31complex. the clump mass function - tracing cluster scales and not scales ofindividual stars - derived from the 875mum continuum data has a slope of1.5+-0.3, consistent with previous cloud mass functions.

1105.0344	submillimeter continuum observations of sagittarius b2 at subarcsecond  spatial resolution	we report the first high spatial resolution submillimeter continuumobservations of the sagittarius b2 cloud complex using the submillimeter array(sma). with the subarcsecond resolution provided by the sma, the two massivestar-forming clumps sgr b2(n) and sgr b2(m) are resolved into multiple compactsources. in total, twelve submillimeter cores are identified in the sgr b2(m)region, while only two components are observed in the sgr b2(n) clump. the gasmass and column density are estimated from the dust continuum emission. we findthat most of the cores have gas masses in excess of 100 m$_{\odot}$ and columndensities above 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. the very fragmented appearance of sgrb2(m), in contrast to the monolithic structure of sgr b2 (n), suggests that theformer is more evolved. the density profile of the sgr b2(n)-sma1 core is wellfitted by a plummer density distribution. this would lead one to believe thatin the evolutionary sequence of the sgr b2 cloud complex, a massive star formsfirst in an homogeneous core, and the rest of the cluster forms subsequently inthe then fragmenting structure.

1305.1954	interstellar detection of c-c3d2	we report the first interstellar detection of c-c3d2. the doubly deuteratedcyclopropenylidene, a carbene, has been detected toward the starless cores tmc-1c and l1544 using the iram 30m telescope. the j(ka,kc) = 3(0,3)-2(1,2),3(1,3)-2(0,2), and 2(2,1)-1(1,0) transitions of this species have been observedat 3 mm in both sources. the expected 1:2 intensity ratio has been found in the3(0,3)-2(1,2) and 3(1,3)-2(0,2) lines, belonging to the para and ortho speciesrespectively. we also observed lines of the main species, c-c3h2, the singlydeuterated c-c3hd, and the species with one 13c off of the principal axis ofthe molecule, c-h13cc2h. the lines of c-c3d2 have been observed with highsignal to noise ratio, better than 7.5 sigma in tmc-1c and 9 sigma in l1544.the abundance of doubly deuterated cyclopropenylidene with respect to thenormal species is found to be (0.4 - 0.8)% in tmc-1c and (1.2 - 2.1)% in l1544.the deuteration of this small hydrocarbon ring is analysed with a comprehensivegas-grain model, the first including doubly deuterated species. the observedabundances of c-c3d2 can be explained solely by gas-phase processes, supportingthe idea that c-c3h2 is a good indicator of gas-phase deuteration.

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

1412.1106	herschel survey of galactic oh+, h2o+, and h3o+: probing the molecular  hydrogen fraction and cosmic-ray ionization rate	in diffuse interstellar clouds the chemistry that leads to the formation ofthe oxygen bearing ions oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ begins with the ionization ofatomic hydrogen by cosmic rays, and continues through subsequent hydrogenabstraction reactions involving h2. given these reaction pathways, the observedabundances of these molecules are useful in constraining both the totalcosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen (zeta_h) and molecular hydrogenfraction, f(h2). we present observations targeting transitions of oh+, h2o+,and h3o+ made with the herschel space observatory along 20 galactic sight linestoward bright submillimeter continuum sources. both oh+ and h2o+ are detectedin absorption in multiple velocity components along every sight line, but h3o+is only detected along 7 sight lines. from the molecular abundances we computef(h2) in multiple distinct components along each line of sight, and find agaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042+-0.018. thisconfirms previous findings that oh+ and h2o+ primarily reside in gas with lowh2 fractions. we also infer zeta_h throughout our sample, and find a log-normaldistribution with mean log(zeta_h)=-15.75, (zeta_h=1.78x10^-16 s^-1), andstandard deviation 0.29 for gas within the galactic disk, but outside of thegalactic center. this is in good agreement with the mean and distribution ofcosmic-ray ionization rates previously inferred from h3+ observations.ionization rates in the galactic center tend to be 10--100 times larger thanfound in the galactic disk, also in accord with prior studies.

0807.4208	sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations of the bullet cluster (1e  0657-56) with apex-sz	we present observations of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) in the bulletcluster (1e 0657--56) using the apex-sz instrument at 150 ghz with a resolutionof 1 arcmin. the main results are maps of the sze in this massive, merginggalaxy cluster. the cluster is detected with 23 sigma significance within thecentral 1 arcmin radius of the source position. the sze map has a broadlysimilar morphology to that in existing x-ray maps of this system, and we findno evidence for significant contamination of the sze emission by radio or irsources. in order to make simple quantitative comparisons with cluster gasmodels derived from x-ray observations, we fit our data to an isothermalelliptical beta model, despite the inadequacy of such a model for this complexmerging system. with an x-ray derived prior on the power-law index, beta = 1.04+0.16 -0.10, we find a core radius r_c =142 +/- 18 arcsec, an axial ratio of0.889 +/- 0.072, and a central temperature decrement of -771 +/- 71micro-k_cmb, including a +/-5.5% flux calibration uncertainty. combining theapex-sz map with a map of projected electron surface density from chandra x-rayobservations, we determine the mass-weighted temperature of the cluster gas tobe t_mg=10.8 +/- 0.9 kev, significantly lower than some previously reportedx-ray spectroscopic temperatures. under the assumption of an isothermal clustergas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium, we compute the gas mass fractionfor prolate and oblate spheroidal geometries and find it to be consistent withprevious results from x-ray and weak lensing observations. this work is thefirst result from the apex-sz experiment, and represents the first reportedscientific result from observations with a large array of multiplexedsuperconducting transition-edge sensor bolometers.

astro-ph;0006094	three high-redshift millimeter sources and their radio and near-infrared  identifications	we present millimeter wavelength detections of three faint sources that aremost likely high-redshift starburst galaxies. for one of the sources, which waspreviously discovered with scuba at 850 mu m, we present a detection with theiram interferometer at 240 ghz (1.25 mm) that shows the object unresolved at anangular resolution of 2.''5, and coincident within 1'' with a radio source anda galaxy detected in the near-infrared. the two other sources were discoveredin a deep 250 ghz (1.2 mm) survey with the max-planck millimeter bolometer(mambo) array at the iram 30m telescope. both have fluxes of ~4 mjy and radiocounterparts with a 1.4 ghz flux density of ~75 mujy. their radio-to-mm fluxratios suggest redshifts larger than 2. both sources are faint in the opticaland near-infrared, one showing a 20.5 mag k-band counterpart. from our data andthat available in the literature, we estimate the redshift distribution oftwenty-two faint mm and sub-mm sources and conclude that the majority of themare likely to be at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;0110370	high-mass proto-stellar candidates - ii : density structure from dust  continuum and cs emission	we present a detailed 1.2 mm continuum and cs spectral line study of a largesample of 69 massive star forming regions in very early stages of evolution,most of them prior to building up an ultracompact hii region. the continuumdata show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on thespatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities ofthe whole sample. fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that threeparameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources:constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by afirst power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into asecond power law distribution. the mean inner power law intensity index mi(i~r^(-mi)) is 1.2 corresponding to density indices p (n~r^(-p)) of 1.6. intotal the density distribution of our massive star formations sites seem to benot too different from their low-mass counterparts, but we show that settingtight constrains on the density indices is very difficult and subject to manypossible errors. the local densities we derive from cs calculations are higher(up to one order of magnitude) than the mean densities we find via themm-continuum. such inhomogeneous density distribution reflects most likely theubiquitous phenomenon of clumping and fragmentation in molecular clouds.linewidth-mass relations show a departure from virial equilibrium in the stagesof strongly collapsing cores.

astro-ph;0201311	detection of feo towards sgrb2	we have observed the j=5-4 ground state transition of feo at a frequency of153 ghz towards a selection of galactic sources.  towards the galactic center source sgrb2, we see weak absorption atapproximately the velocity of other features towards this source (62 kms$^{-1}$ lsr).  towards other sources, the results were negative as they were also formgoh(3-2) and fec(6-5). we tentatively conclude that the absorption seen towardsgrb2 is due to feo in the hot ($\sim $ 500 k) relatively low density absorbinggas known to be present in this line of sight.  this is the first (albeit tentative) detection of feo or any iron--containingmolecule in the interstellar gas. assuming the observed absorption to be due tofeo, we estimate [feo]/[sio] to be of order or less than 0.002 and[feo]/[h$_{2}$] of order $3 10^{-11}$. this is compatible with our negativeresults in other sources.  our results suggest that the iron liberated from grains in the shocksassociated with sgrb2 remains atomic and is not processed into molecular form.

astro-ph;0204448	triply deuterated ammonia in ngc 1333	the caltech submillimeter observatory has detected triply deuterated ammonia,nd3, through its 10a-00s transition near 310 ghz. emission is found in the ngc1333 region, both towards iras 4a and a position to the south-east where dco+peaks. in both cases, the hyperfine ratio indicates that the emission isoptically thin. column densities of nd3 are 3--6 x 10^11 cm^-2 for t_ex=10 kand twice as high for t_ex=5 k. using a monte carlo radiative transfer code anda model of the structure of the iras source with temperature and densitygradients, the estimated nd3 abundance is 3.2 x 10^-12 if nd3/h2 is constantthroughout the envelope. in the more likely case that nd3/h2d+ is constant,nd3/h2 peaks in the cold outer parts of the source at a value of 1.0 x 10^-11.to reproduce the observed nh3/nd3 abundance ratio of ~1000, grain surfacechemistry requires an atomic d/h ratio of ~0.15 in the gas phase, &gt;10 timeshigher than in recent chemical models. more likely, the deuteration of nh3occurs by ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase, in which case the dataindicate that deuteron transfer reactions are much faster than protontransfers.

astro-ph;0402563	massive molecular outflows at high spatial resolution	we present high-spatial resolution plateau de bure interferometer co(2-1) andsio(2-1) observations of one intermediate-mass and one high-mass star-formingregion. the intermediate-mass region iras20293+3952 exhibits four molecularoutflows, one being as collimated as the highly collimated jet-like outflowsobserved in low-mass star formation sources. furthermore, comparing the datawith additional infrared h2 and cm observations we see indications that thenearby ultracompact hii region triggers a shock wave interacting with theoutflow. the high-mass region iras19217+1651 exhibits a bipolar outflow as welland the region is dominated by the central driving source. adding two moresources from the literature, we compare position-velocity diagrams of theintermediate- to high-mass sources with previous studies in the low-massregime. we find similar kinematic signatures, some sources can be explained byjet-driven outflows whereas other are better constrained by wind-driven models.the data also allow to estimate accretion rates varying from a few times10^{-5}msun/yr for the intermediate-mass sources to a few times 10^{-4}msun/yrfor the high-mass source, consistent with models explaining star formation ofall masses via accretion processes.

astro-ph;0407384	high-spatial-resolution cn and cs observation of two regions of massive  star formation	molecular line cn, cs and mm continuum observations of two intermediate- tohigh-mass star-forming regions - iras20293+3952 and iras19410+2336 - obtainedwith the plateau de bure interferometer at high spatial resolution revealinteresting characteristics of the gas and dust emission. in spite of theexpectation that the cn and cs morphology might closely follow the dense gastraced by the dust continuum, both molecules avoid the most central cores.comparing the relative line strengths of various cn hyperfine components, thisappears not to be an opacity effect but to be due to chemical and physicaleffects. the cn data also indicate enhanced emission toward the differentmolecular outflows in the region. regarding cs, avoiding the central cores canbe due to high optical depth, but the data also show that the cs emission isnearly always associated with the outflows of the region. therefore, neither csnor cn appear well suited for dense gas and disk studies in these two sources,and we recommend the use of different molecules for future massive diskstudies. an analysis of the 1 and 3mm continuum fluxes toward iras20293+3952reveals that the dust opacity index beta is lower than the canonical value of2. tentatively, we identify a decreasing gradient of beta from the edge of thecore to the core center. this could be due to increasing optical depth towardthe core center and/or grain growth within the densest cores and potentialcentral disks. we detect 3mm continuum emission toward the collimated outflowemanating from iras20293+3952. the spectral index of alpha ~ 0.8 in this regionis consistent with standard models for collimated ionized winds.

astro-ph;0410619	hdo abundance in the envelope of the solar-type protostar iras16293-2422	we present iram 30m and jcmt observations of hdo lines towards the solar-typeprotostar iras 16293-2422. five hdo transitions have been detected on-source,and two were unfruitfully searched for towards a bright spot of the outflow ofiras 16293-2422. we interpret the data by means of the ceccarelli, hollenbachand tielens (1996) model, and derive the hdo abundance in the warm inner andcold outer parts of the envelope. the emission is well explained by a jumpmodel, with an inner abundance of 1e-7 and an outer abundance lower than 1e-9(3 sigma). this result is in favor of hdo enhancement due to ice evaporationfrom the grains in theinner envelope. the deuteration ratio hdo/h2o is found tobe f_in=3% and f_out &lt; 0.2% (3 sigma) in the inner and outer enveloperespectively and therefore, the fractionation also undergoes a jump in theinner part of the envelope. these results are consistent with the formation ofwater in the gas phase during the cold prestellar core phase and storage of themolecules on the grains, but do not explain why observations of h2o icesconsistently derive a h2o ice abundance of several 1e-5 to 1e-4, some twoorders of magnitude larger than the gas phase abundance of water in the hotcore around iras 16293-2422.

astro-ph;0508421	high mass starless cores	we report the identification of a sample of potential high-mass starlesscores (hmscs). the cores were discovered by comparing images of the fieldscontaining candidate high-mass protostellar objects (hmpos) at 1.2mm andmid-infrared (8.3um; mir) wavelengths. while the hmpos are detected at bothwavelengths, several cores emitting at 1.2mm in the same fields show absorptionor no emission at the mir wavelength. we argue that the absorption is caused bycold dust. the estimated masses of a few 10^2msun - 10^3 msun and the lack ofir emission suggests that they may be massive cold cores in a pre-stellarphase, which could presumably form massive stars eventually. ammonia (1,1) and(2,2) observations of the cores indicate smaller velocity dispersions and lowerrotation temperatures compared to hmpos and uchii regions suggesting aquiescent pre-stellar stage. we propose that these newly discovered cores aregood candidates for the hmsc stage in high-mass star-formation. this sample ofcores will allow us to study the high-mass star and cluster formation processesat the earliest evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0603201	discovery of interstellar cf+	we discuss the first astronomical detection of the cf+ (fluoromethylidynium)ion, obtained by observations of the j=1-0 (102.6 ghz), j=2-1 (205.2 ghz) andj=3-2 (307.7 ghz) rotational transitions toward the orion bar region. oursearch for cf+, carried out using the iram 30m and apex 12m telescopes, wasmotivated by recent theoretical models that predict cf+ abundances of a fewtimes 1.e-10 in uv-irradiated molecular regions where c+ is present. the cf+ion is produced by exothermic reactions of c+ with hf. because fluorine atomscan react exothermically with h2, hf is predicted to be the dominant reservoirof fluorine, not only in well-shielded regions but also in the surface layersof molecular clouds where the c+ abundance is large. the observed cf+ lineintensities imply the presence of cf+ column densities of at least 1.e+12 cm-2over a region of size at least ~ 1 arcmin, in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions. they provide support for our current theories of interstellarfluorine chemistry, which suggest that hydrogen fluoride should be ubiquitousin interstellar gas clouds and widely detectable in absorption by futuresatellite and airborne observatories.

astro-ph;0605582	apex mapping of h3o+ in the sgr b2 region	the cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta) of dense molecular clouds is a keyparameter for their dynamics and chemistry. variations of zeta are wellestablished, but it is unclear if these are related to source column density orto galactic location. using the apex telescope, we have mapped the 364 ghz lineof h3o+ in the sgr b2 region and observed the 307 ghz line at selectedpositions. with the iram 30-m telescope we have observed the 203 ghz line ofh2o-18 at the same positions. strong h3o+ emission is detected over a ~3x2 pcregion, indicating h3o+ column densities of 10^15 - 10^16 cm^-2 in an 18" beam.the h3o+ abundance of ~3 x 10^-9 and h3o+/h2o ratio of ~1/50 in the sgr b2envelope are consistent with models with zeta ~4 x 10^-16 s^-1, 3x lower thanderived from h3+ observations toward sgr a, but 10x that of local dense clouds.the ionization rates of interstellar clouds thus seem to be to first orderdetermined by the ambient cosmic-ray flux, while propagation effects cause afactor of ~3 decrease from diffuse to dense clouds.
