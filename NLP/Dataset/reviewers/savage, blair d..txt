0907.3479	detection of ne viii in an intervening multi-phase absorption system  towards 3c 263	we report on the detection of ne viii in an intervening multiphase absorptionline system at z=0.32566 in the fuse spectrum of the quasar 3c 263. the ne viii770 a line detection has a 3.9 sigma significance. at the same velocity we alsofind absorption lines from c iv, o iii, o iv and n iv. the line parametermeasurements yield log [n(ne viii), cm^-2] =13.98 (+0.10,-0.13) and b = 49.8+/- 5.5 km/s. we find that the ionization mechanism in the gas phase givingrise to the ne viii absorption is inconsistent with photoionization. theabsorber has a multi-phase structure, with the intermediate ions produced incool photoionized gas and the ne viii most likely in a warm collisionallyionized medium in the temperature range (0.5 - 1.0) x 10^6 k. this is thesecond ever detection of an intervening ne viii absorption system. itsproperties resemble the previous ne viii absorber reported by savage et al.(2005). direct observations of h i and o vi are needed to better constrain thephysical conditions in the collisionally ionized gas phase of this absorber.

0907.4955	the extension of the transition temperature plasma into the lower  galactic halo	column densities for h i, al iii, si iv, c iv, and o vi toward 109 stars and30 extragalactic objects have been assembled to study the extensions of thesespecies away from the galactic plane into the galactic halo. h i and al iiimostly trace the warm neutral and warm ionized medium, respectively, while siiv, c iv and o vi trace a combination of warm photoionized and collisionallyionized plasmas. the much larger object sample compared to previous studiesallows us to consider and correct for the effects of the sample bias that hasaffected earlier but smaller surveys of the gas distributions. we find si ivand c iv have similar exponential scale heights of 3.2(+1.0, -0.6) and3.6(+1.0, -0.8) kpc. the scale height of o vi is marginally smaller with h =2.6+/- 0.6 kpc. the transition temperature gas is ~3 times more extended thanthe warm ionized medium traced by al iii with h = 0.90(+0.62, -0.33) kpc and~12 times more extended than the warm neutral medium traced by h i with h =0.24 +/- 0.06 kpc. there is a factor of 2 decrease in the dispersion of the logof the column density ratios for transition temperature gas for lines of sightin the galactic disk compared to extragalactic lines of sight through theentire halo. the observations are compared to the predictions of the variousmodels for the production of the transition temperature gas in the halo. theappendix presents a revision to the electron scale height proposed by gaensleret al.

1006.0974	exploring the origin and fate of the magellanic stream with ultraviolet  and optical absorption	(abridged) we present an analysis of ionization and metal enrichment in themagellanic stream (ms), the nearest gaseous tidal stream, using hst/stis andfuse ultraviolet spectroscopy of two background agn, ngc 7469 and mrk 335. forngc 7469, we include optical spectroscopy from vlt/uves. in both sightlines thems is detected in low-ion and high-ion absorption. toward ngc 7469, we measurea ms oxygen abundance [o/h]_ms=[oi/hi]=-1.00+/-0.05(stat)+/-0.08(syst),supporting the view that the stream originates in the smc rather than the lmc.we use cloudy to model the low-ion phase of the stream as a photoionized plasmausing the observed si iii/si ii and c iii/c ii ratios. toward mrk 335 thisyields an ionization parameter log u between -3.45 and -3.15 and a gas densitylog (n_h/cm^-3) between -2.51 and -2.21. toward ngc 7469 we derive sub-solarabundance ratios for [si/o], [fe/o], and [al/o], indicating the presence ofdust in the ms. the high-ion column densities are too large to be explained byphotoionization, but also cannot be explained by a single-temperaturecollisional-ionization model (equilibrium or non-equilibrium). this suggeststhe high-ion plasma is multi-phase. summing over the low-ion and high-ionphases, we derive conservative lower limits on the ratio n(total h ii)/n(h i)of &gt;19 toward ngc 7469 and &gt;330 toward mrk 335, showing that along these twodirections the vast majority of the stream has been ionized. the presence ofwarm-hot plasma together with the small-scale structure observed at 21 cmprovides evidence for an evaporative interaction with the hot galactic corona.this scenario, predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, suggests that the fateof the ms will be to replenish the galactic corona with new plasma, rather thanto bring neutral fuel to the disk.

1202.5973	characterizing transition temperature gas in the galactic corona	we present a study of the properties of the transition temperature (t~10^5 k)gas in the milky way corona, based on measurements of ovi, nv, civ, siiv andfeiii absorption lines seen in the far ultraviolet spectra of 58 sightlines toextragalactic targets, obtained with far-ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer(fuse) and space telescope imaging spectrograph. in many sightlines thegalactic absorption profiles show multiple components, which are analyzedseparately. we find that the highly-ionized atoms are distributed irregularlyin a layer with a scaleheight of about 3 kpc, which rotates along with the gasin the disk, without an obvious gradient in the rotation velocity away from thegalactic plane. within this layer the gas has randomly oriented velocities witha dispersion of 40-60 km/s. on average the integrated column densities are logn(ovi)=14.3, log n(nv)=13.5, log n(civ)=14.2, log n(siiv)=13.6 and logn(feiii)=14.2, with a dispersion of just 0.2 dex in each case. in sightlinesaround the galactic center and galactic north pole all column densities areenhanced by a factor ~2, while at intermediate latitudes in the southern skythere is a deficit in n(ovi) of about a factor 2, but no deficit for the otherions. we compare the column densities and ionic ratios to a series oftheoretical predictions: collisional ionization equilibrium, shock ionization,conductive interfaces, turbulent mixing, thick disk supernovae, staticnon-equilibrium ionization (nie) radiative cooling and an nie radiative coolingmodel in which the gas flows through the cooling zone. none of these models canfully reproduce the data, but it is clear that non-equilibrium ionizationradiative cooling is important in generating the transition temperature gas.

1203.3049	highly ionized collimated outflow from he 0238 - 1904	we present a detailed analysis of a highly ionized, multiphased andcollimated outflowing gas detected through o v, o vi, ne viii and mg xabsorption associated with the qso he 0238 - 1904 (z_em ~ 0.629). based on thesimilarities in the absorption line profiles and estimated covering fractions,we find that the o vi and ne viii absorption trace the same phase of theabsorbing gas. simple photoionization models can reproduce the observed n(neviii), n(o vi) and n(mg x) from a single phase whereas the low ionizationspecies (e.g. n iii, n iv, o iv) originate from a different phase. the measuredn(ne viii)/n(o vi) ratio is found to be remarkably similar (within a factor of~ 2) in several individual absorption components kinematically spread over ~1800 km/s. under photoionization this requires a fine tuning between hydrogendensity (nh) and the distance of the absorbing gas from the qso. alternativelythis can also be explained by collisional ionization in hot gas with t &gt;10^{5.7} k. long-term stability favors the absorbing gas being located outsidethe broad line region (blr). we speculate that the collimated flow of such ahot gas could possibly be triggered by the radio jet interaction.

astro-ph;0205415	a fuse survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen in translucent clouds	we report the first ensemble results from the fuse survey of molecularhydrogen in lines of sight with a_v $\gtrsim$ 1 mag. we have developedtechniques for fitting computed profiles to the low-j lines of h2, and thusdetermining column densities for j = 0 and j = 1, which contain $\gtrsim$99% ofthe total h2. from these column densities and ancillary data we have derivedthe total h2 column densities, hydrogen molecular fractions, and kinetictemperatures for 23 lines of sight. this is the first significant sample ofmolecular hydrogen column densities of 10^21 cm^-2, measured through uvabsorption bands. we have also compiled a set of extinction data for theselines of sight, which sample a wide range of environments. we have searched forcorrelations of our h2-related quantities with previously published columndensities of other molecules and extinction parameters. we find strongcorrelations between h2 and molecules such as ch, cn, and co, in generalagreement with predictions of chemical models. we also find the expectedcorrelations between hydrogen molecular fraction and various density indicatorssuch as kinetic temperature, cn abundance, the steepness of the far-uvextinction rise, and the width of the 2175a bump. despite the relatively largemolecular fractions, we do not see the values greater than 0.8 expected intranslucent clouds. with the exception of a few lines of sight, we see littleevidence for the presence of individual translucent clouds in our sample. weconclude that most of the lines of sight are actually composed of two or morediffuse clouds similar to those found toward targets like zeta oph. we suggesta modification in terminology to distinguish between a "translucent line ofsight" and a "translucent cloud."

astro-ph;0310769	highly ionized gas surrounding high velocity cloud complex c	we present far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer and hubble space telescopeobservations of high, intermediate, and low ion absorption in high-velocitycloud complex c along the lines of sight toward five active galaxies. ourpurpose is to investigate the idea that complex c is surrounded by an envelopeof highly ionized material, arising from the interaction between the cloud anda hot surrounding medium. we measure column densities of high-velocity high ionabsorption, and compare the kinematics of low, intermediate, and highionization gas along the five sight lines. we find that in all five cases, theh i and o vi high-velocity components are centered within 20 km/s of oneanother, with an average displacement of &lt;v(o vi)-v(h i)&gt;=3+-12 km/s. in thosedirections where the h i emission extends to more negative velocities (theso-called high-velocity ridge), so does the o vi absorption. we compare ourhigh ion column density ratios to the predictions of various models, adjustedto account for both recent updates to the solar elemental abundances, and forthe relative elemental abundance ratios in complex c. our observed ratios areinconsistent with collisional ionization equilibrium at one kinetictemperature. photoionization by the extragalactic background is ruled out asthe source of the high ions, since the path lengths required would make complexc unreasonably large. we consider the most likely origin for the highly ionizedhigh-velocity gas to be at the conductive or turbulent interfaces between theneutral/warm ionized components of complex c and a surrounding hot medium. thepresence of interfaces on the surface of hvcs provides indirect evidence forthe existence of a hot medium in which the hvcs are immersed.

astro-ph;0508470	a method for deriving accurate gas-phase abundances for the multiphase  interstellar galactic halo	we describe a new method for determining total gas-phase abundances for thegalactic ism with minimal ionization uncertainties. for sight lines towardglobular clusters containing both uv-bright stars and radio pulsars, one canmeasure column densities of hi and several metal ions using uv absorptionmeasurements and of h ii using radio dispersion measurements, therebyminimizing ionization uncertainties. we apply this method to the globularcluster messier 3 sight line using fuse and hst ultraviolet spectroscopy of thepost-asymptotic giant branch star von zeipel 1128 and radio observations byransom et al. of millisecond pulsars. ionized hydrogen is 45+/-5% of the totalalong this sight line, the highest measured fraction along a high-latitudepulsar sight line. we derive total gas-phase abundances log n(s)/n(h) =-4.87+/-0.03 and log n(fe)/n(h) = -5.27+/-0.05. our derived sulfur abundance isin excellent agreement with recent solar system determinations of asplund,grevesse, &amp; sauval, but -0.14 dex below the solar system abundance typicallyadopted in studies of the ism. the iron abundance is ~-0.7 dex below the solarsystem abundance, consistent with significant depletion. abundance estimatesderived by simply comparing s ii and fe ii to h i are +0.17 and +0.11 dexhigher, respectively, than our measurements. ionization corrections to thegas-phase abundances measured in the standard way are, therefore, significantcompared with the measurement uncertainties along this sight line. thesystematic uncertainties associated with the uncertain contribution to theelectron column density from ionized helium could raise these abundances by&lt;+0.03 dex (+7%).

(2) physical conditions in the lymanlimit absorber at z(abs) = 2.3150 differ significantly from the galacticgaseous halo, and photoionization models require [si/h] &gt; -0.95 and [al/h] &gt;-0.96 for the strongest component of this absorber. abundances of three otherlyman limit absorbers are also derived from photoionization models. (3)unsaturated c iv and rather strong n v are detected in the associated absorberat z(abs) = 2.7125. the apparent column density profiles indicate that n v isaffected by unresolved saturation or that the n v absorbing gas does notcompletely cover the qso flux source. from photoionization models we derive[n/h] &gt; -0.65 and [c/h] &gt; -0.82.

astro-ph;9709197	extraplanar dust in the edge-on spiral ngc 891	we present high-resolution (&lt;0.65") optical broad-band images of the edge-onsb galaxy ngc 891 obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope. these bvr imagesreveal a complex network of hundreds of dust absorbing structures far from themid-plane of the galaxy. the dust structures have a wide range of morphologiesand are clearly visible to |z|&lt;1.5 kpc from the mid-plane. in this paper wediscuss the general characteristics of the population of absorbing structures,as well as physical properties of 12 individual features. these 12 structuresare characterised by n_h &gt;10^21 cm^-2, with masses estimated to be more than2x10^5 - 5x10^6 solar masses, assuming galactic gas-to-dust relationships. thegravitational potential energies of the individual dust structures, given theirobserved heights and derived masses, lie in the range of 20-200x10^51 ergs.rough number counts of extraplanar dust features suggest the mass of high-z gasassociated with extraplanar dust in ngc 891 likely exceeds 2x10^8 solar masses,or ~2% of the total neutral ism mass of the galaxy.  we discuss several mechanisms which may produce high-z dust structures suchas those seen in the images presented here. it is not yet known which of thesemechanisms are primarily responsible for the extensive extraplanar duststructures seen in our images. the data presented are part of a larger programto search for and characterize off-plane dust structures in edge-on systems.(abstract abridged)

astro-ph;9710045	the metallicity and dust content of hvc 287.5+22.5+240: evidence for a  magellanic clouds origin	we estimate the abundances of s and fe in the high velocity cloud hvc287.5+22.5+240, which has a velocity of +240 km/s with respect to the localstandard of rest and is in the galactic direction l~287, b~23. the measurementsare based on uv absorption lines of these elements in the hubble spacetelescope spectrum of ngc 3783, a background seyfert galaxy, as well as new h i21-cm interferometric data taken with the australia telescope. we finds/h=0.25+/-0.07 and fe/h=0.033+/-0.006 solar, with s/fe=7.6+/-2.2 times thesolar ratio. the s/h value provides an accurate measure of the chemicalenrichment level in the hvc, while the super-solar s/fe ratio clearly indicatesthe presence of dust, which depletes the gas-phase abundance of fe. themetallicity and depletion information obtained here, coupled with the velocityand the position of the hvc in the sky, strongly suggest that the hvcoriginated from the magellanic clouds. it is likely (though not necessary) thatthe same process(es) that generated the magellanic stream is also responsiblefor hvc 287.5+22.5+240.

astro-ph;9806036	the relationship between galaxies and low redshift weak lyman alpha  absorbers in the directions of h1821+643 and pg1116+215	to study the nature of low z lya absorbers in the spectra of qsos, we haveobtained high signal-to-noise uv spectra of h 1821+643 (z = 0.297) and pg1116+215 (z = 0.177) with the ghrs on the hst. the spectra have minimum s/n of70-100 and 3 sigma limiting equivalent widths of 50-75 ma. we detect 26 lyalines with wr &gt; 50 ma toward h1821+643 and 13 toward pg1116+215, which impliesa density of 102+/-16 lines per unit redshift. the two-point correlationfunction shows marginal evidence of clustering on ~500 km/s scales, but only ifthe weakest lines are excluded. we have also used the wiyn observatory tomeasure galaxy redshifts in the ~1 degree fields centered on each qso. we find17 galaxy-absorber pairs within projected distances of 1 mpc with velocityseparations of 350 km/s or less. monte carlo simulations show that if the lyalines are randomly distributed, the probability of observing this many closepairs is 3.6e-5. we find that all galaxies with projected distances of 600 kpcor less have associated lya absorbers within 1000 km/s, and the majority ofthese galaxies have absorbers within 350 km/s. we also find that the lyaequivalent width is anticorrelated with the projected distance of the nearestgalaxy out to at least 600 kpc, but this should be interpreted cautiouslybecause there are potential selection biases. statistical tests using theentire sample also indicate that the absorbers are not randomly distributed. wediscuss the nature of the lya absorbers in light of the new data.

astro-ph;9806123	the hst quasar absorption line key project. xiv. the evolution of  ly-alpha absorption lines in the redshift interval 0 to 1.5	we present an analysis of the evolution of the ly alpha absorption lines inthe redshift interval 0.0 to \sim 1.5 based upon a sample of 987 linesidentified in the spectra of 63 qsos obtained with the faint objectspectrograph on the hubble space telescope. fits to the number of absorbers perunit redshift dn/dz = a \times (1+z)^\gamma yield values of \gamma in the range0.1 to 0.3, decidedly flatter than results from groundbased data pertaining tothe redshift range z &gt; 1.7. the combination of the space and groundbased datasuggest a marked transition in the rate of evolution of the ly alpha lines at aredshift of about 1.7. the distribution in redshift is well represented by apower law and the distribution of equivalent widths above a rest equivalentwidth of 0.1 \aa is fit well by an exponential. the sample of ly alpha systemswhich has ions from heavy elements has a much larger value of \gamma than asample of lines of comparable strength without heavy elements. we argue thatthis is not likely due to either line misidentification or incomplete spectralcoverage and suggest that it is due to rapid evolution of the very highestcolumn density systems, rather than differences in metallicity. we also findevidence that the rate of evolution increases with increasing equivalent width.we compare our results for the variation of line density with redshift torecent numerical simulations of ly alpha absorbers, and find fairly goodagreement. our results for the stronger ly alpha lines in our sample arecompatible with the recent analysis of the absorber--galaxy correlation by chenet al. 1998 but for the weaker lines our results suggest that the associationbetween absorbers and galaxies is different from that for the stronger lines.

astro-ph;9809231	highly ionized high velocity clouds: intergalactic gas in the local  group or distant gas in the galactic halo?	we have recently identified several high velocity (v &lt; -100 km/s) clouds inthe directions of mrk 509 and pks 2155-304 that have unusual ionizationproperties. the clouds exhibit strong c iv absorption with little or nodetectable low ion (c ii, si ii) absorption or h i 21cm emission. as theclosest known analog to the outer diffuse halos of damped ly-alpha absorbersand the low h i column density metal line absorption systems seen in thespectra of high redshift quasars, these "c iv-hvcs" present uniqueopportunities for relating the conditions within the milky way halo and nearbyintergalactic gas to the properties of galactic halos at higher redshift.  the c iv-hvcs have ionization properties consistent with photoionization byextragalactic background radiation, though some contribution by collisionalionization within a hot plasma cannot be ruled out. the clouds are probably lowdensity [n(h) ~ 10^-4 cm^-3], large [greater than several kiloparsecs], andmostly ionized [n(hi)/n(h) ~ 10^-3] regions located well beyond the neutral gaslayer of the galaxy. the presence of weak h i-hvcs detected through 21cmemission near both sight lines indicates that the c iv-hvcs trace the extended,ionized, low density regions of the h i-hvcs. several lines of evidence,including very low thermal pressures (p/k ~ 2 cm^-3 k), favor a location forthe c iv-hvcs in the local group or very distant galactic halo.

astro-ph;9810442	dust in the ionized medium of the galaxy: ghrs measurements of al iii  and s iii	we present interstellar absorption line measurements of the ions s iii and aliii towards six stars using archival goddard high resolution spectrograph data.the ions al iii and s iii trace heavily depleted and non-depleted elements,respectively, in ionized gas. we use the photoionization code cloudy to derivethe ionization correction relating n(al iii)/n(s iii) to the gas-phaseabundance [al/s]_i in the ionized gas. for spectral types considered here, thecorrections are small and independent of the assumed ionization parameter.using the results of these photoionization models, we find [al/s]_i = -1.0 inthe ionized gas towards three disk stars. these values of [al/s]_i (=[al/h]_i)imply that al-bearing grains are present in the ionized nebulae around thesestars. if the wim of the galaxy is photoionized by ob stars, our data for twohalo stars imply [al/s]_i = -0.4 to -0.5 in the wim and thus the presence ofdust grains containing al in this important phase of the ism. whilephotoionization appears to be the most likely origin of the ionization for aliii and s iii, we cannot rule out confusion from the presence of hot,collisionally ionized gas along two sightlines. we find that [al/s]_i in theionized gas along the six sightlines is anti-correlated with the electrondensity and average sightline neutral density. the degree of grain destructionin the ionized medium of the galaxy is not much higher than in the warm neutralmedium. the existence of grains in the ionized regions studied here hasimportant implications for the thermal balance of these regions.

0706.1214	a high-resolution survey of low-redshift qso absorption lines:  statistics and physical conditions of o vi absorbers	using high-resolution uv spectra of 16 low-z qsos, we study the physicalconditions and statistics of o vi absorption in the igm at z &lt; 0.5. we identify51 intervening (z_{abs} &lt;&lt; z_{qso}) o vi systems comprised of 77 individualcomponents, and we find 14 "proximate" systems (z_{abs} ~ z_{qso}) containing34 components. for intervening systems [components] with rest-frame equivalentwidth w_{r} &gt; 30 ma, the number of o vi absorbers per unit redshift dn/dz =15.6(+2.9/-2.4) [21.0(+3.2/-2.8)], and this decreases to dn/dz = 0.9(+1.0/-0.5)[0.3(+0.7/-0.3)] for w_{r} &gt; 300 ma. the number per redshift increases steeplyas z_{abs} approaches z_{qso}, and some proximate absorbers have substantiallylower h i/o vi ratios. the lower proximate ratios could be partially due toionization effects but also require higher metallicities. we find that 37% ofthe intervening o vi absorbers have velocity centroids that are well-alignedwith corresponding h i absorption. if the o vi and the h i trace the same gas,the relatively small differences in line widths imply the absorbers are coolwith t &lt; 10^{5} k. most of these well-aligned absorbers have thecharacteristics of metal-enriched photoionized gas. however, the o vi in theapparently simple and cold systems could be associated with a hot phase with t~ 10^{5.5} k if the metallicity is high enough to cause the associated broad lyalpha absorption to be too weak to detect. we show that 53% of the interveningo vi systems are complex multiphase absorbers that can accommodate both lowermetallicity collisionally-ionized gas with t &gt; 10^{5} k and cold photoionzedgas.
