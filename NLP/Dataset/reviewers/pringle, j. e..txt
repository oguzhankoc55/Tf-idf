0903.4098	a simple model for the relationship between star formation and surface  density	we investigate the relationship between the star formation rate per unit areaand the surface density of the ism (the local kennicutt-schmitt law) using asimplified model of the ism and a simple estimate of the star formation ratebased on the mass of gas in bound clumps, the local dynamical timescales of theclumps, and an efficiency parameter of around 5 per cent. despite thesimplicity of the approach, we are able to reproduce the observed linearrelation between star formation rate and surface density of dense (molecular)gas. we use a simple model for the dependence of h_2 fraction on total surfacedensity to argue why neither total surface density nor the hi surface densityare good local indicators of star formation rate. we also investigate thedependence of the star formation rate on the depth of the spiral potential. ourmodel indicates that the mean star formation rate does not depend significantlyon the strength of the spiral potential, but that a stronger spiral potential,for a given mean surface density, does result in more of the star formationoccurring close to the spiral arms. this agrees with the observation that granddesign galaxies do not appear to show a larger degree of star formationcompared to their flocculent counterparts.

0905.0637	rs ophiuchi: thermonuclear explosion or disc instability?	sokoloski et al (2008) have recently reported evidence that the recurrentnova rs ophiuchi produced a pair of highly collimated radio jets within days ofits 2006 outburst. this suggests that an accretion disc must be present duringthe outburst. however in the standard picture of recurrent novae asthermonuclear events, any such disc must be expelled from the white dwarfvicinity, as the nuclear energy yield greatly exceeds its binding energy. wesuggest instead that the outbursts of rs oph are thermal--viscous instabilitiesin a disc irradiated by the central accreting white dwarf. the distinctivefeature of rs oph is the very large size of its accretion disc. given this, itfits naturally into a consistent picture of systems with unstable accretiondiscs. this picture explains the presence and speed of the jets, the brightnessand duration of the outburst, and its rise time and linear decay, as well asthe faintness of the quiescence. by contrast, the hitherto standard picture ofrecurrent thermonuclear explosions has a number of severe difficulties. theseinclude the presence of jets, the faintness of quiescence, and the fact the theaccretion disc must be unstable unless it is far smaller than any reasonableestimate.

0905.2362	supernova kicks and misaligned be star binaries	be stars are rapidly spinning b stars surrounded by an outflowing disc of gasin keplerian rotation. be star/x-ray binary systems contain a be star and aneutron star. they are found to have non-zero eccentricities and there isevidence that some systems have a misalignment between the spin axis of thestar and the spin axis of the binary orbit. the eccentricities in these systemsare thought to be caused by a kick to the neutron star during the supernovathat formed it. such kicks would also give rise to misalignments. in this paperwe investigate the extent to which the same kick distribution can give rise toboth the observed eccentricity distribution and the observed misalignments. wefind that a maxwellian distribution of velocity kicks with a low velocitydispersion, $\sigma_k \approx 15\rm km s^{-1}$, is consistent with the observedeccentricity distribution but is hard to reconcile with the observedmisalignments, typically $i \ge 25^\circ$. alternatively a higher velocity kickdistribution, $\sigma_k = 265 \rm km s^{-1}$, is consistent with the observedmisalignments but not with the observed eccentricities, unless post-supernovacircularisation of the binary orbits has taken place. we discuss briefly howthis might be achieved.

0906.0737	black hole mergers: can gas discs solve the `final parsec' problem?	we compute the effect of an orbiting gas disc in promoting the coalescence ofa central supermassive black hole binary. unlike earlier studies, we consider afinite mass of gas with explicit time dependence: we do not assume that the gasnecessarily adopts a steady state or a spatially constant accretion rate, i.e.that the merging black hole was somehow inserted into a pre--existing accretiondisc. we consider the tidal torque of the binary on the disc, and the binary'sgravitational radiation. we study the effects of star formation in the gas discin a simple energy feedback framework. the disc spectrum differs in detail fromthat found before. in particular, tidal torques from the secondary black holeheat the edges of the gap, creating bright rims around the secondary. theserims do not in practice have uniform brightness either in azimuth or time, butcan on average account for as much as 50 per cent of the integrated light fromthe disc. this may lead to detectable high--photon--energy variability on therelatively long orbital timescale of the secondary black hole, and thus offer aprospective signature of a coalescing black hole binary. we also find that thedisc can drive the binary to merger on a reasonable timescale only if its massis at least comparable with that of the secondary black hole, and if theinitial binary separation is relatively small, i.e. $a_0 \lesssim 0.05$ pc.star formation complicates the merger further by removing mass from the disc.in the feedback model we consider, this sets an effective limit to the discmass. as a result, binary merging is unlikely unless the black hole mass ratiois $\la 0.001$. gas discs thus appear not to be an effective solution to the`last parsec' problem for a significant class of mergers.

0907.5142	the shape of an accretion disc in a misaligned black hole binary	we model the overall shape of an accretion disc in a semi-detached binarysystem in which mass is transfered on to a spinning black hole the spin axis ofwhich is misaligned with the orbital rotation axis. we assume the disc is in asteady state. its outer regions are subject to differential precession causedby tidal torques of the companion star. these tend to align the outer parts ofthe disc with the orbital plane. its inner regions are subject to differentialprecession caused by the lense-thirring effect. these tend to align the innerparts of the disc with the spin of the black hole. we give full numericalsolutions for the shape of the disc for some particular disc parameters. wethen show how an analytic approximation to these solutions can be obtained forthe case when the disc surface density varies as a power law with radius. theseanalytic solutions for the shape of the disc are reasonably accurate even forlarge misalignments and can be simply applied for general disc parameters. theyare particularly useful when the numerical solutions would be slow.

0909.4255	chaotic star formation and the alignment of stellar rotation with disc  and planetary orbital axes	we investigate the evolution of the relative angle between the stellarrotation axis and the circumstellar disc axis of a star that forms in a stellarcluster from the collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud. this is an inherentlychaotic environment with variable accretion, both in terms of rate and theangular momentum of the material, and dynamical interactions between stars. wefind that the final stellar rotation axis and disc spin axis can be stronglymisaligned, but this occurs primarily when the disc is truncated by a dynamicalencounter so that the final disc rotation axis depends simply on what fell inlast. this may lead to planetary systems with orbits that are misaligned withthe stellar rotation axis, but only if the final disc contains enough mass toform planets. we also investigate the time variability of the inner disc spinaxis, which is likely to determine the direction of a protostellar jet. we findthat the jet direction varies more strongly for lighter discs, such as thosethat have been truncated by dynamical interactions or have suffered a period ofrapid accretion. finally, we note that variability of the angular momentum ofthe material accreting by a star implies that the internal velocity field ofsuch stars may be more complicated than that of aligned differential rotation.

0910.0002	black hole mergers: the first light	the coalescence of supermassive black hole binaries occurs via the emissionof gravitational waves, that can impart a substantial recoil to the mergedblack hole. we consider the energy dissipation, that results if the recoilingblack hole is surrounded by a thin circumbinary disc. our results differsignificantly from those of previous investigations. we show analytically thatthe dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in theouter disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii. thus, dimensionalestimates, that include only the kinetic energy gained by the disc gas,underestimate the real energy loss. this underestimate can exceed an order ofmagnitude, if the recoil is directed close to the disc plane. we use threedimensional smooth particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations and two dimensionalfinite difference simulations to verify our analytic estimates. we also computethe bolometric light curve, which is found to vary strongly depending upon thekick angle. a prompt emission signature due to this mechanism may be observablefor low mass (10^6 solar mass) black holes whose recoil velocities exceed about1000 km/s. emission at earlier times can mainly result from the response of thedisc to the loss of mass, as the black holes merge. we derive analytically thecondition for this to happen.

0910.0018	supernova kicks and misaligned microquasars	the low-mass x-ray binary microquasar gro j1655-40 is observed to have amisalignment between the jets and the binary orbital plane. since the currentblack hole spin axis is likely to be parallel to the jets, this implies amisalignment between the spin axis of the black hole and the binary orbitalplane. it is likely the black holes formed with an asymmetric supernova whichcaused the orbital axis to misalign with the spin of the stars. we ask whetherthe null hypothesis that the supernova explosion did not affect the spin axisof the black hole can be ruled out by what can be deduced about the propertiesof the explosion from the known system parameters. we find that this nullhypothesis cannot be disproved but we find that the most likely requirements toform the system include a small natal black hole kick (of a few tens of km/s)and a relatively wide pre-supernova binary. in such cases the observed closebinary system could have formed by tidal circularisation without a commonenvelope phase.

0708.1124	warp diffusion in accretion discs: a numerical investigation	in this paper we explore numerically the evolution of a warped accretiondisc. here, we focus here on the regime where the warp evolves diffusively. bycomparing the numerical results to a simple diffusion model, we are able todetermine the diffusion coefficient of the warp, $\alpha_2$, as a function ofthe relevant disc parameters. we find that while in general the disc behaviouris well reproduced by the diffusion model and for relatively large viscositiesthe warp diffusion is well described by the linear theory (in particularconfirming that the warp diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional toviscosity), significant non-linear effects are present as the viscosity becomessmaller, but still dominates over wave-propagation effects. in particular, wefind that the inverse dependence of the diffusion coefficient on viscositybreaks down at low viscosities, so that $\alpha_2$ never becomes larger than asaturation value $\alpha_{\rm max}$ of order unity. this can have majorconsequences in the evolution of systems where a warped disc is present. inparticular, it affects the location of the warp radius in the bardeen-pettersoneffect and therefore the spin up (or spin down) of supermassive black holes inthe nuclei of galaxies. additionally, we also find that while the rate of warpdiffusion does not depend significantly on the detailed viscosity formulation,the rate of internal precession generated by the warp is strongly affected byit. such effects should be considered with care when modeling the evolution ofwarped discs. this emphasises the need to test the above results usingdifferent numerical schemes, and with higher resolution, in order toinvestigate the degree to which numerical simulations are able to provideaccurate modeling of the complex fluid dynamics of warped discs.

0708.2034	alignment and precession of a black hole with a warped accretion disc	we consider the shape of an accretion disc whose outer regions are misalignedwith the spin axis of a central black hole and calculate the steady state formof the warped disc in the case where the viscosity and surface densities arepower laws in the distance from the central black hole. we discuss the shape ofthe resulting disc in both the frame of the black hole and that of the outerdisc. we note that some parts of the disc and also any companion star maybeshadowed from the central regions by the warp. we compute the torque on theblack hole caused by the lense-thirring precession and hence compute thealignment and precession timescales. we generalise the case with viscosity andhence surface density independent of radius to more realistic densitydistributions for which the surface density is a decreasing function of radius.we find that the alignment timescale does not change greatly but the precessiontimescale is more sensitive. we also determine the effect on this timescale ifwe truncate the disc. for a given truncation radius, the the timescales areless affected for more sharply falling density distributions.

1009.0221	a common envelope binary star origin of long gamma-ray bursts	the stellar origin of gamma-ray bursts can be explained by the rapid releaseof energy in a highly collimated, extremely relativistic jet. this in turnappears to require a rapidly spinning highly magnetised stellar core thatcollapses into a magnetic neutron star or a black hole within a relativelymassive envelope. they appear to be associated with type ib/c supernovae but,with a birthrate of around 10^{-6}-10^{-5} per year per galaxy, they areconsiderably rarer than such supernovae in general. to satisfy all theserequirements we hypothesize a binary star model that ends with the merging ofan oxygen neon white dwarf with the carbon-oxygen core of a naked helium starduring a common envelope phase of evolution. the rapid spin and high magneticfield are natural consequences of such a merging. the evolution that leads tothese progenitors is convoluted and so naturally occurs only very rarely. totest the hypothesis we evolve a population of progenitors and find that therate is as required. at low metallicity we calculate that a similar fraction ofstars evolve to this point and so would expect the gamma-ray burst rate tocorrelate with the star formation rate in any galaxy. this too is consistentwith observations. these progenitors, being of intermediate mass, differradically from the usually postulated high-mass stars. thus we can reconcileobservations that the bursts occur close to but not within massive starassociations.

1011.1914	retrograde accretion and merging supermassive black holes	we investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassiveblack hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. this is known to beproblematic for a prograde disc. we show that in contrast, interaction with aretrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking thebinary because there are no orbital resonances. the binary directly absorbsnegative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into adisc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binarymass ratio is close to unity. in many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric,shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. in all cases thebinary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas masscomparable to that of the secondary black hole. importantly, this conclusion isunaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formallysuper--eddington for either hole. the coalescence timescale is therefore always$\sim m_2/\dot m$, where $m_2$ is the secondary black hole mass and $\dot m$the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.

1106.2591	tidal warping of be star decretion discs	rapidly rotating be stars are observed as shell stars when the decretion discis viewed edge on. transitions between the two implies that the discs may bewarped and precessing. type ii x-ray outbursts are thought to occur when thewarped disc interacts with the fast stellar wind. we suggest that tides from amisaligned companion neutron star can cause the observed effects. we makenumerical models of a be star decretion disc in which the spin of the be staris misaligned with the orbital axis of a neutron star companion. tidal torquesfrom the neutron star truncate the disc at a radius small enough that theneutron star orbit does not intersect the disc unless the eccentricity ormisalignment is very large. a magnetic torque from the be star that is largestat the equator, where the rotation is fastest, is approximated by an innerboundary condition. there are large oscillations in the mass and inclination ofthe disc as it moves towards a steady state. these large variations may explainthe observed changes from be star to be shell star and vice-versa and also thetype ii x-ray outbursts. we find the tidal timescale on which the disc warps,precesses and reaches a steady state to be around a year up to a few hundredyears. if present, the oscillations in mass and disc inclination occur on afraction of this timescale depending on the orbital parameters of the binary.the timescales associated with the tidal torque for observed be star binariessuggest that these effects are important in all but the longest periodbinaries.

1107.0154	the properties of the ism in disc galaxies with stellar feedback	we perform calculations of isolated disc galaxies to investigate how theproperties of the ism, the nature of molecular clouds, and the global starformation rate depend on the level of stellar feedback. we adopt a simplephysical model, which includes a galactic potential, a standard cooling andheating prescription of the ism, and self gravity of the gas. stellar feedbackis implemented by injecting energy into dense, gravitationally collapsing gas,but is independent of the schmidt-kennicutt relation. we obtain fractions ofgas, and filling factors for different phases of the ism in reasonable ageementwith observations. supernovae are found to be vital to reproduce the scaleheights of the different components of the ism, and velocity dispersions. thegmcs formed in the simulations display mass spectra similar to theobservations, their normalisation dependent on the level of feedback. we find~40 per cent of the clouds exhibit retrograde rotation, induced by cloud-cloudcollisions. the star formation rates we obtain are in good agreement with theobserved schmidt-kennicutt relation, and are not strongly dependent on the starformation efficiency we assume, being largely self regulated by the feedback.we also investigate the effect of spiral structure by comparing calculationswith and without the spiral component of the potential. the main differencewith a spiral potential is that more massive gmcs are able to accumulate in thespiral arms. thus we are able to reproduce massive gmcs, and the spurs seen inmany grand design galaxies, even with stellar feedback. the presence of thespiral potential does not have an explicit effect on the star formation rate,but can increase the star formation rate indirectly by enabling the formationof long-lived, strongly bound clouds.

1108.3837	disc instability in rs ophiuchi: a path to type ia supernovae?	we study the stability of disc accretion in the recurrent nova rs ophiuchi.we construct a one-dimensional time-dependent model of the binary-disc system,which includes viscous heating and radiative cooling and a self-consistenttreatment of the binary potential. we find that the extended accretion disc inthis system is always unstable to the thermal-viscous instability, andundergoes repeated disc outbursts on ~10-20yr time-scales. this is similar tothe recurrence time-scale of observed outbursts in the rs oph system, but weshow that the disc's accretion luminosity during outburst is insufficient toexplain the observed outbursts. we explore a range of models, and find that inmost cases the accretion rate during outbursts reaches or exceeds the criticalaccretion rate for stable nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface.consequently we suggest that a surface nuclear burning triggered by discinstability may be responsible for the observed outbursts. this allows thewhite dwarf mass to grow over time, and we suggest that disc instability in rsoph and similar systems may represent a path to type ia supernovae.

1112.3364	dead zones around young stellar objects: dependence on physical  parameters	angular momentum is transported outwards through an accretion disc bymagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence thus allowing material to accrete on tothe central object. the magneto-rotational instability (mri) requires a minimumionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc. the inner parts of the discaround a young stellar object are sufficiently hot to be thermally ionised.further out, cosmic rays ionise the surface layers and a dead zone forms at themid-plane where the disc is too cool for the mri to operate. the surfacedensity in the turbulent active layer is often assumed to be constant withradius because the cosmic rays penetrate a constant layer. however, if acritical magnetic reynolds number, re_{m,crit}, is used to determine the extentof the dead zone, the surface density in the layer generally increases withradius. for small critical magnetic reynolds number of order 1, the constantlayer approximation may be a reasonable fit. however, mhd simulations suggestthe critical magnetic reynolds number may be much larger, of order 10^4.analytical fits for the surface density in the magnetic active layer show that\sigma_m \propto re_{m,crit}^{-2} r^{9/2} t^{\,2}$, at temperature t and radiusr, are a good fit for higher critical magnetic reynolds number. for themetallicity variation between our galaxy, the lmc and the smc, there should beno significant difference in the extent of the dead zone. observations suggestan increase in the lifetime of the disc with decreasing metallicity that cannotbe explained by the dead zone structure (ignoring possible differences in dustabundances).

1203.5097	hundred thousand degree gas in the virgo cluster of galaxies	the physical relationship between low-excitation gas filaments at ~10^4 k,seen in optical line emission, and diffuse x-ray emitting coronal gas at ~10^7k in the centers of many galaxy clusters is not understood. it is unclearwhether the ~10^4 k filaments have cooled and condensed from the ambient hot(~10^7 k) medium or have some other origin such as the infall of cold gas in amerger, or the disturbance of an internal cool reservoir of gas by nuclearactivity. observations of gas at intermediate temperatures (~10^5-10^6 k) canpotentially reveal whether the central massive galaxies are gaining cool gasthrough condensation or losing it through conductive evaporation and henceidentify plausible scenarios for transport processes in galaxy cluster gas.here we present spectroscopic detection of ~10^5 k gas spatially associatedwith the h-alpha filaments in a central cluster galaxy, m87 in the virgocluster. the measured emission-line fluxes from triply ionized carbon (civ 1549a) and singly ionized helium (heii 1640 a) are consistent with a model in whichthermal conduction determines the interaction between hot and cold phases.

1204.2959	dead zones around young stellar objects: fu orionis outbursts and  transition discs	we perform global time-dependent simulations of an accretion disc around ayoung stellar object with a dead zone (a region where the magneto-rotationalinstability cannot drive turbulence because the material is not sufficientlyionised). for infall accretion rates on to the disc of around 10^-7 msun/yr,dead zones occur if the critical magnetic reynolds number is larger than about10^4. we model the collapse of a molecular gas cloud. at early times when theinfall accretion rate is high, the disc is thermally ionised and fullyturbulent. however, as the infall accretion rate drops, a dead zone may form ifthe critical magnetic reynolds number is sufficiently large, otherwise the discremains fully turbulent. with a dead zone the disc can become unstable to thegravo-magneto instability. the mass of the star grows in large accretionoutbursts that may explain fu orionis events. at late times there is notsufficient mass in the disc for outbursts to occur but the dead zone becomeseven more prominent as the disc cools. large inner dead zones in the laterstages of disc evolution may help to explain observations of transition discswith an inner hole.

1205.0004	scars of intense accretion episodes at metal-rich white dwarfs	a re-evaluation of time-averaged accretion rates at dbz-type white dwarfspoints to historical, time-averaged rates significantly higher than thecurrently observed episodes at their daz counterparts. the difference betweenthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at daz white dwarfs, whichoften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the dbzstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result fromhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected todate. this paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretionepisodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. for reasonableassumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching orexceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescentcataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions orwide-field monitoring facilities. gaseous debris that is prone to such rapidaccretion may be abundant immediately following a tidal disruption event viacollisions and sublimation, or if additional bodies impinge upon an extantdisk. particulate disk matter accretes at or near the poynting-robertson dragrate for long periods between gas-producing events, consistent with ratesinferred for dusty daz white dwarfs. in this picture, warm daz stars withoutinfrared excesses have rates consistent with accretion from particulate disksthat remain undetected. this overall picture has implications for quasi-steadystate models of accretion and the derived chemical composition of asteroidaldebris in dbz white dwarfs.

1206.4904	giant molecular clouds: what are they made from, and how do they get  there?	we analyse the results of four simulations of isolated galaxies: two with arigid spiral potential of fixed pattern speed, but with different degrees ofstar-formation induced feedback, one with an axisymmetric galactic potentialand one with a `live' self-gravitating stellar component. since we use alagrangian method we are able to select gas that lies within giant molecularclouds (gmcs) at a particular timeframe, and to then study the properties ofthis gas at earlier and later times. we find that gas which forms gmcs is nottypical of the interstellar medium at least 50 myr before the clouds form andreaches mean densities within an order of magnitude of mean cloud densities byaround 10 myr before. the gas in gmcs takes at least 50 myr to return totypical ism gas after dispersal by stellar feedback, and in some cases the gasis never fully recycled. we also present a study of the two-dimensional,vertically-averaged velocity fields within the ism. we show that the velocityfields corresponding to the shortest timescales (that is, those timescalesclosest to the immediate formation and dissipation of the clouds) can bereadily understood in terms of the various cloud formation and dissipationmechanisms. properties of the flow patterns can be used to distinguish theprocesses which drive converging flows (e.g.\ spiral shocks, supernovae) andthus molecular cloud formation, and we note that such properties may bedetectable with future observations of nearby galaxies.

1302.6494	accretion disc viscosity: what do warped discs tell us?	standard, planar accretion discs operate through a dissipative mechanism,usually thought to be turbulent, and often modelled as a viscosity. this actsto take energy from the radial shear, enabling the flow of mass and angularmomentum in the radial direction. in a previous paper we discussedobservational evidence for the magnitude of this viscosity, and pointed outdiscrepancies between these values and those obtained in numerical simulations.in this paper we discuss the observational evidence for the magnitude of thedissipative effects which act in non--planar discs, both to transfer and toeliminate the non--planarity. estimates based on the model by ogilvie (1999),which assumes a small--scale, isotropic viscosity, give alignment timescalesfor fully ionized discs which are apparently too short by a factor of a fewcompared with observations, although we emphasize that more detailedcomputations as well as tighter observational constraints are required toverify this conclusion. for discs with low temperature and conductivity, wefind that the timescales for disc alignment based on isotropic viscosity aretoo short by around two orders of magnitude. this large discrepancy suggeststhat our understanding of viscosity in quiescent discs is currently inadequate.

1303.4995	the exciting lives of giant molecular clouds	we present a detailed study of the evolution of gmcs in a galactic discsimulation. we follow individual gmcs (defined in our simulations by a totalcolumn density criterion), including their level of star formation, from theirformation to dispersal. we find the evolution of gmcs is highly complex. gmcsoften form from a combination of smaller clouds and ambient ism, and similarlydisperse by splitting into a number of smaller clouds and ambient ism. howeversome clouds emerge as the result of the disruption of a more massive gmc,rather than from the assembly of smaller clouds. likewise in some cases, cloudsaccrete onto more massive clouds rather than disperse. because of thedifficulty of determining a precursor or successor of a given gmc, determininggmc histories and lifetimes is highly non-trivial. using a definition relatingto the continuous evolution of a cloud, we obtain lifetimes typically of 4-25myr for &gt;10^5 m$_{\odot}$ gmcs, over which time the star formation efficiencyis about 1 %. we also relate the lifetime of gmcs to their crossing time. wefind that the crossing time is a reasonable measure of the actual lifetime ofthe cloud, although there is considerable scatter. the scatter is found to beunavoidable because of the complex and varied shapes and dynamics of theclouds. we study cloud dispersal in detail and find both stellar feedback andshear contribute to cloud disruption. we also demonstrate that gmcs do notbehave as ridge clouds, rather massive spiral arm gmcs evolve into smallerclouds in inter-arm spurs.

0801.1564	the evolution of black hole mass and spin in active galactic nuclei	we argue that supermassive black hole growth in agn occurs via sequences ofrandomly--oriented accretion discs with angular momentum limited byself--gravity. these stably co-- or counter--align with the black hole spinwith almost equal frequency. accretion from these discs very rapidly adjuststhe hole's spin parameter to average values $\bar a \sim 0.1-0.3$ (the preciserange depending slightly on the disc vertical viscosity coefficient $\alpha_2$)from any initial conditions, but with significant fluctuations ($\delta a\sim\pm 0.2$) about these. we conclude (a) agn black holes should on average spinmoderately, with the mean value $\bar a$ decreasing slowly as the massincreases; (b) smbh coalescences leave little long--term effect on $\bar a$;(c) smbh coalescence products in general have modest recoil velocities, so thatthere is little likelihood of their being ejected from the host galaxy; (d)black holes can grow even from stellar masses to $\sim 5\times 10^9 \msun$ athigh redshift $z\sim 6$; (e) jets produced in successive accretion episodes canhave similar directions, but after several episodes the jet direction deviatessignificantly. rare examples of massive holes with larger spin parameters couldresult from prograde coalescences with smbh of similar mass, and are mostlikely to be found in giant ellipticals. we compare these results withobservation.

0801.2100	disc evolution and the relationship between $l_{\rm acc}$ and $l_\ast$  in t tauri stars	we investigate the evolution of accretion luminosity $l_{\rm acc}$ andstellar luminosity ${l_\ast}$ in pre-mainsequence stars. we make the assumptionthat when the star appears as a class ii object, the major phase of accretionis long past, and the accretion disc has entered its asymptotic phase. we usean approximate stellar evolution scheme for accreting pre-mainsequence starsbased on hartmann, cassen &amp; kenyon, 1997. we show that the observed range ofvalues $k = l_{\rm acc}/l_\ast$ between 0.01 and 1 can be reproduced if thevalues of the disc mass fraction $m_{\rm disc}/m_*$ at the start of the t tauriphase lie in the range 0.01 -- 0.2, independent of stellar mass. we also showthat the observed upper bound of $l_{\rm acc} \sim l_\ast$ is a generic featureof such disc accretion. we conclude that as long as the data uniformly fillsthe region between this upper bound and observational detection thresholds,then the degeneracies between age, mass and accretion history severely limitthe use of this data for constraining possible scalings between disc propertiesand stellar mass.

1309.6244	the dependence of stellar age distributions on gmc environment	in this letter, we analyse the distributions of stellar ages in giantmolecular clouds (gmcs) in spiral arms, inter-arm spurs, and at large galacticradii, where the spiral arms are relatively weak. we use the results ofnumerical simulations of galaxies, which follow the evolution of gmcs andinclude star particles where star formation events occur. we find that gmcs inspiral arms tend to have predominantly young (&lt; 10 myr) stars. by contrast,clouds which are the remainders of spiral arm gmas that have been sheared intointer-arm gmcs, contain fewer young (&lt; 10 myr) stars, and more ~20 myr stars.we also show that clouds which form in the absence of spiral arms, due to localgravitational and thermal instabilities, contain preferentially young stars. wepropose the age distributions of stars in gmcs will be a useful diagnostic totest different cloud evolution scenarios, the origin of spiral arms, and thesuccess of numerical models of galactic star formation. we discuss theimplications of our results in the context of galactic and extragalacticmolecular clouds.

1401.6173	stochastic accretion of planetesimals onto white dwarfs: constraints on  the mass distribution of accreted material from atmospheric pollution	this paper explores how the stochastic accretion of planetesimals onto whitedwarfs would be manifested in observations of their atmospheric pollution.archival observations of pollution levels for unbiased samples of da and non-dawhite dwarfs are used to derive the distribution of accretion rates, confirmingthat rates become systematically lower as sinking time is decreased, with nodiscernable dependence on cooling age. the accretion rates expected fromplanetesimals that are all the same mass (ie, a mono-mass distribution) areexplored both analytically and using a monte carlo model, quantifying howmeasured accretion rates inevitably depend on sinking time, since differentsinking times probe different times since the last accretion event. however,that dependence is so dramatic that a mono-mass distribution can be excluded.consideration of accretion from a broad distribution of planetesimal massesuncovers an important conceptual difference: accretion is continuous (ratherthan stochastic) for planetesimals below a certain mass, and the accretion ofsuch planetesimals determines the rate typically inferred from observations;smaller planetesimals dominate the rates for shorter sinking times. areasonable fit to the observationally inferred accretion rate distributions isfound with model parameters consistent with a collisionally evolved massdistribution up to pluto-mass, and an underlying accretion rate distributionconsistent with that expected from descendants of debris discs of main sequencea stars. with these parameters, while both da and non-da white dwarfs accretefrom the same broad planetesimal distribution, this model predicts that thepollution seen in das is dominated by the continuous accretion of &lt;35kmobjects, and that in non-das by &gt;35km objects (though the dominant size variesbetween stars by around an order of magnitude from this value)...

0802.3912	alignment timescale of the microquasar gro j1655-40	the microquasar gro j1655-40 has a black hole with spin angular momentumapparently misaligned to the orbital plane of its companion star. weanalytically model the system with a steady state disc warped by lense-thirringprecession and find the timescale for the alignment of the black hole with thebinary orbit. we make detailed stellar evolution models so as to estimate theaccretion rate and the lifetime of the system in this state. the secondary canbe evolving at the end of the main sequence or across the hertzsprung gap. themass-transfer rate is typically fifty times higher in the latter case but wefind that, in both cases, the lifetime of the mass transfer state is at most afew times the alignment timescale. the fact that the black hole has not yetaligned with the orbital plane is therefore consistent with either model. weconclude that the system may or may not have been counter-aligned after itssupernova kick but that it is most likely to be close to alignment rather thancounteralignment now.

1411.0840	the frequency and nature of `cloud-cloud collisions' in galaxies	we investigate cloud-cloud collisions, and gmc evolution, in hydrodynamicsimulations of isolated galaxies. the simulations include heating and coolingof the ism, self--gravity and stellar feedback. over timescales $&lt;5$ myr mostclouds undergo no change, and mergers and splits are found to be typically twobody processes, but evolution over longer timescales is more complex andinvolves a greater fraction of intercloud material. we find that mergers, orcollisions, occur every 8-10 myr (1/15th of an orbit) in a simulation withspiral arms, and once every 28 myr (1/5th of an orbit) with no imposed spiralarms. both figures are higher than expected from analytic estimates, as cloudsare not uniformly distributed in the galaxy. thus clouds can be expected toundergo between zero and a few collisions over their lifetime. we presentspecific examples of cloud--cloud interactions in our results, includingsynthetic co maps. we would expect cloud--cloud interactions to be observable,but find they appear to have little or no impact on the ism. due to acombination of the clouds' typical geometries, and moderate velocitydispersions, cloud--cloud interactions often better resemble a smaller cloudnudging a larger cloud. our findings are consistent with the view that spiralarms make little difference to overall star formation rates in galaxies, and wesee no evidence that collisions likely produce massive clusters. however, toconfirm the outcome of such massive cloud collisions we ideally need higherresolution simulations.

0805.0115	binary star origin of high field magnetic white dwarfs	white dwarfs with surface magnetic fields in excess of $1 $mg are found asisolated single stars and relatively more often in magnetic cataclysmicvariables. some 1,253 white dwarfs with a detached low-mass main-sequencecompanion are identified in the sloan digital sky survey but none of these isobserved to show evidence for zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines associatedwith a magnetic field in excess of 1mg. if such high magnetic fields on whitedwarfs result from the isolated evolution of a single star then there should bethe same fraction of high field white dwarfs among this sdss binary sample asamong single stars. thus we deduce that the origin of such high magnetic fieldsmust be intimately tied to the formation of cataclysmic variables. cvs emergefrom common envelope evolution as very close but detached binary stars that arethen brought together by magnetic braking or gravitational radiation. wepropose that the smaller the orbital separation at the end of the commonenvelope phase, the stronger the magnetic field. the magnetic cataclysmicvariables originate from those common envelope systems that almost merge. wepropose further that those common envelope systems that do merge are theprogenitors of the single high field white dwarfs. thus all highly magneticwhite dwarfs, be they single stars or the components of mcvs, have a binaryorigin. this hypothesis also accounts for the relative dearth of single whitedwarfs with fields of 10,000 - 1,000,000g. such intermediate-field white dwarfsare found preferentially in cataclysmic variables. in addition the bias towardshigher masses for highly magnetic white dwarfs is expected if a fraction ofthese form when two degenerate cores merge in a common envelope. similarscenarios may account for very high field neutron stars.

astro-ph;0002131	jet directions in seyfert galaxies	we present the study of the relative angle between the accretion disk (orradio jet) and the galaxy disk for a sample of seyfert galaxies selected from amostly isotropic property, the 60$\mu$m flux. for each galaxy we have a pair ofpoints ($i$,$\delta$), which are the inclination of the galaxy relative to theline of sight and the angle between the jet projected into the plane of the skyand the host galaxy major axis, respectively. this data is combined with astatistical technique to determine the distribution of $\beta$ angles {\it in 3dimensions}, the angle between the jet and the host galaxy plane axis. theanalysis of the data, not differentiating between seyfert 1's and 2's, showedthat the observed distribution of $i$ and $\delta$ values can be wellrepresented by a homogeneous $\beta-$distribution in the range$0^{\circ}\leq\beta\leq90^{\circ}$. however, when we distinguished betweenseyfert 1's and 2's, the models could not represent seyfert 1's adequately. itwas necessary to introduce viewing angle restrictions, that a galaxy can onlybe recognized as a seyfert 1 if the angle between the jet and the line of sight($|\phi|$) is smaller than a given angle $\phi_c$ and that the galaxyinclination $i$ is smaller than an angle $i_c$, in order to have statisticallyacceptable models. this is a direct and independent confirmation of theunderlying concepts of the unified model. we discuss several ways to explainthe misalignment between the accretion disk axis and the host galaxy disk axis.

astro-ph;0005333	observational implications of precessing protostellar discs and jets	we consider the dynamics of a protostellar disc in a binary system where thedisc is misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary, with the aim ofdetermining the observational consequences for such systems. the disc wobbleswith a period approximately equal to half the binary's orbital period andprecesses on a longer timescale. we determine the characteristic timescale forrealignment of the disc with the orbital plane due to dissipation. if thedissipation is determined by a simple isotropic viscosity then we find, in linewith previous studies, that the alignment timescale is of order the viscousevolution timescale. however, for typical protostellar disc parameters, if thedisc tilt exceeds the opening angle of the disc, then tidally induced shearingwithin the disc is transonic. in general, hydrodynamic instabilities associatedwith the internally driven shear result in extra dissipation which is expectedto drastically reduce the alignment timescale. for large disc tilts thealignment timescale is then comparable to the precession timescale, while forsmaller tilt angles $\delta$, the alignment timescale varies as $(\sin\delta)^{-1}$. we discuss the consequences of the wobbling, precession andrapid realignment for observations of protostellar jets and the implicationsfor binary star formation mechanisms.

astro-ph;0101253	episodic accretion in magnetically layered protoplanetary discs	we study protoplanetary disc evolution assuming that angular momentumtransport is driven by gravitational instability at large radii, andmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence in the hot inner regions. at radii of theorder of 1 au such discs develop a magnetically layered structure, withaccretion occurring in an ionized surface layer overlying quiescent gas that istoo cool to sustain mhd turbulence. we show that layered discs are subject to alimit cycle instability, in which accretion onto the protostar occurs in burstswith an accretion rate of 10^{-5} solar masses / yr, separated by quiescentintervals where the accretion rate is 10^{-8} solar masses / yr. such burstscould lead to repeated episodes of strong mass outflow in young stellarobjects. the transition to this episodic mode of accretion occurs at an earlyepoch (t &lt; 1 myr), and the model therefore predicts that many youngpre-main-sequence stars should have low rates of accretion through the innerdisc. at ages of a few myr, the discs are up to an order of magnitude moremassive than the minimum mass solar nebula, with most of the mass locked up inthe quiescent layer of the disc at around 1 au. the predicted rate of low massplanetary migration is reduced at the outer edge of the layered disc, whichcould lead to an enhanced probability of giant planet formation at radii of 1-3au.

astro-ph;0102121	accretion in stellar clusters and the imf	we present a simple physical mechanism that can account for the observedstellar mass spectrum for masses $\ms \simgreat 0.5 \solm$. the model dependssolely on the competitive accretion that occurs in stellar clusters where eachstar's accretion rate depends on the local gas density and the square of theaccretion radius. in a stellar cluster, there are two different regimesdepending on whether the gas or the stars dominate the gravitational potential.when the cluster is dominated by cold gas, the accretion radius is given by atidal-lobe radius. this occurs as the cluster collapses towards a $\rho\proptor^{-2}$ distribution. accretion in this regime results in a mass spectrum withan asymptotic limit of $\gamma=-3/2$ (where salpeter is $\gamma=-2.35$). oncethe stars dominate the potential and are virialised, which occurs first in thecluster core, the accretion radius is the bondi-hoyle radius. the resultantmass spectrum has an asymptotic limit of $\gamma=-2$ with slightly steeperslopes ($\gamma\approx-2.5$) if the stars are already mass-segr egated.simulations of accretion onto clusters containing 1000 stars show that asexpected, the low-mass stars accumulate the majority of their masses during thegas dominated phase whereas the high-mass stars accumulate the majority oftheir massed during the stellar dominated phase. this results in a massspectrum with a relatively shallow $\gamma\approx 3/2$ power-law for low-massstars and a steeper, power-law for high-mass stars $ -2.5\simless\gamma\le -2$.this competitive accretion model also results in a mass segregated cluster.

astro-ph;0103263	testing the unified model with an infrared selected sample of seyfert  galaxies	we present a series of statistical tests done to a sample of 29 seyfert 1 and59 seyfert 2 galaxies selected from mostly isotropic properties, their farinfrared fluxes and warm infrared colors. such selection criteria provide aprofound advantage over the criteria used by most investigators in the past,such as ultraviolet excess. these tests were done using ground based highresolution vla a-configuration 3.6 cm radio and optical b and i imaging data.  from the relative number of seyfert 1's and seyfert 2's we calculate that thetorus half opening angle is 48deg. we show that, as seen in previous papers,there is a lack of edge-on seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting dust and gas alongthe host galaxy disk probably play an important role in hiding some nuclei fromdirect view. we find that there is no statistically significant difference inthe distribution of host galaxy morphological types and radio luminosities ofseyfert 1's and seyfert 2's, suggesting that previous results showing theopposite may have been due to selection effects. the average extension of theradio emission of seyfert 1's is smaller than that of seyfert 2's by a factorof ~2-3, as predicted by the unified model. a search for galaxies around ourseyferts allows us to put a lower and an upper limit on the possible number ofcompanions around these galaxies of 19% and 28%, respectively, with nosignificant difference in the number of companion galaxies between seyfert 1'sand seyfert 2's. we also show that there is no preference for the radio jets tobe aligned closer to the host galaxy disk axis in late type seyferts, unlikeresults claimed by previous papers. these results, taken together, providestrong support for a unified model in which type 2 seyferts contain a torusseen more edge-on than the torus in type 1 seyferts.

astro-ph;0201149	the excitation, propagation and dissipation of waves in accretion discs:  the non-linear axisymmetric case	we analyse the non-linear propagation and dissipation of axisymmetric wavesin accretion discs using the zeus-2d hydrodynamics code. the waves arenumerically resolved in the vertical and radial directions. both verticallyisothermal and thermally stratified accretion discs are considered. the wavesare generated by means of resonant forcing and several forms of forcing areconsidered. compressional motions are taken to be locally adiabatic ($\gamma =5/3$). prior to non-linear dissipation, the numerical results are in excellentagreement with the linear theory of wave channelling in predicting the types ofmodes that are excited, the energy flux by carried by each mode, and thevertical wave energy distribution as a function of radius. in all cases, wavesare excited that propagate on both sides of the resonance (inwards andoutwards). for vertically isothermal discs, non-linear dissipation occursprimarily through shocks that result from the classical steepening of acousticwaves. for discs that are substantially thermally stratified, wave channellingis the primary mechanism for shock generation. wave channelling boosts the machnumber of the wave by vertically confining the wave to a small cool region atthe base of the disc atmosphere. in general, outwardly propagating waves withmach numbers near resonance ${\cal m}_{\rm r} \ga 0.01$ undergo shocks within adistance of order the resonance radius.

astro-ph;0204001	predictions for the frequency and orbital radii of massive extrasolar  planets	we investigate the migration of massive extrasolar planets due togravitational interaction with a viscous protoplanetary disc. we show that amodel in which planets form at 5 au at a constant rate, before migrating, leadsto a predicted distribution of planets that is a steeply rising function of log(a), where a is the orbital radius. between 1 au and 3 au, the expected numberof planets per logarithmic interval in orbital radius roughly doubles. wedemonstrate that, once selection effects are accounted for, this is consistentwith current data, and then extrapolate the observed planet fraction to massesand radii that are inaccessible to current observations. in total, about 15percent of stars targeted by existing radial velocity searches are predicted topossess planets with masses 0.3 m_jupiter &lt; m_p sin (i) &lt; 10 m_jupiter, andradii 0.1 au &lt; a &lt; 5 au. a third of these planets (around 5 percent of thetarget stars) lie at the radii most amenable to detection via microlensing. afurther 5-10 percent of stars could have planets at radii of 5 au &lt; a &lt; 8 authat have migrated outwards. we discuss the probability of forming a system(akin to the solar system) in which significant radial migration of the mostmassive planet does not occur. about 10-15 percent of systems with a survivingmassive planet are estimated to fall into this class. finally, we note that asmaller fraction of low mass planets than high mass planets is expected tosurvive without being consumed by the star. the initial mass function forplanets is thus predicted to rise more steeply towards small masses than theobserved mass function.

astro-ph;0204247	the orientation of jets relative to dust disks in radio galaxies	we use hst broad band images, vla and vlbi continuum data to study the threedimensional orientation of jets relative to nuclear dust disks in 20 radiogalaxies. the comparison between the position angles of the jets with those ofthe dust disks major axes shows a wide distribution, suggesting that they arenot aligned preferentially perpendicular to each other. we use a statisticaltechnique to determine the 3 dimensional distribution of angles between jetsand dust disks rotation axes. this analysis shows that the observations areconsistent with jets homogeneously distributed over a large region, extendingover polar caps of 55 degrees to 77 degrees, but seem to avoid lying close tothe plane of the dust disks. we argue that the lack of close alignment betweenjets and dust disks axes is not likely to be caused by feeding the nucleus withgas from mergers originated from random directions. we suggest that themisalignment can be due by a warping mechanism in the accretion disk, likeself-irradiation instability or the bardeen-petterson effect, or that thegravitational potential in the inner regions of the galaxy is misaligned withrespect to that of the dust disk.

astro-ph;0208288	viscous effects on the interaction between the coplanar decretion disc  and the neutron star in be/x-ray binaries	we study the viscous effects on the interaction between the coplanar be-stardisc and the neutron star in be/x-ray binaries, using a three-dimensional,smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. for simplicity, we assume the be disc tobe isothermal at the temperature of half the stellar effective temperature. inorder to mimic the gas ejection process from the be star, we inject particleswith the keplerian rotation velocity at a radius just outside the star. both bestar and neutron star are treated as point masses. we find that the be-stardisc is effectively truncated if the shakura-sunyaev viscosity parameteralpha_ss &gt;&gt; 1, which confirms the previous semi-analytical result. in thetruncated disc, the material decreted from the be star accumulates, so that thedisc becomes denser more rapidly than if around an isolated be star. theresonant truncation of the be disc results in a significant reduction of theamount of gas captured by the neutron star and a strong dependence of the masscapture rate on the orbital phase. we also find that an eccentric mode isexcited in the be disc through direct driving due to a one-armed bar potentialof the binary. the strength of the mode becomes greater in the case of asmaller viscosity. in a high-resolution simulation with alpha_ss=0.1, theeccentric mode is found to precess in a prograde sense. the mass capture rateby the neutron star modulates as the mode precesses.

astro-ph;0306480	are there brown dwarfs in globular clusters?	we present an analytical method for constraining the substellar initial massfunction in globular clusters, based on the observed frequency of transitevents. globular clusters typically have very high stellar densities whereclose encounters are relatively common, and thus tidal capture can occur toform close binary systems. encounters between main sequence stars andlower-mass objects can result in tidal capture if the mass ratio is &gt; 0.01. ifbrown dwarfs exist in significant numbers, they too will be found in closebinaries, and some fraction of their number should be revealed as they transittheir stellar companions. we calculate the rate of tidal capture of browndwarfs in both segregated and unsegregated clusters, and find that the tidalcapture is more likely to occur over an initial relaxation time beforeequipartition occurs. the lack of any such transits in recent hst monitoring of47 tuc implies an upper limit on the frequency of brown dwarfs (&lt; 15 % relativeto stars) which is significantly below that measured in the galactic field andyoung clusters.

astro-ph;0307255	a hubble space telescope survey of extended [oiii]5007a emission in a  far-infrared selected sample of seyfert galaxies: results	we present the results of a hubble space telescope (hst) survey of extended[oiii] emission in a sample of 60 nearby seyfert galaxies (22 seyfert 1's and38 seyfert 2's), selected by mostly isotropic properties. the comparisonbetween the semi major axis size of their [oiii] emitting regions (r_maj) showsthat seyfert 1's and seyfert 2's have similar distributions, which seems tocontradict unified model predictions. we discuss possible ways to explain thisresult, which could be due either to observational limitations or the modelsused for the comparison with our data. we show that seyfert 1 narrow lineregions (nlr's) are more circular and concentrated than seyfert 2's, which canbe attributed to foreshortening in the former. we find a good correlationbetween the nlr size and luminosity, following the relation r_maj proptol([oiii])^0.33, which is flatter than a previous one found for qso's andseyfert 2's. we discuss possible reasons for the different results, and theirimplications to photoionization models. we confirm previous results which showthat the [oiii] and radio emission are well aligned, and also find nocorrelation between the orientation of the extended [oiii] emission and thehost galaxy major axis. this agrees with results showing that the torus axisand radio jet are not aligned with the host galaxy rotation axis, indicatingthat the orientation of the gas in the torus, and not the spin of the blackhole, determine the orientation of the accretion disk, and consequently theorientation of the radio jet.

astro-ph;0311035	variability in black hole accretion discs	observations of accreting systems often show significant variability (10-20percent of accretion luminosity) on timescales much longer than expected forthe disc regions releasing most of the luminosity. we propose an explicitphysical model for disc variability, consistent with lyubarskii's (1997)general scheme for solving this problem. we suggest that local dynamo processescan affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum lossin the form of an outflow (a wind or jet). we model the dynamo as a small-scalestochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical timescale. weargue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale randomprocesses in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherentlarge-scale magnetic field. this occurs on much longer timescales, and causes abright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherentfashion. most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitudeflickering. we reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a1/f power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignmenttimescale at the inner disc edge. however the relation between the black holemass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than oftenassumed in the literature. the effect of an outer disc edge is to flatten thespectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there. we also find acorrelation between the variability amplitude and luminosity, similar to thatfound in some agn.

astro-ph;0311276	on the origin of ionising photons emitted by t tauri stars	we address the issue of the production of lyman continuum photons by t tauristars, in an attempt to provide constraints on theoretical models of discphotoionisation. by treating the accretion shock as a hotspot on the stellarsurface we show that lyman continuum photons are produced at a rateapproximately three orders of magnitude lower than that produced by acorresponding black body, and that a strong lyman continuum is only emitted forhigh mass accretion rates. when our models are extended to include a column ofmaterial accreting on to the hotspot we find that the accretion column isextremely optically thick to lyman continuum photons. further, we find thatradiative recombination of hydrogen atoms within the column is not an efficientmeans of producing photons with energies greater than 13.6ev, and find that anaccretion column of any conceivable height suppresses the emission of lymancontinuum photons to a level below or comparable to that expected from thestellar photosphere. the photospheric lyman continuum is itself much too weakto affect disc evolution significantly, and we find that the lyman continuumemitted by an accretion shock is similarly unable to influence disc evolutionsignificantly. this result has important consequences for models which usephotoionisation as a mechanism to drive the dispersal of circumstellar discs,essentially proving that an additional source of lyman continuum photons mustexist if disc photoionisation is to be significant.

astro-ph;0406643	the effects of x-ray photoionization and heating on the structure of  circumstellar discs	we present the results of a theoretical study investigating the effects ofphotoionization and heating by x-rays on discs around low-mass stars. inparticular we address the question of whether or not x-rays can drive a discwind. first, we construct a 1-dimensional ``quasi-hydrostatic'' model, whichsolves for the vertical structure introduced by x-ray heating. we consideruniform x-ray illumination of the disc, but the x-ray fluxes required to heatthe disc significantly are much greater than those seen by recent observations.when the model is extended to consider heating from a central x-ray source wefind that the 1-dimensional model is only valid very close to the star. weextend our analysis to consider a simple 2-dimensional model, treating the discas a two-layered structure and solving for its density profileself-consistently. for t tauri stars we are able to set a crude upper limit onthe mass-loss rate that can be driven by x-ray photoevaporation, with a valueof ~10^-13 g/cm^2/s. our model is designed to maximise this value, and mostlikely over-estimates it significantly. however we still find a mass-loss ratewhich is less than that found in studies of ultraviolet photoevaporation. weconclude that in the presence of a significant uv field, x-ray driven discwinds are unlikely to play a significant role in the evolution of discs aroundlow-mass stars.

astro-ph;0408390	accelerated planetesimal growth in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs	in this paper we consider the evolution of small planetesimals in marginallystable, self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. the drag force between the discgas and the embedded planetesimals generally causes the planetesimals to driftinwards through the disc at a rate that depends on the particle size. in amarginally stable, self-gravitating disc, however, the planetesimals aresignificantly influenced by the non-axisymmetric spiral structures resultingfrom the growth of the gravitational instability. for small particles, that arestrongly coupled to the disc gas, and for large particles, that haveessentially decoupled from the disc gas, the effect is not particularlysignificant. intermediate sized particles, which would generally have thelargest radial drift rates, do, however, become significantly concentrated atthe peaks of the spiral arms. these high density regions may persist for, oforder, an orbital period and may attain densities comparable to that of thedisc gas. although at the end of the simulation only ~ 25 % of the planetesimalparticles lie in regions of enhanced density, during the course of thesimulation at least 75 % of the planetesimal particles have at some stage beenin a such a region. we find that the concentration of particles in the spiralarms results in an increased collision rate, an effect that could significantlyaccelerate planetesimal growth. the density enhancements may also be sufficientfor the growth of planetesimals through direct gravitational collapse. theinteraction between small planetesimals and self-gravitating spiral structuresmay therefore play an important role in the formation of large planetesimalsthat will ultimately coagulate to form terrestrial planets or the cores ofgas/ice giant planets.

astro-ph;0501100	constraints on the ionizing flux emitted by t tauri stars	we present the results of an analysis of ultraviolet observations of t tauristars (tts). by analysing emission measures taken from the literature we deriverates of ionizing photons from the chromospheres of 5 classical tts in therange ~10^41-10^44 photons/s, although these values are subject to largeuncertainties. we propose that the heii/civ line ratio can be used as areddening-independent indicator of the hardness of the ultraviolet spectrumemitted by tts. by studying this line ratio in a much larger sample of objectswe find evidence for an ionizing flux which does not decrease, and may evenincrease, as tts evolve. this implies that a significant fraction of theionizing flux from tts is not powered by the accretion of disc material ontothe central object, and we discuss the significance of this result and itsimplications for models of disc evolution. the presence of a significantionizing flux in the later stages of circumstellar disc evolution provides animportant new constraint on disc photoevaporation models.

astro-ph;0509809	spiral shocks, triggering of star formation and the velocity dispersion  in giant molecular clouds	we present numerical simulations of the passage of clumpy gas through agalactic spiral shock and the subsequent formation of giant molecular clouds(gmcs). the spiral shock forms dense clouds while dissipating kinetic energy,producing regions that are locally gravitationally bound and collapse to formstars. the effect of the clumpiness of gas as it passes through the shock is togenerate chaotic internal motions in the gas. the kinematics of these motionsare found to agree with the observed velocity-dispersion/size relation found instar-forming regions. in contrast to the standard picture where continuouslydriven turbulence generates the density inhomogeneities in star-forming clouds,we find here that it is the clumpiness of the interstellar gas that producesthe chaotic motions as it passes through the spiral shock and initiates thestar formation process. the velocity dispersion can be understood as being dueto the random mass loading of clumps as they converge in the spiral shock. inthis model there is no need for any internal or external continuous drivingmechanism for the 'turbulence'. the coupling of the clouds' internal kinematicsto their externally triggered formation removes the need for the clouds to beself-gravitating. indeed, while clearly some parts of the clouds areself-gravitating and able to form stars, most of the molecular material remainsgravitationally unbound. this can provide a simple explanation for the lowefficiency of star formation.

astro-ph;0601663	variability of black hole accretion discs: the cool, thermal disc  component	we extend the model of king et al. (2004) for variability in black holeaccretion discs, by taking proper account of the thermal properties of thedisc. because the degree of variability in the king et al. (2004) model dependssensitively on the ratio of disc thickness to radius, h/r, it is important tofollow the time-dependence of the local disc structure as the variabilityproceeds. in common with previous authors, we develop a one-zone model for thelocal disc structure. we agree that radial heat advection plays an importantrole in determining the inner disc structure, and also find limit-cyclebehaviour. when the stochastic magnetic dynamo model of king et al. (2004) isadded to these models, we find similar variability behaviour to before.  we are now better placed to put physical constraints on model parameters. inparticular, we find that in order to be consistent with the low degree ofvariability seen in the thermal disc component of black hole binaries, we needto limit the energy density of the poloidal field that can be produced by localdynamo cells in the disc to less than a few percent of the energy density ofthe dynamo field within the disc itself.

astro-ph;0602103	the formation of molecular clouds in spiral galaxies	we present smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations of molecularcloud formation in spiral galaxies. these simulations model the response of anon-self-gravitating gaseous disk to a galactic potential. the spiral shockinduces high densities in the gas, and considerable structure in the spiralarms, which we identify as molecular clouds. we regard the formation of thesestructures as due to the dynamics of clumpy shocks, which perturb the flow ofgas through the spiral arms. in addition, the spiral shocks induce a largevelocity dispersion in the spiral arms, comparable with the magnitude of thevelocity dispersion observed in molecular clouds. we estimate the formation ofmolecular hydrogen, by post-processing our results and assuming the gas isisothermal. provided the gas is cold ($t\le100$ k), the gas is compressedsufficiently in the spiral shock for molecular hydrogen formation to occur inthe dense spiral arm clumps. these molecular clouds are largely confined to thespiral arms, since most molecular gas is photodissociated to atomic hydrogenupon leaving the arms.

astro-ph;0602306	the evolution of misaligned accretion discs and spinning black holes	in this paper we consider the process of alignment of a spinning black holeand a surrounding misaligned accretion disc. we use a simplified set ofequations, that describe the evolution of the system in the case where thepropagation of warping disturbances in the accretion disc occurs diffusively, asituation likely to be common in the thin discs in active galactic nuclei(agn). we also allow the direction of the hole spin to move under the action ofthe disc torques. in such a way, the evolution of the hole-disc system iscomputed self-consistently. we consider a number of different situations and weexplore the relevant parameter range, by varying the location of the warpradius $r_{\rm w}$ and the propagation speed of the warp. we find that thedissipation associated with the twisting of the disc results in a largeincrease in the accretion rate through the disc, so that agn accreting from amisaligned disc are likely to be significantly more luminous than thoseaccreting from a flat disc. we compute explicitly the time-scales for thewarping of the disc and for the alignment process and compare our results withearlier estimates based on simplified steady-state solutions. we also confirmearlier predictions that, under appropriate circumstances, accretion canproceed in a counter-aligned fashion, so that the accreted material willspin-down the hole, rather than spinning it up. our results have implication ina number of different observational features of agn such as the orientation andshape of jets, the shape of x-ray iron lines, and the possibility ofobscuration and absorption of x-ray by the outer disc as well as the generalissue of the spin history of black holes during their growth.

astro-ph;0603254	photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs ii: evolutionary models and  observable properties	we present a new model for protoplanetary disc evolution. this model combinesviscous evolution with photoevaporation of the disc, in a manner similar toclarke, gendrin &amp; sotomayor (2001). however in a companion paper (alexander,clarke &amp; pringle 2006a) we have shown that at late times such models mustconsider the effect of stellar radiation directly incident on the inner discedge, and here we model the observational implications of this process. we findthat the entire disc is dispersed on a time-scale of order $10^5$yr after adisc lifetime of a few myr, consistent with observations of t tauri (tt) stars.we use a simple prescription to model the spectral energy distribution of theevolving disc, and demonstrate that the model is consistent with observationaldata across a wide range of wavelengths. we note also that the model predicts ashort ``inner hole'' phase in the evolution of all tt discs, and makepredictions for future observations at mid-infrared and millimetre wavelengths.

astro-ph;0604497	the nature of ss433 and the ultraluminous x-ray sources	the periodic precession (162--day) and nodding (6.3--day) motions of the jetsin ss433 are driven in the outer regions of the disc, whereas the jetsthemselves, being relativistic, are launched near the black hole at the disccentre. given that the nutation period is comparable to the dynamical timescalein the outer regions of the disc, it seems unlikely that these periods can becommunicated efficiently to the disc centre. here we propose that the massiveoutflow observed in ss433 is launched at large radii in the disc, about 1/10 ofthe outer disc edge, and that it is this outflow which responds to theoscillations of the outer disc and determines the direction of the jets. themassive outflow is launched at large radius because the mass transfer rate ishyper-eddington. this implies not only that the total luminosity of ss433exceeds $\le$ by a considerable factor, but also that the radiative output iscollimated along the outflow. we thus suggest that ss433 is an ultraluminousx-ray source (ulx) viewed `from the side'. we also suggest that the obscured{\it integral} sources may be ss433--like objects, but with slightly lower masstransfer rates.

astro-ph;0612300	accretion discs with strong toroidal magnetic fields	simulations and analytic arguments suggest that the turbulence driven bymagnetorotational instability (mri) in accretion discs can amplify the toroidal(azimuthal) component of the magnetic field to a point at which magneticpressure exceeds the combined gas + radiation pressure in the disc. arguingfrom the recent analysis by pessah and psaltis, and other mri results in theliterature, we conjecture that the limiting field strength for a thin disc issuch that the alfven speed roughly equals the geometric mean of the keplerianspeed and the gas sound speed. we examine the properties of suchmagnetically-dominated discs, and show that they resolve a number ofoutstanding problems in accretion disc theory. the discs would be thicker thanstandard (shakura-sunyaev) discs at the same radius and accretion rate, andwould tend to have higher colour temperatures. if they transport angularmomentum according to an alpha-prescription, they would be stable against thethermal and viscous instabilities that are found in standard disc models. indiscs fuelling active galactic nuclei, magnetic pressure support could alsoalleviate the restriction on accretion rate imposed by disc self-gravity.

astro-ph;9709146	an investigation into the geometry of seyfert galaxies	we present a new method for the statistical investigation into thedistributions of the angle beta between the radio axis and the normal to thegalactic disk for a sample of seyfert galaxies. we discuss how furtherobservations of the sample galaxies can strengthen the conclusions. our dataare consistent with the hypothesis that agn jets are oriented randomly inspace, independent of the position of the plane of the galaxy. by making thesimple assumption that the standard model of agn holds, with a universalopening angle of the thick torus of phi_c, we demonstrate a statistical methodto obtain an estimate of phi_c. our data are not consistent with thesimple-minded idea that seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are differentiated solely bywhether or not our line of sight lies within some fixed angle of the jet axis.our result is significant on the 2 sigma level and can thus be considered onlysuggestive, not conclusive. a complete sample of seyfert galaxies selected onan isotropic property is required to obtain a conclusive result.

astro-ph;9802162	warped disks as a possible origin of torque reversals in  accretion-powered pulsars	enigmatic transitions between spin-up and spin-down have been observed inseveral x-ray pulsars accreting matter via an accretion disk. in thesetransitions, the torque changes sign but remains at nearly the same magnitude.it has been noted previously that alternating prograde and retrograde diskflows would explain many features of the torque reversals, although it has beenunclear how a stable retrograde disk could be formed. we suggest that thereversals may be related to the disk at times being warped to such an extentthat the inner region becomes tilted by more than 90 degrees. this region wouldthus become retrograde, leading to a negative torque. accretion disk models canshow such behavior, if account is taken of a warping instability due toirradiation. the resulting `flip-overs' of the inner parts of the disk canreproduce most characteristics of the observations, although it remains unclearwhat sets the timescale on which the phenomenon occurs. if this model werecorrect, it would have a number of ramifications, for instance that in thespin-down state the x-ray source would mostly be observed through the accretiondisk.

astro-ph;9808187	the alignment of disk and black hole spins in active galactic nuclei	the inner parts of an accretion disk around a spinning black hole are forcedto align with the spin of the hole by the bardeen-petterson effect. assumingthat any jet produced by such a system is aligned with the angular momentum ofeither the hole or the inner disk, this can, in principle provide a mechanismfor producing steady jets in agn whose direction is independent of the angularmomentum of the accreted material. however, the torque which aligns the innerdisk with the hole, also, by newton's third law, tends to align the spin of thehole with the outer accretion disk. in this letter, we calculate this alignmenttimescale for a black hole powering an agn, and show that it is relativelyshort. this timescale is typically much less than the derived ages for jets inradio loud agn, and implies that the jet directions are not in generalcontrolled by the spin of the black hole. we speculate that the jet directionsare most likely controlled either by the angular momentum of the accretedmaterial or by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy.

0810.1288	stellar disruption by a supermassive black hole: is the light curve  really proportional to $t^{-5/3}$?	in this paper we revisit the arguments for the basis of the time evolution ofthe flares expected to arise when a star is disrupted by a supermassive blackhole. we present a simple analytic model relating the lightcurve to theinternal density structure of the star. we thus show that the standardlightcurve proportional to $t^{-5/3}$ only holds at late times. close to thepeak luminosity the lightcurve is shallower, deviating more strongly from$t^{-5/3}$ for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar--type) stars. we testour model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellarmodels, described by simple polytropic spheres with index $\gamma$. thesimulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. first,the stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effectivereduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. this is welldescribed by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as thepolytropic index becomes larger. second, for large polytropic indices wingsappear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some materialis pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. inall our simulations, the $t^{-5/3}$ lightcurve is achieved only at late stages.in particular we predict that for solar type stars, this happens only after theluminosity has dropped by at least two magnitudes from the peak. we discuss ourresults in the light of recent observations of flares in otherwise quiescentgalaxies and note the dependence of these results on further parameters, suchas the star/hole mass ratio and the stellar orbit.
