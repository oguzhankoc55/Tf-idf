0901.1109	the cosmic evolution of agn in galaxy clusters	we present the surface density of luminous active galactic nuclei (agn)associated with a uniformly selected galaxy cluster sample identified in the8.5 square degree bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. the clustersare distributed over a large range of redshift (0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5) and we identifyagn using three different selection criteria: mid-ir color, radio luminosity,and x-ray luminosity. relative to the field, we note a clear overdensity of thenumber of agn within 0.5 mpc of the cluster centers at z &gt; 0.5. the amplitudeof this agn overdensity increases with redshift. although there are significantdifferences between the agn populations probed by each selection technique, therise in cluster agn surface density generally increases more steeply than thatof field quasars. in particular, x-ray selected agn are at least three timesmore prevalent in clusters at 1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 compared to clusters at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.this effect is stronger than can be explained by the evolving median richnessof our cluster sample. we thus confirm the existence of a butcher-oemler typeeffect for agn in galaxy clusters, with the number of agn in clustersincreasing with redshift.

0901.4121	host galaxies, clustering, eddington ratios, and evolution of radio,  x-ray, and infrared-selected agns	we explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei(agns) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxyproperties, clustering, and eddington ratios of agns selected in the radio,x-ray, and infrared. we study a sample of 585 agns at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 usingredshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages) and data in the radio(wsrt 1.4 ghz), x-rays (chandra xbootes), and mid-ir (irac shallow survey). theradio, x-ray, and ir agn samples show modest overlap, indicating that to theflux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of agns. wederive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as eddington ratios(lambda), for obscured or optically faint agns. we also measure the two-pointcross-correlation between agns and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h^-1 mpc, andderive typical dark matter halo masses. we find that: (1) radio agns are mainlyfound in luminous red galaxies, are strongly clustered (with m_halo ~ 3x10^13h^-1 m_sun), and have very low lambda &lt;~ 10^-3; (2) x-ray-selected agns arepreferentially found in galaxies in the "green valley" of color-magnitude spaceand are clustered similarly to typical ages galaxies (m_halo ~ 10^13 h^-1m_sun), with 10^-3 &lt;~ lambda &lt;~ 1; (3) ir agns reside in slightly bluer, lessluminous galaxies than x-ray agns, are weakly clustered (m_halo &lt;~ 10^12 h^-1m_sun), and have lambda &gt; 10^-2. we interpret these results in terms of asimple model of agn and galaxy evolution, whereby a "quasar" phase and thegrowth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches acritical mass between ~10^12 and 10^13 m_sun. subsequently, star formationceases and agn accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and ir-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically-faint, radio-bright) modes.

0903.2219	the star formation and nuclear accretion histories of normal galaxies in  the ages survey	we combine ir, optical and x-ray data from the overlapping, 9.3 square degreenoao deep wide-field survey (ndwfs), agn and galaxy evolution survey (ages),and xbootes survey to measure the x-ray evolution of 6146 normal galaxies as afunction of absolute optical luminosity, redshift, and spectral type over thelargely unexplored redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.5. because only the closest orbrightest of the galaxies are individually detected in x-rays, we use astacking analysis to determine the mean properties of the sample. our resultssuggest that x-ray emission from spectroscopically late-type galaxies isdominated by star formation, while that from early-type galaxies is dominatedby a combination of hot gas and agn emission. we find that the mean starformation and supermassive black hole accretion rate densities evolve like(1+z)^3, in agreement with the trends found for samples of bright, individuallydetectable starburst galaxies and agn. our work also corroborates the resultsof many previous stacking analyses of faint source populations, with improvedstatistics.

0905.4274	strong pah emission from z~2 ulirgs	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, wepresent low-resolution (64 &lt; lambda / dlambda &lt; 124), mid-infrared (20-38micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ulirgs detected in the bootes field of thenoao deep wide-field survey. all of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24micron) &gt; 0.5 mjy; 2) r-[24] &gt; 14 vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into spitzer's 3-8 micron iracbands. of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs),usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. the pah features indicateredshifts in the range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, with a mean of &lt;z&gt;=1.96 and a dispersionof 0.30. based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infraredluminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. our results confirmprevious indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can beefficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, andthat the fraction of starburst-dominated ulirgs increases to faint 24 micronflux densities. using local templates, we find that the observed narrowredshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability ofpah-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. we can analogously explain thebroader redshift distribution of spitzer-detected agn-dominated ulirgs based onthe shapes of their seds. finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with adetectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient agn emission toveil the 7.7 micron pah band.

0707.0393	supernovae in the subaru deep field: an initial sample, and type ia  rate, out to redshift 1.6	large samples of high-redshift supernovae (sne) are potentially powerfulprobes of cosmic star formation, metal enrichment, and sn physics. we presentinitial results from a new deep sn survey, based on re-imaging in the r, i', z'bands, of the 0.25 deg2 subaru deep field (sdf), with the 8.2-m subarutelescope and suprime-cam. in a single new epoch consisting of two nights ofobservations, we have discovered 33 candidate sne, down to a z'-band magnitudeof 26.3 (ab). we have measured the photometric redshifts of the sn hostgalaxies, obtained keck spectroscopic redshifts for 17 of the host galaxies,and classified the sne using the bayesian photometric algorithm of poznanski etal. (2007) that relies on template matching. after correcting for biases in theclassification, 55% of our sample consists of type ia supernovae and 45% ofcore-collapse sne. the redshift distribution of the sne ia reaches z ~ 1.6,with a median of z ~ 1.2. the core-collapse sne reach z ~ 1.0, with a median ofz ~ 0.5. our sn sample is comparable to the hubble space telescope/goods sampleboth in size and redshift range. the redshift distributions of the sne in thesdf and in goods are consistent, but there is a trend (which requiresconfirmation using a larger sample) for more high-z sne ia in the sdf. thistrend is also apparent when comparing the sn ia rates we derive to those basedon goods data. our results suggest a fairly constant rate at high redshift thatcould be tracking the star-formation rate. additional epochs on this field,already being obtained, will enlarge our sn sample to the hundreds, anddetermine whether or not there is a decline in the sn ia rate at z &gt;~ 1.

0907.3185	active galactic nuclei and the truncation of star formation in k+a  galaxies	we have searched for active galactic nuclei (agns) in k+a galaxies, usingmultiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy in the bootes field of the noao deepwide-field survey. the k+a galaxies, which have had their star formationrapidly truncated, are selected via their strong balmer absorption lines andweak h-alpha emission. our sample consists of 24 k+a galaxies selected from6594 0.10&lt;z&lt;0.35 galaxies brighter than i=20 with optical spectroscopy from theagn and galaxy evolution survey. two thirds of the k+a galaxies are likelyongoing galaxy mergers, with nearby companion galaxies or tidal tails. galaxymergers may be responsible for the truncation of star formation, or we areobserving the aftermath of merger triggered starbursts. as expected, theoptical colors of k+a galaxies largely fall between blue galaxies with ongoingstar formation and red passive galaxies. however, only 1% of the galaxies withcolors between the red and blue populations are k+a galaxies, and we concludethat the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies must have been unusuallyabrupt (&lt;100 myr). we examined the agn content of k+a galaxies with bothoptical emission-line ratios (bpt diagrams) and chandra x-ray imaging. at leasthalf of all k+a galaxies display the optical emission-line ratios of agns, anda third of m_r&lt;-22 k+a galaxies host agns with x-ray luminosities of 10^{42}erg/s. the faintest k+a galaxies do not show clear evidence for hosting agns,having emission-line ratios consistent with photoionization by massive starsand few x-ray detections. we speculate that two mechanisms may be responsiblefor the truncation of star formation in k+a galaxies, with agn feedback onlyplaying a role in m_r&lt;-20.5 galaxies.

0911.0368	galaxies at redshift ~0.5 around three closely spaced quasar sightlines	we examine the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium atz &lt; 1 using a group of three closely spaced background qsos with z_em ~1observed with the hubble space telescope. using a new grouping algorithm, weidentify groups of galaxies and absorbers across the three qso sightlines thatmay be physically linked. there is an excess number of such groups compared tothe number we expect from a random distribution of absorbers at a confidencelevel of 99.9%. the same search is performed with mock spectra generated usinga hydrodynamic simulation, and we find the vast majority of such groups arisein dense regions of the simulation. we find that at z&lt;0.5, groups in thesimulation generally trace the large-scale filamentary structure as seen in theprojected 2-d distribution of the hi column density in a ~30 h^-1 mpc region.we discover a probable sub-damped lyman-alpha system at z=0.557 showing strong,low-ionisation metal absorption lines. previous analyses of absorption acrossthe three sightlines attributed these metal lines to hi. we show that even whenthe new line identifications are taken into account, evidence remains forplanar structures with scales of ~1 mpc absorbing across the three sightlines.we identify a galaxy at z=0.2272 with associated metal absorption in twosightlines, each 200 kpc away. by constraining the star formation history ofthe galaxy, we show the gas causing this metal absorption may have beenenriched and ejected by the galaxy during a burst of star formation 2 gyr ago.

0912.2799	the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~4	we have conducted a spectroscopic survey to find faint quasars (-26.0 &lt;m_{1450} &lt; -22.0) at redshifts z=3.8-5.2 in order to measure the faint end ofthe quasar luminosity function at these early times. using available opticalimaging data from portions of the noao deep wide-field survey and the deep lenssurvey, we have color-selected quasar candidates in a total area of 3.76 deg^2.thirty candidates have r &lt;= 23 mags. we conducted spectroscopic followup for 28of our candidates and found 23 qsos, 21 of which are reported here for thefirst time, in the 3.74 &lt; z &lt;5.06 redshift range. we estimate our surveycompleteness through detailed monte carlo simulations and derive the firstmeasurement of the density of quasars in this magnitude and redshift interval.we find that the binned luminosity function is somewhat affected by thek-correction used to compute the rest-frame absolute magnitude at 1450a.considering only our r &lt;= 23 sample, the best-fit single power-law (phi \proptol^beta) gives a faint-end slope beta = -1.6+/-0.2. if we consider our larger,but highly incomplete sample going one magnitude fainter, we measure a steeperfaint-end slope -2 &lt; beta &lt; -2.5. in all cases, we consistently find faint-endslopes that are steeper than expected based on measurements at z ~ 3. wecombine our sample with bright quasars from the sloan digital sky survey toderive parameters for a double-power-law luminosity function. our best fitfinds a bright-end slope, alpha = -2.4+/-0.2, and faint-end slope, beta =-2.3+/-0.2, without a well-constrained break luminosity. this is effectively asingle power-law, with beta = -2.7+/-0.1. we use these results to place limitson the amount of ultraviolet radiation produced by quasars and find thatquasars are able to ionize the intergalactic medium at these redshifts.

0707.4182	a luminosity function of lyman alpha emitting galaxies at redshift 4.5	we present a catalog of 59 z=4.5 lyman alpha emitting galaxiesspectroscopically confirmed in a campaign of keck/deimos follow-up observationsto candidates selected in the large area lyman alpha (lala) narrow-band imagingsurvey. we targeted 97 candidates for spectroscopic follow-up; by accountingfor the variety of conditions under which we performed spectroscopy, weestimate a selection reliability of about 76%. together with our previoussample of keck/lris confirmations, the 59 sources confirmed herein bring thetotal catalog to 73 spectroscopically confirmed z=4.5 lyman alpha emittinggalaxies in the 0.7 square degrees covered by the lala imaging. as with thekeck/lris sample, we find that a non-negligible fraction of the confirmed lymanalpha lines have rest-frame equivalent widths (w_{rest}) which exceed themaximum predicted for normal stellar populations: 17% -- 31% (93% confidence)of the detected galaxies show w_{rest} &gt; 190 aa, and 12% -- 27% (90%confidence) show w_{rest} &gt; 240 aa. we construct a luminosity function of z=4.5lyman alpha emission lines for comparison to lyman alpha luminosity functionsspanning 3.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.6. we find no significant evidence for lyman alphaluminosity function evolution from z ~ 3 to z ~ 6. this result supports theconclusion that the intergalactic medium remains largely reionized from thelocal universe out to z=6.5. it is somewhat at odds with the pronounced drop inthe cosmic star formation rate density recently measured between z~3 and z~6 incontinuum-selected lyman-break galaxies, and therefore potentially sheds lighton the relationship between the two populations.

1009.3022	the average physical properties and star formation histories of the  uv-brightest star-forming galaxies at z~3.7	[abridged] we investigate the average physical properties and star formationhistories of the most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies at z~3.7. our resultsare derived from analyses of the average spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed from stacked optical to infrared photometry, of a sample of the1,902 most uv-luminous star-forming galaxies found in 5.3 square degrees of thenoao deep wide-field survey. we bin the sample according to uv luminosity, andfind that the shape of the average sed in the rest-frame optical and infraredis fairly constant with uv luminosity: i.e., more uv luminous galaxies are, onaverage, also more luminous at longer wavelengths. in the rest-uv, however, thespectral slope (measured at 0.13-0.28 um) rises steeply with the median uvluminosity from -1.8 at l l* to -1.2 in the brightest bin (l~4-5l*). we usepopulation synthesis analyses to derive the average physical properties ofthese galaxies and find that: (1) l_uv, and thus star formation rates (sfrs),scale closely with stellar mass such that more uv-luminous galaxies are alsomore massive; (2) the median ages indicate that the stellar populations arerelatively young (200-400 myr) and show little correlation with uv luminosity;and (3) more uv-luminous galaxies are dustier than their less-luminouscounterparts, such that l~4-5l* galaxies are extincted up to a(1600)=2 magwhile l l* galaxies have a(1600)=0.7-1.5 mag. based on these observations, weargue that the average star formation histories of uv-luminous galaxies arebetter described by models in which sfr increases with time in order tosimultaneously reproduce the tight correlation between the observed sfr andstellar mass, and the universally young ages of these galaxies. we demonstratethe potential of measurements of the sfr-m* relation at multiple redshifts todiscriminate between simple models of star formation histories.

1101.0537	the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~4: implications for  ionization of the intergalactic medium and cosmic downsizing	we present an updated determination of the z ~ 4 qso luminosity function(qlf), improving the quality of the determination of the faint end of the qlfpresented in glikman et al. (2010). we have observed an additional 43candidates from our survey sample, yielding one additional qso at z = 4.23 andincreasing the completeness of our spectroscopic follow-up to 48% forcandidates brighter than r = 24 over our survey area of 3.76 deg2. we study theeffect of using k-corrections to compute the rest-frame absolute magnitude at1450a compared with measuring m1450 directly from the object spectra. we find aluminosity-dependent bias: template-based k-corrections overestimate theluminosity of low-luminosity qsos, likely due to their reliance on templatesderived from higher luminosity qsos. combining our sample with bright quasarsfrom the sloan digital sky survey and using spectrum-based m1450 for all thequasars, we fit a double-power-law to the binned qlf. our best fit has abright-end slope, {\alpha} = 3.3\pm0.2, and faint-end slope, {\beta} =1.6(+0.8/-0.6). our new data revise the faint-end slope of the qlf down toflatter values similar to those measured at z ~ 3. the break luminosity, thoughpoorly constrained, is at m* = -24.1(+0.7/-1.9), approximately 1 - 1.5 magfainter than at z ~ 3. this qlf implies that qsos account for about half theradiation needed to ionize the igm at these redshifts.

1102.4850	clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the bootes field:  placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web	we present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infraredselected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 bootes multiwavelength survey. recentlythe spitzer space telescope and x-ray observations have revealed largepopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of thex-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. to date, little isknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the massesof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolutionof black holes and galaxies. in this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infraredselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxycross-correlation function w_p(r). the observed clustering yieldscharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) =12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (qso-1s) and obscuredquasars (obs-qsos), respectively. the results for qso-1s are in excellentagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while weconclude that the obs-qsos are at least as strongly clustered as the qso-1s. wetest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faintobs-qsos, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on theclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clusteringamplitude of the obs-qsos by at most ~20%. we compare our results to previousstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering forobscured quasars.

1105.0549	on the location of the gamma-ray emission in the 2008 outburst in the bl  lacertae object ao 0235+164 through observations across the electromagnetic  spectrum	we present observations of a major outburst at centimeter, millimeter,optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths of the bl lacertae object ao0235+164. we analyze the timing of multi-waveband variations in the flux andlinear polarization, as well as changes in very long baseline array (vlba)images at 7mm with 0.15 milliarcsecond resolution. the association of theevents at different wavebands is confirmed at high statistical significance byprobability arguments and monte-carlo simulations. a series of sharp peaks inoptical linear polarization, as well as a pronounced maximum in the 7 mmpolarization of a superluminal jet knot, indicate rapid fluctuations in thedegree of ordering of the magnetic field. these results lead us to concludethat the outburst occurred in the jet both in the quasi-stationary "core" andin the superluminal knot, both parsecs downstream of the supermassive blackhole. we interpret the outburst as a consequence of the propagation of adisturbance, elongated along the line of sight by light-travel time delays,that passes through a standing recollimation shock in the core and propagatesdown the jet to create the superluminal knot. the multi-wavelength light curvesvary together on long time-scales (months/years), but the correspondence ispoorer on shorter time-scales. this, as well as the variability of thepolarization and the dual location of the outburst, agrees with theexpectations of a multi-zone emission model in which turbulence plays a majorrole in modulating the synchrotron and inverse compton fluxes.

1106.6055	searching for z~7.7 lyman alpha emitters in the cosmos field with  newfirm	the study of ly-alpha emission in the high-redshift universe is a usefulprobe of the epoch of reionization, as the ly-alpha line should be attenuatedby the intergalactic medium (igm) at low to moderate neutral hydrogenfractions. here we present the results of a deep and wide imaging search forly-alpha emitters in the cosmos field. we have used two ultra-narrowbandfilters (filter width of ~8-9 {\deg}a) on the newfirm camera, installed on themayall 4m telescope at kitt peak national observatory, in order to isolately-alpha emitters at z = 7.7; such ultra-narrowband imaging searches haveproved to be excellent at detecting ly-alpha emitters. we found 5-sigmadetections of four candidate ly-alpha emitters in a survey volume of 2.8 x 10^4mpc^3 (total survey area ~760 arcmin^2). each candidate has a line flux greaterthan 8 x 10^-18 erg s^-1 cm^-2. using these results to construct a luminosityfunction and comparing to previously established ly-alpha luminosity functionsat z = 5.7 and z = 6.5, we find no conclusive evidence for evolution of theluminosity function between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7. statistical monte carlosimulations suggest that half of these candidates are real z = 7.7 targets, andspectroscopic follow-up will be required to verify the redshift of thesecandidates. however, our results are consistent with no strong evolution in theneutral hydrogen fraction of the igm between z = 5.7 and z = 7.7, even if onlyone or two of the z = 7.7 candidates are spectroscopically confirmed.

1111.0630	resolving the galaxies within a giant lya nebula: witnessing the  formation of a galaxy group?	detailed analysis of the substructure of lya nebulae can put importantconstraints on the physical mechanisms at work and the properties of galaxiesforming within them. using high resolution hst imaging of a lya nebula atz~2.656, we have taken a census of the compact galaxies in the vicinity, usedoptical/near-infrared colors to select system members, and put constraints onthe morphology of the spatially-extended emission. the system is characterizedby (a) a population of compact, low luminosity (~0.1 l*) sources --- 17primarily young, small (re~1-2 kpc), disky galaxies including an obscured agn--- that are all substantially offset (&gt;20 kpc) from the line-emitting nebula;(b) the lack of a central galaxy at or near the peak of the lya emission; and(c) several nearly coincident, spatially extended emission components --- lya,heii, and uv continuum --- that are extremely smooth. these morphologicalfindings are difficult to reconcile with theoretical models that invokeoutflows, cold flows, or resonant scattering, suggesting that while all ofthese physical phenomena may be occurring, they are not sufficient to explainthe powering and large extent of lya nebulae. in addition, although the compactgalaxies within the system are irrelevant as power sources, the region issignificantly overdense relative to the field galaxy population (by at least afactor of 4). these observations provide the first estimate of the luminosityfunction of galaxies within an individual lya nebula system, and suggest thatlarge lya nebulae may be the seeds of galaxy groups or low-mass clusters.

1111.2603	a successful broad-band survey for giant lya nebulae i: survey design  and candidate selection	giant lya nebulae (or lya "blobs") are likely sites of ongoing massive galaxyformation, but the rarity of these powerful sources has made it difficult toform a coherent picture of their properties, ionization mechanisms, and spacedensity. systematic narrow-band lya nebula surveys are ongoing, but the smallredshift range covered and the observational expense limit the comoving volumethat can be probed by even the largest of these surveys and pose a significantproblem when searching for such rare sources. we have developed a systematicsearch technique designed to find large lya nebulae at 2&lt;z&lt;3 within deepbroad-band imaging and have carried out a survey of the 9.4 square degree noaodeep wide-field survey (ndwfs) bootes field. with a total survey comovingvolume of ~10^8 h^-3_70 mpc^3, this is the largest volume survey for lyanebulae ever undertaken. in this first paper in the series, we present thedetails of the survey design and a systematically-selected sample of 79candidates, which includes one previously discovered lya nebula.

1209.2414	herschel detection of dust emission from uv-luminous star-forming  galaxies at 3.3&lt;z&lt;4.3	we report the herschel spire detection of dust emission arising fromuv-luminous (l&gt;~l*) star-forming galaxies at 3.3&lt;z&lt;4.3. our sample of 1,913lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidates is selected over an area of 5.3 deg2 in thebootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. this is one of the largestsamples of uv-luminous galaxies at this epoch and enables an investigation ofthe bright end of the galaxy luminosity function. we divide our sample intothree luminosity bins and stack the herschel spire data to measure the averagespectral energy distribution (sed) of lbgs at far-infrared (fir) wavelengths.we find that these galaxies have average ir luminosities of (3-5)x10^{11}l_sunand 60-70% of their star-formation obscured by dust. the fir seds peak atlambda&gt;100um, suggesting dust temperatures (t_d=27-30k) significantly colderthan that of local galaxies of comparable ir luminosities. the observedir-to-uv luminosity ratio (irx=l_ir/l_uv) is low (~3-4) compared with thatobserved for z~2 lbgs (irx(z~2)~7.1+/-1.1). the correlation between the slopeof the uv continuum and irx for galaxies in the two lower luminosity binssuggests dust properties similar to those of local starburst galaxies. however,the galaxies in the highest luminosity bin appear to deviate from the localrelation, suggesting that their dust properties may differ from those of theirlower-luminosity and low-redshift counterparts. we speculate that the most uvluminous galaxies at this epoch are being observed in a short-lived and youngevolutionary phase.

1209.6055	mid-infrared selection of active galactic nuclei with the wide-field  infrared survey explorer. ii. properties of wise-selected active galactic  nuclei in the ndwfs bo\"otes field	stern et al.(2012) presented a study of wise selection of agn in the 2 deg^2cosmos field, finding that a simple criterion w1-w2&gt;=0.8 provides a highlyreliable and complete agn sample for w2&lt;15.05, where the w1 and w2 passbandsare centered at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, respectively. here we extend this studyusing the larger 9 deg^2 noao deep wide-field survey bootes field which alsohas considerably deeper wise observations than the cosmos field, and find thatthis simple color-cut significantly loses reliability at fainter fluxes. wedefine a modified selection criterion combining the w1-w2 color and the w2magnitude to provide highly reliable or highly complete agn samples for fainterwise sources. in particular, we define a color-magnitude cut that finds 130+/-4deg^-2 agn candidates for w2&lt;17.11 with 90% reliability. using the extensive uvthrough mid-ir broad-band photometry available in this field, we study thespectral energy distributions of wise agn candidates. as expected, the wise agnselection is biased towards objects where the agn dominates the bolometricluminosity output, and that it can identify highly obscured agn. we study thedistribution of reddening in the agn sample and discuss a formalism to accountfor sample incompleteness based on the step-wise maximum-likelihood method ofefstathiou et al.(1988). the resulting dust obscuration distributions dependstrongly on agn luminosity, consistent with the trend expected for a simpson(2005) receding torus. at l_agn~3x10^44 erg/s, 29+/-7% of agn are observed astype 1, while at ~4x10^45 erg/s the fraction is 64+/-13%. the distribution ofobscuration values suggests that dust in the torus is present as both a diffusemedium and in optically thick clouds.

1210.0905	a high molecular fraction in a sub-damped absorber at z=0.56	measuring rest-frame ultraviolet rotational transitions from the lyman andwerner bands in absorption against a bright background continuum is one of thefew ways to directly measure molecular hydrogen (h2). here we report thedetection of lyman-werner absorption from h2 at z=0.56 in a sub-damped ly-alphasystem with neutral hydrogen column density n(hi) = 10^(19.5 +/- 0.2) cm^-2.this is the first h2 system analysed at a redshift &lt; 1.5 beyond the milky wayhalo. it has a surprisingly high molecular fraction: log f(h2) &gt; -1.93 +/- 0.36based on modelling the line profiles, with a robust model-independent lowerlimit of f(h2) &gt; 10^-3. this is higher than f(h2) values seen along sightlineswith similar n(hi) through the milky way disk and the magellanic clouds. themetallicity of the absorber is 0.19 +0.21 -0.10 solar, with a dust-to-gas ratio&lt; 0.36 times the value in the solar neighbourhood. absorption from associatedlow-ionisation metal transitions such as oi and feii is observed in addition toovi. using cloudy models we show that there are three phases present; a ~100 kphase giving rise to h2, a ~10^4 k phase where most of the low-ionisation metalabsorption is produced; and a hotter phase associated with ovi. based onsimilarities to high velocity clouds in the milky way halo showing h2 and thepresence of two nearby galaxy candidates with impact parameters of ~10 kpc, wesuggest that the absorber may be produced by a tidally-stripped structuresimilar to the magellanic stream.

1211.6798	the clustering of extremely red objects	we measure the clustering of extremely red objects (eros) in ~8 deg^2 of thenoao deep wide field survey bo\"otes field in order to establish robust linksbetween ero z~1.2 and local galaxy z&lt;0.1 populations. three different colorselection criteria from the literature are analyzed to assess the consequencesof using different criteria for selecting eros. specifically, our samples are(r-k_s)&gt;5.0 (28,724 galaxies), (i-k_s)&gt;4.0 (22,451 galaxies) and (i-[3.6])&gt;5.0(64,370 galaxies). magnitude-limited samples show the correlation length (r_0)to increase for more luminous eros, implying a correlation with stellar mass.we can separate star-forming and passive ero populations using the (k_s-[24])and ([3.6]-[24]) colors to k_s=18.4 and [3.6]=17.5, respectively. star-formingand passive eros in magnitude limited samples have different clusteringproperties and host dark halo masses, and cannot be simply understood as asingle population. based on the clustering, we find that bright passive erosare the likely progenitors of &gt;4l^* elliptical galaxies. bright eros withongoing star formation were found to occupy denser environments thanstar-forming galaxies in the local universe, making these the likelyprogenitors of &gt;l^* local ellipticals. this suggests that the progenitors ofmassive &gt;4l^* local ellipticals had stopped forming stars by z&gt;1.2, but thatthe progenitors of less massive ellipticals (down to l^*) can still showsignificant star formation at this epoch.

1212.4835	probing high-redshift galaxy formation at the highest luminosities: new  insights from deimos spectroscopy	we present deimos spectroscopic observations of the most uv-luminousstar-forming galaxies at 3.2&lt;z&lt;4.6. our sample contains galaxies withluminosities of l*&lt;l&lt;7l* and is one of the largest samples to date of the mostuv-luminous galaxies at these redshifts. our data confirm 41 star-forminggalaxies at 3.2&lt;z&lt;4.6 and validate the clean selection of the photometriccandidates. we find that the fraction of lya emitting galaxies increases withdecreasing uv luminosity. we find strong evidence of large-scale outflows,transporting the neutral/ionized gas in the interstellar medium away from thegalaxy. galaxies exhibiting both interstellar absorption and lya emission linesshow a significant velocity offset between the two features (200-1140 km/s). wefind tentative evidence that this measure of the outflow velocity increaseswith uv luminosity and/or stellar mass. the luminosity- and mass-dependentoutflow strengths suggest that the efficiency of feedback and enrichment of thesurrounding medium depend on these parameters. we present composite spectra ofthe absorption-line-only and lya-emitting subsets of the uv luminous galaxiesat z~3.7. the composite spectra are similar to those of lower-z andlower-luminosity lbgs samples, but with some subtle differences. analyses ofthe composite spectra suggest that the uv luminous lbgs at z~3.7 may have ahigher covering fraction of absorbing gas, and may be older than their lower-zand lower-luminosity counterparts. in addition, we have discovered 5 galaxiesthat belong to a massive overdensity at z=3.78. finally, two galaxies each showtwo distinct sets of interstellar absorption features. the latter may be a signof a final stage of major merger, or clumpy disk formation. their presenceimplies that frequency of such sources among our luminous z~3.7 lbgs may be anorder of magnitude higher than in lower redshift and lower luminosity samples.

1306.1227	a correlation between star formation rate and average black hole  accretion in star forming galaxies	we present a measurement of the average supermassive black hole accretionrate (bhar) as a function of star formation rate (sfr) for galaxies in theredshift range 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.8. we study a sample of 1,767 far-ir selectedstar-forming galaxies in the 9 deg^2 bo\"otes multiwavelength survey field. thesfr is estimated using 250 micron observations from the herschel spaceobservatory, for which the contribution from the agn is minimal. in thissample, 121 agns are directly identified using x-ray or mid-ir selectioncriteria. we combined these detected agns and an x-ray stacking analysis forundetected sources to study the average bhar for all of the star-forminggalaxies in our sample. we find an almost linear relation between the averagebhar (in m_sun/year) and the sfr (in m_sun/year) for galaxies across a wide sfrrange 0.85&lt;log sfr&lt;2.56 : log bhar=(-3.72\pm0.52)+(1.05\pm0.33) log sfr. thisglobal correlation between sfr and average bhar is consistent with a simplepicture in which sfr and agn activity are tightly linked over galaxy evolutiontimescales.

0801.1860	a significant population of very luminous dust-obscured galaxies at  redshift z ~ 2	observations with spitzer space telescope have recently revealed asignificant population of high-redshift z~2 dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) withlarge mid-ir to uv luminosity ratios. these galaxies have been missed intraditional optical studies of the distant universe. we present a simple methodfor selecting this high-z population based solely on the ratio of the observedmid-ir 24um to optical r-band flux density. in the 8.6 sq.deg bootes ndwfsfield, we uncover ~2,600 dog candidates (= 0.089/sq.arcmin) with 24um fluxdensities f24&gt;0.3mjy and (r-[24])&gt;14 (i.e., f[24]/f[r] &gt; 1000). these galaxieshave no counterparts in the local universe, and become a larger fraction of thepopulation at fainter f24, representing 13% of the sources at 0.3~mjy. dogsexhibit evidence of both star-formation and agn activity, with the brighter24um sources being more agn- dominated. we have measured spectroscopicredshifts for 86 dogs, and find a broad z distribution centered at &lt;z&gt;~2.0.their space density is 2.82e-5 per cubic mpc, similar to that of brightsub-mm-selected galaxies at z~2. these redshifts imply very large luminositieslir&gt;~1e12-14 lsun. dogs contribute ~45-100% of the ir luminosity densitycontributed by all z~2 ulirgs, suggesting that our simple selection criterionidentifies the bulk of z~2 ulirgs. dogs may be the progenitors of ~4l*present-day galaxies seen undergoing a luminous,short- lived phase of bulge andblack hole growth. they may represent a brief evolution phase between smgs andless obscured quasars or galaxies.

0801.4578	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of distant x-ray luminous agn	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 16 optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope. these sources were jointly selected from spitzer andchandra imaging surveys in the ndwfs bootes field and were selected from theirbright x-ray fluxes to host luminous agn. none of the spectra show significantemission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; 6.2um equivalent widths&lt;0.2um), consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by agn. nineof the x-ray sources show 9.7um silicate absorption features. their redshiftsare in the range 0.9&lt;z&lt;2.6, implying infrared luminosities oflog(l{ir})=12.5-13.6 solar luminosities. the average silicate absorptionstrength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies with similar mid-infrared luminosities implying thatthe x-ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of si-rich dust thannon-x-ray selection. seven of the x-ray sources have featureless power-lawmid-ir spectra. we argue that the featureless spectra likely result from thesources having weak or absent silicate and pah features rather than the sourceslying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the irsspectral window. we investigate whether there are any correlations betweenx-ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorptionfeatures tend to have fainter x-ray fluxes and harder x-ray spectra, indicatinga weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density ofx-ray-absorbing gas.

1310.6040	the evolution of dust-obscured star formation activity in galaxy  clusters relative to the field over the last 9 billion years	we compare the star formation (sf) activity in cluster galaxies to the fieldfrom z=0.3-1.5 using $herschel$ spire 250$\mu$m imaging. we utilize 274clusters from the irac shallow cluster survey (iscs) selected as rest-framenear-infrared overdensities over the 9 square degree bootes field . thisanalysis allows us to quantify the evolution of sf in clusters over a longredshift baseline without bias against active cluster systems. using a stackinganalysis, we determine the average star formation rates (sfrs) andspecific-sfrs (ssfr=sfr/m$_{\star}$) of stellar mass-limited (m&gt;1.3x10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$), statistical samples of cluster and field galaxies, probing boththe star forming and quiescent populations. we find a clear indication that theaverage sf in cluster galaxies is evolving more rapidly than in the field, withfield sf levels at z&gt;1.2 in the cluster cores (r&lt;0.5 mpc), in good agreementwith previous iscs studies. by quantifying the sf in cluster and field galaxiesas an exponential function of cosmic time, we determine that cluster galaxiesare evolving ~2 times faster than the field. additionally, we see enhanced sfabove the field level at z~1.4 in the cluster outskirts (r&gt;0.5 mpc). thesegeneral trends in the cluster cores and outskirts are driven by the lower massgalaxies in our sample. blue cluster galaxies have systematically lower ssfrsthan blue field galaxies, but otherwise show no strong differential evolutionwith respect to the field over our redshift range. this suggests that thecluster environment is both suppressing the star formation in blue galaxies onlong time-scales and rapidly transitioning some fraction of blue galaxies tothe quiescent galaxy population on short time-scales. we argue that our resultsare consistent with both strangulation and ram pressure stripping acting inthese clusters, with merger activity occurring in the cluster outskirts.

0802.2489	redshift distribution of extragalactic 24 micron sources	we present the redshift distribution of a complete, unbiased sample of 24micron sources down to fnu(24 micron) = 300 ujy (5-sigma). the sample consistsof 591 sources detected in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey.we have obtained optical spectroscopic redshifts for 421 sources (71%). thesehave a redshift distribution peaking at z~0.3, with a possible additional peakat z~0.9, and objects detected out to z=4.5. the spectra of the remaining 170(29%) exhibit no strong emission lines from which to determine a redshift. wedevelop an algorithm to estimate the redshift distribution of these sources,based on the assumption that they have emission lines but that these lines arenot observable due to the limited wavelength coverage of our spectroscopicobservations. the redshift distribution derived from all 591 sources exhibitsan additional peak of extremely luminous (l(8-1000 micron) &gt; 3 x 10^{12} lsun)objects at z~2, consisting primarily of sources without observable emissionlines. we use optical line diagnostics and irac colors to estimate that 55% ofthe sources within this peak are agn-dominated. we compare our results topublished models of the evolution of infrared luminous galaxies. the modelswhich best reproduce our observations predict a large population ofstar-formation dominated ulirgs at z &gt; 1.5 rather than the agn-dominatedsources we observe.

1405.2620	discovery of a very large structure at z=3.78	we report the discovery of a large-scale structure containing multipleprotoclusters at z=3.78 in the bo\"otes field. the spectroscopic discovery offive galaxies at z=3.783+/-0.002 lying within 1 mpc of one another led us toundertake a deep narrow- and broad-band imaging survey of the surroundingfield. within a comoving volume of 72x72x25 mpc^3, we have identified 65 lymanalpha emitter (lae) candidates at z=3.795+/-0.015, and four additional galaxiesat z_spec=3.730,3.753,3.780,3.835. the galaxy distribution within the field ishighly non-uniform, exhibiting three large (~3-5x) overdensities separated by8-14 mpc (physical) and possibly connected by filamentary structures traced bylaes. the observed number of laes in the entire field is nearly twice theaverage expected in field environments, based on estimates of the lyaluminosity function at these redshifts. we estimate that by z=0 the largestoverdensity will grow into a cluster of mass 10^15 msun; the two smalleroverdensities will grow into clusters of mass (2-6)x10^14 msun. the highestconcentration of galaxies is located at the southern end of the image,suggesting that the current imaging may not map the true extent of the largescale structure. finding three large protocluster candidates within a single0.3 deg^2 field is highly unusual; expectations from theory suggest that suchalignments should occur less than 2% of the time. searching for andcharacterizing such structures and accurately measuring their volume spacedensity can therefore place constraints on the theory of structure formation.such regions can also serve as laboratories for the study of galaxy formationin dense environments.

1410.3489	the clustering and halo masses of star forming galaxies at z&lt;1	we present clustering measurements and halo masses of star forming galaxiesat 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. after excluding agn, we construct a sample of 22553 24 {\mu}msources selected from 8.42 deg^2 of the spitzer mips agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey of bo\"otes. mid-infrared imaging allows us to observe galaxies with thehighest star formation rates (sfrs), less biased by dust obscuration afflictingthe optical bands. we find that the galaxies with the highest sfrs have opticalcolors which are redder than typical blue cloud galaxies, with many residingwithin the green valley. at z &gt; 0.4 our sample is dominated by luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^11 lsun) and is comprised entirely oflirgs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, l_tir &gt; 10^12 lsun) at z &gt;0.6. we observe weak clustering of r_0 = 3-6 mpc/h for almost all of our starforming samples. we find that the clustering and halo mass depend on l_tir atall redshifts, where galaxies with higher l_tir (hence higher sfrs) havestronger clustering. galaxies with the highest sfrs at each redshift typicallyreside within dark matter halos of m_halo ~ 10^12.9 msun/h. this is consistentwith a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated,although we cannot exclude that ulirgs reside within higher mass halos. bymodeling the clustering evolution of halos, we connect our star forming galaxysamples to their local descendants. most star forming galaxies at z &lt; 1.0 arethe progenitors of l &lt; 2.5l* blue galaxies in the local universe, but starforming galaxies with the highest sfrs (l_tir &gt;10^11.7 lsun) at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 arethe progenitors of early-type galaxies in denser group environments.

0804.2293	red galaxy growth and the halo occupation distribution	we have traced the past 7 gyr of red galaxy stellar mass growth within darkmatter halos. we have determined the halo occupation distribution, whichdescribes how galaxies reside within dark matter halos, using the observedluminosity function and clustering of 40,696 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0 red galaxies in bootes.half of 10^{11.9} msun/h halos host a red central galaxy, and this fractionincreases with increasing halo mass. we do not observe any evolution of therelationship between red galaxy stellar mass and host halo mass, although weexpect both galaxy stellar masses and halo masses to evolve over cosmic time.we find that the stellar mass contained within the red population has doubledsince z=1, with the stellar mass within red satellite galaxies tripling overthis redshift range. in cluster mass halos most of the stellar mass resideswithin satellite galaxies and the intra-cluster light, with a minority of thestellar mass residing within central galaxies. the stellar masses of the mostluminous red central galaxies are proportional to halo mass to the power of athird. we thus conclude that halo mergers do not always lead to rapid growth ofcentral galaxies. while very massive halos often double in mass over the past 7gyr, the stellar masses of their central galaxies typically grow by only 30%.

1509.06381	probing the physical properties of z=4.5 lyman alpha emitters with  spitzer	we present the results from a stellar population modeling analysis of asample of 162 z=4.5, and 14 z=5.7 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) in thebootes field, using deep spitzer/irac data at 3.6 and 4.5 um from the spitzerlyman alpha survey, along with hubble space telescope nicmos and wfc3 imagingat 1.1 and 1.6 um for a subset of the laes. this represents one of the largestsamples of high-redshift laes imaged with spitzer irac. we find that 30/162(19%) of the z=4.5 laes and 9/14 (64%) of the z=5.7 laes are detected at&gt;3-sigma in at least one irac band. individual z=4.5 irac-detected laes have alarge range of stellar mass, from 5x10^8 to 10^11 msol. one-third of theirac-detected laes have older stellar population ages of 100 myr - 1 gyr, whilethe remainder have ages &lt; 100 myr. a stacking analysis of irac-undetected laesshows this population to be primarily low mass (8 -- 20 x 10^8 msol) and young(64 - 570 myr). we find a correlation between stellar mass and thedust-corrected ultraviolet-based star-formation rate (sfr) similar to that atlower redshifts, in that higher mass galaxies exhibit higher sfrs. however, thez=4.5 lae correlation is elevated 4-5 times in sfr compared tocontinuum-selected galaxies at similar redshifts. the exception is the mostmassive laes which have sfrs similar to galaxies at lower redshifts suggestingthat they may represent a different population of galaxies than the traditionallower-mass laes, perhaps with a different mechanism promoting lyman alphaphoton escape.

astro-ph;0002445	nicmos imaging of a damped lyman-alpha absorber at z=1.89 toward lbqs  1210+1731 : constraints on size and star formation rate	we report results of a high-resolution imaging search (in rest frameh-$\alpha$ and optical continuum) for the galaxy associated with the dampedlyman-$\alpha$ (dla) absorber at $z=1.892$ toward the $z_{em}=2.543$ quasarlbqs 1210+1731, using hst/nicmos. after psf subtraction, a feature is seen inboth the broad-band and narrow-band images, at a projected separation of0.25$\arcsec$ from the quasar. if associated with the dla, the object would be$\approx 2-3$ $h_{70}^{-1}$ kpc in size with a flux of $9.8 \pm 2.4$ $\mu$jy inthe f160w filter, implying a luminosity at $\lambda_{central}=5500$ {\aa} inthe rest frame of $1.5 \times 10^{10}$ $h_{70}^{-2}$ l$_{\odot}$ at $z=1.89$,for $q_{0}=0.5$. however, no significant h-$\alpha$ emission is seen,suggesting a low star formation rate (sfr) (3 $\sigma$ upper limit of 4.0$h_{70}^{-2}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), or very high dust obscuration.alternatively, the object may be associated with the host galaxy of the quasar.h-band images obtained with the nicmos camera 2 coronagraph show a much fainterstructure $\approx 4-5$ $h_{70}^{-1}$ kpc in size and containing four knots ofcontinuum emission, located 0.7$\arcsec$ away from the quasar. we have probedregions far closer to the quasar sight-line than in most previous studies ofhigh-redshift intervening dlas. the two objects we report mark the closestdetected high-redshift dla candidates yet to any quasar sight line. if thefeatures in our images are associated with the dla, they suggest faint,compact, somewhat clumpy objects rather than large, well-formed proto-galacticdisks or spheroids.

astro-ph;0209544	spectroscopic confirmation of three redshift 5.7 lyman-alpha emitters  from the large area lyman alpha survey	narrow-band searches for lyman alpha emission are an efficient way ofidentifying star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. we present keck telescopespectra confirming redshifts z = 5.7 for three objects discovered in the largearea lyman alpha (lala) survey at kitt peak national observatory.  all three spectra show strong, narrow emission lines with the asymmetricprofile that is characteristically produced in high redshift lyman alphaemitters by preferential hi absorption in the blue wing of the line. theseobjects are undetected in deep bw, v, r, and 6600a narrow-band images from thenoao deep wide-field survey and from lala, as expected from lyman break andlyman alpha forest absorption at redshift z = 5.7. all three objects show largeequivalent widths (&gt;= 150a in the rest-frame), suggesting at least one of thefollowing: a top-heavy initial mass function, very low stellar metallicity, orthe presence of an active nucleus. we consider the case for an active nucleusto be weak in all three objects due to the limited width of the lyman alphaemission line (&lt; 500 km/s) and the absence of any other indicator of quasaractivity.  the three confirmed high redshift objects were among four spectroscopicallyobserved targets drawn from the sample of 18 candidates presented by rhoads andmalhotra (2001). thus, these spectra support the lyman alpha emitter populationstatistics from our earlier photometric study, which imply little evolution innumber density from z=5.7 to z=4.5 and provide strong evidence that thereionization redshift is greater than 5.7.

astro-ph;0302555	the nature of the uv/x-ray absorber in pg 2302+029	we present chandra x-ray observations of the radio-quiet qso pg 2302+029.this quasar has a rare system of ultra-high velocity (-56,000 km/s) uvabsorption lines that form in an outflow from the active nucleus (jannuzi etal. 2003). the chandra data indicate that soft x-ray absorption is alsopresent. we perform a joint uv and x-ray analysis, using photoionizationcalculations, to detemine the nature of the absorbing gas. the uv and x-raydatasets were not obtained simultaneously. nonetheless, our analysis suggeststhat the x-ray absorption occurs at high velocities in the same general regionas the uv absorber. there are not enough constraints to rule out multi-zonemodels. in fact, the distinct broad and narrow uv line profiles clearlyindicate that multiple zones are present. our preferred estimates of theionization and total column density in the x-ray absorber (log u=1.6,n_h=10^22.4 cm^-2) over predict the o vi 1032, 1038 absorption unless the x-rayabsorber is also outflowing at ~56,000 km/s, but they over predict the ne viii770, 780 absorption at all velocities. if we assume that the x-ray absorbinggas is outflowing at the same velocity of the uv-absorbing wind and that thewind is radiatively accelerated, then the outflow must be launched at a radiusof &lt; 10^15 cm from the central continuum source. the smallness of this radiuscasts doubts on the assumption of radiative acceleration.

astro-ph;0410523	mid-infrared selection of active galaxies	mid-infrared photometry provides a robust technique for identifying activegalaxies. while the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of normal galaxies isdominated by the composite stellar black body curve and peaks at approximately1.6 microns, the ultraviolet to mid-infrared continuum of active galaxies isdominated by a power law. consequently, with sufficient wavelength baseline,one can easily distinguish agn from stellar populations. mirroring the tendencyof agn to be bluer than galaxies in the ultraviolet, where galaxies (and stars)sample the blue, rising portion of stellar spectra, agn tend to be redder thangalaxies in the mid-infrared, where galaxies sample the red, falling portion ofthe stellar spectra. we report on spitzer space telescope mid-infrared colors,derived from the irac shallow survey, of nearly 10,000 spectroscopicallyidentified sources from the agn and galaxy evolution survey. based on thisspectroscopic sample, we find that simple mid-infrared color criteria provideremarkably robust separation of active galaxies from normal galaxies andgalactic stars, with over 80% completeness and less than 20% contamination.considering only broad-lined agn, these mid-infrared color criteria identifyover 90% of spectroscopically identified quasars and seyfert 1s. applying thesecolor criteria to the full imaging data set, we discuss the implied surfacedensity of agn and find evidence for a large population of optically obscuredactive galaxies.

astro-ph;0503156	tracing the nuclear accretion history of the red galaxy population	we investigate the evolution of the hard x-ray luminosity of the red galaxypopulation using a large sample of 3316 red galaxies selected over a wide rangein redshift (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9) from a 1.4 deg^2 region in the bootes field of the noaodeep wide-field survey (ndwfs). the red galaxies are early-type,bulge-dominated galaxies and are selected to have the same evolution corrected,absolute r-band magnitude distribution as a function of redshift to ensure weare tracing the evolution in the x-ray properties of a comparable opticalpopulation. using a stacking analysis of 5-ks chandra/acis observations withinthis field to study the x-ray emission from these red galaxies in threeredshift bins, we find that the mean x-ray luminosity increases as a functionof redshift. the large mean x-ray luminosity and the hardness of the mean x-rayspectrum suggests that the x-ray emission is largely dominated by agn ratherthan stellar sources. the hardness ratio can be reproduced by either anabsorbed (n_h ~2 x 10^22 cm^-2) gamma=1.7 power-law source, consistent withthat of a population of moderately obscured seyfert-like agn, or an unabsorbedgamma=0.7 source suggesting a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (e.g., anadvection-dominated accretion flow). we also find that the emission from thissample of red galaxies constitutes at least 5% of the hard x-ray background.these results suggest a global decline in the mean agn activity of normalearly-type galaxies from z~1 to the present, which indicates that we arewitnessing the tailing off of the accretion activity onto smbhs in early-typegalaxies since the quasar epoch.

astro-ph;0601200	the association between gas and galaxies i: cfht spectroscopy and pair  analysis	we investigate the relative distribution of the gaseous contents of theuniverse (as traced by a sample of lyman alpha (lya) absorbers), and theluminous baryonic matter (as traced by a redshift survey of galaxies in thesame volume searched for lya absorbers), along 16 lines-of-sight (los) betweenredshifts 0 and 1. our galaxy redshift survey was made with the multi-objectspectrograph (mos) on canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) and, when combinedwith galaxies from the literature in the same los, gives us a galaxy sample of636 objects. by combining this with an absorption line sample of 406 absorbingsystems drawn from published works, we are able to study the relationshipbetween gas and galaxies over the latter half of the age of the universe. acorrelation between absorbers and galaxies is detected out to separation of 1.5mpc. this correlation is weaker than the galaxy-galaxy correlation. there isalso some evidence that the absorbing systems seen in civ are more closelyrelated to galaxies, although this correlation could be with column densityrather than metallicity. the above results are all consistent with theabsorbing gas and the galaxies co-existing in dark matter filaments and knotsas predicted by current models, where the column density of the absorbing gasis correlated with the underlying matter density.

astro-ph;0605030	the discovery of three new z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolution  survey	we present the discovery of three z&gt;5 quasars in the agn and galaxy evolutionsurvey (ages) spectroscopic observations of the noao deep wide-field survey(ndwfs) bootes field. these quasars were selected as part of a larger spitzermid-infrared quasar sample with no selection based on optical colors. thehighest redshift object, ndwfs j142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is thelowest-luminosity z&gt;5.8 quasar currently known. we compare mid-infraredtechniques for identifying z&gt;5 quasars to more traditional optical techniquesand show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasarseven at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z&gt;7where optical selection is impossible. using the superb multi-wavelengthcoverage available in the ndwfs bootes field, we construct the spectral energydistributions (seds) of high-redshift quasars from observed bw-band to 24microns (rest-frame 600 angstroms - 3.7 microns). we show that the threehigh-redshift quasars have quite similar seds, and the rest-frame composite sedof low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared toour high-redshift objects. we compare the number of z&gt;5 quasars we havediscovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.while analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on onlythree objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with psil^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasarsdiscovered in our survey.

astro-ph;0609584	the evolving luminosity function of red galaxies	we trace the assembly history of red galaxies since z=1, by measuring theirevolving space density with the b-band luminosity function. our sample of 39599red galaxies, selected from 6.96 square degrees of imaging from the noao deepwide-field and spitzer irac shallow surveys, is an order of magnitude larger,in size and volume, than comparable samples in the literature. we measure ahigher space density of z=0.9 red galaxies than some of the recent literature,in part because we account for the faint yet significant galaxy flux whichfalls outside of our photometric aperture. the b-band luminosity density of redgalaxies, which effectively measures the evolution of ~l* galaxies, increasesby only 36 percent from z=0 to z=1. if red galaxy stellar populations havefaded by 1.24 b-band magnitudes since z=1, the stellar mass contained withinthe red galaxy population has roughly doubled over the past 8 gyr. this isconsistent with star-forming galaxies being transformed into ~l* red galaxiesafter a decline in their star formation rates. in contrast, the evolution of4l* red galaxies differs only slightly from a model with negligible starformation and no galaxy mergers since z=1. if this model approximates theluminosity evolution of red galaxy stellar populations, then 80 percent of thestellar mass contained within today's 4l* red galaxies was already in place atz=0.7. while red galaxy mergers have been observed, such mergers do not producerapid growth of 4l* red galaxy stellar masses between z=1 and the present day.

astro-ph;9508068	requirements for investigating the connection between lyman alpha  absorption clouds and the large-scale distribution of galaxies	we model the requirements on observational data that would allow an accuratedetermination of the degree of association between lyman alpha absorbers andpeaks in the redshift distribution of galaxies (large-scale structures likeclusters of galaxies). we compare simulated distributions of low-redshift lymanalpha absorption systems, constrained to be consistent with the distributionobserved with hst, with the large-scale distribution of galaxies determinedfrom pencil-beam redshift surveys. we estimate the amount of observational datarequired from catalogues of lyman alpha absorbers and galaxies to allow astatistically significant test of the association of absorbers with large-scalestructures of galaxies.  we find that for each line-of-sight observed for lyman alpha absorption lines(assuming that the entire redshift range out to z=0.4 is observable), redshiftsmust be obtained for at least 18 galaxies brighter than mb=-18 and havingredshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. based on the redshift surveys used in thisstudy, a search radius of 10' from the quasar line-of-sight is required. thiswill ensure that all peaks in the galaxy redshift distribution are representedby at least one galaxy in the observed sample. if lyman alpha absorbers areintrinsically uncorrelated with galaxies, we find that 8 lines-of-sight must beobserved to show that the distributions are different at the 95% confidencelevel. however, if a fraction of the lyman alpha absorbers are distributed withthe peaks in the galaxy distribution, 38 lines-of-sight must be mapped for thedistribution of both lyman alpha absorbers and galaxies in order to determinethe fraction of absorbers distributed with the peaks of the galaxy distributionto an accuracy of 10%.

astro-ph;9509099	detection of extended polarized ultraviolet radiation from the z = 1.82  radio galaxy 3c 256	we have detected spatially extended linear polarized uv emission from thehigh-redshift radio galaxy 3c~256 ($z=1.82$). a spatially integrated ($7.8''$diameter aperture) measurement of the degree of polarization of the $v-$band(rest frame 0.19 $\mu$m) emission yields a value of 16.4\% ($\pm 2.2$\%) with aposition angle of $42{}\rlap{\rm .}^\circ 4$ ($\pm 3{}\rlap{\rm .}^\circ 9$),orthogonal to the position angle on the sky of the major axis of the extendedemission. the peak emission measured with a $3.6''$ diameter circular apertureis 11.7\% ($\pm 1.5$\%) polarized with a position angle of $42{}\rlap{\rm.}^\circ 4$ ($\pm 3{}\rlap{\rm .}^\circ 6$). an image of the polarized flux ispresented, clearly displaying that the polarized flux is extended and presentover the entire extent of the object. while it has been suggested that the uvcontinuum of 3c~256 might be due to star formation (elston 1988) or aprotogalaxy (eisenhardt \&amp; dickinson 1993) based on its extremely blue spectralenergy distribution and similar morphology at uv and visible wavelengths, weare unable to reconcile the observed high degree of polarization with such amodel. while the detection of polarized emission from hzrgs has been shown tobe a common phenomena, 3c~256 is only the third object for which a measurementof the extended polarized uv emission has been presented. these data lendadditional support to the suggestion first made by di serego alighieri andcollaborators that the ``alignment effect'', the tendency for the extended uvcontinuum radiation and line emission from hzrgs to be aligned with the majoraxis of the extended radio emission, is in large part due to scattering ofanisotropic nuclear emission.

astro-ph;9703134	probing the geometry and circumstellar environment of sn 1993j in m81	we have monitored the polarized radiation of the type iib sn 1993j in m81over a period of 41 days, starting from 7 days after the explosion on 1993march 27.5 (ut). our data show clear evidence that the intrinsic continuumpolarization of sn 1993j evolved from being essentially negligible on april3-4, to a peak value of ~ 1% in late april 1993, and started to decline by themiddle of may. the polarized flux spectrum in late april strongly resembledspectra of type ib supernovae, with prominent he i lines but redshifted ~ 3380km/s relative to the total flux spectrum. these data are consistent with modelsof hoflich; they suggest that the polarization was most likely produced byeither an asymmetric helium core configuration of material and/or flux, orscattering from an asymmetric circumstellar distribution of dusty material. acombination of electron and dust scattering, as well as a clumpy or stratifieddistribution of the emitting gas, are possible as the polarization mechanism ofthe continuum and emission lines. the latter interpretation is supported by thefact that 1-2 months after the explosion, the observed rotations ofpolarization position angle across prominent line features remain even aftercorrection for effects of interstellar polarization. this indicates thatemission lines of he i, fe ii, [o i], and h are all intrinsically polarized atposition angles different from that of the continuum, with the non-balmer linesgenerally being most highly polarized. if the supernova had an oblate geometry,our data are consistent with a small viewing angle (i.e., more or lessequator-on), although the degree of asphericity that gave rise to thepolarization at early times is probably smaller (minor to major axis ratio &gt;0.7) than has been previously suggested.
