0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0908.3808	photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey fields	we present the photometric calibration of the supernova legacy survey (snls)fields. the snls aims at measuring the distances to sne ia at (0.3&lt;z&lt;1) usingmegacam, the 1 deg^2 imager on the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). theuncertainty affecting the photometric calibration of the survey dominates thesystematic uncertainty of the key measurement of the survey, namely the darkenergy equation of state. the photometric calibration of the snls requiresobtaining a uniform response across the imager, calibrating the science fieldstars in each survey band (sdss-like ugriz bands) with respect to standardswith known flux in the same bands, and binding the calibration to the ubvrilandolt standards used to calibrate the nearby sne from the literaturenecessary to produce cosmological constraints. the spatial non-uniformities ofthe imager photometric response are mapped using dithered observations of densestellar fields. photometric zero-points against landolt standards are obtained.the linearity of the instrument is studied. we show that the imager filters andphotometric response are not uniform and publish correction maps. we presentmodels of the effective passbands of the instrument as a function of theposition on the focal plane. we define a natural magnitude system for megacam.we show that the systematics affecting the magnitude-to-flux relations can bereduced if we use the spectrophotometric standard star bd +17 4708 instead ofvega as a fundamental flux standard. we publish ugriz catalogs of tertiarystandards for all the snls fields.

0909.3316	the eso/vlt 3rd year type ia supernova data set from the supernova  legacy survey	we present 139 spectra of 124 type ia supernovae (sneia) that were observedat the eso/vlt during the first three years of the canada-france-hawaitelescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). this homogeneous data set isused to test for redshift evolution of sneia spectra, and will be used in thesnls 3rd year cosmological analyses.  spectra have been reduced and extracted with a dedicated pipeline that usesphotometric information from deep cfht legacy survey (cfht-ls) reference imagesto trace, at sub-pixel accuracy, the position of the supernova on thespectrogram as a function of wavelength. it also separates the supernova andits host light in 60% of cases. the identification of the supernova candidatesis performed using a spectrophotometric snia model.  a total of 124 sneia, roughly 50% of the overall snls spectroscopic sample,have been identified using the eso/vlt during the first three years of thesurvey. their redshifts range from z=0.149 to z=1.031. the average redshift ofthe sample is z=0.63+/-0.02. this constitutes the largest snia spectral set todate in this redshift range. the spectra are presented along with theirbest-fit spectral snia model and a host model where relevant. in the lattercase, a host subtracted spectrum is also presented. we produce average spectrafor pre-maximum, maximum and post-maximum epochs for both z&lt;0.5 and z&gt;=0.5sneia. we find that z&lt;0.5 spectra have deeper intermediate mass elementabsorptions than z&gt;= 0.5 spectra. the differences with redshift are consistentwith the selection of brighter and bluer supernovae at higher redshift.

0912.1646	the type ia supernova rate in radio and infrared galaxies from the cfht  supernova legacy survey	we have combined the large sn ia database of the canada-france-hawaiitelescope supernova legacy survey and catalogs of galaxies with photometricredshifts, vla 1.4 ghz radio sources, and spitzer infrared sources. we presenteight sne ia in early-type host galaxies which have counterparts in the radioand infrared source catalogs. we find the sn ia rate in subsets of radio andinfrared early-type galaxies is ~1-5 times the rate in all early-type galaxies,and that any enhancement is always &lt;~ 2 sigma. rates in these subsets areconsistent with predictions of the two component "a+b" sn ia rate model. sinceinfrared properties of radio sn ia hosts indicate dust obscured star formation,we incorporate infrared star formation rates into the "a+b" model. we also showthe properties of sne ia in radio and infrared galaxies suggest the hostscontain dust and support a continuum of delay time distributions for sne ia,although other delay time distributions cannot be ruled out based on our data.

1002.1249	gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (snls)	the observed brightness of type ia supernovae is affected by gravitationallensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, whichintroduces an additional dispersion into the hubble diagram. we look forevidence of lensing in the supernova legacy survey 3-year data set. weinvestigate the correlation between the residuals from the hubble diagram andthe gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution offoreground galaxies. a deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, andwell established mass luminosity relations are used. we find evidence of alensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. the current result is limited bythe number of sne, their redshift distribution, and the other sources ofscatter in the hubble diagram. separating the galaxy population into a red anda blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signaldetection. on the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, theprecision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the massluminosity relations have little effect. we show that for the full supernovalegacy survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type ia sne and ~200photometrically identified type ia sne), there is an 80% probability ofdetecting the lensing signal with a 3 sigma significance.

1002.1374	constraining dark matter halo properties using lensed snls supernovae	this paper exploits the gravitational magnification of sne ia to measureproperties of dark matter haloes. the magnification of individual sne ia can becomputed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halomodels. we model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singularisothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeyingluminosity dependent scaling laws. a homogeneously selected sample of 175 sneia from the first 3-years of the supernova legacy survey (snls) in the redshiftrange 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloesassociated with foreground galaxies. the best-fitting velocity dispersionscaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. we furtherfind that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and starforming galaxies are consistent with empirical faber-jackson and tully-fisherrelations, respectively. if we make no assumption on the normalisation of theserelations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 percent confidence level. using recent models of dust extinction we deduce thatthe impact of this effect on our results is very small. we also investigate thebrightness scatter of sne ia due to gravitational lensing. the gravitationallensing scatter is approximately proportional to the sn ia redshift. we findthe constant of proportionality to be b = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (b &lt; 0.12 magat the 95 per cent confidence level). if this model is correct, thecontribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of sne ia issmall for the snls sample.

1003.5119	the dependence of type ia supernova luminosities on their host galaxies	(abridged) precision cosmology with type ia supernovae (sne ia) makes use ofthe fact that sn ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes andcolours. using supernova legacy survey (snls) and other data, we show thatthere is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their hostgalaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average,0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich)and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (ssfr). sne ia in galaxieswith a low ssfr also have a smaller slope ("beta") between their luminositiesand colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on sn ia hubblediagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects isdependent on the reddest sne. sn ia colours are similar between low-mass andhigh-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as anintrinsic property of the sne and not of some external factor such as dust. ifthe host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminositytrends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. we show thatthe average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our sn iahost galaxies decreases with redshift. the sn ia luminosity differencesconsequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparableto the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. we show thatthe use of two sn ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass(metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies,adequately corrects for the differences. cosmological fits incorporating theseterms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma). we conclude thatfuture sn ia cosmological analyses should use a correction of this (or similar)form to control demographic shifts in the galaxy population.

1004.1711	spectra and light curves of six type ia supernovae at 0.511 &lt; z &lt; 1.12  and the union2 compilation	we report on work to increase the number of well-measured type ia supernovae(sne ia) at high redshifts. light curves, including high signal-to-noise hstdata, and spectra of six sne ia that were discovered during 2001 are presented.additionally, for the two sne with z&gt;1, we present ground-based j-bandphotometry from gemini and the vlt. these are among the most distant sne ia forwhich ground based near-ir observations have been obtained. we add these sixsne ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in theliterature to the union compilation (kowalski et al. 2008). we have made anumber of refinements to the union analysis chain, the most important onesbeing the refitting of all light curves with the salt2 fitter and an improvedhandling of systematic errors. we call this new compilation, consisting of 557supernovae, the union2 compilation. the flat concordance lambdacdm modelremains an excellent fit to the union2 data with the best fit constant equationof state parameter w=-0.997^{+0.050}_{-0.054} (stat) ^{+0.077}_{-0.082}(stat+sys\ together) for a flat universe, or w=-1.035^{+0.055}_{-0.059}(stat)^{+0.093}_{-0.097} (stat+sys together) with curvature. we also presentimproved constraints on w(z). while no significant change in w with redshift isdetected, there is still considerable room for evolution in w. the strength ofthe constraints depend strongly on redshift. in particular, at z &gt; 1, theexistence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained by the data.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1006.2254	real-time analysis and selection biases in the supernova legacy survey	the supernova legacy survey (snls) has produced a high-quality, homogeneoussample of type ia supernovae (sne ia) out to redshifts greater than z=1. in itsfirst four years of full operation (to june 2007), the snls discovered morethan 3000 transient candidates, 373 of which have been confirmedspectroscopically as sne ia. use of these sne ia in precision cosmologycritically depends on an analysis of the observational biases incurred in thesnls survey due to the incomplete sampling of the underlying sn ia population.this paper describes our real-time supernova detection and analysis procedures,and uses detailed monte carlo simulations to examine the effects of malmquistbias and spectroscopic sampling. such sampling effects are found to becomeapparent at z~0.6, with a significant shift in the average magnitude of thespectroscopically confirmed sn ia sample towards brighter values for z&gt;0.75. wedescribe our approach to correct for these selection biases in our three-yearsnls cosmological analysis (snls3), and present a breakdown of the systematicuncertainties involved.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.4743	the supernova legacy survey 3-year sample: type ia supernovae  photometric distances and cosmological constraints	we present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 highredshift type ia supernovae (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1) discovered during the first threeyears of the supernova legacy survey (snls). these events were detected andtheir multi-colour light curves measured using the megaprime/megacam instrumentat the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht), by repeatedly imaging fourone-square degree fields in four bands. follow-up spectroscopy was performed atthe vlt, gemini and keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae andto measure their redshifts. systematic uncertainties arising from light curvemodeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peakmagnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of aprecise calibration of the snls fields. a flat lambdacdm cosmological fit to231 snls high redshift type ia supernovae alone gives omega_m = 0.211 +/-0.034(stat) +/- 0.069(sys). the dominant systematic uncertainty comes fromuncertainties in the photometric calibration. systematic uncertainties fromlight curve fitters come next with a total contribution of +/- 0.026 onomega_m. no clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope(beta) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1104.1443	supernova constraints and systematic uncertainties from the first 3  years of the supernova legacy survey	we combine high redshift type ia supernovae from the first 3 years of thesupernova legacy survey (snls) with other supernova (sn) samples, primarily atlower redshifts, to form a high-quality joint sample of 472 sne (123 low-$z$,93 sdss, 242 snls, and 14 {\it hubble space telescope}). sn data alone requirecosmic acceleration at &gt;99.9% confidence, including systematic effects. for thedark energy equation of state parameter (assumed constant out to at least$z=1.4$) in a flat universe, we find $w = -0.91^{+0.16}_{-0.20}(\mathrm{stat})^{+0.07}_{-0.14} (\mathrm{sys})$ from sne only, consistent with a cosmologicalconstant. our fits include a correction for the recently discoveredrelationship between host-galaxy mass and sn absolute brightness. we payparticular attention to systematic uncertainties, characterizing them using asystematics covariance matrix that incorporates the redshift dependence ofthese effects, as well as the shape-luminosity and color-luminosityrelationships. unlike previous work, we include the effects of systematic termson the empirical light-curve models. the total systematic uncertainty isdominated by calibration terms. we describe how the systematic uncertaintiescan be reduced with soon to be available improved nearby andintermediate-redshift samples, particularly those calibrated ontousno/sdss-like systems.

1104.1444	snls3: constraints on dark energy combining the supernova legacy survey  three year data with other probes	we present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using thesupernova legacy survey three year sample (snls3) of guy et al. (2010) andconley et al. (2011). we use the 472 sne ia in this sample, accounting forrecently discovered correlations between sn ia luminosity and host galaxyproperties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertaintiesdirectly in the cosmological fits. combining the snls3 data with the full wmap7power spectrum, the sloan digital sky survey luminous red galaxy powerspectrum, and a prior on the hubble constant h0 from shoes, in a flat universewe find omega_m=0.269+/-0.015 and w=-1.061+0.069-0.068 -- a 6.5% measure of thedark energy equation-of-state parameter w. the statistical and systematicuncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertaintiesdominated by the photometric calibration of the sn ia fluxes -- without thesecalibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. whenrelaxing the assumption of flatness, we find omega_m=0.271+/-0.015,omega_k=-0.002+/-0.006, and w=-1.069+0.091-0.092. parameterizing the timeevolution of w as w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), gives w_0=-0.905+/-0.196,w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. all of our results are consistentwith a flat, w=-1 universe. the size of the snls3 sample allows various teststo be performed with the sne segregated according to their light curve and hostgalaxy properties. we find that the cosmological constraints derived from thesedifferent sub-samples are consistent. there is evidence that the coefficient,beta, relating sn ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at&gt;4sigma significance (in addition to the known sn luminosity--host relation);however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and iscurrently a sub-dominant systematic.

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1106.4008	constraining type ia supernovae progenitors from three years of snls  data	while it is generally accepted that type ia supernovae are the result of theexplosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting mass in a binary system, thedetails of their genesis still elude us, and the nature of the binary companionis uncertain. kasen (2010) points out that the presence of a non-degeneratecompanion in the progenitor system could leave an observable trace: a fluxexcess in the early rise portion of the lightcurve caused by the ejecta impactwith the companion itself. this excess would be observable only under favorableviewing angles, and its intensity depends on the nature of the companion. wesearched for the signature of a non-degenerate companion in three years ofsupernova legacy survey data by generating synthetic lightcurves accounting forthe effects of shocking and comparing true and synthetic time series withkolmogorov-smirnov tests. our most constraining result comes from noting thatthe shocking effect is more prominent in rest-frame b than v band: we rule outa contribution from white dwarf-red giant binary systems to type ia supernovaexplosions greater than 10% at 2 sigma, and than 20% at 3 sigma level.

1109.0948	photometric selection of type ia supernovae in the supernova legacy  survey	we present a sample of 485 photometrically identified type ia supernovacandidates mined from the first three years of data of the cfht supernovalegacy survey (snls). the images were submitted to a deferred processingindependent of the snls real-time detection pipeline. light curves of alltransient events were reconstructed in the g_m, r_m, i_m and z_m filters andsubmitted to automated sequential cuts in order to identify possiblesupernovae. pure noise and long-term variable events were rejected by lightcurve shape criteria. type ia supernova identification relied on eventcharacteristics fitted to their light curves assuming the events to be normalsne ia. the light curve fitter salt2 was used for this purpose, assigning hostgalaxy photometric redshifts to the tested events. the selected sample of 485candidates is one magnitude deeper than that allowed by the snls spectroscopicidentification. the contamination by supernovae of other types is estimated tobe 4%. testing hubble diagram residuals with this enlarged sample allows us tomeasure the malmquist bias due to spectroscopic selections directly. the resultis fully consistent with the precise monte carlo based estimate used to correctsn ia distance moduli in the snls 3-year cosmological analyses. this paperdemonstrates the feasibility of a photometric selection of high redshiftsupernovae with known host galaxy redshifts, opening interesting prospects forcosmological analyses from future large photometric sn ia surveys.

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1109.5757	the rise-time of normal and subluminous type ia supernovae	we calculate the average stretch-corrected rise-time of type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the supernova legacy survey. we use the aggregate lightcurves ofspectroscopic and photometrically identified sne ia to fit the rising part ofthe lightcurve with a simple quadratic model. we obtain a lightcurve shapecorrected, i .e. stretch-corrected, fiducial rise-time of 17.02^{+0.18}_{-0.28}(stat) days. the measured rise-time differs from an earlier finding by the snls(conley et al. 2006) due to the use of different sn ia templates. we compare itto nearby samples using the same methods and find no evolution in the earlypart of the lightcurve of sne ia up to z=1. we search for variations amongdifferent populations, particularly subluminous objects, by dividing the samplein stretch. bright and slow decliners (s&gt;1.0) have consistent stretch-correctedrise-times compared to fainter and faster decliners (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0); they areshorter by 0.57^{+0.47}_{-0.50} (stat) days. subluminous sne ia (here definedas objects with s&lt;0.8), although less constrained, are also consistent, with arise-time of 18.03^{+0.81}_{-1.37} (stat) days. we study several systematicbiases and find that the use of different fiducial templates may affect theaverage rise-time but not the intrinsic differences between populations. basedon our results, we estimate that subluminous sne ia are powered by 0.05-0.35solar masses of radioactive nickel synthesized in the explosion. ourconclusions are the same for the single-stretch and two-stretchparameterizations of the lightcurve.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1206.0665	evolution in the volumetric type ia supernova rate from the supernova  legacy survey	we present a measurement of the volumetric type ia supernova (sn ia) rate(snr_ia) as a function of redshift for the first four years of data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) supernova legacy survey (snls). thisanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additionalphotometrically identified sne ia within the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.1. thevolumetric snr_ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows apower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. this evolutionarytrend in the snls rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmicstar-formation history over the same redshift range. we combine the snls ratemeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the snls redshiftrange, and fit various simple sn ia delay-time distribution (dtd) models to thecombined data. a simple power-law model for the dtd (i.e., proportional tot^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending onthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. a two-componentmodel, where snr_ia is dependent on stellar mass (mstellar) and star formationrate (sfr) as snr_ia(z)=axmstellar(z) + bxsfr(z), yields the coefficientsa=1.9+/-0.1 sne/yr/m_solar and b=3.3+/-0.2 sne/yr/(m_solar/yr). more generaltwo-component models also fit the data well, but single gaussian or exponentialdtds provide significantly poorer matches. finally, we split the snls sampleinto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that thegeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining sne ia (0.8&lt;s&lt;1.0) issimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects(1.0&lt;s&lt;1.3) out to z~0.8.

1206.2319	herschel observations of a z~2 stellar mass selected galaxy sample drawn  from the goods nicmos survey	we present a study of the far-ir properties of a stellar mass selected sampleof 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 galaxies with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 9.5 drawn from the goods nicmossurvey (gns), the deepest h-band hubble space telescope survey of its typeprior to the installation of wfc3. we use far-ir and sub-mm data from the pacsand spire instruments on-board herschel, taken from the pacs evolutionary probe(pep) and herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key projectsrespectively. we find a total of 22 gns galaxies, with median log(m_*/m_sun) =10.8 and z = 2.0, associated with 250 um sources detected with snr &gt; 3. wederive mean total ir luminosity log l_ir (l_sun) = 12.36 +/- 0.05 andcorresponding star formation rate sfr_(ir+uv) = (280 +/- 40) m_sun/yr for theseobjects, and find them to have mean dust temperature t_dust ~ 35 k. we findthat the sfr derived from the far-ir photometry combined with uv-basedestimates of unobscured sfr for these galaxies is on average more than a factorof 2 higher than the sfr derived from extinction corrected uv emission alone,although we note that the ir-based estimate is subject to substantial malmquistbias. to mitigate the effect of this bias and extend our study to fainterfluxes, we perform a stacking analysis to measure the mean sfr in bins ofstellar mass. we obtain detections at the 2-4 sigma level at spire wavelengthsfor samples with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 10. in contrast to the herschel detected gnsgalaxies, we find that estimates of sfr_(ir+uv) for the stacked samples arecomparable to those derived from extinction corrected uv emission, although theuncertainties are large. we find evidence for an increasing fraction of dustobscured star formation with stellar mass, finding sfr_ir/sfr_uv \proptom_*^{0.7 +/- 0.2}, which is likely a consequence of the mass--metallicityrelation.

1207.5564	fmos near-ir spectroscopy of herschel selected galaxies: star formation  rates, metallicity and dust attenuation at z~1	we investigate the properties (e.g. star formation rate, dust attentuation,stellar mass and metallicity) of a sample of infrared luminous galaxies at z\sim 1 via near-ir spectroscopy with subaru-fmos. our sample consists ofherschel spire and spitzer mips selected sources in the cosmos field withphotometric redshifts in the range 0.7 &lt; z-phot &lt; 1.8, which have been targetedin 2 pointings (0.5 sq. deg.) with fmos. we find a modest success rate foremission line detections, with candidate h{\alpha} emission lines detected for57 of 168 spire sources (34 per cent). by stacking the near-ir spectra wedirectly measure the mean balmer decrement for the h{\alpha} and h{\beta}lines, finding a value of &lt;e(b-v)&gt; = 0.51\pm0.27 for &lt;lir&gt; = 10^12 lsol sourcesat &lt;z&gt; = 1.36. by comparing star formation rates estimated from the ir and fromthe dust uncorrected h{\alpha} line we find a strong relationship between dustattenuation and star formation rate. this relation is broadly consistent withthat previously seen in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 0.1. finally, weinvestigate the metallicity via the n2 ratio, finding that z ~ 1 ir-selectedsources are indistinguishable from the local mass-metallicity relation. we alsofind a strong correlation between dust attentuation and metallicity, with themost metal-rich ir-sources experiencing the largest levels of dust attenuation.

1210.2362	cosmic evolution of star-formation enhancement in close major-merger  galaxy pairs since z = 1	the infrared (ir) emission of m_* galaxies (10^{10.4} &lt; m_{star} &lt; 10^{11.0}m_\sun) in galaxy pairs, derived using data obtained in herschel (pep/hermes)and spitzer (s-cosmos) surveys, is compared to that of single disk galaxies inwell matched control samples to study the cosmic evolution of thestar-formation enhancement induced by galaxy-galaxy interaction. both the meanir sed and mean ir luminosity of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) in sfg+sfg (s+s)pairs in the redshift bin of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1 are consistent with no star-formationenhancement. sfgs in s+s pairs in a lower redshift bin of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 showmarginal evidence for a weak star-formation enhancement. together with thesignificant and strong ssfr enhancement shown by sfgs in a local sample of s+spairs (obtained using previously published spitzer observations), our resultsreveal a trend for the star-formation enhancement in s+s pairs to decrease withincreasing redshift. between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-inducedstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by afactor of ~10) of the ssfr of single sfgs, both can be explained by the highergas fraction in higher z disks. sfgs in mixed pairs (s+e pairs) do not show anysignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. the difference betweensfgs in s+s pairs and in s+e pairs suggests a modulation of the ssfr by theinter-galactic medium igm in the dark matter halos (dmh) hosting these pairs.

1210.4928	a redshift survey of herschel far-infrared selected starbursts and  implications for obscured star formation	we present keck spectroscopic observations and redshifts for a sample of 767herschel-spire selected galaxies (hsgs) at 250, 350, and 500um, taken with thekeck i low resolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and the keck ii deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph (deimos). the redshift distribution of these spiresources from the herschel multitiered extragalactic survey (hermes) peaks atz=0.85, with 731 sources at z&lt;2 and a tail of sources out to z~5. we measuremore significant disagreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts(&lt;delta_z&gt;/(1+z)&gt;=0.29) than is seen in non-infrared selected samples, likelydue to enhanced star formation rates and dust obscuration in infrared-selectedgalaxies. we estimate that the vast majority (72-83%) of z&lt;2 herschel-selectedgalaxies would drop out of traditional submillimeter surveys at 0.85-1mm. weestimate the luminosity function and implied star-formation rate densitycontribution of hsgs at z&lt;1.6 and find overall agreement with work based on24um extrapolations of the lirg, ulirg and total infrared contributions. thiswork significantly increased the number of spectroscopically confirmedinfrared-luminous galaxies at z&gt;&gt;0 and demonstrates the growing importance ofdusty starbursts for galaxy evolution studies and the build-up of stellar massthroughout cosmic time.

1210.4932	a population of z&gt;2 far-infrared herschel-spire selected starbursts	we present spectroscopic observations for a sample of 36 herschel-spire250-500um selected galaxies (hsgs) at 2&lt;z&lt;5 from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). redshifts are confirmed as part of a largeredshift survey of herschel-spire-selected sources covering ~0.93deg^2 in sixextragalactic legacy fields. observations were taken with the keck i lowresolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and the keck ii deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph (deimos). precise astrometry, needed forspectroscopic follow-up, is determined by identification of counterparts at24um or 1.4ghz using a cross-identification likelihood matching method.individual source luminosities range from log(l_ir/lsun)=12.5-13.6(corresponding to star formation rates 500-9000msun/yr, assuming a salpeterimf), constituting some of the most intrinsically luminous, distant infraredgalaxies yet discovered. we present both individual and composite rest-frameultraviolet spectra and infrared spectral energy distributions (seds). theselection of these hsgs is reproducible and well characterized across largeareas of sky in contrast to most z&gt;2 hylirgs in the literature which aredetected serendipitously or via tailored surveys searching only for high-zhylirgs; therefore, we can place lower limits on the contribution of hsgs tothe cosmic star formation rate density at (7+-2)x10^(-3)msun/yr h^3mpc^(-3) atz~2.5, which is &gt;10% of the estimated total star formation rate density (sfrd)of the universe from optical surveys. the contribution at z~4 has a lower limitof 3x10^(-3)msun/yr h^3 mpc^(-3), ~&gt;20% of the estimated total sfrd. thishighlights the importance of extremely infrared-luminous galaxies with highstar formation rates to the build-up of stellar mass, even at the earliestepochs.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1212.2650	inferring the mass of sub-millimetre galaxies by exploiting their  gravitational magnification of background galaxies	dust emission at sub-millimetre wavelengths allows us to trace the earlyphases of star formation in the universe. in order to understand the physicalprocesses involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gainknowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses -that sub-millimetre galaxies live in. here we use the magnification effect ofgravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content ofsub-millimetre galaxies with 250mu flux densities of s_250&gt;15mjy selected usingdata from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey. the positions ofhundreds of sub-millimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with thepositions of background lyman-break galaxies at z~3-5 selected using opticaldata from the canada-france hawaii telescope legacy survey. we detect across-correlation signal at the 7-sigma level over a sky area of one squaredegree, with ~80% of this signal being due to magnification, whereas theremaining ~20% comes from dust extinction. adopting some simple assumptions forthe dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us toestimate the average mass of the halos hosting the sub-millimetre galaxies tobe log(m_200/m_sun)=13.17+0.05-0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction(at radii of &gt;10kpc) to be m_dust/m_200~6x10^-5. this supports the picture thatsub-millimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside inmassive group-sized halos, and are a crucial phase in the assembly andevolution of structure in the universe.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1303.6725	hermes: a deficit in the surface brightness of the cosmic infrared  background due to galaxy cluster gravitational lensing	we have observed four massive galaxy clusters with the spire instrument onthe herschel space observatory and measure a deficit of surface brightnesswithin their central region after subtracting sources. we simulate the effectsof instrumental sensitivity and resolution, the source population, and thelensing effect of the clusters to estimate the shape and amplitude of thedeficit. the amplitude of the central deficit is a strong function of thesurface density and flux distribution of the background sources. we find thatfor the current best fitting faint end number counts, and excellent lensingmodels, the most likely amplitude of the central deficit is the full intensityof the cosmic infrared background (cib). our measurement leads to a lower limitto the integrated total intensity of the cib of i(250 microns) &gt;0.69_(-0.03)^(+0.03) (stat.)_(-0.06)^(+0.11) (sys.) mjy/sr, with more cibpossible from both low-redshift sources and from sources within the targetclusters. it should be possible to observe this effect in existing high angularresolution data at other wavelengths where the cib is bright, which would allowtests of models of the faint source component of the cib.

0705.0367	is there evidence for a hubble bubble? the nature of type ia supernova  colors and dust in external galaxies	we examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of type iasupernovae (sne ia) for the $\sim 3 \sigma$ detection of a ``hubble bubble'' --a departure of the local value of the hubble constant from its globallyaveraged value \citep{jha:07}. by comparing the mlcs2k2 fits used in that studyto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, wedemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of sn color excesses(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of acolor gradient across the local sample. if the slope of the linear relation($\beta$) between sn color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then thebubble disappears. if, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely frommilky way-like dust, then sn data clearly favors a hubble bubble. wedemonstrate that sn data give $\beta \simeq 2$, instead of the $\beta \simeq 4$one would expect from purely milky-way-like dust. this suggests that either snintrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a singlelight-curve shape parameter, or that dust around sn is unusual. disentanglingthese possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey snia cosmology.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1307.3556	herschel reveals the obscured star formation in hizels h\alpha\ emitters  at z=1.47	we describe the far-infrared (fir; rest-frame 8--1000\mu m) properties of asample of 443 h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the cosmos and udsfields detected by the hizels imaging survey. sources are identified usingnarrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformlyselect h\alpha\ (and [oii] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice atz = 1.47+/-0.02. we use a stacking approach in spitzer, herschel (from pep andhermes surveys) and aztec images to describe their typical fir properties. wefind that hizels galaxies with observed h\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}lo have bolometric fir luminosities of typical lirgs, l_fir ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}lo. combining the h\alpha\ and fir luminosities, we derive median sfr = 32+/-5mo/yr and h\alpha\ extinctions of a(h\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. perhapssurprisingly, little difference is seen in typical hizels extinction levelscompared to local star-forming galaxies. we confirm previous empirical stellarmass (m*) to a(h\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =1.47. for hizels galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the sfras a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. we find that theobserved h\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant sfr tracer when (u-z)_rest ~&lt; 0.9mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry &gt; 22 mag (vega) or when m* &lt; 10^9.7 mo. we donot find any correlation between the [oii]/h\alpha\ and fir luminosity,suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of themost obscured star-forming regions. the luminosity-limited hizels sample tendsto lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,especially at low m*. this work suggests that obscured star formation is linkedto the assembly of m*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxiesproviding dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

0801.4968	type ia supernovae rates and galaxy clustering from the cfht supernova  legacy survey	the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey (snls) has createda large homogeneous database of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0) type iasupernovae (sne ia). the snls team has shown that correlations exist between snia rates, properties, and host galaxy star formation rates. the snls sn iadatabase has now been combined with a photometric redshift galaxy catalog andan optical galaxy cluster catalog to investigate the possible influence ofgalaxy clustering on the sn ia rate, over and above the expected effect due tothe dependence of sfr on clustering through the morphology-density relation. weidentify three cluster sne ia, plus three additional possible cluster sne ia,and find the sn ia rate per unit mass in clusters at intermediate redshifts isconsistent with the rate per unit mass in field early-type galaxies and the snia cluster rate from low redshift cluster targeted surveys. we also find thenumber of sne ia in cluster environments to be within a factor of two ofexpectations from the two component snia rate model.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1311.5758	hermes: clusters of dusty galaxies uncovered by herschel and planck	the potential for planck to detect clusters of dusty, star-forming galaxiesat z greater than 1 is tested by examining the herschel-spire images of planckearly release compact source catalog (ercsc) sources lying in fields observedby the hermes survey. of the 16 planck sources that lie in the roughly 90 sq.deg. examined, we find that twelve are associated with single bright herschelsources. the remaining four are associated with overdensities of herschelsources, making them candidate clusters of dusty, starforming galaxies. we usecomplementary optical and nir data for these clumps to test this idea, and findevidence for the presence of galaxy clusters in all four cases. we usephotometric redshifts and red sequence galaxies to estimate the redshifts ofthese clusters, finding that they range from 0.8 to 2.3. these redshifts implythat the herschel sources in these clusters, which contribute to the detectedplanck flux, are forming stars very rapidly, with typical total cluster starformation rates greater than 1000msun per yr. the high redshift clustersdiscovered in these observations are used to constrain the epoch of clustergalaxy formation, finding that the galaxies in our clusters are 1 to 1.5 gy oldat z about 1 to 2. prospects for the discovery of further clusters of dustygalaxies are discussed, using not only all sky planck surveys, but also deeper,smaller area, herschel surveys.

1312.0950	disentangling a group of lensed submm galaxies at z~2.9	ms$\,$0451.6$-$0305 is a rich galaxy cluster whose strong lensing isparticularly prominent at submm wavelengths. we combine new scuba-2 data withimaging from herschel spire and pacs and hst in order to try to understand thenature of the sources being lensed. in the region of the "giant submm arc," weuncover seven multiply imaged galaxies (up from the previously known three), ofwhich six are found to be at a redshift of $z\sim2.9$, and possibly constitutean interacting system. using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able tosimultaneously deblend and fit seds to the individual galaxies that contributeto the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far infraredluminosities and star formation rates. the submm arc first identified by scubacan now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of thesewithin the galaxy group at $z\sim2.9$. the total unlensed luminosity for thisgalaxy group is $(3.1\pm0.3) \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{l}_\odot$, which gives anunlensed star formation rate of $(450\pm50)$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. from theproperties of this system, we see no evidence of evolution towards lowertemperatures in the dust temperature versus far-infrared luminosity relationfor high redshift galaxies.

1312.4963	constraining the lyman alpha escape fraction with far-infrared  observations of lyman alpha emitters	we study the far-infrared properties of 498 lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5 in the extended chandra deep field-south, using 250, 350 and500 micron data from the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes)and 870 micron data from the laboca ecdfs submillimeter survey (less). none ofthe 126, 280 or 92 laes at z=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5, respectively, are individuallydetected in the far-infrared data. we use stacking to probe the averageemission to deeper flux limits, reaching $1\sigma$ depths of ~0.1 to 0.4 mjy.the laes are also undetected at $\ge3\sigma$ in the stacks, although a$2.5\sigma$ signal is observed at 870 micron for the z=2.8 sources. we considera wide range of far-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds), including am82 and an sd galaxy template, to determine upper limits on the far-infraredluminosities and far-infrared-derived star-formation rates of the laes. thesestar-formation rates are then combined with those inferred from the ly$\alpha$and uv emission to determine lower limits on the laes ly$\alpha$ escapefraction ($f_{\rm esc}($ly$\alpha$)). for the sd sed template, the inferredlaes $f_{\rm esc}($ly$\alpha$) are $\gtrsim30%$ ($1\sigma$) at z=2.8, 3.1 and4.5, which are all significantly higher than the global $f_{\rmesc}($ly$\alpha$) at these redshifts. thus, if the laes $f_{\rmesc}($ly$\alpha$) follows the global evolution then they have warmerfar-infrared seds than the sd galaxy template. the average and m82 seds producelower limits on the lae $f_{\rm esc}($ly$\alpha$) of ~10 to 20% ($1\sigma$),all of which are slightly higher than the global evolution of $f_{\rmesc}($ly$\alpha$) but consistent with it at the 2 to 3$\sigma$ level.

1401.4064	improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the sdss-ii  and snls supernova samples	we present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type iasupernova (sn ia) observations obtained by the sdss-ii and snls collaborations.the data set includes several low-redshift samples (z&lt;0.1), all 3 seasons fromthe sdss-ii (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.4), and 3 years from snls (0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1) and totals\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with high quality lightcurves. we have followed the methods and assumptions of the snls 3-year dataanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition ofthe full sdss-ii spectroscopically-confirmed sn ia sample in both the trainingof the salt2 light curve model and in the hubble diagram analysis (\nsdsscsne), 2) inter-calibration of the snls and sdss surveys and reduced systematicuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect tothe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errorsassociated with the salt2 modeling of sn ia light-curves. we producerecalibrated sn ia light-curves and associated distances for the sdss-ii andsnls samples. the large sdss-ii sample provides an effective, independent,low-z anchor for the hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error fromcalibration systematics in the low-z sn sample. for a flat lcdm cosmology wefind omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recentcmb measurement from the planck and wmap experiments. our result is 1.8sigma(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of snls 3-year data.the change is due primarily to improvements in the snls photometriccalibration. when combined with cmb constraints, we measure a constantdark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flatuniverse. adding bao distance measurements gives similar constraints:w=-1.027+-0.055.

1403.0854	first experimental constraints on the disformally coupled galileon model	the galileon model is a modified gravity model that can explain the late-timeaccelerated expansion of the universe. in a previous work, we derivedexperimental constraints on the galileon model with no explicit coupling tomatter and showed that this model agrees with the most recent cosmologicaldata. in the context of braneworld constructions or massive gravity, thegalileon model exhibits a disformal coupling to matter, which we study in thispaper. after comparing our constraints on the uncoupled model with recentstudies, we extend the analysis framework to the disformally coupled galileonmodel and derive the first experimental constraints on that coupling, usingprecise measurements of cosmological distances and the growth rate of cosmicstructures. in the uncoupled case, with updated data, we still observe a lowtension between the constraints set by growth data and those from distances. inthe disformally coupled galileon model, we obtain better agreement with dataand favour a non-zero disformal coupling to matter at the $2.5\sigma$ level.this gives an interesting hint of the possible braneworld origin of galileontheory.

0803.3441	sifto: an empirical method for fitting sne ia light curves	we present sifto, a new empirical method for modeling type ia supernovae (sneia) light curves by manipulating a spectral template. we make use ofhigh-redshift sn observations when training the model, allowing us to extend itbluer than rest frame u. this increases the utility of our high-redshift snobservations by allowing us to use more of the available data. we find thatwhen the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription,applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description.sifto therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies differentstretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter andthe stretch in the rest-frame b band. we compare sifto to other publishedlight-curve models by applying them to the same set of sn photometry, anddemonstrate that sifto and salt2 perform better than the alternatives whenjudged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. wefurther demonstrate that when sifto and salt2 are trained on the same data setthe cosmological results agree.

1410.0702	are dusty galaxies blue? insights on uv attenuation from dust-selected  galaxies	galaxies' rest-frame ultraviolet (uv) properties are often used to directlyinfer the degree to which dust obscuration affects the measurement of starformation rates. while much recent work has focused on calibrating dustattenuation in galaxies selected at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths, locallyand at high-$z$, here we investigate attenuation in dusty, star-forminggalaxies (dsfgs) selected at far-infrared wavelengths. by combiningmultiwavelength coverage across 0.15--500\,$\mu$m in the cosmos field, inparticular making use of {\it herschel} imaging, and a rich dataset on localgalaxies, we find a empirical variation in the relationship between rest-frameuv slope ($\beta$) and ratio of infrared-to-ultraviolet emission ($l_{\rmir}/l_{\rm uv}\equiv\,irx$) as a function of infrared luminosity, or total starformation rate, sfr. both locally and at high-$z$, galaxies abovesfr$\gt$50\,m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ deviate from the nominal $irx-\beta$ relationtowards bluer colors by a factor proportional to their increasing irluminosity. we also estimate contamination rates of dsfgs on high-$z$ dropoutsearches of $\ll1$\%\ at $z\lt4-10$, providing independent verification thatcontamination from very dusty foreground galaxies is low in lbg searches.overall, our results are consistent with the physical interpretation thatdsfgs, e.g. galaxies with $&gt;50$\,m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, are dominated at allepochs by short-lived, extreme burst events, producing many young o and b starsthat are primarily, yet not entirely, enshrouded in thick dust cocoons. theblue rest-frame uv slopes of dsfgs are inconsistent with the suggestion thatmost dsfgs at $z\sim2$ exhibit steady-state star formation in secular disks.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0104382	timescale stretch parameterization of type ia supernova b-band light  curves	r-band intensity measurements along the light curve of type ia supernovaediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) are fitted in brightness totemplates allowing a free parameter the time-axis width factor w = s(1+z). thedata points are then individually aligned in the time-axis, normalized andk-corrected back to the rest frame, after which the nearly 1300 normalizedintensity measurements are found to lie on a well-determined common rest-frameb-band curve which we call the ``composite curve''. the same procedure isapplied to 18 low-redshift calan/tololo sne with z &lt; 0.11; these nearly 300b-band photometry points are found to lie on the composite curve equally well.the scp search technique produces several measurements before maximum light foreach supernova. we demonstrate that the linear stretch factor, s, whichparameterizes the light-curve timescale appears independent of z,and appliesequally well to the declining and rising parts of the light curve. in fact, theb-band template that best fits this composite curve fits the individualsupernova photometry data when stretched by a factor s with chi^2/dof approx =1, thus as well as any parameterization can, given the current data sets. themeasurement of the date of explosion, however, is model dependent and nottightly constrained by the current data.  we also demonstrate the 1+z light-curve time-axis broadening expected fromcosmological expansion. this argues strongly against alternative explanations,such as tired light, for the redshift of distant objects.

astro-ph;0207409	the type ia supernova 1999aw: a probable 1999aa-like event in a  low-luminosity host galaxy	sn 1999aw was discovered during the first campaign of the nearby galaxiessupernova search (ngss) project. this luminous, slow-declining (delta m_{15}(b) = 0.81 \pm 0.03) type ia supernova was noteworthy in at least two respects.first, it occurred in an extremely low luminosity host galaxy that was notvisible in the template images, nor in initial subsequent deep imaging.secondly, the photometric and spectral properties of this supernova indicatethat it very likely was similar to the subclass of type ia supernovae whoseprototype is sn 1999aa. this paper presents the bvri and j_{s} hk_{s}lightcurves of sn 1999aw (through 100 days past maximum light), as well asseveral epochs of optical spectra. from these data we calculate the bolometriclight curve, and give estimates of the luminosity at maximum light and theinitial ^{56}ni mass. in addition, we present deep bvi images obtained recentlywith the baade 6.5-meter telescope at las campanas observatory which reveal theremarkably low-luminosity host galaxy.

astro-ph;0211444	the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae as a function of host galaxy  morphology	(abridged) we present new results on the hubble diagram of distant type iasupernovae (sne ia) segregated according to the type of host galaxy. this makesit possible to check earlier evidence for a cosmological constant by explicitlycomparing sne residing in galaxies likely to contain negligible dust with thelarger sample. the cosmological parameters derived from these sne ia hosted bypresumed dust-free early-type galaxies supports earlier claims for acosmological constant, which we demonstrate at 5 sigma significance, and theinternal extinction implied is small even for late-type systems (a_b&lt;0.2).thus, our data demonstrate that host galaxy extinction is unlikely tosystematically dim distant sne ia in a manner that would produce a spuriouscosmological constant. we classify the host galaxies of 39 distant snediscovered by the supernova cosmology project (scp) using the combination ofhst stis imaging, keck esi spectroscopy and ground-based broad-band photometry.we compare with a low-redshift sample of 25 sne ia. the scatter observed in thesne ia hubble diagrams correlates closely with host galaxy morphology. we findthe scatter in the sne ia hubble diagram is smallest for sne occurring inearly-type hosts and largest for those occurring in late-type galaxies.moreover, sne residing in early-type hosts appear only ~0.14+/-0.09 magbrighter in their light-curve-width-corrected luminosity than those inlate-type hosts, implying only a modest amount of dust extinction even in thelate-type systems.

astro-ph;0309368	new constraints on $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from an  independent set of eleven high-redshift supernovae observed with hst	we report measurements of $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from elevensupernovae at z=0.36-0.86 with high-quality lightcurves measured using wfpc-2on the hst. this is an independent set of high-redshift supernovae thatconfirms previous supernova evidence for an accelerating universe. combinedwith earlier supernova cosmology project data, the new supernovae yield aflat-universe measurement of the mass density $\omega_m=0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$(statistical) $\pm0.04$ (identified systematics), or equivalently, acosmological constant of $\omega_\lambda=0.75^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ (statistical)$\pm0.04$ (identified systematics). when the supernova results are combinedwith independent flat-universe measurements of $\omega_m$ from cmb and galaxyredshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of$w=-1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ (statistical) $\pm0.09$ (identified systematic), if wis assumed to be constant in time. the new data offer greatly improved colormeasurements of the high-redshift supernovae, and hence improved host-galaxyextinction estimates. these extinction measurements show no anomalous negativee(b-v) at high redshift. the precision of the measurements is such that it ispossible to perform a host-galaxy extinction correction directly for individualsupernovae without any assumptions or priors on the parent e(b-v) distribution.our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that darkenergy is required with $p(\omega_\lambda&gt;0)&gt;0.99$, a result consistent withprevious and current supernova analyses which rely upon the identification of alow-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinctiondistribution.

astro-ph;0507288	spectroscopic observations and analysis of the unusual type ia sn 1999ac	we present optical spectra of the peculiar type ia supernova (sn ia) 1999ac.the data extend from -15 to +42 days with respect to b-band maximum and revealan event that is unusual in several respects. prior to b-band maximum, thespectra resemble those of sn 1999aa, a slowly declining event, but possessstronger siii and caii signatures (more characteristic of a spectroscopicallynormal sn). spectra after b-band maximum appear more normal. the expansionvelocities inferred from the iron lines appear to be lower than average;whereas, the expansion velocity inferred from calcium h and k are higher thanaverage. the expansion velocities inferred from siii are among the slowest everobserved, though sn 1999ac is not particularly dim. the analysis of theparameters v_10, r(siii), dv(siii)/dt, and d_m15 further underlines the uniquecharacteristics of sn 1999ac. we find convincing evidence of cii 6580 in theday -15 spectrum with ejection velocity v &gt; 16,000 km/s, but this signaturedisappears by day -9. this rapid evolution at early times highlights theimportance of extremely early-time spectroscopy.

astro-ph;0510857	photometric selection of high-redshift type ia supernovae	we present a method for selecting high-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia)located via rolling sn searches. the technique, using both color and magnitudeinformation of events from only 2-3 epochs of multi-band real-time photometry,is able to discriminate between sne ia and core collapse sne. furthermore, forthe sne ia, the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase and light-curveparameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. wedemonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of sne iaand core-collapse sne, where the selection method effectively rejects mostcore-collapse sne while retaining sne ia. we also apply the selection code toreal-time data acquired as part of the canada-france-hawaii telescope supernovalegacy survey (snls). during the period may 2004 to january 2005 in the snls,440 sn candidates were discovered of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopicallyas sne ia and 15 as core-collapse events. for this test dataset, the selectiontechnique correctly identifies 100% of the identified sne ii as non-sne ia withonly a 1-2% false rejection rate. the predicted parameterization of the sne iahas a precision of |delta_z|/(1+z_spec)&lt;0.09 in redshift, and +/- 2-3rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planningspectroscopic follow-up observations. we also investigate any bias introducedby this selection method on the ability of surveys such as snls to measurecosmological parameters (e.g., w and omega matter), and find any effect to benegligible.

astro-ph;0602411	measurement of \omega_m, \omega_{\lambda} from a blind analysis of type  ia supernovae with cmagic: using color information to verify the acceleration  of the universe	we present measurements of \omega_m and \omega_{\lambda} from a blindanalysis of 21 high-redshift supernovae using a new technique (cmagic) forfitting the multi-color lightcurves of type ia supernovae, first introduced inwang et al. (2003). cmagic takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior oftype ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages overcurrent techniques based on maximum magnitudes. among these are a reducedsensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-widthrelation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. this allows usto provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite thefact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for cmagic.we describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed toprevent experimenter bias. the data are broadly consistent with the picture ofan accelerating universe, and agree with a flat universe within 1.7\sigma,including systematics. we also compare the cmagic results directly with thoseof a maximum magnitude fit to the same sne, finding that cmagic favors moreacceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlationbetween the two measurements. a fit for w assuming a flat universe yields avalue which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2\sigma.

astro-ph;0605455	rates and properties of type ia supernovae as a function of mass and  star-formation in their host galaxies	(abridged) we show that type ia supernovae (sne ia) are formed within bothvery young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on thestellar mass and mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of their host galaxies.models where the sn ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass areruled out with 99% confidence. our analysis is based on 100spectroscopically-confirmed sne ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,all from the supernova legacy survey (snls) and distributed over 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.75.using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and sfrs for the sn iahost galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions withthe galaxy spectral synthesis code, pegase.2. we show that the sn ia rate perunit mass is proportional to the specific sfr of the parent galaxies -- morevigorously star-forming galaxies host more sne ia per unit stellar mass,broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing sn ia rate in later-type galaxiesseen in the local universe. following earlier suggestions for a simple"two-component" model approximating the sn ia rate, we find bivariate lineardependencies of the sn ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean sfrs ofthe host systems. we also demonstrate a dependence of distant sn ia light-curveshapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observedlocally. passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially hostfaster-declining/dimmer sne ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are onlyfound in systems with ongoing star-formation. we model the light-curve widthdistribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and anold component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0703529	k-corrections and spectral templates of type ia supernovae	with the advent of large dedicated type ia supernova (sn ia) surveys,k-corrections of sne ia and their uncertainties have become especiallyimportant in the determination of cosmological parameters. while k-correctionsare largely driven by sn ia broad-band colors, it is shown here that thediversity in spectral features of sne ia can also be important. for anindividual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity inspectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filtersare aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters aremisaligned). to minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed sn iaspectral energy distribution (sed), we outline a prescription for deriving amean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneoussample of observed spectra. we then remove the effects of broad-band colors andmeasure the remaining uncertainties in the k-corrections associated with thediversity in spectral features. finally, we present a template spectroscopicsequence near maximum light for further improvement on the k-correctionestimate. a library of ~600 observed spectra of ~100 sne ia from heterogeneoussources is used for the analysis.

0810.0031	the effect of progenitor age and metallicity on luminosity and 56ni  yield in type ia supernovae	timmes, brown &amp; truran found that metallicity variations could theoreticallyaccount for a 25% variation in the mass of 56ni synthesized in type iasupernovae (sne ia), and thus account for a large fraction of the scatter inobserved sn ia luminosities. higher-metallicity progenitors are moreneutron-rich, producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive56ni. we develop a new method for estimating bolometric luminosity and 56niyield in sne ia and use it to test the theory with data from the supernovalegacy survey. we find that the average 56ni yield does drop in sne ia fromhigh metallicity environments, but the theory can only account for 7%--10% ofthe dispersion in sn ia 56ni mass, and thus luminosity. this is because theeffect is dominant at metallicities significantly above solar, whereas we findthat sn hosts have predominantly subsolar or only moderately above-solarmetallicities. we also show that allowing for changes in o/fe with themetallicity [fe/h] does not have a major effect on the theoretical predictionof timmes, brown &amp; truran, so long as one is using the o/h as the independentvariable. age may have a greater effect than metallicity -- we find that theluminosity weighted age of the host galaxy is correlated with 56ni yield, andthus more massive progenitors give rise to more luminous explosions. this ishard to understand if most sne ia explode when the primaries reach thechandrasekhar mass. finally, we test the findings of gallagher et al., that theresiduals of sne ia from the hubble diagram are correlated with host galaxymetallicity, and we find no such correlation.
