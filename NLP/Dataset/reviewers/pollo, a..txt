0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0911.5598	star forming galaxies in the akari deep field south: identifications and  seds	to investigate the nature and properties of far-infrared (fir) sources fromthe akari deep field south (adf-s), we performed an extensive search for thecounterparts of 1000 adf-s objects brighter than 0.0301 jy in the wide-s (90$\mu$m) akari band in the public databases (ned and simbad). we analyzed theproperties of the resulting sample: statistic of the identified objects, numbercounts, redshift distribution and morphological types. we also made a crudeanalysis of the clustering properties of the sources and constructed spectralenergy distributions (seds) of 47 selected objects with the best photometry.among 1000 investigated adf-s sources, 545 were identified at otherwavelengths. from them, 518 are known galaxies, and 343 of them were not knownpreviously as infra-red sources. we found redshifts of 48 extragalactic objectsand morphological types of 77 galaxies. we conclude that the bright fir pointsources observed in the adf-s are mostly nearby galaxies.their properties arevery similar to properties of the local population of optically brightgalaxies, except an unusually high ratio of peculiar or interacting objects anda smaller percentage of elliptical galaxies. the percentage of lenticulargalaxies is the same as in the optically bright population which suggests theymay frequently contain a significant amount of cool dust. it is possible thatsource confusion plays a significant role in more than 34% of measurements. theseds display a variety of galaxy types, from very actively star forming to veryquiescent. thanks to the akari long wavelength bands it was revealed for thefirst time that these galaxies form a population of objects with very cooldust.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1002.3674	detection of the cosmic far-infrared background in the akari deep field  south	we report the detection and measurement of the absolute brightness andspatial fluctuations of the cosmic infrared background (cib) with the akarisatellite. we have carried out observations at 65, 90, 140 and 160 um as acosmological survey in akari deep field south (adf-s), which is one of thelowest cirrus regions with contiguous area on the sky. after removing brightgalaxies and subtracting zodiacal and galactic foregrounds from the measuredsky brightness, we have successfully measured the cib brightness and itsfluctuations across a wide range of angular scales from arcminutes to degrees.the measured cib brightness is consistent with previous results reported fromcobe data but significantly higher than the lower limits at 70 and 160 umobtained with the spitzer satellite from the stacking analysis of 24-umselected sources. the discrepancy with the spitzer result is possibly due to anew galaxy population at high redshift obscured by hot dust. from powerspectrum analysis at 90 um, three components are identified: shot noise due toindividual galaxies; galactic cirrus emission dominating at the largest angularscales of a few degrees; and an additional component at an intermediate angularscale of 10-30 arcminutes, possibly due to galaxy clustering. the spectralshape of the clustering component at 90 um is very similar to that at longerwavelengths as observed by spitzer and blast. moreover, the color of thefluctuations indicates that the clustering component is as red asultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at high redshift, these galaxies arenot likely to be the majority of the cib emission at 90 um, but responsible forthe clustering component. our results provide new constraints on the evolutionand clustering properties of distant infrared galaxies.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

1205.1517	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model. ii. the colour-density relation up to z=1.5	[abridged] we perform on galaxy mock catalogues the same colour-densityanalysis made by cucciati et al. (2006) on a 5 mpc/h scale using the vvds-deepsurvey, and compare the results from mocks with observed data. we use mockswith the same flux limits (i=24) as the vvds (cmocks), built using the semi-analytic model by de lucia &amp; blaizot (2007) applied to the millenniumsimulation. from cmocks, we extracted samples of galaxies mimicking the vvdsobservational strategy (omocks). we computed the b-band luminosity function lfand the colour-density relation (cdr) in the mocks. we find that the lf inmocks roughly agrees with the observed lf, but at z&lt;0.8 the faint-end slope ofthe model lf is steeper than the vvds one. computing the lf for early and latetype galaxies, we show that mocks have an excess of faint early-type and ofbright late-type galaxies with respect to data. we find that the cdr in omocksis in excellent agreement with the one in cmocks. at z~0.7, the cdr in mocksagrees with the vvds one (red galaxies reside mainly in high densities). yet,the strength of the cdr in mocks does not vary within 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5, while theobserved relation flattens with increasing z and possibly inverts at z=1.3. weargue that the lack of evolution in the cdr in mocks is not due only toinaccurate prescriptions for satellite galaxies, but that also the treatment ofcentral galaxies has to be revised. the reversal of the cdr can be explained bywet mergers between young galaxies, producing a starburst event. this should beseen on group scales. a residual of this is found in observations at z=1.5 onlarger scales, but not in the mocks, suggesting that the treatment of physicalprocesses affecting satellites and central galaxies in models should berevised.

1210.2649	clustering of far-infrared galaxies in the akari all-sky survey	we present the first measurement of the angular two-point correlationfunction for akari 90-$\mu$m point sources, detected outside of the milky wayplane and other regions characterized by high galactic extinction, andcategorized as extragalactic sources according to our far-infrared-color basedcriterion (pollo et al. 2010). this is the first measurement of the large-scaleangular clustering of galaxies selected in the far-infrared after irasmeasurements. although a full description of clustering properties of thesegalaxies will be obtained by more detailed studies, using either spatialcorrelation function, or better information about properties and at leastphotometric redshifts of these galaxies, the angular correlation functionremains the first diagnostics to establish the clustering properties of thecatalog and observed galaxy population. we find a non-zero clustering signal inboth hemispheres extending up to $\sim 40$ degrees, without any significantfluctuations at larger scales. the observed correlation function is well fittedby a power law function. the notable differences between a northern andsouthern hemisphere are found, which can be probably attributed to thephotometry problems and point out to a necessity of performing a bettercalibration in the data from southern hemisphere.

1303.2621	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). a support  vector machine classification of galaxies, stars and agns	the aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive method for classifyingsources in large sky surveys and we apply the techniques to the vimos publicextragalactic redshift survey (vipers). using the optical (u*, g', r', i') andnir data (z', ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, foridentifying stars, agns and galaxies improving the purity of the vipers sample.support vector machine (svm) supervised learning algorithms allow the automaticclassification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensionalparameter space. in this work, we tailored the svm for classifying stars, agnsand galaxies, and applied this classification to the vipers data. we train thesvm using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the vipers and vvds surveys.we tested two svm classifiers and concluded that including nir data cansignificantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. the self-check of thebest optical + nir classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification ofgalaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for agns in the 5-dimensional colour space. inthe test on vipers sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier givesan accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for agns. themethod was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify theirclassification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4900 objects. we conclude that the svm algorithm trained on a carefully selectedsample of galaxies, agns, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selectionmethods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification methodparticularly suitable for modern large surveys.

1310.3380	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): $\omega_{\rm  m_0}$ from the galaxy clustering ratio measured at $z \sim 1$	we use a sample of about 22,000 galaxies at $0.65&lt;z&lt;1.2$ from the viperspdr-1 catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement ofthe galaxy {\it clustering ratio} $\eta_{g,r}$. this statistic has favourableproperties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing thesmoothed density field in spheres of given radius $r$: the value of itscorrelation function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nr)$, and its variance$\sigma^2(r)$. for sufficiently large values of $r$, this is a universalnumber, capturing 2-point clustering information independently of the linearbias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. inthis paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,r}$to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selectioneffects which are typical of redshift surveys as vipers. we verify the accuracyand efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the surveyselection process. these results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,r}$ tonon-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its verydefinition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected.  we measure $\omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. in addition to the greatprecision achieved on our estimation of $\omega_m$ using vipers pdr-1, thisresult is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recentestimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained applying the same technique to the sdss-lrgcatalogue. it, therefore, suports the robustness of the present analysis.moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and othercosmological probes such as baos, cmb and supernovae.

1312.0765	properties of star forming galaxies in akari deep field-south	the main aim of this work is the characterization of physical properties ofgalaxies detected in the far infrared (fir) in the akari deep field-south(adf-s) survey. starting from a catalog of the 1 000 brightest adf-s sources inthe wide-s (90$\mu$m) akari band, we constructed a subsample of galaxies withspectral coverage from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. we then analyzedthe multiwavelength properties of this 90$\mu$m selected sample of galaxies.for galaxies without known spectroscopic redshifts we computed photometricredshifts using the codes photometric analysis for redshift estimate (le phare)and code investigating galaxy emission (cigale), tested these photometricredshifts using spectroscopic redshifts, and compared the performances of bothcodes. to test the reliability of parameters obtained by fitting spectralenergy distributions, a mock cataloge was generated. we built a largemultiwavelength catalog of more than 500 adf-s galaxies. we successfully fittedspectral energy distributions of 186 galaxies with $\rm{\chi^2_{min}&lt;4}$, andanalyzed the output parameters of the fits. we conclude that our sampleconsists mostly of nearby actively star-forming galaxies, and all our galaxieshave a relatively high metallicity. we estimated photometric redshifts for 113galaxies from the whole adf-s sample. comparing the performance of le phare andcigale, we found that cigale gives more reliable redshift estimates for ourgalaxies, which implies that including the ir photometry allows for substantialimprovement of photometric redshift estimation.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1401.3745	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). never mind the  gaps: comparing techniques to restore homogeneous sky coverage	[abridged] non-uniform sampling and gaps in sky coverage are common in galaxyredshift surveys, but these effects can degrade galaxy counts-in-cells anddensity estimates. we carry out a comparison of methods that aim to fill thegaps to correct for the systematic effects. our study is motivated by theanalysis of the vimos extragalactic redshift survey (vipers), a flux-limitedsurvey (i&lt;22.5) based on one-pass observations with vimos, with gaps covering25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%. our findings areapplicable to other surveys with similar observing strategies. we compare 1)two algorithms based on photometric redshift, that assign redshifts to galaxiesbased on the spectroscopic redshifts of the nearest neighbours, 2) two bayesianmethods, the wiener filter and the poisson-lognormal filter. using galaxy mockcatalogues we quantify the accuracy of the counts-in-cells measurements onscales of r=5 and 8 mpc/h after applying each of these methods. we also studyhow they perform to account for spectroscopic redshift error and inhomogeneousand sparse sampling rate. we find that in vipers the errors in counts-in-cellsmeasurements on r&lt;10 mpc/h scales are dominated by the sparseness of thesample. all methods underpredict by 20-35% the counts at high densities. thissystematic bias is of the same order as random errors. no method outperformsthe others. random and systematic errors decrease for larger cells. we showthat it is possible to separate the lowest and highest densities on scales of 5mpc/h at redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1, over a large volume such as in vipers survey.this is vital for the characterisation of cosmic variance and rare populations(e.g, brightest galaxies) in environmental studies at these redshifts.

1401.6137	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): a quiescent  formation of massive red-sequence galaxies over the past 9 gyr	we explore the evolution of the colour-magnitude relation (cmr) andluminosity function (lf) at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.3 from the vimos public extragalacticredshift survey (vipers) using ~45,000 galaxies with precise spectroscopicredshifts down to i'_ab&lt;22.5 over ~10.32 deg^2 in two fields. from z=0.5 toz=1.3 the lf and cmr are well defined for different galaxy populations andm^*_b evolves by ~1.04(1.09)+/-0.06(0.10) mag for the total (red) galaxysample. we compare different criteria for selecting early-type galaxies (etgs):(1) fixed cut in rest-frame (u-v) colours, (2) evolving cut in (u-v) colours,(3) rest-frame (nuv-r')-(r'-k) colour selection, and (4) sed classification.regardless of the method we measure a consistent evolution of the red-sequence(rs). between 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.3 we find a moderate evolution of the rs intercept ofdelta(u-v)=0.28+/-0.14 mag, favouring exponentially declining star formation(sf) histories with sf truncation at 1.7&lt;=z&lt;=2.3. together with the rise in theetg number density by 0.64 dex since z=1, this suggests a rapid build-up ofmassive galaxies (m&gt;10^11 m_sun) and expeditious rs formation over a shortperiod of ~1.5 gyr starting before z=1. this is supported by the detection ofongoing sf in etgs at 0.9&lt;z&lt;1.0, in contrast with the quiescent red stellarpopulations of etgs at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.6. there is an increase in the observed cmrscatter with redshift, two times larger than in galaxy clusters and at variancewith theoretical models. we discuss possible physical mechanisms that supportthe observed evolution of the red galaxy population. our findings point outthat massive galaxies have experienced a sharp sf quenching at z~1 with onlylimited additional merging. in contrast, less-massive galaxies experience a mixof sf truncation and minor mergers which build-up the low- andintermediate-mass end of the cmr.

1411.5688	the evolution of clustering length, large-scale bias and host halo mass  at 2&lt;z&lt;5 in the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds)	we investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in theredshift range 2.0&lt;$z$&lt;5.0 using the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds). we presentthe projected (real-space) two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ measuredby using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independentfields (cosmos and vvds-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. we quantify how thescale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use ofmock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. using apower-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$ we find that the correlationfunction for the general population is best fit by a model with a clusteringlength $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$mpc and slope$\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$ at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$mpc and$\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5. we use these clustering parametersto derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_l^{pl}$, between galaxies anddark matter. we find $b_l^{pl}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming$\sigma_8$ = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and lowredshifts. we fit an hod model to the data and we obtain that the average halomass at redshift $z$~3 is $m_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$ h$^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. fromthis fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively highat $b_l^{hod}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. comparing these measurements with similarmeasurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population ofgalaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($m_r$&lt;-21.5)galaxy population which typically occupy haloes of mass $\langle m_h\rangle$ =10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $m_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.

1412.5584	the stellar mass - halo mass relation from galaxy clustering in vuds: a  high star formation efficiency at z~3	the relation between the galaxy stellar mass m_star and the dark matter halomass m_h gives important information on the efficiency in forming stars andassembling stellar mass in galaxies. we present the stellar mass to halo massratio (smhr) measurements at redshifts 2&lt;z&lt;5, obtained from the vimos ultradeep survey. we use halo occupation distribution (hod) modelling of clusteringmeasurements on ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the darkmatter halo mass m_h, and sed fitting over a large set of multi-wavelength datato derive the stellar mass m_star and compute the smhr=m_star/m_h. we find thatthe smhr ranges from 1% to 2.5% for galaxies with m_star=1.3x10^9 m_sun tom_star=7.4x10^9 m_sun in dm halos with m_h=1.3x10^{11} m_sun} to m_h=3x10^{11}m_sun. we derive the integrated star formation efficiency (isfe) of thesegalaxies and find that the star formation efficiency is a moderate 6-9% forlower mass galaxies while it is relatively high at 16% for galaxies with themedian stellar mass of the sample ~7x10^9 m_sun. the lower isfe at lower massesmay indicate that some efficient means of suppressing star formation is at work(like sne feedback), while the high isfe for the average galaxy at z~3 isindicating that these galaxies are efficiently building-up their stellar massat a key epoch in the mass assembly process. we further infer that the averagemass galaxy at z~3 will start experiencing star formation quenching within afew hundred millions years.

1505.03017	beyond the current noise limit in imaging through turbulent medium	shift-and-add is an approach employed to mitigate the phenomenon ofresolution degradation in images acquired through a turbulent medium. usingthis technique, a large number of consecutive short exposures is registeredbelow the coherence time of the atmosphere or other blurring medium. theacquired images are shifted to the position of the brightest speckle andstacked together to obtain high-resolution and high signal-to-noise frame. inthis paper we present a highly efficient method for determination of framesshifts, even if in a single frame the object cannot be distinguished from thebackground noise. the technique utilizes our custom genetic algorithm, whichiteratively evolves a set of image shifts. we used the maximal energy ofstacked images as an objective function for shifts estimation and validate theefficiency of the method on simulated and real images of simple and complexsources. obtained results confirmed, that our proposed method allows for therecovery of spatial distribution of objects even only 2% brighter than theirbackground. the presented approach extends significantly current limits ofimage reconstruction with the use of shift-and-add method. the applications ofour algorithm include both the optical and the infrared imaging. our method maybe also employed as a digital image stabilizer in extremely low light levelconditions in professional and consumer applications.

1511.01145	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). environmental  effects shaping the galaxy stellar mass function	we exploit the first public data release of vipers to investigateenvironmental effects in galaxy evolution between $z\sim0.5$ and $0.9$. thelarge number of spectroscopic redshifts over an area of about$10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ provides a galaxy sample with high statistical power. theaccurate redshift measurements, with $\sigma_z = 0.00047(1+z_\mathrm{spec})$,allow us to robustly isolate galaxies living in the lowest- and highest-densityenvironments, as defined in terms of spatial 3d density contrast. we estimatethe stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies residing in these two environments,and constrain its high-mass end with unprecedented precision. we find that thegalaxy smf in the densest regions has a different shape than that measured atlow densities, with an enhancement of massive galaxies and a hint of a flatter(less negative) slope at $z&lt;0.8$. we normalise each smf to the comoving volumeoccupied by the corresponding environment, and relate estimates from differentredshift bins. we observe an evolution of the smf of vipers galaxies in highdensities, while the low-density one is nearly constant. we compare theseresults to semi-analytical models and find consistent environmental signatures.we discuss how the halo mass function and fraction of central/satellitegalaxies depend on the environments considered, making intrinsic andenvironmental properties of galaxies physically coupled, and thereforedifficult to disentangle. the evolution of our low-density regions is welldescribed by the formalism introduced by peng et al.~(2010), and is consistentwith the idea that galaxies become progressively passive because of internalphysical processes. the same formalism could also describe the evolution of thesmf in the high density regions, but only if a significant contribution fromdry mergers is considered.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

astro-ph;0303364	the vla-virmos deep field i. radio observations probing the microjy  source population	we have conducted a deep survey (r.m.s noise 17 microjy) with the very largearray (vla) at 1.4 ghz, with a resolution of 6 arcsec, of a 1 square degreeregion included in the virmos vlt deep survey. in the same field we alreadyhave multiband photometry down to i(ab)=25, and spectroscopic observations willbe obtained during the virmos vlt survey. the homogeneous sensitivity over thewhole field has allowed to derive a complete sample of 1054 radio sources (5sigma limit). we give a detailed description of the data reduction and of theanalysis of the radio observations, with particular care to the effects ofclean bias and bandwidth smearing, and of the methods used to obtain thecatalogue of radio sources. to estimate the effect of the resolution bias onour observations we have modelled the effective angular-size distribution ofthe sources in our sample and we have used this distribution to simulate asample of radio sources. finally we present the radio count distribution downto 0.08 mjy derived from the catalogue. our counts are in good agreement withthe best fit derived from earlier surveys, and are about 50 % higher than thecounts in the hdf. the radio count distribution clearly shows, with extremelygood statistics, the change in the slope for the sub-mjy radio sources.

astro-ph;0409134	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution of the galaxy luminosity function  up to z=2 in first epoch data	we investigate the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function from thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) from the present to z=2 in five (u, b, v, r and i)rest-frame band-passes. we use the first epoch vvds deep sample of 11,034spectra selected at 17.5 &lt;= i_{ab} &lt;= 24.0, on which we apply the algorithm forluminosity function (alf), described in this paper. we observe a substantialevolution with redshift of the global luminosity functions in all bands. fromz=0.05 to z=2, we measure a brightening of the characteristic magnitude m*included in the magnitude range 1.8-2.5, 1.7-2.4, 1.2-1.9, 1.1-1.8 and 1.0-1.6in the u, b, v, r and i rest-frame bands, respectively. we confirm thisdifferential evolution of the luminosity function with rest-frame wavelength,from the measurement of the comoving density of bright galaxies (m &lt;m*(z=0.1)). this density increases by a factor of around 2.6, 2.2, 1.8, 1.5,1.5 between z=0.05 and z=1 in the u, b, v, r, i bands, respectively. we alsomeasure a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of the luminosityfunctions, with \delta\alpha ~ -0.3 between z=0.05 and z=1, similar in allbands.

astro-ph;0409135	the vimos vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering to z=2  from first epoch observations	this paper presents the evolution of the clustering of the main population ofgalaxies from z=2.1 to z=0.2, from the first epoch vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), a magnitude limited sample with 17.5&lt;=i_{ab}&lt;=24. we have computed thecorrelation functions \xi(r_p,\pi) and w_p(r_p), and the correlation lengthr_0(z), for the vvds-02h and vvds-cdfs fields, for a total of 7155 galaxies ina 0.61deg^2 area. we find that the correlation length in this sample staysroughly constant from z=0.5 to z=1.1, with r_0(z)=2.5-2.8 h^{-1} mpc(comoving), for galaxies comparable in luminosity to the local 2dfgrs and sdsssamples, indicating that the amplitude of the correlation function was ~2.5xlower at z~1 than observed locally. the correlation length in our lowestredshift bin z=[0.2,0.5] is r_0=2.4 h^{-1} mpc, lower than for any otherpopulation at the same redshift, indicating the low clustering of very lowluminosity galaxies, 1.5 magnitudes fainter than in the 2dfgrs or sdss. thecorrelation length is increasing to r_0~3.0 h^{-1} mpc at higher redshiftsz=[1.3,2.1], as we are observing increasingly brighter galaxies, comparable togalaxies with mb_ab=-20.5 locally. we compare our measurement to the deep2measurements in the range z=[0.7,1.35] \citep{coil} on the population selectedapplying the same magnitude and color selection criteria as in their survey,and find comparable results. the slowly varying clustering of vvds galaxies asredshift increases is markedly different from the predicted evolution of theclustering of dark matter, indicating that bright galaxies are already tracingthe large scale structures emerging from the dark matter distribution 9-10billion years ago, a supporting evidence for a strong evolution of the galaxyvs. dark matter bias.

astro-ph;0409138	the vimos vlt deep survey: computing the two point correlation  statistics and associated uncertainties	we are presenting in this paper a detailed account of the methods used tocompute the three-dimensional two-point galaxy correlation function in thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). we investigate how instrumental selection effectsand observational biases affect the measurements and identify the methods tocorrect them. we quantify the accuracy of our correction method using anensemble of fifty mock galaxy surveys generated with the galics semi-analyticmodel of galaxy formation which incorporate the same selection biases andtiling strategy as the real data does. we demonstrate that we are able torecover the real-space two-point correlation function xi(s) to an accuracybetter than 10% on scales larger than 1 h^{-1} mpc, and of about 30% on scalesbelow 1 h^{-1} mpc, with the sampling strategy used for the first epoch vvdsdata. the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) is recovered with an accuracybetter than 10% on all scales 0.1 &lt;= r &lt;= 10 h^{-1} mpc. there is a tendencyfor a small but systematic under-estimate of the correlation length derivedfrom w_p(r_p) of 6% on average, remaining after our correction process. thelarge number of simulated surveys allows us to provide a reliable estimate ofthe cosmic error on the measurements of the correlation length r_0, of about15-20% for the first epoch vvds observation (le fevre et al.2004,astro-ph/0409133). the error estimation and measurement techniques outlined inthis paper are being used in several studies which investigate in detail theclustering properties of galaxies in the vvds data.

astro-ph;0409248	the vvds data reduction pipeline: introducing vipgi, the vimos  interactive pipeline and graphical interface	the vimos vlt deep survey (vvds), designed to measure 150,000 galaxyredshifts, requires a dedicated data reduction and analysis pipeline to processin a timely fashion the large amount of spectroscopic data being produced. thisrequirement has lead to the development of the vimos interactive pipeline andgraphical interface (vipgi), a new software package designed to simplify to avery high degree the task of reducing astronomical data obtained with vimos,the imaging spectrograph built by the virmos consortium for the europeansouthern observatory, and mounted on unit 3 (melipal) of the very largetelescope (vlt) at paranal observatory (chile). vipgi provides the astronomerwith specially designed vimos data reduction functions, a vimos-centric dataorganizer, and dedicated data browsing and plotting tools, that can be used toverify the quality and accuracy of the various stages of the data reductionprocess. the quality and accuracy of the data reduction pipeline are comparableto those obtained using well known iraf tasks, but the speed of the datareduction process is significantly increased, thanks to the large set ofdedicated features. in this paper we discuss the details of the mos datareduction pipeline implemented in vipgi, as applied to the reduction of some20,000 vvds spectra, assessing quantitatively the accuracy of the variousreduction steps. we also provide a more general overview of vipgi capabilities,a tool that can be used for the reduction of any kind of vimos data.

astro-ph;0506561	the vimos vlt deep survey: evolution of the non-linear galaxy bias up to  z=1.5	we present the first measurements of the probability distribution function(pdf) of galaxy fluctuations in the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) cone, covering0.4x0.4 deg between 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.5. the second moment of the pdf, i.e. the rmsfluctuations of the galaxy density field, is with good approximation constantover the full redshift baseline investigated: we find that, in redshift space,sigma_8 for galaxies brighter than m=-20+5log h has a mean value of 0.94\pm0.07in the redshift interval 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5. the third moment, i.e. the skewness,increases with cosmic time: we find that the probability of having underdenseregions is greater at z~0.7 than it was at z~1.5. by comparing the pdf ofgalaxy density contrasts with the theoretically predicted pdf of massfluctuations we infer the redshift-, density-, and scale-dependence of thebiasing function b(z, \delta, r) between galaxy and matter overdensities up toredshift z=1.5. our results can be summarized as follows: i) the galaxy bias isan increasing function of redshift: evolution is marginal up to z~0.8 and morepronounced for z&gt;0.8; ii) the formation of bright galaxies is inhibited below acharacteristic mass-overdensity threshold whose amplitude increases withredshift and luminosity; iii) the biasing function is non linear in all theredshift bins investigated with non-linear effects of the order of a few to 10%on scales &gt;5mpc.

astro-ph;0506690	the vvds-vla deep field ii. optical and near infrared identifications of  vla s(1.4ghz)&gt;80 microjy sources in the vimos vlt deep survey vvds-02h field	in this paper we present the optical and near-infrared identifications of the1054 radio sources detected in the 20cm deep radio survey down to a 5sigma fluxlimit of about 80 microjy obtained with the vla in the vimos vlt deep surveyvvds-02h deep field. using u,b,v,r,i and k data, we identified 718 radiosources (~74% of the whole sample). the photometric redshift analysis showsthat, in each magnitude bin, the radio sample has a higher median photometricredshift than the whole optical sample, while the median (v-i) color of theradio sources is redder than the median color of the whole optical sample.these results suggest that radio detection is preferentially selecting galaxieswith higher intrinsic optical luminosity. from the analysis of the opticalproperties of the radio sources as function of the radio flux, we found thatwhile about 35% of the radio sources are optically unidentified in the higherradio flux bin (s&gt; 1.0 mjy), the percentage of unidentified sources decreasesto about 25% in the faintest bins (s&lt; 0.5 mjy). the median i magnitude for thetotal sample of radio sources,i.e. including also the unidentified ones, isbrighter in the faintest radio bins than in the bin with higher radio flux.this suggests that most of the faintest radio sources are likely to beassociated to relatively lower radio luminosity objects at relatively modestredshift, rather than radio-powerful, agn type objects at high redshift.

astro-ph;0507668	the virmos deep imaging survey iv: near-infrared observations	in this paper we present a new deep, wide-field near-infrared imaging survey.our j- and k-band observations in four separate fields complement optical bvri,ultraviolet and spectroscopic observations undertaken as part of the vimos-vltdeep survey (vvds). in total, our survey spans ~400arcmis^2. our catalogues arereliable in all fields to at least kvega~20.75 and jvega~21.50 (defined as themagnitude where object contamination is less than 10% and completeness greaterthan 90%). taken together these four fields represents a unique combination ofdepth, wavelength coverage and area. we describe the complete data reductionprocess and outline a comprehensive series of tests carried out to characterisethe reliability of the final catalogues. we compare the statistical propertiesof our catalogues with literature compilations. we find that our j- andk-selected galaxy counts are in good agreement with previously published works,as are our (j-k) versus k colour-magnitude diagrams. stellar number countsextracted from our fields are consistent with a synthetic model of our galaxy.using the location of the stellar locus in colour-magnitude space and themeasured field-to-field variation in galaxy number counts we demonstrate thatthe absolute accuracy of our photometric calibration is at the 5% level orbetter. finally, an investigation of the angular clustering of k- selectedextended sources in our survey displays the expected scaling behaviour withlimiting magnitude, with amplitudes in each magnitude bin in broad agreementwith literature values.

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0512429	the vimos-vlt deep survey: luminosity dependence of clustering at z~1	we investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on the galaxy intrinsicluminosity at high redshift, using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6530 galaxies) and depth (i_{ab}&lt;24) of the surveyallows us to measure the projected two-point correlation function of galaxies,w_p(r_p) for a set of volume-limited samples up to an effective redshift&lt;z&gt;=0.9 and median absolute magnitude -19.6&lt; m_b &lt; -21.3. fitting w_p(r_p) witha single power-law model for the real-space correlation functionxi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-gamma}, we measure the relationship of the correlation lengthr_0 and the slope gamma with the sample median luminosity for the first time atsuch high redshift. values from our lower-redshift samples (0.1&lt;z&lt;0.5) arefully consistent with the trend observed by larger local surveys. in our highredshift sample (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2), we find that the clustering strength is suddenlyrising around m_b^*, apparently with a sharper turn than at low redshifts.galaxies in the faintest sample (&lt;m_b&gt;=-19.6) have a correlation lengthr_0=2.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3} h^{-1} mpc, compared to r_0=5.0^{+1.5}_{-1.6} h^{-1} mpcat &lt;m_b&gt;=-21.3. correspondingly the slope of the correlation function isobserved to steepen significantly from \gamma=1.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1} to\gamma=2.4^{+0.4}_{-0.2}. this is not observed neither by large local surveysnor in our lower-redshift sample and seems to imply a significant change in theway luminous galaxies trace dark-matter halos at z~1 with respect to z~0. atour effective median redshift z~0.9 this corresponds to a strong difference ofthe relative bias, from b/b* &lt; 0.7 for galaxies with l &lt; l*, to b/b*~1.4 forgalaxies with l &gt; l*.

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0606060	the vimos vlt deep survey: the faint type-1 agn sample	we present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (agn) sample extracted from thevimos vlt deep survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 squaredegree. this sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphologicalor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line agn (blagn) spectra withredshift up to 5. our data are divided into a wide (iab &lt; 22.5) and a deep (iab&lt; 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. because of its depthand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the populationof faint type-1 agn. our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 blagn per squaredegree with iab &lt; 24) is significantly higher than that of any other opticallyselected sample of blagn with spectroscopic confirmation. by applying amorphological and color analysis to our agn sample we find that: (1)~23% of theagn brighter than iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentageincreases to ~42% for those with z &lt; 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of ourblagn are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versusg'-r' color-color diagram. this leads us to the conclusion that classicaloptical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes(iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can missmiss up to ~35% of the agn population. finally, we present a composite spectrumof our sample of objects. while the continuum shape is very similar to that ofthe sdss composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda &gt;3000 a. we interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission ofthe host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled byour survey.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0612313	the vimos-vlt deep survey: dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity	we have investigated the dependence of galaxy clustering on their intrinsicluminosities at z ~ 1, using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). we have measured the projected two-point correlation function ofgalaxies, w_p(r_p), for a set of volume-limited samples at an effectiveredshift &lt;z&gt;=0.9 and median absolute magnitude -19.6&lt; m_b &lt; -21.3. we find thatthe clustering strength is rising around m_b^*, apparently with a sharper turnthan observed at low redshifts. the slope of the correlation function isobserved to steepen significantly from \gamma=1.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1} to\gamma=2.4^{+0.4}_{-0.2}. this is due to a significant change in the shape ofw_p(r_p), increasingly deviating from a power-law for the most luminoussamples, with a strong upturn at small (&lt; 1-2 h^{-1} mpc) scales. this trend,not observed locally, also results in a strong scale dependence of the relativebias, b/b* and possibly imply a significant change in the way luminous galaxiestrace dark-matter halos at z ~ 1 with respect to z ~ 0.

astro-ph;0701273	studying the evolution of large-scale structure with the vimos-vlt deep  survey	the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) currently offers a unique combination ofdepth, angular size and number of measured galaxies among surveys of thedistant universe: ~ 11,000 spectra over 0.5 deg2 to i_{ab}=24 (vvds-deep),35,000 spectra over ~ 7 deg2 to i_{ab}=22.5 (vvds-wide). the current ``firstepoch'' data from vvds-deep already allow investigations of galaxy clusteringand its dependence on galaxy properties to be extended to redshifts ~1.2-1.5,in addition to measuring accurately evolution in the properties of galaxies upto z~4. this paper concentrates on the main results obtained so far on galaxyclustering. overall, l* galaxies at z~ 1.5 show a correlation length r_0=3.6\pm0.7. as a consequence, the linear galaxy bias at fixed luminosity rises overthe same range from the value b~1 measured locally, to b=1.5 +/- 0.1. theinterplay of galaxy and structure evolution in producing this observation isdiscussed in some detail. galaxy clustering is found to depend on galaxyluminosity also at z~ 1, but luminous galaxies at this redshift show asignificantly steeper small-scale correlation function than their z=0counterparts. finally, red galaxies remain more clustered than blue galaxiesout to similar redshifts, with a nearly constant relative bias among the twoclasses, b_{rel}~1.4, despite the rather dramatic evolution of thecolor-density relation over the same redshift range.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

0810.2172	eddington ratios of faint agn at intermediate redshift: evidence for a  population of half-starved black holes	we use one of the deepest spectroscopic samples of broad line active galacticnuclei (agn) currently available, extracted from the vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), to compute mgii and civ virial masses estimate of 120 super-massiveblack holes in the redshift range 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.9 and 2.6&lt;z&lt;4.3. we find that themass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low agnluminosities (log l_bol ~ 45). at these luminosities, there is a substantialfraction of black holes accreting far below their eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd&lt; 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for agn of higherluminosities. we speculate that these may be agn on the decaying branch oftheir light-curves, well past their peak activity. this would agree with recenttheoretical predictions of agn evolution.  in the electronic appendix of this paper we publish an update of the vvdstype-1 agn sample, including the first and most of the second epochobservations. this sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

0811.2053	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z~0.9	we derive the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies up to$z\sim0.9$, using data from the vimos vlt deep survey. automatic measurement ofemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the fullspectroscopic sample. this sample is divided into two sub-samples depending onthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;22.5$) and deep$i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;24$). these two samples span two different ranges of stellarmasses. emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxiesand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. for the star-forminggalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phaseoxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to giveconsistent results at low and high redshifts. the stellar masses have beenestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set ofstellar population synthesis models. we assume at first order that the shape ofthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. then we find astronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deepsample. we thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter athigher redshift. the observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation athigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.
