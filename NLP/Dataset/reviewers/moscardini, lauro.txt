0902.4051	x-ray and strong lensing mass estimate of ms2137.3-2353	we present new mass estimates of the galaxy cluster ms2137.3-2353, inferredfrom x-ray and strong lensing analyses. this cluster exhibits an outstandingstrong lensing configuration and indicates a well-relaxed dynamical state,being most suitable for a mass reconstruction which combines both techniques.despite this, several previous studies have claimed a significant discrepancybetween the x-ray and the strong lensing mass estimates. the primary aim ofthis paper is to address and explain this mismatch. for this purpose, we haveanalysed chandra observations to recover the profiles of the intra-clustermedium properties and, assuming a functional form for the matter density, thetotal mass distribution. the notable strong-lensing features of ms2137.3 allowus to reconstruct its projected mass in the central regions with good accuracy,by taking advantage of the lensing inversion code lenstool. we find a goodagreement between our x-ray and strong lensing mass estimates for ms2137,leading to a mean, extrapolated value of m_200 ~ 4.4 +/- 0.3*10^14 m_sun, underthe assumption of the navarro-frenk-white (nfw) density profile. however, thestrong lensing mass estimate is affected by the details of the bcg massmodeling. in particular, we do not find evidence for a high concentration forthe nfw density profile, as reported in some earlier works.

0904.0256	the spatial distribution of x-ray selected agn in the chandra deep  fields: a theoretical perspective	we study the spatial distribution of x-ray selected agn in the framework ofhierarchical co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxiesand dark matter haloes. to this end, we have applied the model developed bycroton et al.(2006), de lucia &amp; blaizot(2007) and marulli et al.(2008) to theoutput of the millennium run and obtained hundreds of realizations of pastlight-cones from which we have extracted realistic mock agn catalogues thatmimic the chandra deep fields. we find that the model agn number counts are infair agreement with observations, except at fluxes &lt;1e-15 erg/cm^2/s. thespatial two-point correlation function predicted by the model is well describedby a power-law relation out to 20 mpc/h, in close agreement with observations.our model matches the correlation length r_0 of agn in the chandra deep fieldnorth but underestimates it in the chandra deep field south. when fixing theslope to gamma = 1.4, as in gilli et al. (2005), the statistical significanceof the mismatch is 2-2.5 sigma, suggesting that the predicted cosmic variance,which dominates the error budget, may not account for the different correlationlength of the agn in the two fields. while our results are robust to changes inthe model prescriptions for the agn lightcurves, the luminosity dependence ofthe clustering is sensitive to the different lightcurve models adopted.however, irrespective of the model considered, the luminosity dependence of theagn clustering in our mock fields seems to be weaker than in the real chandrafields. the significance of this mismatch needs to be confirmed using largerdatasets.

1004.1637	non-gaussian halo assembly bias	the strong dependence of the large-scale dark matter halo bias on the (local)non-gaussianity parameter, f_nl, offers a promising avenue towards constrainingprimordial non-gaussianity with large-scale structure surveys. in this paper,we present the first detection of the dependence of the non-gaussian halo biason halo formation history using n-body simulations. we also present an analyticderivation of the expected signal based on the extended press-schechterformalism. in excellent agreement with our analytic prediction, we find thatthe halo formation history-dependent contribution to the non-gaussian halo bias(which we call non-gaussian halo assembly bias) can be factorized in a formapproximately independent of redshift and halo mass. the correction to thenon-gaussian halo bias due to the halo formation history can be as large as100%, with a suppression of the signal for recently formed halos andenhancement for old halos. this could in principle be a problem for realisticgalaxy surveys if observational selection effects were to pick galaxiesoccupying only recently formed halos. current semi-analytic galaxy formationmodels, for example, imply an enhancement in the expected signal of ~23% and~48% for galaxies at z=1 selected by stellar mass and star formation rate,respectively.

1006.0610	optimal filtering of optical and weak lensing data to search for galaxy  clusters: application to the cosmos field	galaxy clusters are usually detected in blind optical surveys via suitablefiltering methods. we present an optimal matched filter which maximizes theirsignal-to-noise ratio by taking advantage of the knowledge we have of theirintrinsic physical properties and of the data noise properties. in this paperwe restrict our application to galaxy magnitudes, positions and photometricredshifts if available, and we also apply the filter separately to weak lensingdata. the method is suitable to be naturally extended to a multi-band approachwhich could include not only additional optical bands but also observables withdifferent nature such as x-rays. for each detection, the filter provides itssignificance, an estimate for the richness and for the redshift even if photo-zare not given. the provided analytical error estimate is tested againstnumerical simulations. we finally apply our method to the cosmos field andcompare the results with previous cluster detections obtained with differentmethods. our catalogue contains 27 galaxy clusters with minimal threshold at3-sigma level including both optical and weak-lensing information.

1008.0003	the distribution of lyman-limit absorption systems during and after  reionization	lyman-limit absorption systems can play many important roles during and aftercosmological reionization. unfortunately, due to the prohibitively largedynamic range required, it is impossible to self-consistently include thesesystems in cosmological simulations. using fast and versatile semi-numericsimulations, we systematically explore the spatial distribution of absorptionsystems during and following reionization. we self-calibrate the resultingnumber of absorbers to the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing ultravioletbackground (uvb), and present results at a given mfp and neutral hydrogenfraction. we use a simple optical depth criterion to identify the locations ofabsorbers. our approach is fairly robust to uncertainties such as missingsubgrid structure. unlike at lower redshifts where the uvb is relativelyuniform, at higher redshifts the fluctuations in the uvb and the hii morphologyof reionization can drive the large-scale distribution of absorption systems.specifically, we find that absorbers are highly correlated with the densityfield on small scales, and then become anti-correlated with the uvb on largescales. after reionization, the large-scale power spectrum of the absorberstraces the uvb power spectrum, which can be predicted with a simple analyticextension of the halo-model. during reionization, absorbers tend topreferentially lie inside overdensities (i.e. filaments) of therecently-ionized intergalactic medium (igm). absorbers may also dominate thesmall-scale (k &gt; 1/mpc) 21-cm power during and after reionization. conversely,they smooth the contrast on moderate scales. once the hii regions grow tosurpass the mfp, the absorbers add to the large-scale 21-cm power. our resultsshould prove useful in interpreting future observations of the reionizationepoch.

1008.5376	hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters in dark energy  cosmologies: i. general properties	we investigate the influence of dark energy on structure formation, withinfive different cosmological models, namely a concordance $\lambda$cdm model,two models with dynamical dark energy, viewed as a quintessence scalar field(using a rp and a sugra potential form) and two extended quintessence models(eqp and eqn) where the quintessence scalar field interacts non-minimally withgravity (scalar-tensor theories). we adopted for all models the normalizationof the matter power spectrum $\sigma_{8}$ to match the cmb data. in the modelswith dynamical dark energy and quintessence, we describe the equation of statewith $w_0\approx-0.9$, still within the range allowed by observations. for eachmodel, we have performed hydrodynamical simulations in a cosmological box of$(300 \ {\rm{mpc}} \ h^{-1})^{3}$ including baryons and allowing for coolingand star formation. the contemporary presence of evolving dark energy andbaryon physics allows us to investigate the interplay between the differentbackground cosmology and the evolution of the luminous matter. since clusterbaryon fraction can be used to constrain other cosmological parameters such as$\omega_{m}$, we also analyse how dark energy influences the baryon content ofgalaxy clusters. we find that, in models with dynamical dark energy, theevolving cosmological background leads to different star formation rates anddifferent formation histories of galaxy clusters, but the baryon physics is notaffected in a relevant way. we investigate several proxies of the cluster massfunction based on x-ray observables like temperature, luminosity, $m_{gas}$,and $y_{gas}$. we conclude that the x-ray temperature and $m_{gas}$ functionsare better diagnostic to disentangle the growth of structures among differentdark energy models.

1009.5519	expected properties of the two-point autocorrelation function of the igm	recent analyses of the fluctuations of the soft diffuse x-ray background(dxb) have provided indirect detection of a component consistent with theelusive warm hot intergalactic medium (whim). in this work we use theoreticalpredictions obtained from hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the angularcorrelation properties of the whim in emission and assess the possibility ofindirect detection with next-generation x-ray missions. our results indicatethat the angular correlation signal of the whim is generally weak but dominatesthe angular correlation function of the dxb outside virialized regions. itsindirect detection is possible but requires rather long exposure times [0.1-1]ms, large (~1{\deg} x1{\deg}) fields of view and accurate subtraction ofisotropic fore/background contributions, mostly contributed by galacticemission. the angular correlation function of the whim is positive for {\theta}&lt; 5' and provides limited information on its spatial distribution. asatisfactory characterization of the whim in 3d can be obtained throughspatially resolved spectroscopy. 1 ms long exposures with next generationdetectors will allow to detect ~400 o vii+o viii x-ray emission systems that weuse to trace the spatial distribution of the whim. we predict that theseobservations will allow to estimate the whim correlation function with highstatistical significance out to ~10 mpc h^-1 and characterize its dynamicalstate through the analysis of redshift-space distortions. the detectable whim,which is typically associated with the outskirts of virialized regions ratherthan the filaments has a non-zero correlation function with slope {\gamma} =-1.7 \pm 0.1 and correlation length r0 = 4.0 \pm 0.1 mpc h^-1 in the range r =[4.5, 12] mpc h^-1. redshift space distances can be measured to assess thedynamical properties of the gas, typically infalling onto large virializedstructures.

1011.2116	studying the warm-hot intergalactic medium in emission	we assess the possibility to detect the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim)in emission and to characterize its physical conditions and spatialdistribution through spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopy, in the framework ofthe recently proposed dios, edge, xenia, and origin missions, all of which areequipped with microcalorimeter-based detectors. for this purpose we analyze alarge set of mock emission spectra, extracted from a cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulation. these mock x-ray spectra are searched for emissionfeatures showing both the ovii k alpha triplet and oviii ly alpha line, whichconstitute a typical signature of the warm hot gas. our analysis shows that 1ms long exposures and energy resolution of 2.5 ev will allow us to detect about400 such features per deg^2 with a significance &gt;5 sigma and reveals that theseemission systems are typically associated with density ~100 above the mean. thetemperature can be estimated from the line ratio with a precision of ~20%. thecombined effect of contamination from other lines, variation in the level ofthe continuum, and degradation of the energy resolution reduces theseestimates. yet, with an energy resolution of 7 ev and all these effects takeninto account, one still expects about 160 detections per deg^2. these linesystems are sufficient to trace the spatial distribution of the line-emittinggas, which constitute an additional information, independent from linestatistics, to constrain the poorly known cosmic chemical enrichment historyand the stellar feedback processes.

1012.2305	the clustering of galaxies and galaxy clusters: constraints on  primordial non-gaussianity from future wide-field surveys	we investigate the constraints on primordial non-gaussianity with variedbispectrum shapes that can be derived from the power spectrum of galaxies andclusters of galaxies detected in future wide field optical/near-infraredsurveys. having in mind the proposed esa space mission \emph{euclid} as aspecific example, we combine the spatial distribution of spectroscopicallyselected galaxies with that of weak lensing selected clusters. we use thephysically motivated halo model in order to represent the correlation functionof arbitrary tracers of the large scale structure in the universe. as naivelyexpected, we find that galaxies are much more effective in jointly constrainthe level of primordial non-gaussianity $f_\mathrm{nl}$ and the amplitude ofthe matter power spectrum $\sigma_8$ than clusters of galaxies, due to the muchlower abundance of the latter that is not adequately compensated by the largereffect on the power spectrum. nevertheless, combination of the galaxy powerspectrum with the cluster-galaxy cross spectrum can decrease the error on thedetermination of $f_\mathrm{nl}$ by up to a factor of $\sim 2$. this decrementis particularly evident for the less studied non-gaussian bispectrum shapes,the so-called enfolded and the orthogonal ones. setting constraints on thesemodels can shed new light on various aspects of the physics of the earlyuniverse, and it is hence of extreme importance. by combining the power spectraof clusters and galaxies with the cluster-galaxy cross spectrum we findconstraints on primordial non-gaussianity of the order $\delta f_\mathrm{nl}\sim $ a few, competitive and possibly superior to future cmb experiments.

1103.0278	effects of massive neutrinos on the large-scale structure of the  universe	cosmological neutrinos strongly affect the evolution of the largeststructures in the universe, i.e. galaxies and galaxy clusters. we use largebox-size full hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the non-linear effectsthat massive neutrinos have on the spatial properties of cold dark matter (cdm)haloes. we quantify the difference with respect to the concordance lambdacdmmodel of the halo mass function and of the halo two-point correlation function.we model the redshift-space distortions and compute the errors on the lineardistortion parameter beta introduced if cosmological neutrinos are assumed tobe massless. we find that, if not taken correctly into account and depending onthe total neutrino mass, these effects could lead to a potentially fakesignature of modified gravity. future nearly all-sky spectroscopic galaxysurveys will be able to constrain the neutrino mass if it is larger than 0.6ev, using beta measurements alone and independently of the value of the matterpower spectrum normalisation. in combination with other cosmological probes,this will strengthen neutrino mass constraints and help breaking parameterdegeneracies.

1109.0285	moka: a new tool for strong lensing studies	strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the matterdistribution in the cores of massive dark matter haloes. recent and ongoinganalyses of galaxy cluster surveys (macs, cfhtls, sdss, sgas, clash, locuss)have adressed the question of the nature of the dark matter distribution inclusters. n-body simulations of cold dark-matter haloes consistently find thathaloes should be characterized by a concentration-mass relation that decreasesmonotonically with halo mass, and populated by a large amount of substructures,representing the cores of accreted progenitor halos. it is important for ourunderstanding of dark matter to test these predictions. we present moka, a newalgorithm for simulating the gravitational lensing signal from cluster-sizedhaloes. it implements the most recent results from numerical simulations tocreate realistic cluster-scale lenses with properties independent of numericalresolution. we perform systematic studies of the strong lensing cross sectionas a function of halo structures. we find that the strong lensing crosssections depend most strongly on the concentration and on the inner slope ofthe density profile of a halo, followed in order of importance by halotriaxiality and the presence of a bright central galaxy.

1109.4820	an application of extreme value statistics to the most massive galaxy  clusters at low and high redshifts	in this work we present an application of general extreme value statistics(gev) to very massive single clusters at high and low redshifts. afterintroducing the formalism, we apply this statistics to four very massive highredshift clusters. those clusters comprise act-cl j0102-4915 with a mass ofm_200m=(2.16+/-0.32)x10^{15} m_sun at a redshift of z=0.87, spt-cl j2106-5844with a mass of m_200m=(1.27+/-0.21)x10^{15} m_sun at z=1.132 and two clustersfound by the xmm-newton distant cluster project survey: xmmu j2235.32557 with amass of m_200c= (7.3+/-1.3)x10^{14} m_sun located at a redshift of z=1.4 andxmmu j0044.0-2033 having a mass in the range of m_200c= (3.5-5.0)x10^{14} m_sunat z=1.579. by relating those systems to their corresponding distributionfunctions of being the most massive system in a given survey area, we find thatnone of the systems alone is in extreme tension with lcdm. we confront theseresults with a gev analysis of four very massive low redshift clusters: a2163,a370, rxj1347-1145 and 1e0657-558, finding no tendency of the high-z systems tobe more extreme than the low-z ones. in addition, we study the extremequantiles of single clusters at high-z and present contour plots for fixedquantiles in the mass vs. survey area plane for four redshift intervals,finding that, in order to be significantly in conflict with lcdm, clustermasses would have to be substantially higher than the currently observed ones.

1110.3045	clustering and redshift-space distortions in interacting dark energy  cosmologies	we investigate the spatial properties of the large scale structure (lss) ofthe universe in the framework of coupled dark energy (cde) cosmologies. usingthe public halo catalogues from the codecs simulations -- the largest set ofn-body experiments to date for such cosmological scenarios -- we estimate theclustering and bias functions of cold dark matter (cdm) haloes, both in real-and redshift-space. moreover, we investigate the effects of the dark energy(de) coupling on the geometric and dynamic redshift-space distortions,quantifying the difference with respect to the concordance lambdacdm model. atz~0, the spatial properties of cdm haloes in cde models appear very similar tothe lambdacdm case, even if the cde models are normalized at last scattering inorder to be consistent with the latest cosmic microwave background (cmb) data.at higher redshifts, we find that the de coupling produces a significantscale-dependent suppression of the halo clustering and bias function. thiseffect, that strongly depends on the coupling strength, is not degenerate withsigma8 at scales r&lt;5-10 mpc/h. moreover, we find that the coupled de stronglyaffects both the linear distortion parameter, beta, and the pairwise peculiarvelocity dispersion, sigma12. although the models considered in this work arefound to be all in agreement with presently available observational data, thenext generation of galaxy surveys will be able to put strong constraints on thelevel of coupling between de and cdm exploiting the shape of redshift-spaceclustering anisotropies.

1112.4810	measuring the neutrino mass from future wide galaxy cluster catalogues	we present forecast errors on a wide range of cosmological parametersobtained from a photometric cluster catalogue of a future wide-fieldeuclid-like survey. we focus in particular on the total neutrino mass asconstrained by a combination of the galaxy cluster number counts andcorrelation function. for the latter we consider only the shape information andthe baryon acoustic oscillations (bao), while marginalising over the spectralamplitude and the redshift space distortions. in addition to the cosmologicalparameters of the standard lcdm+nu model we also consider a non-vanishingcurvature, and two parameters describing a redshift evolution for the darkenergy equation of state. for completeness, we also marginalise over a set of"nuisance" parameters, representing the uncertainties on the cluster massdetermination. we find that combining cluster counts with power spectruminformation greatly improves the constraining power of each probe takenindividually, with errors on cosmological parameters being reduced by up to anorder of magnitude. in particular, the best improvements are for the parametersdefining the dynamical evolution of dark energy, where cluster counts breakdegeneracies. moreover, the resulting error on neutrino mass is at the level of\sigma(m_\nu)\sim 0.9 ev, comparable with that derived from present ly-alphaforest measurements and cosmic microwave background (cmb) data in the frameworkof a non-flat universe. further adopting planck priors and reducing the numberof free parameters to a lcdm+nu cosmology allows to place constraints on thetotal neutrino mass of \sigma(m_\nu) \sim 0.08 ev, close to the lower boundenforced by neutrino oscillation experiments.

1201.3526	on the modelling of the excesses of galaxy clusters over high-mass  thresholds	in this work we present for the first time an application of the paretoapproach to the modelling of the excesses of galaxy clusters over high-massthresholds. the distribution of those excesses can be described by thegeneralized pareto distribution (gpd), which is closely related to thegeneralized extreme value (gev) distribution. after introducing the formalism,we study the impact of different thresholds and redshift ranges on thedistributions, as well as the influence of the survey area on the mean excessabove a given mass threshold. we also show that both the gpd and the gevapproach lead to identical results for rare, thus high-mass and high-redshift,clusters. as an example, we apply the pareto approach to act-cl j0102-4915 andspt-cl j2106-5844 and derive the respective cumulative distribution functionsof the exceedance over different mass thresholds. we also study the possibilityto use the gpd as a cosmological probe. since in the maximum likelihoodestimation of the distribution parameters all the information from clustersabove the mass threshold is used, the gpd might offer an interestingalternative to gev-based methods that use only the maxima in patches. whencomparing the accuracy with which the parameters can be estimated, it turns outthat the patch-based modelling of maxima is superior to the pareto approach. inan ideal case, the gev approach is capable to estimate the location parameterwith a percent level precision for less than 100 patches. this result makes thegev based approach potentially also interesting for cluster surveys with asmaller area.

1201.3590	accuracy of photometric redshifts for future weak lensing surveys from  space	photometric redshifts are a key tool to extract as much information aspossible from planned cosmic shear experiments. in this work we aim to test theperformances that can be achieved with observations in the near-infrared fromspace and in the optical from the ground. this is done by performing realisticsimulations of multi-band observations of a patch of the sky, and submittingthese mock images to software usually applied to real images to extract thephotometry and then a redshift estimate for each galaxy. in this way we mimicthe most relevant sources of uncertainty present in real data analysis,including blending and light pollution between galaxies. as an example we adoptthe infrared setup of the esa-proposed euclid mission, while we simulatedifferent observations in the optical, modifying filters, exposure times andseeing values. finally, we consider directly some future ground-basedexperiments, such as lsst, pan-starrs and des. the results highlight theimportance of u-band observations, especially to discriminate between low (z &lt;0.5) and high (z ~ 3) redshifts, and the need for good observing sites, withseeing fwhm &lt; 1. arcsec. the former of these indications clearly favours thelsst experiment as a counterpart for space observations, while for the otherexperiments we need to exclude at least 15 % of the galaxies to reach aprecision in the photo-zs equal to $&lt;\frac{\sigma_z}{1+z}&gt;$ &lt; 0.05.

1202.0353	inclusive constraints on unified dark matter models from future  large-scale surveys	in the very last years, cosmological models where the properties of the darkcomponents of the universe - dark matter and dark energy - are accounted for bya single "dark fluid" have drawn increasing attention and interest. amongstmany proposals, unified dark matter (udm) cosmologies are promising candidatesas effective theories. in these models, a scalar field with a non-canonicalkinetic term in its lagrangian mimics both the accelerated expansion of theuniverse at late times and the clustering properties of the large-scalestructure of the cosmos. however, udm models also present peculiar behaviours,the most interesting one being the fact that the perturbations in thedark-matter component of the scalar field do have a non-negligible speed ofsound. this gives rise to an effective jeans scale for the newtonian potential,below which the dark fluid does not cluster any more. this implies a growth ofstructures fairly different from that of the concordance lcdm model. in thispaper, we demonstrate that forthcoming large-scale surveys will be able todiscriminate between viable udm models and lcdm to a good degree of accuracy.to this purpose, the planned euclid satellite will be a powerful tool, since itwill provide very accurate data on galaxy clustering and the weak lensingeffect of cosmic shear. finally, we also exploit the constraining power of theongoing cmb planck experiment. although our approach is the most conservative,with the inclusion of only well-understood, linear dynamics, in the end we alsoshow what could be done if some amount of non-linear information were included.

1203.1002	cosmology with clustering anisotropies: disentangling dynamic and  geometric distortions in galaxy redshift surveys	we investigate the impact of different observational effects affecting aprecise and accurate measurement of the growth rate of fluctuations from theanisotropy of clustering in galaxy redshift surveys. we focus on redshiftmeasurement errors, on the reconstruction of the underlying real-spaceclustering and on the apparent degeneracy existing with the geometricaldistortions induced by the cosmology-dependent conversion of redshifts intodistances. we use a suite of mock catalogues extracted from large n-bodysimulations, focusing on the analysis of intermediate, mildly non-linear scalesand apply the standard linear dispersion model to fit the anisotropy of theobserved correlation function. we verify that redshift errors up to ~0.2% havea negligible impact on the precision with which the specific growth rate betacan be measured. larger redshift errors introduce a positive systematic error,which can be alleviated by adopting a gaussian distribution function ofpairwise velocities. this is, in any case, smaller than the systematic error ofup to 10% due to the limitations of the linear dispersion model, which isstudied in a separate paper. we then show that 50% of the statistical errorbudget on beta depends on the deprojection procedure through which thereal-space correlation function is obtained. finally, we demonstrate that thedegeneracy with geometric distortions can in fact be circumvented. this isobtained through a modified version of the alcock-paczynski test inredshift-space, which successfully recovers the correct cosmology by searchingfor the solution that optimizes the description of dynamical redshiftdistortions. for a flat cosmology, we obtain largely independent, robustconstraints on beta and omegam. in a volume of 2.4(gpc/h)^3, the correct omegamis obtained with ~12% error and negligible bias, once the real-spacecorrelation function is properly reconstructed.

1203.1545	statistical and systematic errors in redshift-space distortion  measurements from large surveys	we investigate the impact of statistical and systematic errors onmeasurements of linear redshift-space distortions (rsd) in future cosmologicalsurveys, analyzing large catalogues of dark-matter halos from the basiccsimulation. these allow us to estimate the dependence of errors on typicalsurvey properties, as volume, galaxy density and mass (i.e. bias factor) of theadopted tracer. we find that measures of the specific growth rate \beta=f/busing the hamilton/kaiser harmonic expansion of the redshift-space correlationfunction \xi(r_p,\pi) on scales larger than 3/h mpc are typicallyunder-estimated by up to 10% for galaxy sized halos. this is significantlylarger than the corresponding statistical errors, which amount to a fewpercent, indicating the importance of non-linear improvements to the kaisermodel to obtain accurate measurements of the growth rate. we compare thestatistical errors to predictions obtained with the fisher information matrix,based on the usual fkp prescription for the errors on the power spectrum. weshow that this produces parameter errors fairly similar to the standarddeviations from the halo catalogues, but only if applied to strictly linearscales in fourier space (k&lt;0.2 h/mpc). finally, we present an accurate scalingformula describing the relative error on {\beta} as a function of the surveyparameters, which closely matches the simulation results in all exploredregimes. this provides a handy and plausibly more realistic alternative to thefisher matrix approach, to quickly and accurately predict rsd statisticalerrors expected from future surveys.

1205.2375	cosmology in 2d: the concentration-mass relation for galaxy clusters	the aim of this work is to perform a systematic study of the measures of themass and concentration estimated by fitting the convergence profile of a largesample of mock galaxy cluster size lenses, created with the publicly availablecode moka. we found that the main contribution to the bias in mass and inconcentration is due to the halo triaxiality and second to the presence ofsubstructures within the host halo virial radius. we show that knowing thecluster elongation along the line of sight helps in correcting the mass bias,but still keeps a small negative bias for the concentration. if these mass andconcentration biases will characterize the galaxy cluster sample of a widefield survey it will be difficult to well recover within one sigma thecosmological parameters that mainly influence the c - m relation, using asreference a 3d c - m relation measured in cosmological n-body simulation. inthis work we propose how to correct the c - m relation for projection effectsand for adiabatic contraction and suggest to use these as reference for realobserved data. correcting mass and concentration estimates, as we propose,gives a measurement of the cosmological parameter within 1 - {\sigma}confidence contours.

1205.3163	hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters in dark energy  cosmologies: ii. c-m relation	we use hydrodynamical simulations of different dark energy cosmologies toinvestigate the concentration-mass (c-m) relation in galaxy clusters. inparticular, we consider a reference \lambda cdm model, two quintessence modelswith inverse power-law potentials (rp and sugra), and two extended quintessencemodels, one with positive and one with negative coupling with gravity (eqp andeqn respectively). all the models are normalized in order to match cmb datafrom wmap3. we fit both the dark matter only and the total mass profile with anfw profile, and recover the concentration of each halo from the fit usingdifferent definition. we consider both the complete catalog of clusters andgroups and subsamples of objects at different level of relaxation. we find thatthe definition itself of the concentration can lead to differences up to 20% inits value and that these differences are smaller when more relaxed objects areconsidered. the c-m relation of our reference \lambda cdm model is in goodagreement with the results in literature, and relaxed objects have a highernormalization and a shallower slope with respect to the complete sample. theinclusion of baryon physics is found to influence more high-mass systems thanlow-mass ones, due to a higher concentration of baryons in the inner regions ofmassive halos. for the different dark energy models, we find that for \lambdacdm, rp and sugra the normalization of the c-m relation is linked to the growthfactor, with models having a higher value of \sigma 8 d+ having also a highernormalization. this simple scheme is no longer valid for eqp and eqn because inthese models a time dependent effective gravitational interaction, whoseredshift evolution depends on the sign of the coupling, is present. this leadsto a decrease (increase) of the expected normalization in the eqp (eqn) model.[abridged]

0711.3603	the effect of primordial non--gaussianity on the topology of large-scale  structure	we study the effect of primordial non-gaussianity on the development oflarge-scale cosmic structure using high-resolution n-body simulations. inparticular, we focus on the topological properties of the "cosmic web",quantitatively characterized by the minkowski functionals, for models withquadratic non-linearities with different values of the usual non-gaussianityparameter fnl. in the weakly non-linear regime, we find that analytic formulaederived from perturbation theory agree with the numerical results within a fewpercent of the amplitude of each mf when |fnl|&lt;1000. in the non-linear regime,the detailed behavior of the mfs as functions of threshold density deviatesmore strongly from the analytical curves, while the overall amplitude of theprimordial non-gaussian effect remains comparable to the perturbativeprediction. when smaller-scale information is included, the influence ofprimordial non-gaussianity becomes increasingly significant statistically dueto decreasing sample variance. we find that the effect of the primordialnon-gaussianity with |fnl|=50 is comparable to the sample variance of massdensity fields with a volume of 0.125(gpc/h)^3 when they are smoothed bygaussian filter at a scale of 5mpc/h. the detectability of this effect inactual galaxy surveys will strongly depend upon residual uncertainties incosmological parameters and galaxy biasing.

1209.2250	counts of high-redshift grbs as probe of primordial non-gaussianities	we propose to use high-redshift long $\gamma$-ray bursts (grbs) ascosmological tools to constrain the amount of primordial non-gaussianity in thedensity field. by using numerical, n-body, hydrodynamic, chemistry simulationsof different cosmological volumes with various gaussian and non-gaussianmodels, we self-consistently relate the cosmic star formation rate density tothe corresponding grb rate. assuming that grbs are fair tracers of cosmic starformation, we find that positive local non-gaussianities, described in terms ofthe non-linear parameter, \fnl, might boost significantly the grb rate at highredshift, $z \gg 6$. deviations with respect to the gaussian case account for afew orders of magnitude if \fnl$\sim 1000$, one order of magnitude for\fnl$\sim 100$, and a factor of $\sim 2$ for \fnl$\sim 50$. these differencesare found only at large redshift, while at later times the rates tend toconverge. furthermore, a comparison between our predictions and the observedgrb data at $z &gt; 6$ allows to exclude large negative \fnl, consistently withprevious works. future detections of any long grb at extremely high redshift($z\sim 15-20$) could favor non-gaussian scenarios with positive \fnl. morestringent constraints require much larger high-$z$ grb complete samples,currently not available in literature. by distinguishing the contributions tothe grb rate from the metal-poor population iii regime, and the metal-enrichedpopulation ii-i regime, we conclude that the latter is a more solid tracer ofthe underlying matter distribution, while the former is strongly dominated byfeedback mechanisms from the first, massive, short-lived stars, rather than bypossible non-gaussian fluctuations. this holds quite independently of theassumed population iii initial mass function.

1209.2709	predicting the number of giant arcs expected in the next generation  wide-field surveys from space	in this paper we estimate the number of gravitational arcs detectable in awide-field survey such as that which will be operated by the euclid spacemission, assuming a {\lambda}cdm cosmology. we use the publicly available codemoka to obtain realistic deflection angle maps of mock gravitational lenses.the maps are processed by a ray-tracing code to estimate the strong lensingcross sections of each lens. our procedure involves 1) the generation of alight-cone which is populated with lenses drawn from a theoreticalmass-function; 2) the modeling of each single lens using a triaxial halo with anfw (navarro-frenk-white) density profile and theoretical concentration-massrelation, including substructures, 3) the determination of the lensing crosssection as a function of redshift for each lens in the light-cone, 4) thesimulation of mock observations to characterize the redshift distribution ofsources that will be detectable in the euclid images. we focus on the so-calledgiant arcs, i.e. gravitational arcs characterized by large length-to-widthratios (l/w &gt; 5, 7.5 and 10). we quantify the arc detectability at differentsignificances above the level of the background. performing 128 differentrealizations of a 15,000 sq. degree survey, we find that the number of arcsdetectable at 1{\sigma} above the local background will be 8912,2914, and 1275for l/w&gt;5, 7.5 and 10, respectively. the expected arc numbers decrease to 2409,790, and 346 for a detection limit at 3{\sigma} above the background level.from our analysis, we find that most of the lenses which contribute to thelensing optical depth are located at redshifts 0.4&lt;zl&lt;0.7 and that the 50% ofthe arcs are images of sources at zs &gt; 3. this is the first step towards thefull characterization of the population of strong lenses that will be observedby euclid.

1212.0853	exploiting the shift of baryonic acoustic oscillations as a dynamical  probe for dark interactions	the baryonic acoustic peak in the correlation function of galaxies and galaxyclusters provides a standard ruler to probe the space-time geometry of theuniverse, jointly constraining the angular diameter distance and the hubbleexpansion rate. moreover, non-linear effects can systematically shift the peakposition, giving us the opportunity to exploit this clustering feature also asa dynamical probe. we investigate the possibility of detecting interactions inthe dark sector through an accurate determination of the baryonic acousticscale. making use of the public halo catalogues extracted from the codecssimulations -- the largest suite of n-body simulations of interacting darkenergy models to date -- we determine the position of the baryonic scalefitting a band-filtered correlation function, specifically designed to amplifythe signal at the sound horizon. we analyze the shifts due to non-lineardynamics, redshift-space distortions and gaussian redshift errors, in the range0 &lt; z &lt; 2. since the coupling between dark energy and dark matter affects in aparticular way the clustering properties of haloes and, specifically, theamplitude and location of the baryonic acoustic oscillations, the cosmicevolution of the baryonic peak position might provide a direct way todiscriminate interacting dark energy models from the standard \lambda cdmframework. to maximize the efficiency of the baryonic peak as a dynamic probe,the correlation function has to be measured in redshift-space, where thebaryonic acoustic shift due to non-linearities is amplified. the typicalredshift errors of spectroscopic galaxy surveys do not significantly impactthese results.

1301.3151	characterizing dark interactions with the halo mass accretion history  and structural properties	we study the halo mass accretion history (mah) and its correlation with theinternal structural properties in coupled dark energy cosmologies (cde). toaccurately predict all the non-linear effects caused by dark interactions, weuse the coupled dark energy cosmological simulations (codecs). we measure thehalo concentration at z=0 and the number of substructures above a massresolution threshold for each halo. tracing the halo merging history trees backin time, following the mass of the main halo, we develope a mah model thataccurately reproduces the halo growth in term of m_{200} in the {\lambda}cdmuniverse; we then compare the mah in different cosmological scenarios. for cdemodels with a weak constant coupling, our mah model can reproduce thesimulation results, within 10% of accuracy, by suitably rescaling thenormalization of the linear matter power spectrum at z=0, {\sigma}_8. however,this is not the case for more complex scenarios, like the "bouncing" cde model,for which the numerical analysis shows a rapid growth of haloes at highredshifts, that cannot be reproduced by simply rescaling the value of{\sigma}_8. moreover, at fixed value of {\sigma}_8, cold dark matter (cdm)haloes in these cde scenarios tend to be more concentrated and have a largeramount of substructures with respect to {\lambda}cdm predictions. finally, wepresent an accurate model that relates the halo concentration to the time atwhich it assembles half or 4% of its mass. combining this with our mah model,we show how halo concentrations change while varying only {\sigma}_8 in a{\lambda}cdm universe, at fixed halo mass.

1307.7026	a comparison of structure formation in minimally and non-minimally  coupled quintessence models	we study structure formation in non-minimally coupled dark energy models,where there is a coupling in the lagrangian between a quintessence scalar fieldand gravity via the ricci scalar. we consider models with a range of differentnon-minimal coupling strengths and compare these to minimally coupledquintessence models with time-dependent dark energy densities. the equations ofstate of the latter are tuned to either reproduce the equation of state of thenon-minimally coupled models or their background history. thereby they providea reference to study the unique imprints of coupling on structure formation. weshow that the coupling between gravity and the scalar field, which effectivelyresults in a time-varying gravitational constant g, is not negligible and itseffect can be distinguished from a minimally coupled model. we extend previouswork on this subject by showing that major differences appear in thedetermination of the mass function at high masses, where we observe differencesof the order of 40% at z=0. our new results concern effects on the non-linearmatter power spectrum and on the lensing signal (differences of ~10% for bothquantities), where we find that non-minimally coupled models could bedistinguished from minimally coupled ones.

1311.1205	mass and concentration estimates from weak and strong gravitational  lensing: a systematic study	we study how well halo properties of galaxy clusters, like mass andconcentration, are recovered using lensing data. in order to generate a largesample of systems at different redshifts we use the code moka. we measure halomass and concentration using weak lensing data alone (wl), fitting to an nfwprofile the reduced tangential shear profile, or by combining weak and stronglensing data, by adding information about the size of the einstein radius(wl+sl). for different redshifts, we measure the mass and the concentrationbiases and find that these are mainly caused by the random orientation of thehalo ellipsoid with respect to the line-of-sight. since our simulations accountfor the presence of a bright central galaxy, we perform mass and concentrationmeasurements using a generalized nfw profile which allows for a free innerslope. this reduces both the mass and the concentration biases. we discuss howthe mass function and the concentration mass relation change when using wl andwl+sl estimates. we investigate how selection effects impact the measuredconcentration-mass relation showing that strong lens clusters may have aconcentration 20-30% higher than the average, at fixed mass, considering alsothe particular case of strong lensing selected samples of relaxed clusters.finally, we notice that selecting a sample of relaxed galaxy clusters, as isdone in some cluster surveys, explain the concentration-mass relation biases.

1311.2588	cosmic degeneracies i: joint n-body simulations of modified gravity and  massive neutrinos	we present the first suite of cosmological n-body simulations thatsimultaneously include the effects of two different and theoreticallyindependent extensions of the standard $\lambda$cdm cosmological scenario -namely an $f(r)$ theory of modified gravity (mg) and a cosmological backgroundof massive neutrinos - with the aim to investigate their possible observationaldegeneracies. we focus on three basic statistics of the large-scale matterdistribution, more specifically the nonlinear matter power spectrum, the halomass function, and the halo bias, for which we determine the deviation withrespect to the fiducial $\lambda$cdm cosmology in the context of both separateand combined simulations of $f(r)$ mg and massive neutrinos scenarios. ourresults show that while these two extended models separately determine veryprominent and potentially detectable features in all the three statistics, whenwe allow them to be simultaneously at work these features are stronglysuppressed, resulting in much weaker deviations from the standard model'spredictions. in particular, when an $f(r)$ gravity model with $f_{r0}=-1\times10^{-4}$ is combined with a total neutrino mass of $\sigma _{i}m_{\nu_{i}}=0.4$ ev, the resulting matter power spectrum, halo mass function, andbias at z=0 are found to be consistent with the standard model's predictions atthe 10%, 20%, and 5% accuracy levels, respectively. therefore, our resultsimply an intrinsic theoretical limit to the effective discriminating power ofpresent and future observational data sets with respect to these widelyconsidered extensions of the standard cosmological scenario in the absence ofindependent measurements of the neutrino masses from laboratory experiments,even though the high-redshift evolution might still allow to partially breakthe degeneracy [abridged].

1311.6383	magnification bias as a novel probe for primordial magnetic fields	in this paper we investigate magnetic fields generated in the early universe.these fields are important candidates at explaining the origin of astrophysicalmagnetism observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters, whose genesis is still byand large unclear. compared to the standard inflationary power spectrum,intermediate to small scales would experience further substantial matterclustering, were a cosmological magnetic field present prior to recombination.as a consequence, the bias and redshift distribution of galaxies would also bemodified. hitherto, primordial magnetic fields (pmfs) have been tested andconstrained with a number of cosmological observables, e.g. the cosmicmicrowave background radiation, galaxy clustering and, more recently, weakgravitational lensing. here, we explore the constraining potential of thedensity fluctuation bias induced by gravitational lensing magnification ontothe galaxy-galaxy angular power spectrum. such an effect is known asmagnification bias. compared to the usual galaxy clustering approach,magnification bias helps in lifting the pathological degeneracy present amongstpower spectrum normalisation and galaxy bias. this is because magnificationbias cross-correlates galaxy number density fluctuations of nearby objects withweak lensing distortions of high-redshift sources. thus, it takes advantage ofthe gravitational deflection of light, which is insensitive to galaxy bias butpowerful in constraining the density fluctuation amplitude. to scrutinise thepotentiality of this method, we adopt a deep and wide-field spectroscopicgalaxy survey. we show that magnification bias does contain importantinformation on primordial magnetism, which will be useful in combination withgalaxy clustering and shear. we find we shall be able to rule out at 95.4% clamplitudes of pmfs larger than 0.0005 ng for values of the pmf power spectralindex ~0.

1312.4530	disentangling interacting dark energy cosmologies with the three-point  correlation function	we investigate the possibility of constraining coupled dark energy (cde)cosmologies using the three-point correlation function (3pcf). making use ofthe codecs n-body simulations, we study the statistical properties of cold darkmatter (cdm) haloes for a variety of models, including a fiducial $\lambda$cdmscenario and five models in which dark energy (de) and cdm mutually interact.we measure both the halo 3pcf, $\zeta(\theta)$, and the reduced 3pcf,$q(\theta)$, at different scales ($2&lt;r\,[$mpc\h$]&lt;40$) and redshifts ($0\leqz\leq2$). in all cde models considered in this work, $q(\theta)$ appears flatat small scales (for all redshifts) and at low redshifts (for all scales),while it builds up the characteristic v-shape anisotropy at increasingredshifts and scales. with respect to the $\lambda $cdm predictions, cde modelsshow lower (higher) values of the halo 3pcf for perpendicular (elongated)configurations. the effect is also scale-dependent, with differences between$\lambda$cdm and cde models that increase at large scales. we made use of thesemeasurements to estimate the halo bias, that results in fair agreement with theone computed from the two-point correlation function (2pcf). the main advantageof using both the 2pcf and 3pcf is to break the bias$-\sigma_{8}$ degeneracy.moreover, we find that our bias estimates are approximately independent of theassumed strength of de coupling. this study demonstrates the power of ahigher-order clustering analysis in discriminating between alternativecosmological scenarios, for both present and forthcoming galaxy surveys, suchas e.g. boss and euclid.

1401.0011	lensing dispersion of supernova flux: a probe of nonlinear structure  growth	the scatter in the apparent magnitude of type ia supernovae induced bystochastic gravitational lensing is highly dependent on the nonlinear growth ofcosmological structure. in this paper, we show that such a dependence canpotentially be employed to gain significant information about the massclustering at small scales. while the mass clustering ultimately hinges oncosmology, here we demonstrate that, upon obtaining more precise observationalmeasurements through future cosmological surveys, the lensing dispersion canvery effectively be used to gain information on the poorly understoodastrophysical aspects of structure formation, such as the clumpiness of darkmatter halos and the importance of gas physics and star formation into shapingthe large-scale structure. in order to illustrate this point we verify thateven the tentative current measurements of the lensing dispersion performed onthe supernova legacy survey sample favor a scenario where virialized structuresare somewhat less compact than predicted by $n-$body cosmological simulations.moreover, we are also able to put lower limits on the slope of theconcentration-mass relation. by artificially reducing the statisticalobservational error we argue that with forthcoming data the stochastic lensingdispersion will allow one to importantly improve constraints on the baryonicphysics at work during the assembly of cosmological structure.

1407.7548	raytracing simulations of coupled dark energy models	dark matter and dark energy are usually assumed to couple onlygravitationally. an extension to this picture is to model dark energy as ascalar field coupled directly to cold dark matter. this coupling leads to newphysical effects, such as a fifth-force and a time-dependent dark matterparticle mass. in this work we examine the impact that coupling has on weaklensing statistics by constructing realistic simulated weak-lensing maps usingraytracing techniques through n-body cosmological simulations. we constructmaps for different lensing quantities, covering a range of scales from a fewarcminutes to several degrees. the concordance $\lambda$cdm model is comparedto different coupled dark energy models, described either by an exponentialscalar field potential (standard coupled dark energy scenario) or by a sugrapotential (bouncing model). we analyse several statistical quantities and ourresults, with sources at low redshifts are largely consistent with previouswork on cmb lensing by carbone et al., 2013. the most significant differencesfrom the $\lambda$cdm model are due to the enhanced growth of the perturbationsand to the effective friction term in non-linear dynamics. for the most extrememodels, we see differences in the power spectra up to 40% compared to the$\lambda$cdm model. the different time evolution of the linear matteroverdensity can account for most of the differences, but when controlling forthis using a $\lambda$cdm model having the same normalization, the overallsignal is smaller due to the effect of the friction term appearing in theequation of motion for dark matter particles.

1409.4285	the effect of massive neutrinos on the sunyaev-zeldovich and x-ray  observables of galaxy clusters	massive neutrinos are expected to influence the formation of the large-scalestructure of the universe, depending on the value of their total mass, $\sigmam_\nu$. in particular planck data indicate that a non-zero $\sigma m_\nu$ mayhelp to reconcile cmb data with sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) cluster surveys. inorder to study the impact of neutrinos on the sz and x-ray cluster propertieswe run a set of six very large cosmological simulations (8$h^{-3}$ gpc$^3$comoving volume) that include a massive neutrino particle component: weconsider the values of $\sigma m_\nu$ = (0, 0.17, 0.34) ev in two cosmologicalscenarios to test possible degeneracies. using the halo catalogues extractedfrom their outputs we produce 50 mock light-cones and, assuming suitablescaling relations, we determine how massive neutrinos affect sz and x-raycluster counts, the $y$-parameter and its power spectrum. we provide forecastsfor the south pole telescope (spt) and erosita cluster surveys, showing thatthe number of expected detections is reduced by 40 per cent when assuming$\sigma m_\nu$ =0.34 ev with respect to a model with massless neutrinos.however the degeneracy with $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_m$ is strong, in particularfor x-ray data, requiring the use of additional probes to break it. the$y$-parameter properties are also highly influenced by the neutrino massfraction, $f_\nu$, with $&lt;\,y\,&gt;\propto(1-f_\nu)^{20}$, considering the clustercomponent only, and the normalization of the sz power spectrum is proportionalto $(1-f_\nu)^{25-30}$. comparing our findings with spt and atacama cosmologytelescope measurements at $\ell$ = 3000 indicates that, when planckcosmological parameters are assumed, a value of $\sigma m_\nu\simeq0.34$ ev isrequired to fit with the data.

1410.4559	cosmic voids detection without density measurements	cosmic voids are effective cosmological probes to discriminate amongcompeting world models. their identification is generally based on density orgeometry criteria that, because of their very nature, are prone to shot noise.we propose two void finders that are based on dynamical criterion to selectvoids in lagrangian coordinates and minimise the impact of sparse sampling. thefirst approach exploits the zel'dovich approximation to trace back in time theorbits of galaxies located in voids and their surroundings, the second uses theobserved galaxy-galaxy correlation function to relax the objects' spatialdistribution to homogeneity and isotropy. in both cases voids are defined asregions of the negative velocity divergence, that can be regarded as sinks ofthe back-in-time streamlines of the mass tracers. to assess the performance ofour methods we used a dark matter halo mock catalogue codecs, and compared theresults with those obtained with the zobov void finder. we find that the voiddivergence profiles are less scattered than the density ones and, therefore,their stacking constitutes a more accurate cosmological probe. the significanceof the divergence signal in the central part of voids obtained from both ourfinders is 60% higher than for overdensity profiles in the zobov case. theellipticity of the stacked void measured in the divergence field is closer tounity, as expected, than what is found when using halo positions. therefore ourvoid finders are complementary to the existing methods, that should contributeto improve the accuracy of void-based cosmological tests.

1410.4568	the mass-concentration relation in lensing clusters: the role of  statistical biases and selection effects	the relation between mass and concentration of galaxy clusters traces theirformation and evolution. massive lensing clusters were observed to beover-concentrated and following a steep scaling in tension with predictionsfrom the concordance $\lambda$cdm paradigm. we critically revise the relationin the clash, the sgas, the locuss, and the high-redshift samples of weaklensing clusters. measurements of mass and concentration are anti-correlated,which can bias the observed relation towards steeper values. we corrected forthis bias and compared the measured relation to theoretical predictionsaccounting for halo triaxiality, adiabatic contraction of the halo, presence ofa dominant bcg and, mostly, selection effects in the observed sample. thenormalisation, the slope and the scatter of the expected relation are stronglysample-dependent. for the considered samples, the predicted slope is muchsteeper than that of the underlying relation characterising dark-matter onlyclusters. we found that the correction for statistical and selection biases inobserved relations mostly solve the tension with the $\lambda$cdm model.

1410.5438	new constraints on $\sigma_8$ from a joint analysis of stacked  gravitational lensing and clustering of galaxy clusters	the joint analysis of clustering and stacked gravitational lensing of galaxyclusters in large surveys can constrain the formation and evolution ofstructures and the cosmological parameters. on scales outside a few virialradii, the halo bias, $b$, is linear and the lensing signal is dominated by thecorrelated distribution of matter around galaxy clusters. we discuss a methodto measure the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and $b$ based on a minimalmodelling. we considered a sample of $\sim 120000$ clusters photometricallyselected from the sloan digital sky survey in the redshift range $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6$.the auto-correlation was studied through the two-point function of a subsampleof $\sim 70000$ clusters; the matter-halo correlation was derived from the weaklensing signal of the subsample of $\sim 1200$ clusters withcanada-france-hawaii lensing survey data. we obtained a direct measurement of$b$, which increases with mass in agreement with predictions of the$\lambda$cdm paradigm. assuming $\omega_\mathrm{m}=0.3$, we found$\sigma_8=0.78\pm0.16$. we used the same clusters for measuring both lensingand clustering and the estimate of $\sigma_8$ did require neither themass-richness relation, nor the knowledge of the selection function, nor themodelling of $b$. with an additional theoretical prior on the bias, we obtained$\sigma_8=0.75\pm0.08$.

1505.01170	redshift-space distortions of galaxies, clusters and agn: testing how  the accuracy of growth rate measurements depends on scales and sample  selections	redshift-space clustering anisotropies caused by cosmic peculiar velocitiesprovide a powerful probe to test the gravity theory on large scales. however,to extract unbiased physical constraints, the clustering pattern has to bemodelled accurately, taking into account the effects of non-linear dynamics atsmall scales, and properly describing the link between the selected cosmictracers and the underlying dark matter field. we use a large hydrodynamicsimulation to investigate how the systematic error on the linear growth rate,$f$, caused by model uncertainties, depends on sample selections and comovingscales. specifically, we measure the redshift-space two-point correlationfunction of mock samples of galaxies, galaxy clusters and active galacticnuclei, extracted from the magneticum simulation, in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z&lt; 2, and adopting different sample selections. we estimate $f\sigma_8$ bymodelling both the monopole and the full two-dimensional anisotropicclustering, using the dispersion model. we find that the systematic error on$f\sigma_8$ depends significantly on the range of scales considered for thefit. if the latter is kept fixed, the error depends on both redshift and sampleselection, due to the scale-dependent impact of non-linearities, if notproperly modelled. on the other hand, we show that it is possible to getunbiased constraints on $f\sigma_8$ provided that the analysis is restricted toa proper range of scales, that depends non trivially on the properties of thesample. this can have a strong impact on multiple tracers analyses, and whencombining catalogues selected at different redshifts.

1507.05627	the universality of the virial halo mass function and models for  non-universality of other halo definitions	the abundance of galaxy clusters can constrain both the geometry and growthof structure in our universe. however, this probe could be significantlycomplicated by recent claims of nonuniversality -- non-trivial dependences withrespect to the cosmological model and redshift. in this work we analyse thedependance of the mass function on the way haloes are identified and establishif this can cause departures from universality. in order to explore thisdependance, we use a set of different n-body cosmological simulations (lesbarbine simulations), with the latest cosmological parameters from the planckcollaboration; this first suite of simulations is followed by a lowerresolution set, carried out with different cosmological parameters. we identifydark matter haloes using a spherical overdensity algorithm with varyingoverdensity thresholds (virial, 2000rho_c, 1000rho_c, 500rho_c, 200rho_c and200rho_b) at all redshifts. we notice that, when expressed in term of therescaled variable nu, the mass functionfor virial haloes is a nearly universalas a function of redshift and cosmology, while this is clearly not the case forthe other overdensities we considered. we provide fitting functions for thehalo mass function parameters as a function of overdensity, that allow topredict, to within a few percent accuracy, the halo mass function for a widerange of halo definitions, redshifts and cosmological models. we then show howthe departures from universality associated with other halo definitions can bederived by combining the universality of the virial definition with theexpected shape of the density profile of halos.

astro-ph;0009006	constraining cosmological parameters with the clustering properties of  galaxy clusters in optical and x-ray bands	(abridged) we use a theoretical model to predict the clustering properties ofgalaxy clusters. our technique accounts for past light-cone effects on theobserved clustering and follows the non-linear evolution of the dark mattercorrelation function and cluster bias factor. a linear treatment ofredshift-space distortions is also included. we perform a maximum-likelihoodanalysis by comparing the theoretical predictions to a set of observationaldata, both in the optical (apm and edcc catalogues) and x-ray band (rass1bright sample, bcs, xbacs, reflex). in the framework of cdm models, we computethe constraints on cosmological parameters. our results show that x-ray dataare more powerful than optical ones, allowing smaller regions in the parameterspace. we find that the clustering properties of clusters are almostindependent of the matter density parameter and of the presence of acosmological constant, while they appear to be strongly dependent on the shapeparameter. using the x-ray data only, we obtain gamma~0.1 and 0.4&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.1for the einstein-de sitter model, while 0.14&lt;gamma&lt;0.22 and 0.6&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.3 foropen and flat models with omega_0m=0.3. finally, we use our model to makepredictions on the correlation length of galaxy clusters expected in futuresurveys. in particular, we show the results for an optical catalogue withcharacteristics similar to the eis project and for a very deep x-ray cataloguewith the characteristics of the xmm/lss survey. we find that clusters at highredshifts are expected to have larger a correlation length than local ones.

astro-ph;0011405	giant cluster arcs as a constraint on the scattering cross-section of  dark matter	we carry out ray tracing through five high resolution simulations of a galaxycluster to study how its ability to produce giant gravitationally lensed arcsis influenced by the collision cross-section of its dark matter. in three casestypical dark matter particles in the cluster core undergo between 1 and 100collisions per hubble time; two more explore the long (``collisionless'') andshort (``fluid'') mean free path limits. we study the size and shapedistributions of arcs and compute the cross-section for producing ``extreme''arcs of various sizes. even a few collisions per particle modify the corestructure enough to destroy the cluster's ability to produce long, thin arcs.for larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up tounrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce giantarcs. none of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except the``fluid'' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with thesmallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit of observedcluster masses before it produces radial arcs. apparently the elastic collisioncross-section of dark matter in clusters must be very small, below 0.1 cm^2g^-1, to be compatible with the observed ability of clusters to produce bothradial arcs and giant arcs.

astro-ph;0112456	predicting the clustering properties of galaxy clusters detectable for  the planck satellite	we study the clustering properties of the galaxy clusters detectable for theplanck satellite due to their thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. we take thepast light-cone effect and the redshift evolution of both the underlying darkmatter correlation function and the cluster bias factor into account. atheoretical mass-temperature relation allows us to convert the sensitivitylimit of a catalogue into a minimum mass for the dark matter haloes hosting theclusters. we confirm that the correlation length is an increasing function ofthe sensitivity limits defining the survey. using the expected characteristicsof the planck cluster catalogue, which will be a quite large and unbiasedsample, we predict the two-point correlation function and power spectrum fordifferent cosmological models. we show that the wide redshift distribution ofthe planck survey, will allow to constrain the cluster clustering properties upto z=1. the dependence of our results on the main cosmological parameters (thematter density parameter, the cosmological constant and the normalisation ofthe density power-spectrum) is extensively discussed. we find that the futureplanck clustering data place only mild constraints on the cosmologicalparameters, because the results depend on the physical characteristics of theintracluster medium, like the baryon fraction and the mass-temperaturerelation. once the cosmological model and the hubble constant are determined,the clustering data will allow a determination of the baryon fraction with anaccuracy of few per cent.

astro-ph;0201501	cluster cross sections for strong lensing: analytic and numerical lens  models	the statistics of gravitationally lensed arcs was recognised earlier as apotentially powerful cosmological probe. however, while fully numerical modelsfind orders of magnitude difference between the arc probabilities in differentcosmological models, analytic models tend to find markedly different results.we introduce in this paper an analytic cluster lens model which improves uponexisting analytic models in four ways. (1) we use the more realisticnavarro-frenk-white profile instead of singular isothermal spheres, (2) weinclude the effect of cosmology on the compactness of the lenses, (3) we useelliptical instead of axially symmetric lenses, and (4) we take the intrinsicellipticity of sources into account. while these improvements to the analyticmodel lead to a pronounced increase of the arc probability, comparisons withnumerical models of the same virial mass demonstrate that the analytic modelsstill fall short by a substantial margin of reproducing the results obtainedwith numerical models. using multipole expansions of cluster massdistributions, we show that the remaining discrepancy can be attributed tosubstructure inside clusters and tidal fields contributed by the clustersurroundings, effects that cannot reasonably and reliably be mimicked inanalytic models.

astro-ph;0302603	cd galaxy contribution to the strong lensing cross sections of galaxy  clusters	we perform ray-tracing simulations evaluating the effect of a cd galaxy onthe strong lensing properties of five galaxy cluster halos obtained from n-bodysimulations. the cd galaxy is modelled using both axially symmetric andelliptical models and assuming several masses for its dark matter halo. theeffect of the cd orientation with respect to the mass distribution of the hostgalaxy cluster is also investigated. the simulations are carried out in an openand a flat model universe with cosmological constant. we find that theenhancement of the cluster lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs due tothe presence of a massive cd at the cluster centre is typically less than 100%,depending on the model used for the cd galaxy and its orientation. the impactof the cd on the cluster efficiency for producing radially magnified images islarger only for those clusters whose lensing cross section for radial arcs isvery small in absence of the central galaxy. we conclude that the presence of acd galaxy at the cluster centre can only moderately influence the clusterefficiency for strong lensing and in particular fails to explain thediscrepancy between the observed number of giant arcs in galaxy clusters andtheir abundance predicted from lensing simulations in the currently mostfavoured $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0304375	properties of cluster satellites in hydrodynamical simulations	we analyze the dynamical and thermal evolution of dark matter and icm inhydrodynamical tree-sph simulations of galaxy clusters. starting from a sampleof 17 high-resolution objects, with virial mass ranging from 3 10^{14} to 1.710^{15} m_sun, we follow the build-up of the systems in dark matter and hot gasthrough the repeated merging of satellites along their merging history trees.we measure the self-bound mass fraction of subhaloes as a function of timeafter the merging, estimate the satellite mean orbital properties as a functionof the mass ratio with the main cluster at merging time, and study theevolution of their internal velocity dispersion, gas temperature and entropy asthe substructure is disrupted by various dynamical processes, reachingeventually thermo-dynamic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of themain cluster. we model some relevant properties of subhalo orbits, as the timeof the first pericentric and apocentric passages, and the typical distances andvelocities at the corresponding times. this survival study can be used tointerpret the dynamics of observed merging clusters; as an example we apply ourresults to the system 1e0657-56. we show that, in the light of our results, themost likely interpretation of the data for this cluster points to the merger ofa small group with mass m\approx 1 10^{13} m_sun with a massive cluster withm\approx 1.3 10^{15} m_sun.

astro-ph;0309405	a dynamical model for the distribution of dark matter and gas in galaxy  clusters	using high-resolution non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations of galaxyclusters we obtain simple analytic formulae for dm and gas distribution in thespherical approximation. we derive fits for the dm density, velocity dispersionand velocity anisotropy. we use these models to test the dynamical equilibriumhypothesis through the jeans equation: we find that this is satisfied to goodaccuracy. this result show that our fits constitute a self-consistent dynamicalmodel. we then extend our analysis to the gas, studying its density,temperature and velocity structure, with no further hypothesis on the dynamicalstatus or state equation. gas and dm show self-similar density profiles down to0.06 r_vir, while at smaller radii the gas produces a central core. gastemperatures are almost isothermal out to 0.2 r_vir, then steeply decreasereaching at r_vir a value a factor of 2 lower. we find that the gas is not atrest inside r_vir: velocity dispersions are increasing functions of the radius,motions are isotropic to slightly tangential, and contribute to the totalpressure support. we test our model using a generalization of the hydrostaticequilibrium equation, where the gas motion is properly taken into account. wefind that our fits provide an accurate description of the system: the gas is inequilibrium and is a good tracer the overall cluster potential if all terms aretaken into account, while simpler assumptions, as the beta-model, causesystematic mass underestimates. we also find that, if gas velocities areneglected, then a simple isothermal model fares better at large radii than anon-isothermal one.

astro-ph;0310898	the impact of cluster mergers on arc statistics	we study the impact of merger events on the strong lensing properties ofgalaxy clusters. previous lensing simulations were not able to resolvedynamical time scales of cluster lenses, which arise on time scales which areof order a gyr. in this case study, we first describe qualitatively with ananalytic model how some of the lensing properties of clusters are expected tochange during merging events. we then analyse a numerically simulated lensmodel for the variation in its efficiency for producing both tangential andradial arcs while a massive substructure falls onto the main cluster body. wefind that: (1) during the merger, the shape of the critical lines and causticschanges substantially; (2) the lensing cross sections for long and thin arcscan grow by one order of magnitude and reach their maxima when the extent ofthe critical curves is largest; (3) the cross section for radial arcs alsogrows, but the cluster can efficiently produce this kind of arcs only while themerging substructure crosses the main cluster centre; (4) while the arc crosssections pass through their maxima as the merger proceeds, the cluster's x-rayemission increases by a factor of $\sim5$. thus, we conclude that accountingfor these dynamical processes is very important for arc statistics studies. inparticular, they may provide a possible explanation for the arc statisticsproblem.

astro-ph;0606006	arc sensitivity to cluster ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures	we investigate how ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures separatelyaffect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.this is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constrainingcosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the innerstructure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. we do so by creatingtwo-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetricversions of some numerical models. on average, we find that the contributionsof ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% ofthe total strong lensing cross section, respectively. however, our analysisshows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical andasymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the clustercenters (~1mpc/h). conversely, their effect is less important in highlyasymmetric lenses. the morphology, position and flux of individual arcs arestrongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. removingsubstructures on spatial scales &lt;~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales&lt;~5 10^{10}m_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources usedin the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of thearcs longer than 5''. we conclude that any model for cluster lens cannotneglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. on the otherhand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitationallensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructuresand asymmetries in clusters.

astro-ph;9403065	testing the velocity field in non--scale invariant cold dark matter  models	we analyze the cosmic peculiar velocity field as traced by a sample of 1184spiral, elliptical and s0 galaxies, grouped in 704 objects. we perform astatistical analysis, by calculating the bulk flow, cosmic mach number andvelocity correlation function for this sample and for mock catalogs extractedfrom a set of n--body simulations. we run four cold dark matter (cdm)simulations: two tilted models (with spectral index $n=0.6$ and $n=0.8$), thestandard model ($n=1$) and a ``blue" one ($n=1.2$), with different values ofthe linear bias parameter $b$. by means of a maximum likelihood analysis weestimate the ability of our models to fit the observations, as measured by theabove statistics, and to reproduce the local group properties. on the basis ofthis analysis we conclude that the best model is the unbiased standard model$(n,~b)=(1,~1)$, even though the overall flatness of the joint likelihoodfunction implies that one cannot strongly discriminate models in the range $0.8\le n \le 1$, and $1 \le b \le 1.5$. models with $b \geq 2.5$ are rejected atthe $95\%$ confidence level. for $n=0.8$ the values of $b$ preferred by thepresent analysis, together with the {\em cobe} data, require a negligiblecontribution to $\delta t/t$ by gravitational waves. finally, the blue model,normalized to {\em cobe}, does not provide a good fit to the velocity data.

astro-ph;9501111	collisional versus collisionless matter: a one-dimensional analysis of  gravitational clustering	we present the results of a series of one-dimensional n-body andhydrodynamical simulations which have been used for testing the differentclustering properties of baryonic and dark matter in an expanding background.initial gaussian random density perturbations with a power-law spectrum $p(k)\propto k^n$ are assumed. we analyse the distribution of density fluctuationsand thermodynamical quantities for different spectral indices $n$ and discussthe statistical properties of clustering in the corresponding simulations. atlarge scales the final distribution of the two components is very similar whileat small scales the dark matter presents a lumpiness which is not found in thebaryonic matter. the amplitude of density fluctuations in each componentdepends on the spectral index $n$ and only for $n=-1$ the amplitude of baryonicdensity fluctuations is larger than that in the dark component. this result isalso confirmed by the behaviour of the bias factor, defined as the ratiobetween the r.m.s of baryonic and dark matter fluctuations at different scales:while for $n=1,\ 3$ it is always less than unity except at very large scaleswhere it tends to one, for $n=-1$ it is above 1.4 at all scales. allsimulations show also that there is not an exact correspondence between thepositions of largest peaks in dark and baryonic components, as confirmed by across-correlation analysis. the final temperatures depend on the initialspectral index: the highest values are obtained for $n=-1$ and are in proximityof high density regions.

astro-ph;9608004	redshift evolution of clustering	we discuss how the redshift dependence of the observed two-point correlationfunction of various classes of objects can be related to theoreticalpredictions. this relation involves first a calculation of the redshiftevolution of the underlying matter correlations. the next step is to relatefluctuations in mass to those of any particular class of cosmic objects; ingeneral terms, this means a model for the bias and how it evolves with cosmicepoch. only after these two effects have been quantified can one perform anappropriate convolution of the non-linearly evolved two-point correlationfunction of the objects with their redshift distribution to obtain the`observed' correlation function for a given sample. this convolution in itselftends to mask the effect of evolution by mixing amplitudes at differentredshifts. we develop a formalism which incorporates these requirements and, inparticular, a set of plausible models for the evolution of the bias factor. weapply this formalism to the spatial, angular and projected correlationfunctions from different samples of high-redshift objects, assuming a simplephenomenological model for the initial power-spectrum and an einstein-de sittercosmological model. we find that our model is roughly consistent with data onthe evolution of qso and galaxy clustering, but only if the effective degree ofbiasing is small. we discuss the differences between our analysis and othertheoretical studies of clustering evolution and argue that the dominant barrierto making definitive predictions is uncertainty about the appropriate form ofthe bias and its evolution with cosmic epoch.

astro-ph;9710096	constraining the cosmological baryon density with x-ray clusters	we study the properties of x-ray galaxy clusters in four cold dark mattermodels with different baryon fraction $\omega_{bm}$ ranging from 5 to 20 percent. by using an original three-dimensional hydrodynamic code based on thepiecewise parabolic method, we run simulations on a box with size $64 h^{-1}$mpc and we identify the clusters by selecting the peaks in the x-ray luminosityfield. we analyse these mock catalogues by computing the mass function, theluminosity function, the temperature distribution and theluminosity-temperature relation. by comparing the predictions of the differentmodels to a series of recent observational results, we find that only themodels with low baryonic content agree with the data, while models with largerbaryon fraction are well outside the 1-$\sigma$ errorbars. in particular, theanalysis of the luminosity functions, both bolometric and in the energy band[0.5--2] kev, requires $\omega_{bm}\mincir 0.05$ when we fix the values $h=0.5$and $n=0.8$ for the hubble parameter and the primordial spectral index,respectively. moreover we find that, independently of the cosmologicalscenario, all the considered quantities have a very little redshift evolution,particularly between $z=0.5$ and $z=0$.

astro-ph;9712184	modelling galaxy clustering at high redshift	we discuss the theoretical interpretation of observational data concerningthe clustering of galaxies at high redshifts. building on the theoreticalmachinery developed by matarrese et al.

astro-ph;9806028	large-scale bias in the universe ii: redshift space bispectrum	the determination of the density parameter $\omega_0$ from the large-scaledistribution of galaxies is one of the major goals of modern cosmology.however, if galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution,linear perturbation theory leads to a degeneracy between $\omega_0$ and thelinear bias parameter $b$, and the density parameter cannot be estimated. inmatarrese, verde &amp; heavens (1997) we developed a method based on second-orderperturbation theory to use the bispectrum to lift this degeneracy by measuringthe bias parameter in an $\omega_0$-independent way. the formalism wasdeveloped assuming that one has perfect information on the positions ofgalaxies in three dimensions. in galaxy redshift surveys, the three-dimensionalinformation is imperfect, because of the contaminating effects of peculiarvelocities, and the resulting clustering pattern in redshift space isdistorted. in this paper, we combine second-order perturbation theory with amodel for collapsed, virialised structures, to extend the method to redshiftspace, and demonstrate that the method should be successful in determining withreasonable accuracy the bias parameter from state-of-the-art surveys such asthe anglo-australian 2 degree field survey and the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;9902290	measuring and modelling the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble  deep field north	(abridged) the evolution of galaxy clustering from z=0 to z=4.5 is analyzedusing the angular correlation function and the photometric redshiftdistribution of galaxies brighter than i_{ab}\le 28.5 in the hdf north. thereliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis ofthe available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes andinvestigating the effects of photometric errors. the redshift bins in which theclustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account theuncertainties of the photometric redshifts. the results show that the comovingcorrelation length has a small decrease in the range 0&lt;z&lt;1 followed by anincrease at higher z. we compare these results with the theoretical predictionsof a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of cdm. thecomparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that theobserved high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with aneffective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. assuming an einstein-desitter universe, we obtain b\simeq 2 at z=2 and b\simeq 5 at z=4. a comparisonof the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z=3 with those reported forlbg suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: moreabundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm ofhierarchical galaxy formation. the strong clustering and high bias measured atz=3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted forthe various cosmologies here considered. at z=4, the strong clustering observedin the hdf requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be alreadyformed by that epoch. this feature could be a discriminant test for thecosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.

astro-ph;9909273	predicting the clustering of x-ray selected galaxy clusters in  flux-limited surveys	(abridged) we present a model to predict the clustering properties of x-rayclusters in flux-limited surveys. our technique correctly accounts for pastlight-cone effects on the observed clustering and follows the non-linearevolution in redshift of the underlying dm correlation function and clusterbias factor. the conversion of the limiting flux of a survey into thecorresponding minimum mass of the hosting dm haloes is obtained by usingtheoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature and x-rayluminosity of clusters. finally, our model is calibrated to reproduce theobserved cluster counts adopting a temperature-luminosity relation moderatelyevolving with redshift. we apply our technique to three existing catalogues:bcs, xbacs and reflex samples. moreover, we consider an example of possiblefuture space missions with fainter limiting flux. in general, we find that theamplitude of the spatial correlation function is a decreasing function of thelimiting flux and that the eds models always give smaller correlationamplitudes than open or flat models with low matter density parameter. in thecase of xbacs, the comparison with previous estimates of the observationalspatial correlation shows that only the predictions of models with omega_0m=0.3are in good agreement with the data, while the eds models have too low acorrelation strength. finally, we use our technique to discuss the beststrategy for future surveys. our results show that the choice of a wide areacatalogue, even with a brighter limiting flux, is preferable to a deeper, butwith smaller area, survey.

0812.0003	modeling the cosmological co-evolution of supermassive black holes and  galaxies: ii. the clustering of quasars and their dark environment	we use semi-analytic modeling on top of the millennium simulation to studythe joint formation of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes.  our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasaractivity are triggered by galaxy mergers, and to constrain different models forthe lightcurves associated with individual quasar events. in the present workwe focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars. at allluminosities, we find that the simulated quasar two-point correlation functionis fit well by a single power-law in the range 0.5 &lt; r &lt; 20 h^{-1} mpc, but itsnormalization is a strong function of redshift. when we select only quasarswith luminosities within the range typically accessible by today's quasarsurveys, their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity, inagreement with observations. this holds independently of the assumed lightcurvemodel, since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the eddingtonlimit, and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few10^12 h^{-1} m_sun. therefore the clustering of bright quasars cannot be usedto disentangle lightcurve models, but such a discrimination would becomepossible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainterlimits.  overall, our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agreerather well with observations, lending support to the conjecture that galaxymergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering blackhole accretion and quasar activity.
