0812.4449	extra shared entanglement reduces memory demand in quantum convolutional  coding	we show how extra entanglement shared between sender and receiver reduces thememory requirements for a general entanglement-assisted quantum convolutionalcode. we construct quantum convolutional codes with good error-correctingproperties by exploiting the error-correcting properties of an arbitrary basicset of pauli generators. the main benefit of this particular construction isthat there is no need to increase the frame size of the code when extra sharedentanglement is available. then there is no need to increase the memoryrequirements or circuit complexity of the code because the frame size of thecode is directly related to these two code properties. another benefit, similarto results of previous work in entanglement-assisted convolutional coding, isthat we can import an arbitrary classical quaternary code for use as anentanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code. the rate and error-correctingproperties of the imported classical code translate to the quantum code. weprovide an example that illustrates how to import a classical quaternary codefor use as an entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code. we finally showhow to "piggyback" classical information to make use of the extra sharedentanglement in the code.

0901.3038	trading classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement  in quantum shannon theory	we give trade-offs between classical communication, quantum communication,and entanglement for processing information in the shannon-theoretic setting.we first prove a unit-resource capacity theorem that applies to the scenariowhere only the above three noiseless resources are available for consumption orgeneration. the optimal strategy mixes the three fundamental protocols ofteleportation, super-dense coding, and entanglement distribution. we thenprovide an achievable rate region and a matching multi-letter converse for thedirect static capacity theorem. this theorem applies to the scenario where alarge number of copies of a noisy bipartite state are available (in addition toconsumption or generation of the above three noiseless resources). our codingstrategy involves a protocol that we name the classically-assisted stateredistribution protocol and the three fundamental protocols. we finally providean achievable rate region and a matching mutli-letter converse for the directdynamic capacity theorem. this theorem applies to the scenario where a largenumber of uses of a noisy quantum channel are available in addition to theconsumption or generation of the three noiseless resources. our coding strategycombines the classically-enhanced father protocol with the three fundamentalunit protocols.

0912.2150	nonlocal quantum information in bipartite quantum error correction	we show how to convert an arbitrary stabilizer code into a bipartite quantumcode. a bipartite quantum code is one that involves two senders and onereceiver. the two senders exploit both nonlocal and local quantum resources toencode quantum information with local encoding circuits. they transmit theirencoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmittedquantum information. the nonlocal resources in a bipartite code are ebits andnonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and localinformation qubits. the technique of bipartite quantum error correction isuseful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and infault-tolerant quantum computation. it has application in fault-tolerantquantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline andexploit local encoding circuits. in particular, we derive an encoding circuitfor a bipartite version of the steane code that is local and additionallyrequires only nearest-neighbor interactions. we have simulated this encoding inthe cnot extended rectangle with a publicly available fault-tolerant simulationsoftware. the result is that there is an improvement in the "pseudothreshold"with respect to the baseline steane code, under the assumption that quantummemory errors occur less frequently than quantum gate errors.

0912.5112	identifying the quantum correlations in light-harvesting complexes	one of the major efforts in the quantum biological program is to subjectbiological systems to standard tests or measures of quantumness. these testsand measures should elucidate if non-trivial quantum effects may be present inbiological systems. two such measures of quantum correlations are the quantumdiscord and the relative entropy of entanglement. here, we show that therelative entropy of entanglement admits a simple analytic form when dynamicsand accessible degrees of freedom are restricted to a zero- andsingle-excitation subspace. we also simulate and calculate the amount ofquantum discord that is present in the fenna-matthews-olson protein complexduring the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reactioncenter. we find that the single-excitation quantum discord and relative entropyof entanglement are equal for all of our numerical simulations, but a proof oftheir general equality for this setting evades us for now. also, some of oursimulations demonstrate that the relative entropy of entanglement without thesingle-excitation restriction is much lower than the quantum discord. the firstpicosecond of dynamics is the relevant timescale for the transfer of theexcitation, according to some sources in the literature. our simulation resultsindicate that quantum correlations contribute a significant fraction of thetotal correlation during this first picosecond in many cases, at both cryogenicand physiological temperature.

1001.1732	trade-off capacities of the quantum hadamard channels	coding theorems in quantum shannon theory express the ultimate rates at whicha sender can transmit information over a noisy quantum channel. more often thannot, the known formulas expressing these transmission rates are intractable,requiring an optimization over an infinite number of uses of the channel.researchers have rarely found quantum channels with a tractable classical orquantum capacity, but when such a finding occurs, it demonstrates a completeunderstanding of that channel's capabilities for transmitting classical orquantum information. here, we show that the three-dimensional capacity regionfor entanglement-assisted transmission of classical and quantum information istractable for the hadamard class of channels. examples of hadamard channelsinclude generalized dephasing channels, cloning channels, and the unruhchannel. the generalized dephasing channels and the cloning channels arenatural processes that occur in quantum systems through the loss of quantumcoherence or stimulated emission, respectively. the unruh channel is a noisyprocess that occurs in relativistic quantum information theory as a result ofthe unruh effect and bears a strong relationship to the cloning channels. wegive exact formulas for the entanglement-assisted classical and quantumcommunication capacity regions of these channels. the coding strategy for eachof these examples is superior to a naive time-sharing strategy, and weintroduce a measure to determine this improvement.

1001.1777	addressing the clumsiness loophole in a leggett-garg test of  macrorealism	the rise of quantum information theory has lent new relevance to experimentaltests for non-classicality, particularly in controversial cases such asadiabatic quantum computing superconducting circuits. the leggett-garginequality is a "bell inequality in time" designed to indicate whether a singlequantum system behaves in a macrorealistic fashion. unfortunately, a violationof the inequality can only show that the system is either (i)non-macrorealistic or (ii) macrorealistic but subjected to a measurementtechnique that happens to disturb the system. the "clumsiness" loophole (ii)provides reliable refuge for the stubborn macrorealist, who can invoke it tobrand recent experimental and theoretical work on the leggett-garg testinconclusive. here, we present a revised leggett-garg protocol that permits oneto conclude that a system is either (i) non-macrorealistic or (ii)macrorealistic but with the property that two seemingly non-invasivemeasurements can somehow collude and strongly disturb the system. by providingan explicit check of the invasiveness of the measurements, the protocolreplaces the clumsiness loophole with a significantly smaller "collusion"loophole.

1004.0458	the quantum dynamic capacity formula of a quantum channel	the dynamic capacity theorem characterizes the reliable communication ratesof a quantum channel when combined with the noiseless resources of classicalcommunication, quantum communication, and entanglement. in prior work, weproved the converse part of this theorem by making contact with many previousresults in the quantum shannon theory literature. in this work, we prove thetheorem with an "ab initio" approach, using only the most basic tools in thequantum information theorist's toolkit: the alicki-fannes' inequality, thechain rule for quantum mutual information, elementary properties of quantumentropy, and the quantum data processing inequality. the result is a simplifiedproof of the theorem that should be more accessible to those unfamiliar withthe quantum shannon theory literature. we also demonstrate that the "quantumdynamic capacity formula" characterizes the pareto optimal trade-off surfacefor the full dynamic capacity region. additivity of this formula simplifies thecomputation of the trade-off surface, and we prove that its additivity holdsfor the quantum hadamard channels and the quantum erasure channel. we thendetermine exact expressions for and plot the dynamic capacity region of thequantum dephasing channel, an example from the hadamard class, and the quantumerasure channel.

1004.5179	minimal memory requirements for pearl-necklace encoders of quantum  convolutional codes	one of the major goals in quantum information processing is to reduce theoverhead associated with the practical implementation of quantum protocols, andoften, routines for quantum error correction account for most of this overhead.a particular technique for quantum error correction that may be useful forprotecting a stream of quantum information is quantum convolutional coding. theencoder for a quantum convolutional code has a representation as aconvolutional encoder or as a "pearl-necklace" encoder. in the pearl-necklacerepresentation, it has not been particularly clear in the research literaturehow much quantum memory such an encoder would require for implementation. here,we offer an algorithm that answers this question. the algorithm firstconstructs a weighted, directed acyclic graph where each vertex of the graphcorresponds to a gate string in the pearl-necklace encoder, and each paththrough the graph represents a path through non-commuting gates in the encoder.we show that the weight of the longest path through the graph is equal to theminimal amount of memory needed to implement the encoder. a dynamic programmingsearch through this graph determines the longest path. the running time for theconstruction of the graph and search through it is quadratic in the number ofgate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.

1010.1256	entanglement-assisted quantum turbo codes	an unexpected breakdown in the existing theory of quantum serial turbo codingis that a quantum convolutional encoder cannot simultaneously be recursive andnon-catastrophic. these properties are essential for quantum turbo codefamilies to have a minimum distance growing with blocklength and for theiriterative decoding algorithm to converge, respectively. here, we show that theentanglement-assisted paradigm simplifies the theory of quantum turbo codes, inthe sense that an entanglement-assisted quantum (eaq) convolutional encoder canpossess both of the aforementioned desirable properties. we give severalexamples of eaq convolutional encoders that are both recursive andnon-catastrophic and detail their relevant parameters. we then modify thequantum turbo decoding algorithm of poulin et al., in order to have theconstituent decoders pass along only "extrinsic information" to each otherrather than a posteriori probabilities as in the decoder of poulin et al., andthis leads to a significant improvement in the performance of unassistedquantum turbo codes. other simulation results indicate thatentanglement-assisted turbo codes can operate reliably in a noise regime 4.73db beyond that of standard quantum turbo codes, when used on a memorylessdepolarizing channel. furthermore, several of our quantum turbo codes arewithin 1 db or less of their hashing limits, so that the performance of quantumturbo codes is now on par with that of classical turbo codes. finally, we provethat entanglement is the resource that enables a convolutional encoder to beboth non-catastrophic and recursive because an encoder acting on onlyinformation qubits, classical bits, gauge qubits, and ancilla qubits cannotsimultaneously satisfy them.

1102.2624	classical communication over a quantum interference channel	calculating the capacity of interference channels is a notorious open problemin classical information theory. such channels have two senders and tworeceivers, and each sender would like to communicate with a partner receiver.the capacity of such channels is known exactly in the settings of "very strong"and "strong" interference, while the han-kobayashi coding strategy gives thebest known achievable rate region in the general case. here, we introduce andstudy the quantum interference channel, a natural generalization of theinterference channel to the setting of quantum information theory. we restrictourselves for the most part to channels with two classical inputs and twoquantum outputs in order to simplify the presentation of our results (thoughgeneralizations of our results to channels with quantum inputs arestraightforward). we are able to determine the exact classical capacity of thischannel in the settings of "very strong" and "strong" interference, byexploiting winter's successive decoding strategy and a novel two-sender quantumsimultaneous decoder, respectively. we provide a proof that a han-kobayashistrategy is achievable with holevo information rates, up to a conjectureregarding the existence of a three-sender quantum simultaneous decoder. thisconjecture holds for a special class of quantum multiple access channels withaverage output states that commute, and we discuss some other variations of theconjecture that hold. finally, we detail a connection between the quantuminterference channel and prior work on the capacity of bipartite unitary gates.

1102.2627	the free space optical interference channel	semiclassical models for multiple-user optical communication cannot assessthe ultimate limits on reliable communication as permitted by the laws ofphysics. in all optical communications settings that have been analyzed withina quantum framework so far, the gaps between the quantum limit to the capacityand the shannon limit for structured receivers become most significant in thelow photon-number regime. here, we present a quantum treatment of amultiple-transmitter multiple-receiver multi-spatial-mode free-spaceinterference channel with diffraction-limited loss and a thermal background. weconsider the performance of a laser-light (coherent state) encoding inconjunction with various detection strategies such as homodyne, heterodyne, andjoint detection. joint detection outperforms both homodyne and heterodynedetection whenever the channel exhibits "very strong" interference. wedetermine the capacity region for homodyne or heterodyne detection when thechannel has "strong" interference, and we conjecture the existence of a jointdetection strategy that outperforms the former two strategies in this case.finally, we determine the han-kobayashi achievable rate regions for bothhomodyne and heterodyne detection and compare them to a region achievable by aconjectured joint detection strategy. in these latter cases, we determineachievable rate regions if the receivers employ a recently discoveredmin-entropy quantum simultaneous decoder.

1103.0286	trade-off coding for universal qudit cloners motivated by the unruh  effect	a "triple trade-off" capacity region of a noisy quantum channel provides amore complete description of its capabilities than does a single capacityformula. however, few full descriptions of a channel's ability have been givendue to the difficult nature of the calculation of such regions---it may demandan optimization of information-theoretic quantities over an infinite number ofchannel uses. this work analyzes the d-dimensional unruh channel, a noisyquantum channel which emerges in relativistic quantum information theory. weshow that this channel belongs to the class of quantum channels whose capacityregion requires an optimization over a single channel use, and as such istractable. we determine two triple-trade off regions, the quantum dynamiccapacity region and the private dynamic capacity region, of the d-dimensionalunruh channel. our results show that the set of achievable rate triples usingthis coding strategy is larger than the set achieved using a time-sharingstrategy. furthermore, we prove that the unruh channel has a distinct structuremade up of universal qudit cloning channels, thus providing a clearrelationship between this relativistic channel and the process of stimulatedemission present in quantum optical amplifiers.

1105.0119	quantum trade-off coding for bosonic communication	the trade-off capacity region of a quantum channel characterizes the optimalnet rates at which a sender can communicate classical, quantum, and entangledbits to a receiver by exploiting many independent uses of the channel, alongwith the help of the same resources. similarly, one can consider a trade-offcapacity region when the noiseless resources are public, private, and secretkey bits. in [phys. rev. lett. 108, 140501 (2012)], we identified thesetrade-off rate regions for the pure-loss bosonic channel and proved that theyare optimal provided that a longstanding minimum output entropy conjecture istrue. additionally, we showed that the performance gains of a trade-off codingstrategy when compared to a time-sharing strategy can be quite significant. inthe present paper, we provide detailed derivations of the results announcedthere, and we extend the application of these ideas to thermalizing andamplifying bosonic channels. we also derive a "rule of thumb" for trade-offcoding, which determines how to allocate photons in a coding strategy if alarge mean photon number is available at the channel input. our results on theamplifying bosonic channel also apply to the "unruh channel" considered in thecontext of relativistic quantum information theory.

1107.1347	sequential, successive, and simultaneous decoders for  entanglement-assisted classical communication	bennett et al. showed that allowing shared entanglement between a sender andreceiver before communication begins dramatically simplifies the theory ofquantum channels, and these results suggest that it would be worthwhile tostudy other scenarios for entanglement-assisted classical communication. inthis vein, the present paper makes several contributions to the theory ofentanglement-assisted classical communication. first, we rephrase thegiovannetti-lloyd-maccone sequential decoding argument as a more general"packing lemma" and show that it gives an alternate way of achieving theentanglement-assisted classical capacity. next, we show that a similarsequential decoder can achieve the hsieh-devetak-winter region forentanglement-assisted classical communication over a multiple access channel.third, we prove the existence of a quantum simultaneous decoder forentanglement-assisted classical communication over a multiple access channelwith two senders. this result implies a solution of the quantum simultaneousdecoding conjecture for unassisted classical communication over quantummultiple access channels with two senders, but the three-sender case stillremains open (sen recently and independently solved this unassisted two-sendercase with a different technique). we then leverage this result to recover theknown regions for unassisted and assisted quantum communication over a quantummultiple access channel, though our proof exploits a coherent quantumsimultaneous decoder. finally, we determine an achievable rate region forcommunication over an entanglement-assisted bosonic multiple access channel andcompare it with the yen-shapiro outer bound for unassisted communication overthe same channel.

1108.4940	quantum rate distortion, reverse shannon theorems, and source-channel  separation	we derive quantum counterparts of two key theorems of classical informationtheory, namely, the rate distortion theorem and the source-channel separationtheorem. the rate-distortion theorem gives the ultimate limits on lossy datacompression, and the source-channel separation theorem implies that a two-stageprotocol consisting of compression and channel coding is optimal fortransmitting a memoryless source over a memoryless channel. in spite of theirimportance in the classical domain, there has been surprisingly little work inthese areas for quantum information theory. in the present paper, we prove thatthe quantum rate distortion function is given in terms of the regularizedentanglement of purification. we also determine a single-letter expression forthe entanglement-assisted quantum rate distortion function, and we prove thatit serves as a lower bound on the unassisted quantum rate distortion function.this implies that the unassisted quantum rate distortion function isnon-negative and generally not equal to the coherent information between thesource and distorted output (in spite of barnum's conjecture that the coherentinformation would be relevant here). moreover, we prove several quantumsource-channel separation theorems. the strongest of these are in theentanglement-assisted setting, in which we establish a necessary and sufficientcodition for transmitting a memoryless source over a memoryless quantum channelup to a given distortion.

1109.2591	polar codes for classical-quantum channels	holevo, schumacher, and westmoreland's coding theorem guarantees theexistence of codes that are capacity-achieving for the task of sendingclassical data over a channel with classical inputs and quantum outputs.although they demonstrated the existence of such codes, their proof does notprovide an explicit construction of codes for this task. the aim of the presentpaper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit "polar" codes that arecapacity-achieving. the codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenonobserved by arikan for the case of classical channels. channel polarization isan effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by "channel combining"and "channel splitting," in which a fraction of the synthesized channels areperfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely uselessfor data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of thechannel. the channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for datatransmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and"frozen" bits through the useless ones. the main technical contributions of thepresent paper are threefold. first, we leverage several known results from thequantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarizationeffect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. we thenconstruct linear polar codes based on this effect, and the encoding complexityis o(n log n), where n is the blocklength of the code. we also demonstrate thata quantum successive cancellation decoder works well, in the sense that theword error rate decays exponentially with the blocklength of the code. for thislast result, we exploit sen's recent "non-commutative union bound" that holdsfor a sequence of projectors applied to a quantum state.

1109.4147	stochastic resonance in gaussian quantum channels	we determine conditions for the presence of stochastic resonance in a lossybosonic channel with a nonlinear, threshold decoding. the stochastic resonanceeffect occurs if and only if the detection threshold is outside of a "forbiddeninterval". we show that it takes place in different settings: when transmittingclassical messages through a lossy bosonic channel, when transmitting over anentanglement-assisted lossy bosonic channel, and when discriminating channelswith different loss parameters. moreover, we consider a setting in whichstochastic resonance occurs in the transmission of a qubit over a lossy bosonicchannel with a particular encoding and decoding. in all cases, we assume theaddition of gaussian noise to the signal and show that it does not matter who,between sender and receiver, introduces such a noise. remarkably, differentresults are obtained when considering a setting for private communication. inthis case the symmetry between sender and receiver is broken and the "forbiddeninterval" may vanish, leading to the occurrence of stochastic resonance effectsfor any value of the detection threshold.

1109.5346	polar codes for degradable quantum channels	channel polarization is a phenomenon in which a particular recursive encodinginduces a set of synthesized channels from many instances of a memorylesschannel, such that a fraction of the synthesized channels becomes near perfectfor data transmission and the other fraction becomes near useless for thistask. mahdavifar and vardy have recently exploited this phenomenon to constructcodes that achieve the symmetric private capacity for private data transmissionover a degraded wiretap channel. in the current paper, we build on their workand demonstrate how to construct quantum wiretap polar codes that achieve thesymmetric private capacity of a degraded quantum wiretap channel with aclassical eavesdropper. due to the schumacher-westmoreland correspondencebetween quantum privacy and quantum coherence, we can construct quantum polarcodes by operating these quantum wiretap polar codes in superposition, muchlike devetak's technique for demonstrating the achievability of the coherentinformation rate for quantum data transmission. our scheme achieves thesymmetric coherent information rate for quantum channels that are degradablewith a classical environment. this condition on the environment may seemrestrictive, but we show that many quantum channels satisfy this criterion,including amplitude damping channels, photon-detected jump channels, dephasingchannels, erasure channels, and cloning channels. our quantum polar codingscheme has the desirable properties of being channel-adapted and symmetriccapacity-achieving along with having an efficient encoder, but we have notdemonstrated that the decoding is efficient. also, the scheme may requireentanglement assistance, but we show that the rate of entanglement consumptionvanishes in the limit of large blocklength if the channel is degradable withclassical environment.

1202.0533	polar coding to achieve the holevo capacity of a pure-loss optical  channel	in the low-energy high-energy-efficiency regime of classical opticalcommunications---relevant to deep-space optical channels---there is a big gapbetween reliable communication rates achievable via conventional opticalreceivers and the ultimate (holevo) capacity. achieving the holevo capacityrequires not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collectivemeasurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is impossible toimplement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection alongwith classical postprocessing. here, we apply our recent results on theclassical-quantum polar code---the first near-explicit, linear,symmetric-holevo-rate achieving code---to the lossy optical channel, and weshow that it almost closes the entire gap to the holevo capacity in the lowphoton number regime. in contrast, arikan's original polar codes, applied tothe dmc induced by the physical optical channel paired with any conceivablestructured optical receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, ordirect-detection) fails to achieve the ultimate holevo limit to channelcapacity. however, our polar code construction (which uses the quantum fidelityas a channel parameter rather than the classical bhattacharyya quantity tochoose the "good channels" in the polar-code construction), paired with aquantum successive-cancellation receiver---which involves a sequence ofcollective non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint quantumstate of the received codeword waveform---can attain the holevo limit, and canhence in principle achieve higher rates than arikan's polar code and decoderdirectly applied to the optical channel. however, even a theoretical recipe forconstruction of an optical realization of the quantum successive-cancellationreceiver remains an open question.

1212.2537	polar codes for private and quantum communication over arbitrary  channels	we construct new polar coding schemes for the transmission of quantum orprivate classical information over arbitrary quantum channels. in the formercase, our coding scheme achieves the symmetric coherent information and in thelatter the symmetric private information. both schemes are built from a polarcoding construction capable of transmitting classical information over aquantum channel [wilde and guha, ieee transactions on information theory, inpress]. appropriately merging two such classical-quantum schemes, one fortransmitting "amplitude" information and the other for transmitting "phase,"leads to the new private and quantum coding schemes, similar to theconstruction for pauli and erasure channels in [renes, dupuis, and renner,physical review letters 109, 050504 (2012)]. the encoding is entirely similarto the classical case, and thus efficient. the decoding can also be performedby successive cancellation, as in the classical case, but no efficientsuccessive cancellation scheme is yet known for arbitrary quantum channels. anefficient code construction is unfortunately still unknown. generally, our twocoding schemes require entanglement or secret-key assistance, respectively, butwe extend two known conditions under which the needed assistance rate vanishes.finally, although our results are formulated for qubit channels, we show howthe scheme can be extended to multiple qubits. this then demonstrates anear-explicit coding method for realizing one of the most striking phenomena inquantum information theory: the superactivation effect, whereby two quantumchannels which individually have zero quantum capacity can have a non-zeroquantum capacity when used together.

1212.5316	quantum rate distortion coding with auxiliary resources	we extend quantum rate distortion theory by considering auxiliary resourcesthat might be available to a sender and receiver performing lossy quantum datacompression. the first setting we consider is that of quantum rate distortioncoding with the help of a classical side channel. our result here is that theregularized entanglement of formation characterizes the quantum rate distortionfunction, extending earlier work of devetak and berger. we also combine thisbound with the entanglement-assisted bound from our prior work to obtain thebest known bounds on the quantum rate distortion function for an isotropicqubit source. the second setting we consider is that of quantum rate distortioncoding with quantum side information (qsi) available to the receiver. in orderto prove results in this setting, we first state and prove a quantum reverseshannon theorem with qsi (for tensor-power states), which extends the knowntensor-power quantum reverse shannon theorem. the achievability part of thistheorem relies on the quantum state redistribution protocol, while the converserelies on the fact that the protocol can cause only a negligible disturbance tothe joint state of the reference and the receiver's qsi. this quantum reverseshannon theorem with qsi naturally leads to quantum rate-distortion theoremswith qsi, with or without entanglement assistance.

1301.1594	identifying the information gain of a quantum measurement	we show that quantum-to-classical channels, i.e., quantum measurements, canbe asymptotically simulated by an amount of classical communication equal tothe quantum mutual information of the measurement, if sufficient sharedrandomness is available. this result generalizes winter's measurementcompression theorem for fixed independent and identically distributed inputs[winter, cmp 244 (157), 2004] to arbitrary inputs, and more importantly, itidentifies the quantum mutual information of a measurement as the informationgained by performing it, independent of the input state on which it isperformed. our result is a generalization of the classical reverse shannontheorem to quantum-to-classical channels. in this sense, it can be seen as aquantum reverse shannon theorem for quantum-to-classical channels, but with theentanglement assistance and quantum communication replaced by shared randomnessand classical communication, respectively. the proof is based on a novelone-shot state merging protocol for "classically coherent states" as well asthe post-selection technique for quantum channels, and it uses techniquesdeveloped for the quantum reverse shannon theorem [berta et al., cmp 306 (579),2011].

1302.0398	towards efficient decoding of classical-quantum polar codes	known strategies for sending bits at the capacity rate over a general channelwith classical input and quantum output (a cq channel) require the decoder toimplement impractically complicated collective measurements. here, we show thata fully collective strategy is not necessary in order to recover all of theinformation bits. in fact, when coding for a large number n uses of a cqchannel w, n i(w_acc) of the bits can be recovered by a non-collective strategywhich amounts to coherent quantum processing of the results of productmeasurements, where i(w_acc) is the accessible information of the channel w. inorder to decode the other n (i(w) - i(w_acc)) bits, where i(w) is the holevorate, our conclusion is that the receiver should employ collectivemeasurements. we also present two other results: 1) collective fuchs-cavesmeasurements (quantum likelihood ratio measurements) can be used at thereceiver to achieve the holevo rate and 2) we give an explicit form of thehelstrom measurements used in small-size polar codes. the main approach used todemonstrate these results is a quantum extension of arikan's polar codes.

1303.0808	sequential decoding of a general classical-quantum channel	since a quantum measurement generally disturbs the state of a quantum system,one might think that it should not be possible for a sender and receiver tocommunicate reliably when the receiver performs a large number of sequentialmeasurements to determine the message of the sender. we show here that thisintuition is not true, by demonstrating that a sequential decoding strategyworks well even in the most general "one-shot" regime, where we are given asingle instance of a channel and wish to determine the maximal number of bitsthat can be communicated up to a small failure probability. this result followsby generalizing a non-commutative union bound to apply for a sequence ofgeneral measurements. we also demonstrate two ways in which a receiver canrecover a state close to the original state after it has been decoded by asequence of measurements that each succeed with high probability. the second ofthese methods will be useful in realizing an efficient decoder for fullyquantum polar codes, should a method ever be found to realize an efficientdecoder for classical-quantum polar codes.

1306.1586	strong converse for the classical capacity of entanglement-breaking and  hadamard channels via a sandwiched renyi relative entropy	a strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of a quantum channelstates that the probability of correctly decoding a classical message convergesexponentially fast to zero in the limit of many channel uses if the rate ofcommunication exceeds the classical capacity of the channel. along with acorresponding achievability statement for rates below the capacity, such astrong converse theorem enhances our understanding of the capacity as a verysharp dividing line between achievable and unachievable rates of communication.here, we show that such a strong converse theorem holds for the classicalcapacity of all entanglement-breaking channels and all hadamard channels (thecomplementary channels of the former). these results follow by bounding thesuccess probability in terms of a "sandwiched" renyi relative entropy, byshowing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking andhadamard channels, and by relating this quantity to the holevo capacity. priorresults regarding strong converse theorems for particular covariant channelsemerge as a special case of our results.

1306.1795	quantum state cloning using deutschian closed timelike curves	we show that it is possible to clone quantum states to arbitrary accuracy inthe presence of a deutschian closed timelike curve (d-ctc), with a fidelityconverging to one in the limit as the dimension of the ctc system becomeslarge---thus resolving an open conjecture from [brun et al., physical reviewletters 102, 210402 (2009)]. this result follows from a d-ctc-assisted schemefor producing perfect clones of a quantum state prepared in a known eigenbasis,and the fact that one can reconstruct an approximation of a quantum state fromempirical estimates of the probabilities of an informationally-completemeasurement. our results imply more generally that every continuous, butotherwise arbitrarily non-linear map from states to states can be implementedto arbitrary accuracy with d-ctcs. furthermore, our results show that deutsch'smodel for ctcs is in fact a classical model, in the sense that two arbitrary,distinct density operators are perfectly distinguishable (in the limit of alarge ctc system); hence, in this model quantum mechanics becomes a classicaltheory in which each density operator is a distinct point in a classical phasespace.

1307.5368	quantum enigma machines and the locking capacity of a quantum channel	the locking effect is a phenomenon which is unique to quantum informationtheory and represents one of the strongest separations between the classicaland quantum theories of information. the fawzi-hayden-sen (fhs) lockingprotocol harnesses this effect in a cryptographic context, whereby one partycan encode n bits into n qubits while using only a constant-size secret key.the encoded message is then secure against any measurement that an eavesdroppercould perform in an attempt to recover the message, but the protocol does notnecessarily meet the composability requirements needed in quantum keydistribution applications. in any case, the locking effect represents anextreme violation of shannon's classical theorem, which states thatinformation-theoretic security holds in the classical case if and only if thesecret key is the same size as the message. given this intriguing phenomenon,it is of practical interest to study the effect in the presence of noise, whichcan occur in the systems of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.this paper formally defines the locking capacity of a quantum channel as themaximum amount of locked information that can be reliably transmitted to alegitimate receiver by exploiting many independent uses of a quantum channeland an amount of secret key sublinear in the number of channel uses. we providegeneral operational bounds on the locking capacity in terms of other well-knowncapacities from quantum shannon theory. we also study the important case ofbosonic channels, finding limitations on these channels' locking capacity whencoherent-state encodings are employed and particular locking protocols forthese channels that might be physically implementable.

1308.6732	strong converse for the classical capacity of the pure-loss bosonic  channel	this paper strengthens the interpretation and understanding of the classicalcapacity of the pure-loss bosonic channel, first established in [giovannetti etal., physical review letters 92, 027902 (2004), arxiv:quant-ph/0308012]. inparticular, we first prove that there exists a trade-off between communicationrate and error probability if one imposes only a mean-photon number constrainton the channel inputs. that is, if we demand that the mean number of photons atthe channel input cannot be any larger than some positive number n_s, then itis possible to respect this constraint with a code that operates at a rateg(\eta n_s / (1-p)) where p is the code's error probability, \eta\ is thechannel transmissivity, and g(x) is the entropy of a bosonic thermal state withmean photon number x. we then prove that a strong converse theorem holds forthe classical capacity of this channel (that such a rate-error trade-off cannotoccur) if one instead demands for a maximum photon number constraint, in such away that mostly all of the "shadow" of the average density operator for a givencode is required to be on a subspace with photon number no larger than n n_s,so that the shadow outside this subspace vanishes as the number n of channeluses becomes large. finally, we prove that a small modification of thewell-known coherent-state coding scheme meets this more demanding constraint.

1310.0129	the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel	this paper defines the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as themaximum squashed entanglement that can be registered by a sender and receiverat the input and output of a quantum channel, respectively. a new subadditivityinequality for the original squashed entanglement measure of christandl andwinter leads to the conclusion that the squashed entanglement of a quantumchannel is an additive function of a tensor product of any two quantumchannels. more importantly, this new subadditivity inequality, along with priorresults of christandl, winter, et al., establishes the squashed entanglement ofa quantum channel as an upper bound on the quantum communication capacity ofany channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical communication.a similar proof establishes this quantity as an upper bound on the privatecapacity of a quantum channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward publicclassical communication. this latter result is relevant as a limitation onrates achievable in quantum key distribution. as an important application, wedetermine that these capacities can never exceed log((1+eta)/(1-eta)) for apure-loss bosonic channel for which a fraction eta of the input photons make itto the output on average. the best known lower bound on these capacities isequal to log(1/(1-eta)). thus, in the high-loss regime for which eta &lt;&lt; 1, thisnew upper bound demonstrates that the protocols corresponding to the abovelower bound are nearly optimal.

1310.7028	multiplicativity of completely bounded $p$-norms implies a strong  converse for entanglement-assisted capacity	the fully quantum reverse shannon theorem establishes the optimal rate ofnoiseless classical communication required for simulating the action of manyinstances of a noisy quantum channel on an arbitrary input state, while alsoallowing for an arbitrary amount of shared entanglement of an arbitrary form.turning this theorem around establishes a strong converse for theentanglement-assisted classical capacity of any quantum channel. this paperproves the strong converse for entanglement-assisted capacity by a completelydifferent approach and identifies a bound on the strong converse exponent forthis task. namely, we exploit the recent entanglement-assisted "meta-converse"theorem of matthews and wehner, several properties of the recently establishedsandwiched renyi relative entropy (also referred to as the quantum renyidivergence), and the multiplicativity of completely bounded $p$-norms due todevetak et al. the proof here demonstrates the extent to which the arimotoapproach can be helpful in proving strong converse theorems, it provides anoperational relevance for the multiplicativity result of devetak et al., and itadds to the growing body of evidence that the sandwiched renyi relative entropyis the correct quantum generalization of the classical concept for all$\alpha&gt;1$.

1311.5212	robust quantum data locking from phase modulation	quantum data locking is a unique quantum phenomenon that allows a relativelyshort key to (un)lock an arbitrarily long message encoded in a quantum state,in such a way that an eavesdropper who measures the state but does not know thekey has essentially no information about the encrypted message. the applicationof quantum data locking in cryptography would allow one to overcome thelimitations of the one-time pad encryption, which requires the key to have thesame length as the message. however, it is known that the strength of quantumdata locking is also its achilles heel, as the leakage of a few bits of the keyor the message may in principle allow the eavesdropper to unlock adisproportionate amount of information. in this paper we show that there existquantum data locking schemes that can be made robust against informationleakage by increasing the length of the shared key by a proportionate amount.this implies that a constant size key can still encrypt an arbitrarily longmessage as long as a fraction of it remains secret to the eavesdropper.moreover, we greatly simplify the structure of the protocol by proving thatphase modulation suffices to generate strong locking schemes, paving the way tooptical experimental realizations. also, we show that successful data lockingprotocols can be constructed using random codewords, which very well could behelpful in discovering random codes for data locking over noisy quantumchannels.

1312.3287	strong converse rates for classical communication over thermal and  additive noise bosonic channels	we prove that several known upper bounds on the classical capacity of thermaland additive noise bosonic channels are actually strong converse rates. ourresults strengthen the interpretation of these upper bounds, in the sense thatwe now know that the probability of correctly decoding a classical messagerapidly converges to zero in the limit of many channel uses if thecommunication rate exceeds these upper bounds. in order for these theorems tohold, we need to impose a maximum photon number constraint on the states inputto the channel (the strong converse property need not hold if there is only amean photon number constraint). our first theorem demonstrates that koenig andsmith's upper bound on the classical capacity of the thermal bosonic channel isa strong converse rate, and we prove this result by utilizing the structuraldecomposition of a thermal channel into a pure-loss channel followed by anamplifier channel. our second theorem demonstrates that giovannetti et al.'supper bound on the classical capacity of a thermal bosonic channel correspondsto a strong converse rate, and we prove this result by relating successprobability to rate, the effective dimension of the output space, and thepurity of the channel as measured by the renyi collision entropy. finally, weuse similar techniques to prove that similar previously known upper bounds onthe classical capacity of an additive noise bosonic channel correspond tostrong converse rates.

1402.3626	strong converse for the quantum capacity of the erasure channel for  almost all codes	a strong converse theorem for channel capacity establishes that the errorprobability in any communication scheme for a given channel necessarily tendsto one if the rate of communication exceeds the channel's capacity.establishing such a theorem for the quantum capacity of degradable channels hasbeen an elusive task, with the strongest progress so far being a so-called"pretty strong converse". in this work, morgan and winter proved that thequantum error of any quantum communication scheme for a given degradablechannel converges to a value larger than $1/\sqrt{2}$ in the limit of manychannel uses if the quantum rate of communication exceeds the channel's quantumcapacity. the present paper establishes a theorem that is a counterpart to this"pretty strong converse". we prove that the large fraction of codes having arate exceeding the erasure channel's quantum capacity have a quantum errortending to one in the limit of many channel uses. thus, our work adds to thebody of evidence that a fully strong converse theorem should hold for thequantum capacity of the erasure channel. as a side result, we prove that theclassical capacity of the quantum erasure channel obeys the strong converseproperty.

1403.6102	renyi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information	the conditional quantum mutual information $i(a;b|c)$ of a tripartite state$\rho_{abc}$ is an information quantity which lies at the center of manyproblems in quantum information theory. three of its main properties are thatit is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under localoperations applied to systems $a$ and $b$, and that it obeys the dualityrelation $i(a;b|c)=i(a;b|d)$ for a four-party pure state on systems $abcd$. theconditional mutual information also underlies the squashed entanglement, anentanglement measure that satisfies all of the axioms desired for anentanglement measure. as such, it has been an open question to find r\'enyigeneralizations of the conditional mutual information, that would allow for adeeper understanding of the original quantity and find applications beyond thetraditional memoryless setting of quantum information theory. the present paperaddresses this question, by defining different $\alpha$-r\'enyi generalizations$i_{\alpha}(a;b|c)$ of the conditional mutual information, some of which we canprove converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit$\alpha\rightarrow1$. furthermore, we prove that many of these generalizationssatisfy non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity with respect to localoperations on one of the systems $a$ or $b$ (with it being left as an openquestion to prove that monotoniticity holds with respect to local operations onboth systems). the quantities defined here should find applications in quantuminformation theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics, but we leavethis for future work. we also state a conjecture regarding the monotonicity ofthe r\'enyi conditional mutual informations defined here with respect to ther\'enyi parameter $\alpha$. we prove that this conjecture is true in somespecial cases and when $\alpha$ is in a neighborhood of one.

1408.5328	second-order coding rates for pure-loss bosonic channels	a pure-loss bosonic channel is a simple model for communication overfree-space or fiber-optic links. more generally, phase-insensitive bosonicchannels model other kinds of noise, such as thermalizing or amplifyingprocesses. recent work has established the classical capacity of all of thesechannels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holdsfor the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon numberconstraint. the goal of the present paper is to initiate the study ofsecond-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplestone, the pure-loss bosonic channel. in a second-order analysis ofcommunication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks tounderstand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finitenumber of channel uses. we find a lower bound on the maximum achievable codesize for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression forits capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. we accomplish this byproving a general "one-shot" coding theorem for channels with classical inputsand pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable hilbert space. thetheorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channeloutput is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determinewhether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel.

0807.3803	quantum convolutional coding with shared entanglement: general structure	we present a general theory of entanglement-assisted quantum convolutionalcoding. the codes have a convolutional or memory structure, they assume thatthe sender and receiver share noiseless entanglement prior to quantumcommunication, and they are not restricted to possess thecalderbank-shor-steane structure as in previous work. we provide twosignificant advances for quantum convolutional coding theory. we first show howto "expand" a given set of quantum convolutional generators. this expansionstep acts as a preprocessor for a polynomial symplectic gram-schmidtorthogonalization procedure that simplifies the commutation relations of theexpanded generators to be the same as those of entangled bell states (ebits)and ancilla qubits. the above two steps produce a set of generators withequivalent error-correcting properties to those of the original generators. wethen demonstrate how to perform online encoding and decoding for a stream ofinformation qubits, halves of ebits, and ancilla qubits. the upshot of ourtheory is that the quantum code designer can engineer quantum convolutionalcodes with desirable error-correcting properties without having to worry aboutthe commutation relations of these generators.

0811.4227	entanglement-assisted communication of classical and quantum information	we consider the problem of transmitting classical and quantum informationreliably over an entanglement-assisted quantum channel. our main result is acapacity theorem that gives a three-dimensional achievable rate region. pointsin the region are rate triples, consisting of the classical communication rate,the quantum communication rate, and the entanglement consumption rate of aparticular coding scheme. the crucial protocol in achieving the boundary pointsof the capacity region is a protocol that we name the classically-enhancedfather protocol. the classically-enhanced father protocol is more general thanother protocols in the family tree of quantum shannon theoretic protocols, inthe sense that several previously known quantum protocols are now childprotocols of it. the classically-enhanced father protocol also shows animprovement over a time-sharing strategy for the case of a qubit dephasingchannel--this result justifies the need for simultaneous coding of classicaland quantum information over an entanglement-assisted quantum channel. ourcapacity theorem is of a multi-letter nature (requiring a limit over many usesof the channel), but it reduces to a single-letter characterization for atleast three channels: the completely depolarizing channel, the quantum erasurechannel, and the qubit dephasing channel.
