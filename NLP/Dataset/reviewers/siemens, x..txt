0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0909.1058	the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves	the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves (nanograv)is a consortium of astronomers whose goal is the creation of a galactic scalegravitational wave observatory sensitive to gravitational waves in thenhz-microhz band. it is just one component of an international collaborationinvolving similar organizations of european and australian astronomers whoshare the same goal. gravitational waves, a prediction of einstein's generaltheory of relativity, are a phenomenon of dynamical space-time generated by thebulk motion of matter, and the dynamics of space-time itself. they aredetectable by the small disturbance they cause in the light travel time betweensome light source and an observer. nanograv exploits radio pulsars as both thelight (radio) source and the clock against which the light travel time ismeasured. in an array of radio pulsars gravitational waves manifest themselvesas correlated disturbances in the pulse arrival times. the timing precision oftoday's best measured pulsars is less than 100 ns. with improvedinstrumentation and signal-to-noise it is widely believed that the next decadecould see a pulsar timing network of 100 pulsars each with better than 100 nstiming precision. such a pulsar timing array (pta), observed with a regularcadence of days to weeks, would be capable of observing supermassive black holebinaries following galactic mergers, relic radiation from early universephenomena such as cosmic strings, cosmic superstrings, or inflation, and moregenerally providing a vantage on the universe whose revolutionary potential hasnot been seen in the 400 years since galileo first turned a telescope to theheavens.

1203.5613	the characterization of virgo data and its impact on gravitational-wave  searches	between 2007 and 2010 virgo collected data in coincidence with the ligo andgeo gravitational-wave (gw) detectors. these data have been searched for gwsemitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotatingneutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of thedetectors. the sensitivity of gw searches is limited by noise produced by thedetector or its environment. it is therefore crucial to characterize thevarious noise sources in a gw detector. this paper reviews the virgo detectornoise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which wereidentified in the three first virgo observing runs. in many cases, theseinvestigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or toselectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. we presentexamples from the joint ligo-geo-virgo gw searches to show how well noisetransients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from thevirgo data. we also discuss how detector characterization can improve theastrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.

1305.0447	peace: pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction -- a  software package for post-analysis processing of pulsar survey candidates	modern radio pulsar surveys produce a large volume of prospective candidates,the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequencyinterference or other forms of noise. typically, large numbers of candidatesneed to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars.this process can be labor intensive. in this paper, we introduce an algorithmcalled peace (pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction) whichimproves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. the algorithm ranks thecandidates based on a score function. unlike popular machine-learning basedalgorithms, no prior training data sets are required. this algorithm has beenapplied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. using thehuman-based ranking results generated by students in the arecibo remote commandenter programme, the statistical performance of peace was evaluated. it wasfound that peace ranked 68% of the student-identified pulsars within the top0.17% of sorted candidates, 95% within the top 0.34%, and 100% within the top3.7%. this clearly demonstrates that peace significantly increases the pulsaridentification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. to date, peace has beendirectly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which aremillisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing basedgravitational-wave detection projects.

1309.0776	searching for pulsars using image pattern recognition	in this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (ai) program thatidentifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition withdeep neural nets---the pics (pulsar image-based classification system) ai. theai mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferencesby looking for patterns from candidate. the information from each pulsarcandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up tothousands pixel of image data. the ai takes these data from each candidate asits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,the pics ai teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a setof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. the deep neural networksin this ai system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types ofpulsars as well as their harmonic signals. the trained ai's performance hasbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.in this completely independent test, pics ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-relatedcandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. the first non-pulsarcandidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. in otherwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. the performance of thissystem can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. this aisystem has been integrated into the palfa survey pipeline and has discoveredsix new pulsars to date.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1503.05170	discovery and follow-up of rotating radio transients with the green bank  and lofar telescopes	we have discovered 21 rotating radio transients (rrats) in data from thegreen bank telescope (gbt) 350-mhz drift-scan and the green bank northcelestial cap pulsar surveys using a new candidate sifting algorithm. rrats arepulsars with sporadic emission that are detected through their bright singlepulses rather than fourier domain searches. we have developed {\tt rrattrap}, asingle-pulse sifting algorithm that can be integrated into pulsar survey dataanalysis pipelines in order to find rrats and fast radio bursts. we haveconducted follow-up observations of our newly discovered sources at severalradio frequencies using the gbt and low frequency array (lofar), yieldingimproved positions and measurements of their periods, dispersion measures, andburst rates, as well as phase-coherent timing solutions for four of them. thenew rrats have dispersion measures (dms) ranging from 15 to 97 pc cm$^{-3}$,periods of 240 ms to 3.4 s, and estimated burst rates of 20 to 400 pulseshr$^{-1}$ at 350 mhz. we use this new sample of rrats to perform statisticalcomparisons between rrats and canonical pulsars in order to shed light on therelationship between the two populations. we find that the dm and spatialdistributions of the rrats agree with those of the pulsars found in the samesurvey. we find evidence that slower pulsars (i.e. $p&gt;200$ ms) arepreferentially more likely to emit bright single pulses than are faster pulsars($p&lt;200$ ms), although this conclusion is tentative. our results are consistentwith the proposed link between rrats, transient pulsars, and canonical pulsarsas sources in various parts of the pulse activity spectrum.

1504.02294	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iv. mock spectrometer data analysis,  survey sensitivity, and the discovery of 41 pulsars	the on-going palfa survey at the arecibo observatory began in 2004 and issearching for radio pulsars in the galactic plane at 1.4 ghz. observationssince 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than werepreviously employed in this survey. a new data reduction pipeline has been inplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, aswell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selectionheuristics. this pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8millisecond pulsars (msps; p &lt; 10 ms), bringing the palfa survey's discoverytotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 msps, and one fast radio burst (frb). thepipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsarsincluding 60 found in palfa data by re-analyzing observations previouslysearched by other pipelines. a comprehensive description of the surveysensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has beendetermined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters andamplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recoveredwith the data reduction pipeline. we have confirmed that the palfa surveyachieves the sensitivity to msps predicted by theoretical models. however, wealso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly usedthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods p &gt;= 100 ms thatgradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for p &gt; 4 s at dm &lt; 150 pc/cc.this degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. wefind that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to bedetected in the absence of red noise. this reduced sensitivity could haveimplications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the galaxy.

1504.03684	einstein@home discovery of a palfa millisecond pulsar in an eccentric  binary orbit	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar (msp) psr j1950+2414($p=4.3$ ms) in a binary system with an eccentric ($e=0.08$) 22-day orbit inpulsar alfa survey observations with the arecibo telescope. its companion starhas a median mass of 0.3 $m_\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. fullyrecycled msps like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by masstransfer from a companion star. this process should circularize the orbit, asis observed for the vast majority of binary msps, which predominantly haveorbital eccentricities $e &lt; 0.001$. however, four recently discovered binarymsps have orbits with $0.027 &lt; e &lt; 0.44$; psr j1950+2414 is the fifth suchsystem to be discovered. the upper limits for its intrinsic spin periodderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to thoseof the general msp population. the large eccentricities are incompatible withthe predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happenedduring their evolution. proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of thepulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in anexchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationallydelayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. we compare theproperties of all five known eccentric msps with the predictions of theseformation channels. future measurements of the masses and proper motion mightallow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.

1510.03474	a search of the orion spur for continuous gravitational waves using a  "loosely coherent" algorithm on data from ligo interferometers	we report results of a wideband search for periodic gravitational waves fromisolated neutron stars within the orion spur towards both the inner and outerregions of our galaxy. as gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter,the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. one search disk(a) is $6.87^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29"$, and the other(b) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151"$. we explored thefrequency range of 50-1500 hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times10^{-9}$ hz/s. a multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probingmore deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence lengthwith every stage.  rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70candidates, to be examined manually. none of those 70 candidates proved to beconsistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidencelevel upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. near $169$hz we achieve our lowest 95% cl upper limit on worst-case linearly polarizedstrain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of ourfrequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ forall polarizations and sky locations.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

1512.08326	the nanograv nine-year data set: noise budget for pulsar arrival times  on intraday timescales	the use of pulsars as astrophysical clocks for gravitational wave experimentsdemands the highest possible timing precision. pulse times of arrival (toas)are limited by stochastic processes that occur in the pulsar itself, along theline of sight through the interstellar medium, and in the measurement process.on timescales of seconds to hours, the toa variance exceeds that fromtemplate-fitting errors due to additive noise. we assess contributions to thetotal variance from two additional effects: amplitude and phase jitterintrinsic to single pulses and changes in the interstellar impulse responsefrom scattering. the three effects have different dependencies on time,frequency, and pulse signal-to-noise ratio. we use data on 37 pulsars from thenorth american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves to assess theindividual contributions to the overall intraday noise budget for each pulsar.we detect jitter in 22 pulsars and estimate the average value of rms jitter inour pulsars to be $\sim 1\%$ of pulse phase. we examine how jitter evolves as afunction of frequency and find evidence for evolution. finally, we compare ourmeasurements with previous noise parameter estimates and discuss methods toimprove gravitational wave detection pipelines.
