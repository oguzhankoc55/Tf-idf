0902.1535	chemical enrichment in cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics  simulations	(abridged) we present an implementation of stellar evolution and chemicalfeedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations. we consider thetimed release of individual elements by both massive (type ii supernovae andstellar winds) and intermediate mass stars (type ia supernovae and asymptoticgiant branch stars). we illustrate the results of our method using a suite ofcosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling,star formation, and galactic winds. radiative cooling is implementedelement-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and wetrack all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling.we contrast two reasonable definitions of the metallicity of a resolutionelement and find that while they agree for high metallicities, there are largedifferences at low metallicities. we argue the discrepancy is indicative of thelack of metal mixing caused by the fact that metals are stuck to particles. weargue that since this is a (numerical) sampling problem, solving it using apoorly constrained physical process such as diffusion could have undesiredconsequences. we demonstrate that the two metallicity definitions result inredshift z = 0 stellar masses that can differ by up to a factor of two, becauseof the sensitivity of the cooling rates to the elemental abundances. we findthat by z = 0 most of the metals are locked up in stars. the gaseous metals aredistributed over a very wide range of gas densities and temperatures. theshock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium has a relatively high metallicity of~ 10^-1 z_sun that evolves only weakly and is therefore an important reservoirof metals.

0905.2920	cosmological radiative transfer comparison project ii: the  radiation-hydrodynamic tests	the development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to followgas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution ofmany problems in numerical astrophysics. such fluid flows are highly complex,rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against whichnumerical codes can be tested. an alternative validation procedure is tocompare different methods against each other on common problems, in order toassess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for themethods. previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiativetransfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). this is thesecond paper of the cosmological radiative transfer (rt) comparison project, inwhich we compare 9 independent rt codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of anh ii region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (i-front) in a 1/r^2density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniformdense clump. results show a broad agreement between the different methods andno big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certainlevel of maturity and reliability. however, many details still do differ, andvirtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in onerespect or another, with the majority of the results. this underscores the factthat no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particularfeatures which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

0906.4350	galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation --i. galaxy  formation as a function of large-scale environment	[abridged] we present the first results of hydrodynamical simulations thatfollow the formation of galaxies to z=0 in spherical regions of radius ~20mpc/h drawn from the millennium simulation. the regions have overdensities thatdeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is therms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20mpc/h at z=1.5. the simulations have massresolution of up to 10^6 msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scaleenvironments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (mpc/h)^3millennium volume. they include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionisingbackground, sne feedback and winds, but no agn. we find that the specific sfrdensity at z &lt;~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to anorder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproducesobservational data. massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in thegoods fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appearin the underdense regions until z~3. these environmental variations are notcaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, butrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment toanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.at all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250km/s. however, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (evenin the absence of agn): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 havemostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically format later times. however, additional feedback is required to limit starformation in massive galaxies at late times.

0909.0265	the properties of satellite galaxies in simulations of galaxy formation	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies in cosmologicaln-body/sph simulations of galaxy formation in milky way-sized haloes. becauseof their shallow potential wells, satellite galaxies are very sensitive toheating processes which affect their gas content. their properties cantherefore be used to constrain the nature of feedback processes that regulategalaxy formation. in our simulations, we assume that all the energy produced bysupernovae is used as kinetic energy to drive galactic winds. several of oursimulations produce bright, disc-dominated galaxies. we find that wind modelsin which the wind speed, v_w, is proportional to local velocity dispersion ofdark matter, sigma, (and thus the wind mass-loading, eta_w \propto sigma^{-2})have episodic star formation histories, reproduce the observed satelliteluminosity function reasonably well (down to m_v=-7) and match theluminosity-metallicity relation observed in the local group satellites. bycontrast, models that assume a constant wind speed overproduce faint satellitesand predict an incorrect luminosity-metallicity relation. our simulationstherefore suggest that the feedback processes that operate on the scale ofsatellite galaxies should generate galactic outflows whose intensity variesinversely with the depth of the potential.

0909.1593	the earliest stars and their relics in the milky way	we have implemented a simple model to identify the likely sites of the firststars and galaxies in the high-resolution simulations of the formation ofgalactic dark matter halos of the aquarius project. the first star in a galaxylike the milky way formed around redshift z=35; by z=10, the young galaxycontained up to 30000 dark matter haloes capable of forming stars by molecularhydrogen cooling. these minihaloes were strongly clustered and feedback mayhave severely limited the actual number of population iii stars that formed. bythe present day, the remnants of the first stars would be strongly concentratedto the centre of the main halo. if a second generation of long-lived starsformed near the first (the first star relics), we would expect to find half ofthem within 30kpc/h of the galactic centre and a significant fraction insatellites where they may be singled out by their anomalous metallicitypatterns. the first halo in which gas could cool by atomic hydrogen lineradiation formed at z=25; by z=10, the number of such first galaxies hadincreased to ~300. feedback might have decreased the number of first galaxiesat the time they undergo significant star formation, but not the number thatsurvive to the present because near neighbours merge. half of all the "firstgalaxies" that form before z=10 merge with the main halo before z~3 and mostlose a significant fraction of their mass. however, today there should still bemore than 20 remnants orbiting within the central ~30kpc/h of the milky way.these satellites have circular velocities of a few kilometers per second ormore, comparable to those of known milky way dwarfs. they are a promisinghunting ground for the remnants of the earliest epoch of star formation.

0909.5196	the physics driving the cosmic star formation history	we investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation (sf) historyusing the more than fifty large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations thattogether comprise the overwhelmingly large simulations (owls) project. wesystematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physicalprocesses are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. generically,we find that sf is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at highredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases asit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gasexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. the higherredshift sf is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters andto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. the location and heightof the peak in the sf history, and the steepness of the decline towards thepresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black holefeedback. mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling bothboost the sf rate at late times. galaxies form stars in a self-regulatedfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedbackfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling andaccretion. paradoxically, the sf rate is highly insensitive to the assumed sflaw. this can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the sf efficiencyis changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the samerate of production of massive stars. self-regulated feedback from accretingblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed sf ratebelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from sf, for example in theform of a top-heavy imf at high gas pressures, can help.

0910.5723	metal-line emission from the warm-hot intergalactic medium: i. soft  x-rays	emission lines from metals offer one of the most promising ways to detect theelusive warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim; 10^5 k&lt;t&lt;10^7 k), which is thoughtto contain a substantial fraction of the baryons in the low-redshift universe.we present predictions for the soft x-ray line emission from the whim using asubset of cosmological simulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations(owls) project. we use the owls models to test the dependence of the predictedemission on a range of physical prescriptions, such as cosmology, gas coolingand feedback from star formation and accreting black holes. provided thatmetal-line cooling is taken into account, the models give surprisingly similarresults, indicating that the predictions are robust. soft x-ray lines trace thehotter part of the whim (t&gt;10^6 k). we find that the oviii 18.97a is thestrongest emission line, with a predicted maximum surface brightness of ~10^2photon/s/cm^2/sr, but a number of other lines are only slightly weaker. alllines show a strong correlation between the intensity of the observed flux andthe density and metallicity of the gas responsible for the emission. on theother hand, the potentially detectable emission consistently corresponds to thetemperature at which the emissivity of the electronic transition peaks. theemission traces neither the baryonic nor the metal mass. in particular, theemission that is potentially detectable with proposed missions, tracesoverdense (rho&gt;10^2rho_mean) and metal-rich (z&gt;0.1z_sun) gas in and aroundgalaxies and groups. while soft x-ray line emission is therefore not apromising route to close the baryon budget, it does offer the excitingpossibility to image the gas accreting onto and flowing out of galaxies.

0911.2641	the case for agn feedback in galaxy groups	[abridged] the relatively recent insight that energy input from supermassiveblack holes (bhs) can have a substantial effect on the star formation rates(sfrs) of galaxies motivates us to examine its effects on the scale of galaxygroups. at present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significantfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. to explore the effectsof bh feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydrosimulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations project. while bothinclude galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback frombhs. we compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range ofobservational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (l-m-t) scaling relations, k-bandluminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (cbg), sfrs and agesof the cbg, and gas/stellar metallicities. both runs yield entropy profilessimilar to the data, while the run without agn feedback yields highly peakedtemperature profiles, in discord with the observations. energy input from bhssignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 msun,yielding fgas-t and l-t relations that are in agreement with the data. the runwithout agn feedback suffers from the well known overcooling problem; theresulting k-band luminosities are much larger than observed. by contrast, therun that includes bh feedback yields k-band luminosities and cbg sfrs and agesin agreement with current estimates. both runs yield very similar gas-phasemetallicities that match x-ray data, but they predict very different stellarmetallicities. based on the above, galaxy groups provide a compelling case thatbh feedback is a crucial ingredient in the formation of massive galaxies.

1002.3393	metal-line emission from the warm-hot intergalactic medium: ii.  ultraviolet	approximately half the baryons in the local universe are thought to reside inthe warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). emission lines from metals in the uvband are excellent tracers of the cooler fraction of this gas. we presentpredictions for the surface brightness of a sample of uv lines that couldpotentially be observed by the next generation of uv telescopes at z&lt;1. we usea subset of simulations from the owls project to create emission maps and toinvestigate the effect of varying the physical prescriptions for starformation, supernova and agn feedback, chemodynamics and radiative cooling.most models produce results in agreement within a factor of a few, indicatingthat the predictions are robust. of the lines we consider, c iii is thestrongest line, but it typically traces gas colder than 10^5 k. the same istrue for si iv. the second strongest line, c iv, traces circum-galactic gaswith t~10^5 k. o vi and ne viii probe the warmer (t~10^5.5 k and t~10^6 k,respectively) and more diffuse gas that may be a better tracer of the largescale structure. n v emission is intermediate between c iv and o vi. theintensity of all emission lines increases strongly with gas density andmetallicity, and for the bright emission it is tightly correlated with thetemperature for which the line emissivity is highest. in particular, the c iii,c iv, si iv and o vi emission that is sufficiently bright to be potentiallydetectable in the near future (&gt;10^3 photon/s/cm^2/sr), comes from relativelydense (rho&gt;10^2 rho_mean) and metal rich (z&gt;0.1 z_sun) gas. as such, emissionlines are highly biased tracers of the missing baryons and are not an optimaltool to close the baryon budget. however, they do provide a powerful means todetect the gas cooling onto or flowing out of galaxies and groups.

1005.1642	x-ray coronae in simulations of disc galaxy formation	the existence of x-ray luminous gaseous coronae around massive disc galaxiesis a long-standing prediction of galaxy formation theory in the cold darkmatter cosmogony. this prediction has garnered little observational support,with non-detections commonplace and detections for only a relatively smallnumber of galaxies which are much less luminous than expected. we investigatethe coronal properties of a large sample of bright, disc-dominated galaxiesextracted from the gimic suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulationsrecently presented by crain et al. remarkably, the simulations reproduce theobserved scalings of x-ray luminosity with k-band luminosity and star formationrate and, when account is taken of the density structure of the halo, with discrotation velocity as well. most of the star formation in the simulated galaxies(which have realistic stellar mass fractions) is fuelled by gas cooling from aquasi-hydrostatic hot corona. however, these coronae are more diffuse, and of alower luminosity, than predicted by the analytic models of white &amp; frenkbecause of a substantial increase in entropy at z ~ 1-3. both the removal oflow entropy gas by star formation and energy injection from supernovaecontribute to this increase in entropy, but the latter is dominant for halomasses m_200 &lt;~ 10^(12.5) msun. only a small fraction of the mass of the hotgas is outflowing as a wind but, because of its high density and metallicity,it contributes disproportionally to the x-ray emission. the bulk of the x-rayemission, however, comes from the diffuse quasi-hydrostatic corona whichsupplies the fuel for ongoing star formation in discs today. future deep x-rayobservations with high spectral resolution (e.g. with next/astro-h or ixo)should be able to map the velocity structure of the hot gas and test thisfundamental prediction of current galaxy formation theory.

1005.3921	the enrichment history of cosmic metals	we use a suite of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to investigate thechemical enrichment history of the universe. specifically, we trace the originof the metals back in time to investigate when various gas phases were enrichedand by what halo masses. we find that the age of the metals decreases stronglywith the density of the gas in which they end up. at least half of the metalsthat reside in the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) at redshift zero (two)were ejected from galaxies above redshift two (three). the mass of the haloesthat last contained the metals increases rapidly with the gas density. morethan half of the mass in intergalactic metals was ejected by haloes with totalmasses less than 1e11 solar masses and stellar masses less than 1e9 solarmasses. the range of halo masses that contributes to the enrichment is widerfor the hotter part of the igm. by combining the `when' and `by what' aspectsof the enrichment history, we show that metals residing in lower density gaswere typically ejected earlier and by lower mass haloes.

1007.2840	absorption signatures of warm-hot gas at low redshift: ovi	we investigate the origin and physical properties of ovi absorbers at lowredshift (z = 0.25) using a subset of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulationsfrom the overwhelmingly large simulations (owls) project. intervening oviabsorbers are believed to trace shock-heated gas in the warm-hot intergalacticmedium (whim) and may thus play a key role in the search for the missingbaryons in the present-day universe. when compared to observations, thepredicted distributions of the different ovi line parameters (column density,doppler parameter, rest equivalent width) from our simulations exhibit a lackof strong ovi absorbers. this suggests that physical processes on sub-gridscales (e.g. turbulence) may strongly influence the observed properties of ovisystems. we find that the intervening ovi absorption arises mainly in highlymetal-enriched (0.1 &lt;&lt; z/z_sun &lt; 1) gas at typical overdensities of 1 &lt;&lt;rho/&lt;rho&gt; &lt; 100. one third of the ovi absorbers in our simulation are found totrace gas at temperatures t &lt; 10^5 k, while the rest arises in gas at highertemperatures around t =10^5.3 k. the ovi resides in a similar region of(rho,t)-space as much of the shock-heated baryonic matter, but the vastmajority of this gas has a lower metal content and does not give rise todetectable ovi absorption as a consequence of the patchy metal distribution,ovi absorbers in our simulations trace only a very small fraction of the cosmicbaryons (&lt;2 percent) and the cosmic metals. instead, these systems presumablytrace previously shock-heated, metal-rich material from galactic winds that isnow cooling. the common approach of comparing ovi and hi column densities toestimate the physical conditions in intervening absorbers from qso observationsmay be misleading, as most of the hi (and most of the gas mass) is notphysically connected with the high-metallicity patches that give rise to theovi absorption.

1008.1785	the galaxies that reionized the universe	the durham galform semi-analytical galaxy formation model has been shown toreproduce the observed rest-frame 1500\aa\ luminosity function of galaxies wellover the whole redshift range z=5-10. we show that in this model, this galaxypopulation also emits enough ionizing photons to reionize the universe byredshift z=10, assuming a modest escape fraction of 20 per cent. the bulk ofthe ionizing photons is produced in faint galaxies during starbursts triggeredby galaxy mergers. the bursts introduce a dispersion up to ~ 5 dex in galaxyionizing luminosity at a given halo mass. almost 90 per cent of the ionizingphotons emitted at z=10 are from galaxies below the current observationaldetection limit at that redshift. photo-ionization suppression of starformation in these galaxies is unlikely to affect this conclusionsignificantly, because the gas that fuels the starbursts has already cooled outof their host halos. the galaxies that dominate the ionizing emissivity at z=10are faint, with m_{1500, ab} ~ -16, have low star formation rates, \dot{m_{*}}~ 0.06 h^{-1} m_sun yr^{-1}, and reside in halos of mass m ~ 10^9 h^{-1} m_sun.

1011.0602	the stellar and hot gas content of low-mass galaxy clusters	we analyse the stellar and hot gas content of 18 nearby, low-mass galaxyclusters, detected in redshift space and selected to have a dynamical mass3e14&lt;m/msun&lt;6e14, as measured from the 2df galaxy redshift survey. we combinex-ray measurements from both chandra and xmm with ground-based near-infraredobservations from ctio, aat and cfht to compare the mass in hot gas and starsto the dynamical mass and state of the clusters. only 13 of the clusters aredetected in x-ray emission, and for these systems we find that a range of 7-20per cent of their baryonic mass, and &lt;3 per cent of their dynamical mass, isdetected in starlight, similar to what is observed in more massive clusters. incontrast, the five undetected clusters are underluminous in x-ray emission, byup to a factor 10, given their stellar mass. although the velocity distributionof cluster members in these systems is indistinguishable from a gaussian, allshow subtle signs of being unrelaxed: either they lack a central, dominantgalaxy, or the bright galaxy distribution is less concentrated and/or moreelongated than the rest of the sample. thus we conclude that low-mass clustersand groups selected from the velocity distribution of their galaxies exhibit adichotomy in their hot gas properties. either they are detected in x-ray, inwhich case they generally lie on the usual scaling relations, or they arecompletely undetected in x-ray emission. the non-detections may be partlyrelated to the apparently young dynamical state of the clusters, but it remainsa distinct possibility that some of these systems are exceptionally devoid ofhot emitting gas as the result of its expulsion or rarefaction.

1011.1906	the similarity of observed x-ray coronae associated with l* disc and  elliptical galaxies	the existence of hot, x-ray luminous gaseous coronae surrounding present dayl* galaxies is a generic prediction of galaxy formation theory in the cold darkmatter cosmogony. while extended x-ray emission has been known to exist aroundelliptical galaxies for a long time, diffuse extra-planar emission has onlyrecently been detected around disc galaxies. we compile samples of ellipticaland disc galaxies that have chandra and xmm-newton measurements, and comparethe scaling of the coronal x-ray luminosity (l_x) with both the k-bandluminosity (l_k) and the coronal x-ray temperature (t_x). the x-ray fluxmeasurements are corrected for non-thermal point source contamination byspatial excision and spectral subtraction for resolved and unresolved sourcesrespectively. we find that the properties of the extended x-ray emission fromgalaxies of different morphological types are similar: for both elliptical anddisc galaxies, the l_x - l_k and l_x - t_x relations have similar slope,normalisation and scatter. the observed universality of coronal x-rayproperties suggests that the bulk of this emission originates from gas that hasbeen accreted, shock-heated and compressed during the assembly of the galaxyand that outflows triggered by stellar processes make only a minor contributionto the x-ray emission. this reservoir of cooling gas is a potential source ofmorphological transformation; it provides a fresh supply of material for discsto grow around galaxies of all morphological types.

1102.2526	cosmological simulations of the formation of the stellar haloes around  disc galaxies	we use the galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic)suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation ofstellar spheroids of milky way-mass disc galaxies. the simulations containaccurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star formation,supernova feedback, and chemodynamics, and the large volumes that have beensimulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of ~400 simulated l_* discgalaxies. the simulated galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low-surfacebrightness stellar haloes that extend out to ~100 kpc and beyond. the diffusestellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed aroundthe milky way, m31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surfacebrightness, and metallicity profiles. we show that in situ star formationtypically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r &lt; 30 kpc,whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origininduces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles,which is also present in the observational data. the system-to-system scatterin the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans overa factor of 4. consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shapeand normalisation of the spheroid density profile within r &lt; 30 kpc (e.g., whenfit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). weshow that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formationepoch of the system. dynamically older systems have, on average, largercontributions from in situ star formation, although there is significantsystem-to-system scatter in this relationship. thus, in situ star formationlikely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pureaccretion-based models to reproduce the observed properties of the innerspheroid.

1104.2929	the haloes of bright satellite galaxies in a warm dark matter universe	high resolution n-body simulations of galactic cold dark matter haloesindicate that we should expect to find a few satellite galaxies around themilky way whose haloes have a maximum circular velocity in excess of 40 kms.yet, with the exception of the magellanic clouds and the sagittarius dwarf,which likely reside in subhaloes with significantly larger velocities thanthis, the bright satellites of the milky way all appear to reside in subhaloeswith maximum circular velocities below 40 kms. as recently highlighted byboylan-kolchin et al., this discrepancy implies that the majority of the mostmassive subhaloes within a cold dark matter galactic halo are much tooconcentrated to be consistent with the kinematic data for the bright milky waysatellites. here we show that no such discrepancy exists if haloes are made ofwarm, rather than cold dark matter because these haloes are less concentratedon account of their typically later formation epochs. warm dark matter is oneof several possible explanations for the observed kinematics of the satellites.

1106.0306	numerical overcooling in shocks	we present a study of cooling in radiative shocks simulated with smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) and adaptive mesh refinement codes. we obtain asimilarity solution for a shock-tube problem in the presence of radiativecooling, and test how well the solution is reproduced in gadget and flash.shock broadening governed by the details of the numerical scheme (artificialviscosity or riemann solvers) leads to potentially significant overcooling inboth codes. we interpret our findings in terms of a resolution criterion, andapply it to realistic simulations of cosmological accretion shocks onto galaxyhaloes, cold accretion and thermal feedback from supernovae or active galacticnuclei. to avoid numerical overcooling of accretion shocks onto haloes thatshould develop a hot corona requires a particle or cell mass resolution of 10^6m_sun, which is within reach of current state-of-the-art simulations. at thismass resolution, thermal feedback in the interstellar medium of a galaxyrequires temperatures of supernova or agn driven bubbles to be in excess of10^7 k at densities of n_h=1.0 cm^-3, in order to avoid spurious suppression ofthe feedback by numerical overcooling.

0710.0964	ram pressure stripping the hot gaseous halos of galaxies in groups and  clusters	we use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations tostudy the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous halos of galaxies as theyfall into massive groups and clusters. the sensitivity of the results to theorbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. fortypical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ~30% of the initial hotgalactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 gyr. we propose a physicallysimple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulationsremarkably well. the model is analogous to the original formulation of gunn &amp;gott (1972), except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot)gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disk) and takes into accountthat stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic timescale.the model reproduces the results of the simulations to within approximately 10%at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structuralproperties we have explored. the one exception involves unlikely systems wherethe orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10% ofthe group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the modelunder-predicts the stripping following pericentric passage). the proposed modelhas several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressurestripping of both observed and cosmologically-simulated galaxies and as a wayto improve current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. one immediateconsequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies ingroups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with thestandard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.

1109.5700	cold accretion flows and the nature of high column density hi absorption  at redshift 3	simulations predict that galaxies grow primarily through the accretion of gasthat has not gone through an accretion shock near the virial radius and thatthis cold gas flows towards the central galaxy along dense filaments andstreams. there is, however, little observational evidence for the existence ofthese cold flows. we use a large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation thathas been post-processed with radiative transfer to study the contribution ofcold flows to the observed z=3 column density distribution of neutral hydrogen,which our simulation reproduces. we find that nearly all of the hi absorptionarises in gas that has remained colder than 10^5.5 k, at least while it wasextragalactic. in addition, the majority of the hi is rapidly falling towards anearby galaxy, with non-negligible contributions from outflowing and staticgas. above a column density of n_hi = 10^17 cm^-2, most of the absorbers resideinside haloes, but the interstellar medium only dominates for n_hi &gt; 10^21cm^-2. haloes with total mass below 10^10 msun dominate the absorption for10^17&lt;n_hi &lt; 10^21 cm^-2, but the average halo mass increases sharply forhigher column densities. although very little of the hi in absorbers with n_hi&lt;~ 10^20 cm^-2 resides inside galaxies, systems with n_hi &gt; 10^17 cm^-2 areclosely related to star formation: most of their hi either will become part ofthe interstellar medium before z=2 or has been ejected from a galaxy at z&gt;3.cold accretion flows are critical for the success of our simulation inreproducing the observed rate of incidence of damped lyman-alpha andparticularly that of lyman limit systems. we therefore conclude that coldaccretion flows exist and have already been detected in the form of high columndensity hi absorbers.

1111.1747	global structure and kinematics of stellar haloes in cosmological  hydrodynamic simulations	we use the galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic)suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the global structureand kinematics of stellar spheroids of milky way mass disc galaxies. font etal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfullyreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surfacebrightness profiles of the spheroids of the milky way and m31. a key to thesuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid fromstars that formed in situ. while the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r &lt; ~30 kpc. inthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in aproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc bydynamical heating associated with mass accretion. as a consequence of itsorigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namelynet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroidcomponent built from the disruption of satellites. in addition, the in situcomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation. wemake comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of localgalaxies, including the milky way and m31, and stacked observations of moredistant galaxies. we find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids ofthe correct shape (oblate with a median axis ratio of ~0.6 at radii of &lt; ~30kpc, but note there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity)and that the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ vs.accreted), as observed. our findings therefore add considerable weight to theimportance of dissipative processes in the formation of stellar haloes and tothe notion of a 'dual stellar halo'.

1112.2220	the origin of disks and spheroids in simulated galaxies	in the simplest scenario, disk galaxies form predominantly in halos with highangular momentum and quiet recent assembly history, whereas spheroids are theslowly-rotating remnants of repeated merging events. we explore theseassumptions using one hundred systems with halo masses similar to that of themilky way, identified in a series of cosmological gasdynamical simulationsgimic. at z=0, the simulated galaxies exhibit a wide variety of morphologies,from dispersion-dominated spheroids to pure disk galaxies. surprisingly, thesemorphological features are very poorly correlated with their halo properties:disks form in halos with high and low net spin, and mergers play a negligiblerole in the formation of spheroid stars, most of which form in-situ. moreimportant to morphology is the coherent alignment of the angular momentum ofbaryons that accrete over time to form a galaxy. spheroids tend to form whenthe spin of newly-accreted gas is misaligned with that of the extant galaxy,leading to the episodic formation of stars with different kinematics thatcancel out the net rotation of the system. disks, on the other hand, form outof gas that flows in with similar angular momentum to that of earlier-accretedmaterial. gas accretion from a hot corona thus favours disk formation, whereasgas that flows "cold", often along separate, misaligned filaments, favours theformation of spheroids. in this scenario, most spheroids consist ofsuperpositions of stellar components with distinct kinematics, age, andmetallicity, an arrangement that might survive to the present day given thepaucity of major mergers. since angular momentum is acquired largely atturnaround, morphology is imprinted early by the interplay of the tidal fieldand the shape of the material destined to form the galaxy.

1201.5641	absorption signatures of warm-hot gas at low redshift: broad hi  lyman-alpha absorbers	we investigate the physical state of hi absorbing gas at low redshift (z =0.25) using a subset of cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations from the owlsproject, focusing in particular on broad (b_hi &gt; 40 km/s) hi lyman-alphaabsorbers (blas), which are believed to originate in shock-heated gas in thewarm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). our fiducial model, which includesradiative cooling by heavy elements and feedback by supernovae and activegalactic nuclei, predicts that by z = 0.25 nearly 60 per cent of the gas massends up at densities and temperatures characteristic of the whim and we findthat half of this fraction is due to outflows. the standard hi observables(distribution of hi column densities n_hi, distribution of doppler parametersb_hi, b_hi - n_hi correlation) and the bla line number density predicted by oursimulations are in remarkably good agreement with observations.  blas arise in gas that is hotter, more highly ionised and more enriched thanthe gas giving rise to typical lyman-alpha forest absorbers. the majority ofthe blas arise in warm-hot (log (t/k) ~ 5) gas at low (log delta &lt; 1.5)overdensities. on average, thermal broadening accounts for at least 60 per centof the bla line width, which in turn can be used as a rough indicator of thethermal state of the gas. detectable blas account for only a small fraction ofthe true baryon content of the whim at low redshift. in order to detect thebulk of the mass in this gas phase, a sensitivity at least one order ofmagnitude better than achieved by current ultraviolet spectrographs isrequired. we argue that blas mostly trace gas that has been shock-heated andenriched by outflows and that they therefore provide an important window on apoorly understood feedback process.

1204.5195	rotation rates, sizes, and star formation efficiencies of a  representative population of simulated disc galaxies	we examine the rotation rates, sizes, and star formation (sf) efficiencies ofa representative population of simulated disc galaxies extracted from thegalaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic) suite ofcosmological hydrodynamic simulations. these simulations include efficient, butenergetically feasible supernova feedback, but have not been tuned in any wayto produce 'realistic' disc galaxies. yet, they generate a large number ofdiscs, without requiring extremely high resolution. over the wide galaxystellar mass range, 9.0 &lt; log10[mstar (msun)] &lt; 10.5, the simulations reproducethe observed tully-fisher relation, the rotation curves of disc galaxies inbins of stellar mass, the mass-size relation of disc galaxies, the opticalrotation to virial circular velocity ratio (vopt/vvir), and the sf efficienciesof disc galaxies as inferred from stacked weak lensing and stacked satellitekinematics observations. they also reproduce the specific star formation ratesof ~l* galaxies but predict too low levels of star formation for low-massgalaxies, which is plausibly due to the finite resolution of the simulations.at higher stellar masses, log10[mstar (\msun)] &gt; 10.6, the simulated galaxiesare too concentrated and have too high sf efficiencies. we conjecture that thisshortcoming reflects the neglect of feedback from accreting supermassive blackholes in these simulations. we conclude that it is possible to generate arepresentative population of disc galaxies that reproduces many of the observedtrends of local disc galaxies using standard numerical hydrodynamic techniquesand a plausible implementation of the "subgrid" astrophysical processes thoughtto be relevant to galaxy formation.

1205.2549	the competition between confinement and ram pressure and its  implications for galaxies in groups and clusters	ram pressure stripping of the hot gas that surrounds normal galaxies as theyfall into groups and clusters (also referred to as `strangulation' or`starvation') is generally thought to shut down star formation on a time scaleof a few gyr. however, it has recently been suggested, on the basis ofx-ray-optical scaling relations of galaxies in the field and the group/clusterenvironment, that confinement pressure by the intra-cluster medium can actuallylead to an increase in the mass of hot gas surrounding these galaxies. weinvestigate the competition between pressure confinement and ram pressurestripping for satellite galaxies in orbit about galaxy groups and clustersusing simple analytic models and detailed cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations. it is found that, independent of host mass, ram pressure isgenerally dominant over confinement pressure --- only ~16 % of galaxies findthemselves in the reverse situation. furthermore, these galaxies have, onaverage, less hot gas than ram-pressure dominated ones, contrary to simpleexpectations. this is explained by the fact that the small number of galaxieswhich are confinement dominated are typically at first or second apocentre andhave therefore already been maximally affected by ram pressure stripping aroundfirst pericentre. our results are shown to be insensitive to host halo mass; weargue that the same is true for uncertain sub-grid processes, such as feedback.

1205.2697	large scale structure in absorption: gas within and around galaxy voids	we investigate the properties of the hi ly-a absorption systems (ly-a forest)within and around galaxy voids at z&lt;0.1. we find a significant excess (&gt;99%c.l.) of ly-a systems at the edges of galaxy voids with respect to a randomdistribution, on ~5 h^{-1} mpc scales. we find no significant difference in thenumber of systems inside voids with respect to the random expectation. wereport differences between both column density (n_{hi}) and doppler parameter(b_{hi}) distributions of ly-a systems found inside and at the edge of galaxyvoids at the &gt;98% and &gt;90% c.l. respectively. low density environments (voids)have smaller values for both n_{hi} and b_{hi} than higher density ones (edgesof voids). these trends are theoretically expected and also found in gimic, astate-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation. our findings are consistent with ascenario of at least three types of ly-alpha: (1) containing embedded galaxiesand so directly correlated with galaxies (referred as `halo-like'), (2)correlated with galaxies only because they lie in the same over-dense lss, and(3) associated with under-dense lss with a very low auto-correlation amplitude(~ random) that are not correlated with luminous galaxies. we argue the latterarise in structures still growing linearly from the primordial densityfluctuations inside galaxy voids that have not formed galaxies because of theirlow densities. we estimate that these under-dense lss absorbers account for25-30% +- 6% of the current ly-a population (n_{hi} &gt; 10^{12.5} cm^{-2}) whilethe other two types account for the remaining 70-75% +- 12%. assuming that onlyn_{hi} &gt; 10^{14} cm^{-2} systems have embedded galaxies nearby, we haveestimated the contribution of the `halo-like' ly-a to be ~12-15% +- 4% andconsequently ~55-60% +- 13% of the ly-a systems to be associated with theover-dense lss.

1206.6495	the abundance of (not just) dark matter haloes	we study the effect of baryons on the abundance of structures andsubstructures in a lambda-cdm cosmology, using a pair of high resolutioncosmological simulations from the gimic project. both simulations use identicalinitial conditions, but while one contains only dark matter, the other alsoincludes baryons. we find that gas pressure, reionisation, supernova feedback,stripping, and truncated accretion systematically reduce the total mass and theabundance of structures below ~10^12 solar masses compared to the pure darkmatter simulation. taking this into account and adopting an appropriatedetection threshold lowers the abundance of observed galaxies with maximumcircular velocities below 100 km/s, significantly reducing the reporteddiscrepancy between lambda-cdm and the measured hi velocity function of thealfalfa survey. we also show that the stellar-to-total mass ratios of galaxieswith stellar masses of ~10^5 - 10^7 solar masses inferred from abundancematching of the (sub)halo mass function to the observed galaxy mass functionincrease by a factor of ~2. in addition, we find that an important fraction oflow-mass subhaloes are completely devoid of stars. accounting for the presenceof dark subhaloes below 10^10 solar masses further reduces the abundance ofobservable objects, and leads to an additional increase in the inferredstellar-to-total mass ratio by factors of 2 - 10 for galaxies in haloes of 10^9- 10^10 solar masses. this largely reconciles the abundance matching resultswith the kinematics of individual dwarf galaxies in lambda-cdm. we proposeapproximate corrections to the masses of objects derived from pure dark mattercalculations to account for baryonic effects.

1209.5563	the phase space density of fermionic dark matter haloes	we have performed a series of numerical experiments to investigate how theprimordial thermal velocities of fermionic dark matter particles affect thephysical and phase space density profiles of the dark matter haloes into whichthey collect. the initial particle velocities induce central cores in bothprofiles, which can be understood in the framework of phase space densitytheory. we find that the maximum coarse-grained phase space density of thesimulated haloes (computed in 6 dimensional phase space using the enbid code)is very close to the theoretical fine-grained upper bound, while the pseudophase space density, q ~ {\rho}/{\sigma}^3, overestimates the maximum phasespace density by up to an order of magnitude. the density in the inner regionsof the simulated haloes is well described by a 'pseudo-isothermal' profile witha core. we have developed a simple model based on this profile which, given theobserved surface brightness profile of a galaxy and its central velocitydispersion, accurately predicts its central phase space density. applying thismodel to the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way yields values closeto 0.5 kev for the mass of a hypothetical thermal warm dark matter particle,assuming the satellite haloes have cores produced by warm dark matter freestreaming. such a small value is in conflict with the lower limit of 1.2 kevset by observations of the lyman-{\alpha} forest. thus, if the milky way dwarfspheroidal satellites have cores, these are likely due to baryonic processesassociated with the forming galaxy, perhaps of the kind proposed by navarro,eke and frenk and seen in recent simulations of galaxy formation in the colddark matter model.

1211.1021	physical properties of simulated galaxy populations at z=2 - i. effect  of metal-line cooling and feedback from star formation and agn	we use hydrodynamical simulations from the owls project to investigate thedependence of the physical properties of galaxy populations at redshift 2 onmetal-line cooling and feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei(agn). we find that if the sub-grid feedback from star formation is implementedkinetically, the feedback is only efficient if the initial wind velocityexceeds a critical value. this critical velocity increases with galaxy mass andalso if metal-line cooling is included. this suggests that radiative lossesquench the winds if their initial velocity is too low. if the feedback isefficient, then the star formation rate is inversely proportional to the amountof energy injected per unit stellar mass formed (which is proportional to theinitial mass loading for a fixed wind velocity). this can be understood if thestar formation is self-regulating, i.e. if the star formation rate (and thusthe gas fraction) increase until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.feedback from agn is efficient at high masses, while increasing the initialwind velocity with gas pressure or halo mass allows one to generate galaxy-wideoutflows at all masses. matching the observed galaxy mass function requiresefficient feedback. in particular, the predicted faint-end slope is too steepunless we resort to highly mass loaded winds for low-mass objects. suchefficient feedback from low-mass galaxies (m_* &lt;&lt; 10^10 msun) also reduces thediscrepancy with the observed specific star formation rates, which are higherthan predicted unless the feedback transitions from highly efficient toinefficient just below the observed stellar mass range.

1211.1395	how supernova explosions power galactic winds	feedback from supernovae is an essential aspect of galaxy formation. in orderto improve subgrid models of feedback we perform a series of numericalexperiments to investigate how supernova explosions power galactic winds. weuse the flash hydrodynamic code to model a simplified ism, including gravity,hydrodynamics, radiative cooling above 10,000 k, and star formation thatreproduces the kennicutt-schmidt relation. by simulating a small patch of theism in a tall box perpendicular to the disk, we obtain sub-parsec resolutionallowing us to resolve individual supernova events and we investigate how thewind properties depend on those of the ism and the galaxy. we find thatoutflows are more efficient in disks with lower surface densities or gasfractions. a simple model in which the warm cloudy medium is the barrier thatlimits the expansion of blast waves reproduces the scaling of outflowproperties with disk parameters at high star formation rates. the scaling wefind sets the investigation of galaxy winds on a new footing, providing aphysically motivated sub-grid description of winds that can be implemented incosmological hydrodynamic simulations and phenomenological models.

1211.3120	physical properties of simulated galaxy populations at z=2 - ii. effects  of cosmology, reionization and ism physics	we use hydrodynamical simulations from the owls project to investigate thedependence of the physical properties of galaxy populations at redshift 2 onthe assumed star formation law, the equation of state imposed on the unresolvedinterstellar medium, the stellar initial mass function, the reionizationhistory, and the assumed cosmology. this work complements that of paper i,where we studied the effects of varying models for galactic winds driven bystar formation and agn. the normalisation of the matter power spectrum stronglyaffects the galaxy mass function, but has a relatively small effect on thephysical properties of galaxies residing in haloes of a fixed mass.reionization suppresses the stellar masses and gas fractions of low-massgalaxies, but by z = 2 the results are insensitive to the timing ofreionization. the stellar initial mass function mainly determines the physicalproperties of galaxies through its effect on the efficiency of the feedback,while changes in the recycled mass and metal fractions play a smaller role. ifwe use a recipe for star formation that reproduces the observed star formationlaw independently of the assumed equation of state of the unresolved ism, thenthe latter is unimportant. the star formation law, i.e. the gas consumptiontime scale as a function of surface density, determines the mass of dense,star-forming gas in galaxies, but affects neither the star formation rate northe stellar mass. this can be understood in terms of self-regulation: the gasfraction adjusts until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.

1304.4730	enriching the hot circumgalactic medium	models of galaxy formation in a cdm universe predict that massive galaxiesare surrounded by a hot, quasi-hydrostatic circumgalactic corona of slowlycooling gas, predominantly accreted from the igm. this prediction is borne outby the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of crain et al., which reproducescaling relations between the x-ray and optical properties of nearby discgalaxies. such coronae are metal poor, but observations of the x-ray emittingcircumgalactic medium (cgm) of local galaxies typically indicate enrichment tonear-solar iron abundance, potentially signalling a shortcoming in galaxyformation models. we show here that, while the hot cgm of galaxies formed inthe simulations is metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its x-rayluminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. this bias arisesbecause the soft x-ray emissivity of a typical 0.1 kev corona is dominated bycollisionally-excited metal ions that are synthesised in stars and recycledinto the hot cgm. we find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars thatform in-situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites orexternal galaxies. the enrichment of the hot cgm therefore proceeds in aninside-out fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals aretransported from the central galaxy by sne-driven winds and convection overseveral gigayears, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient.whilst metal ions synthesised by stars are necessary to produce the x-rayemissivity that enables the hot cgm of isolated galaxies to be detected, theelectrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. since oursimulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated bythe metal-poor gas accreted from the igm, we infer that the hot cgm observedvia x-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellarrecycling.

1308.1399	the properties of warm dark matter haloes	well-motivated elementary particle candidates for the dark matter, such asthe sterile neutrino, behave as warm dark matter (wdm).for particle masses oforder a kev, free streaming produces a cutoff in the linear fluctuation powerspectrum at a scale corresponding to dwarf galaxies. we investigate theabundance and structure of wdm haloes and subhaloes on these scales using highresolution cosmological n-body simulations of galactic haloes of mass similarto the milky way's. on scales larger than the free-streaming cutoff, theinitial conditions have the same power spectrum and phases as one of the colddark matter (cdm) haloes previously simulated by springel et al as part of thevirgo consortium aquarius project. we have simulated four haloes with wdmparticle masses in the range 1.4-2.3kev and, for one case, we have carried outfurther simulations at varying resolution. n-body simulations in which thepower spectrum cutoff is resolved are known to undergo artificial fragmentationin filaments producing spurious clumps which, for small masses (&lt;10^7msun inour case) outnumber genuine haloes. we have developed a robust algorithm toidentify these spurious objects and remove them from our halo catalogues. wefind that the wdm subhalo mass function is suppressed by well over an ordermagnitude relative to the cdm case for masses &lt;10^9msun. requiring that thereshould be at least as many subhaloes as there are observed satellites in themilky way leads to a conservative lower limit to the (thermal equivalent) wdmparticle mass of ~1.5\rmn{kev}. wdm haloes and subhaloes have cuspy densitydistributions that are well described by nfw or einasto profiles. their centraldensities are lower for lower wdm particle masses and none of the models wehave considered suffer from the "too big to fail" problem recently highlightedby boylan-kolchin et al.

1403.2475	star forming filaments in warm dark matter models	we performed a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of amilky way-like galaxy in a warm dark matter (wdm) cosmology. smooth and densefilaments, several co-moving mega parsec long, form generically above z 2 inthis model. atomic line cooling allows gas in the centres of these filaments tocool to the base of the cooling function, resulting in a very striking patternof extended lyman-limit systems (llss). observations of the correlationfunction of llss might hence provide useful limits on the nature of the darkmatter. we argue that the self-shielding of filaments may lead to a thermalinstability resulting in star formation. we implement a sub-grid model forthis, and find that filaments rather than haloes dominate star formation untilz 6. reionisation decreases the gas density in filaments, and the more usualstar formation in haloes dominates below z 6, although star formation infilaments continues until z=2. fifteen per cent of the stars of the z=0 galaxyformed in filaments. at higher redshift, these stars give galaxies a stringyappearance, which, if observed, might be a strong indication that the darkmatter is warm.

1403.3338	a compact, metal-rich, kpc-scale outflow in fbqs j0209-0438: detailed  diagnostics from hst/cos extreme uv observations	we present hst/cos observations of highly ionized absorption lines associatedwith a radio-loud qso at $z=1.1319$. the absorption system has multiplevelocity components, tracing gas that is largely outflowing from the qso atvelocities of a few 100 km s$^{-1}$. there is an unprecedented range inionization, with detections of hi, niii, niv, nv, oiv, oiv*, ov, ovi, neviii,mgx, sv and arviii. we estimate the total hydrogen number density from thecolumn density ratio n(oiv*)/n(oiv) to be$\log(n_{\textrm{h}}/\textrm{cm}^3)\sim 3$. assuming photoionizationequilibrium, we derive a distance to the absorbing complex of $2.3&lt;r&lt;6.0$ kpcfrom the centre of the qso. a range in ionization parameter, covering $\sim 2$orders of magnitude, suggest absorption path lengths in the range$10^{-4.5}&lt;l_{\textrm{abs}}&lt;1$ pc. in addition, the absorbing gas onlypartially covers the background emission from the qso continuum, which suggestsclouds with transverse sizes $l_{\textrm{trans}}&lt;10^{-2.5}$ pc. widelydiffering absorption path lengths, combined with covering fractions less thanunity across all ions pose a challenge to models involving simple cloudgeometries. these issues may be mitigated by the presence of non-equilibriumeffects, together with the possibility of multiple gas temperatures. thedynamics and expected lifetimes of the gas clouds suggest that they do notoriginate from close to the agn, but are instead formed close to their observedlocation. their inferred distance, outflow velocities and gas densities arebroadly consistent with scenarios involving gas entrainment or condensations inwinds driven by either supernovae, or the supermassive black hole accretiondisc. in the case of the latter, the present data most likely does not tracethe bulk of the outflow by mass, which could instead manifest itself as anaccompanying warm absorber, detectable in x-rays.

1404.3724	bent by baryons: the low mass galaxy-halo relation	the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos is of vital importancefor evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxyformation physics. we show that the widely used method of abundance matchingbased on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two ofits underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lowerrate due to the effect of baryons. in this regime, reliance on dark matter onlysimulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. wefind that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halomasses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching doesnot point to a failure of lcdm, but simply to a failure to account for baryoniceffects. our results also imply that the local group contains only a fewhundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs thatabundance matching would suggest. we show how relations derived from abundancematching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently tocalibrate models of galaxy formation.

1406.6362	the chosen few: the low mass halos that host faint galaxies	since reionization prevents star formation in most halos below 3 x 10^9 solarmasses, dwarf galaxies only populate a fraction of existing dark matter halos.we use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the local group to study thediscriminating factors for galaxy formation in the early universe and connectthem to the present-day properties of galaxies and halos. a combination ofselection effects related to reionization, and the subsequent evolution ofhalos in different environments, introduces strong biases between thepopulation of halos that host dwarf galaxies, and the total halo population.halos that host galaxies formed earlier and are more concentrated. in addition,halos more affected by tidal stripping are more likely to host a galaxy for agiven mass or maximum circular velocity, vmax, today. consequently, satellitehalos are populated more frequently than field halos, and satellite halos of10^8 - 10^9 solar masses or vmax of 12 - 20 km/s, similar to the local groupdwarf spheroidals, have experienced a greater than average reduction in bothmass and vmax after infall. they are on closer, more radial orbits with higherinfall velocities and earlier infall times. together, these effects make dwarfgalaxies highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution.

1407.7040	the eagle project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and  their environments	we introduce the virgo consortium's eagle project, a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes inrepresentative volumes. we discuss the limitations of such simulations in lightof their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and howthese affect their predictive power. one major improvement is our treatment offeedback from massive stars and agn in which thermal energy is injected intothe gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowingwinds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. becausethe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, wecalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of thegalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.the observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over thefull mass range, $10^8 &lt; m_*/m_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreementclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented forhydrodynamical simulations. we compare our results to a representative set oflow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find goodagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passivefractions, tully-fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxyclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic civ and ovi. whilethe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent withobservations for $m_* \gtrsim 10^9 m_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep atlower masses. the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters ofgalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting ahigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for agn feedback. eagleconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

1409.8297	the effect of baryons on the inner density profiles of rich clusters	we use the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments"(eagle) cosmological simulation to investigate the effect of baryons on thedensity profiles of rich galaxy clusters. we focus on eagle clusters with$m_{200}&gt;10^{14}~m_\odot$ of which we have six examples. the central brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs) in the simulation have steep stellar density profiles,$\rho_*(r) \propto r^{-3}$. stars dominate the mass density for$r&lt;10~\rm{kpc}$, and, as a result, the total mass density profiles are steeperthan the navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, in remarkable agreement withobservations. the dark matter halo itself closely follows the nfw form at allresolved radii ($r\gtrsim3.0~\rm{kpc}$). the eagle bcgs have similar surfacebrightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles as the bcgs in thesample of newman et al., which have the most detailed measurements currentlyavailable. after subtracting the contribution of the stars to the centraldensity, newman et al. infer significantly shallower slopes than the nfw value,in contradiction with the eagle results. we discuss possible reasons for thisdiscrepancy, and conclude that an inconsistency between the kinematical modeladopted by newman et al. for their bcgs, which assumes isotropic stellarorbits, and the kinematical structure of the eagle bcgs, in which the orbitalstellar anisotropy varies with radius and tends to be radially biased, couldexplain at least part of the discrepancy.

1409.8617	baryon effects on the internal structure of lcdm halos in the eagle  simulations	we investigate the internal structure and density profiles of halos of mass$10^{10}-10^{14}~m_\odot$ in the evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironment (eagle) simulations. these follow the formation of galaxies in a$\lambda$cdm universe and include a treatment of the baryon physics thought tobe relevant. the eagle simulations reproduce the observed present-day galaxystellar mass function, as well as many other properties of the galaxypopulation as a function of time. we find significant differences between themasses of halos in the eagle simulations and in simulations that follow onlythe dark matter component. nevertheless, halos are well described by thenavarro-frenk-white (nfw) density profile at radii larger than ~5% of thevirial radius but, closer to the centre, the presence of stars can producecuspier profiles. central enhancements in the total mass profile are mostimportant in halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{13}m_\odot$, where the stellar fractionpeaks. over the radial range where they are well resolved, the resulting galaxyrotation curves are in very good agreement with observational data for galaxieswith stellar mass $m_*&lt;5\times10^{10}m_\odot$. we present an empirical fittingfunction that describes the total mass profiles and show that its parametersare strongly correlated with halo mass.

0804.0004	the clustering of the first galaxy halos	we explore the clustering properties of high redshift dark matter halos,focusing on halos massive enough to host early generations of stars or galaxiesat redshift 10 and greater. halos are extracted from an array of dark mattersimulations able to resolve down to the "mini-halo" mass scale at redshifts ashigh as 30, thus encompassing the expected full mass range of halos capable ofhosting luminous objects and sources of reionization. halo clustering onlarge-scales agrees with the sheth, mo &amp; tormen halo bias relation within allour simulations, greatly extending the regime where large-scale clustering isconfirmed to be "universal" at the 10-20% level (which means, for example, that3sigma halos of cluster mass at z=0 have the same large-scale bias with respectto the mass distribution as 3sigma halos of galaxy mass at z=10). however, onsmall-scales, the clustering of our massive halos (&gt; ~10^9 msun/h) at thesehigh redshifts is stronger than expected from comparisons with small-scale haloclustering extrapolated from lower redshifts. this implies "non-universality"in the scale-dependence of halo clustering, at least for the commonly usedparameterizations of the scale-dependence of bias that we consider. we providea fit for the scale-dependence of bias in our results. this study provides abasis for using extraordinarily high redshift galaxies (redshift ~10) as aprobe of cosmology and galaxy formation at its earliest stages. we show alsothat mass and halo kinematics are strongly affected by finite simulationvolumes. this suggests the potential for adverse affects on gas dynamics inhydrodynamic simulations of limited volumes, such as is typical in simulationsof the formation of the "first stars", though further study is warranted.

1410.7391	the metallicity of galactic winds	the abundance evolution of galaxies depends critically on the balance betweenthe mixing of metals in their interstellar medium, the inflow of new gas andthe outflow of enriched gas. we study these processes in gas columnsperpendicular to a galactic disk using sub-parsec resolution simulations thattrack stellar ejecta with the flash code. we model a simplified interstellarmedium stirred and enriched by supernovae and their progenitors. we vary thedensity distribution of the gas column and integrate our results over anexponential disk to predict wind and ism enrichment properties for diskgalaxies. we find that winds from more massive galaxies are hotter and morehighly enriched, in stark contrast to that which is often assumed in galaxyformation models. we use these findings in a simple model of galacticenrichment evolution, in which the metallicity of forming galaxies is theresult of accretion of nearly pristine gas and outflow of enriched gas along anequilibrium sequence. we compare these predictions to the observedmass-metallicity relation, and demonstrate how the galaxy's gas fraction is akey controlling parameter. this explains the observed flattening of themass-metallicity relation at higher stellar masses.

1501.01311	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: calibration of subgrid  physics and model variations	we present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore theparameter space of the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironments" (eagle) simulation project. four of the simulations follow theevolution of a periodic cube l = 50 cmpc on a side, and each employs adifferent subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with starformation. the relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations eachreproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. three of thesimulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we showanalytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses thatreduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. such losses aregreatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the eagle reference model - byinjecting more energy in higher density gas. this model produces galaxies withthe observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scalingrelations. in the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process ofthe reference model was varied at a time. we find that the properties ofgalaxies with stellar mass &lt;~ m* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar massfunction) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback fromaccretion onto their central black holes. both processes must be efficient inorder to reproduce the observed galaxy population. in general, simulations thathave been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass functionwill still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement thatgalaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range ofobservables.

1503.04807	molecular hydrogen abundances of galaxies in the eagle simulations	we investigate the abundance of galactic molecular hydrogen (h$_2$) in the"evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle)cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we assign h$_2$ masses to gas particlesin the simulations in post-processing using two different prescriptions thatdepend on the local dust-to-gas ratio and the interstellar radiation field.both result in h$_2$ galaxy mass functions that agree well with observations inthe local and high-redshift universe. the simulations reproduce the observedscaling relations between the mass of h$_2$ and the stellar mass, starformation rate and stellar surface density. towards high edshifts, galaxies inthe simulations display larger h$_2$ mass fractions, and correspondingly lowerh$_2$ depletion timescales, also in good agreement with observations. thecomoving mass density of h$_2$ in units of the critical density, $\omega_{\rmh_2}$, peaks at $z\approx 1.2-1.5$, later than the predicted peak of the cosmicstar formation rate activity, at $z\approx 2$. this difference stems from thedecrease in gas metallicity and increase in interstellar radiation field withredshift, both of which hamper h$_2$ formation. we find that the cosmic h$_2$budget is dominated by galaxies with $m_{\rm h_2}&gt;10^9\,\rm m_{\odot}$, starformation rates $&gt;10\,\rm m_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$ and stellar masses $m_{\rmstellar}&gt;10^{10}\,\rm m_{\odot}$, which are readily observable in the opticaland near-ir. the match between the h$_2$ properties of galaxies that emerge inthe simulations and observations is remarkable, particularly since h$_2$observations were not used to adjust parameters in eagle.

1503.05553	the distribution of neutral hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies and  quasars in the eagle simulation	the observed high covering fractions of neutral hydrogen (hi) with columndensities above $\sim 10^{17} \rm{cm}^{-2}$ around lyman-break galaxies (lbgs)and bright quasars at redshifts z ~ 2-3 has been identified as a challenge forsimulations of galaxy formation. we use the eagle cosmological, hydrodynamicalsimulation, which has been shown to reproduce a wide range of galaxy propertiesand for which the subgrid feedback was calibrated without considering gasproperties, to study the distribution of hi around high-redshift galaxies. wepredict the covering fractions of strong hi absorbers ($n_{\rm{hi}} \gtrsim10^{17} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) inside haloes to increase rapidly with redshift but todepend only weakly on halo mass. for massive ($m_{200} \gtrsim 10^{12} {\rmm_{\odot}}$) halos the covering fraction profiles are nearly scale-invariantand we provide fitting functions that reproduce the simulation results. whileefficient feedback is required to increase the hi covering fractions to thehigh observed values, the distribution of strong absorbers in and around halosof a fixed mass is insensitive to factor of two variations in the strength ofthe stellar feedback. in contrast, at fixed stellar mass the predicted hidistribution is highly sensitive to the feedback efficiency. the fiducial eaglesimulation reproduces both the observed global column density distributionfunction of hi and the observed radial covering fraction profiles of strong hiabsorbers around lbgs and bright quasars.

1504.01437	the unexpected diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves	we examine the circular velocity profiles of galaxies in {\lambda}cdmcosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the eagle and local groupsprojects and compare them with a compilation of observed rotation curves ofgalaxies spanning a wide range in mass. the shape of the circular velocityprofiles of simulated galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxymass, but shows remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity.this is especially true for low-mass dark matter-dominated systems, reflectingthe expected similarity of the underlying cold dark matter haloes. this is atodds with observed dwarf galaxies, which show a large diversity of rotationcurve shapes, even at fixed maximum rotation speed. some dwarfs have rotationcurves that agree well with simulations, others do not. the latter are systemswhere the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is much lower thanexpected for cold dark matter haloes and include many galaxies where previouswork claims the presence of a constant density "core". the "cusp vs core" issueis thus better characterized as an "inner mass deficit" problem than as adensity slope mismatch. for several galaxies the magnitude of this inner massdeficit is well in excess of that reported in recent simulations where coresresult from baryon-induced fluctuations in the gravitational potential. weconclude that one or more of the following statements must be true: (i) thedark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model; (ii) currentsimulations fail to reproduce the effects of baryons on the inner regions ofdwarf galaxies; and/or (iii) the mass profiles of "inner mass deficit" galaxiesinferred from kinematic data are incorrect.

1504.04025	the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gas  distributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gasdistributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations. the combination of thesestate-of-the-art hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four ordersof magnitude in halo mass ($11 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/ [h^{-1}m_\odot]) &lt; 15$), awide radial range ($-2.3 &lt; log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc ]) &lt; 1.3$) and redshifts $0 &lt;z &lt; 1$. the shape parameters of the dark matter, stellar and hot gasdistributions follow qualitatively similar trends: they become more aspherical(and triaxial) with increasing halo mass, radius and redshift. we measure themisalignment of the baryonic components (hot gas and stars) of galaxies withtheir host halo as a function of halo mass, radius, redshift, and galaxy type(centrals vs satellites and early- vs late-type). overall, galaxies align wellwith the local distribution of the total (mostly dark) matter. however, thestellar distributions on galactic scales exhibit a median misalignment of about45-50 degrees with respect to their host haloes. this misalignment is reducedto 25-30 degrees in the most massive haloes ($13 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot ]) &lt; 15$). half of the disc galaxies in the eagle simulationshave a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40degrees. we present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probabilitydistribution of galaxy-halo misalignment to enable a straightforward inclusionof our results into models of galaxy formations based on purely collisionlessn-body simulations.

1504.04374	colours and luminosities of z=0.1 simulated galaxies in the eagle  simulations	we calculate the colours and luminosities of redshift z = 0.1 galaxies fromthe eagle simulation suite using the galaxev population synthesis models. wetake into account obscuration by dust in birth clouds and diffuse ism using atwo-component screen model, following the prescription of charlot and fall. wecompare models in which the dust optical depth is constant to models where itdepends on gas metallicity, gas fraction and orientation. the colours of eaglegalaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those ofobserved galaxies. in particular, eagle produces a red sequence of passivegalaxies and a blue cloud of star forming galaxies, with approximately thecorrect fraction of galaxies in each population and with g-r colours within 0.1magnitudes of those observed. luminosity functions from uv to nir wavelengthsdiffer from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resultingfrom a choice between petrosian and kron photometric apertures. despite thegenerally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. theblue cloud of eagle galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than inthe data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction inmassive eagle galaxies. there is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxiescompared to observations. the overall level of agreement with the observedcolour distribution suggests that eagle galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages,metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those ofobserved galaxies.

1506.01031	towards the statistical detection of the warm-hot intergalactic medium  in inter-cluster filaments of the cosmic web	modern analyses of structure formation predict a universe tangled in a'cosmic web' of dark matter and diffuse baryons. these theories further predictthat at low-z, a significant fraction of the baryons will be shock-heated to $t\sim 10^{5}-10^{7}$k yielding a warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim), but whoseactual existence has eluded a firm observational confirmation. we present anovel experiment to detect the whim, by targeting the putative filamentsconnecting galaxy clusters. we use hst/cos to observe a remarkable qsosightline that passes within $\delta d = 3$ mpc from the 7 inter-cluster axesconnecting 7 independent cluster-pairs at redshifts $0.1 \le z \le 0.5$. wefind tentative excesses of total hi, narrow hi (nla; doppler parameters $b&lt;50$km/s), broad hi (bla; $b \ge 50$ km/s) and ovi absorption lines withinrest-frame velocities of $\delta v \lesssim 1000$ km/s from the cluster-pairsredshifts, corresponding to $\sim 2$, $\sim 1.7$, $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ timestheir field expectations, respectively. although the excess of ovi likely comesfrom gas close to individual galaxies, we conclude that most of the excesses ofnlas and blas are truly intergalactic. we find that the covering fractions,$f_c$, of blas close to cluster-pairs are $\sim 4-7$ times higher than therandom expectation (at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ c.l.), whereas the $f_c$ of nlas andovi are not significantly enhanced. we argue that a larger relative excess ofblas compared to those of nlas close to cluster-pairs may be a signature of thewhim in inter-cluster filaments. by extending the present analysis to tens ofsightlines our experiment offers a promising route to detect the whim.

1506.02772	the evolution of galaxy metallicity scaling relations in cosmological  hydrodynamical simulations	the evolution of the metal content of galaxies and its relations to otherglobal properties [such as total stellar mass (m*), circular velocity, starformation rate (sfr), halo mass, etc.] provides important constraints on modelsof galaxy formation. here we examine the evolution of metallicity scalingrelations of simulated galaxies in the galaxies-intergalactic mediuminteraction calculation suite of cosmological simulations. we make comparisonsto observations of the correlation of gas-phase abundances with m* (themass-metallicity relation, mzr), as well as with both m* and sfr or gas massfraction (the so-called 3d fundamental metallicity relations, fmrs). thesimulated galaxies follow the observed local mzr and fmrs over an order ofmagnitude in m*, but overpredict the metallicity of massive galaxies (log m* &gt;10.5), plausibly due to inefficient feedback in this regime. we discuss theorigin of the mzr and fmrs in the context of galactic outflows and gasaccretion. we examine the evolution of mass-metallicity relations defined usingdifferent elements that probe the three enrichment channels (snii, snia, andagb stars). relations based on elements produced mainly by snii evolve weakly,whereas those based on elements produced preferentially in snia/agb exhibitstronger evolution, due to the longer timescales associated with thesechannels. finally, we compare the relations of central and satellite galaxies,finding systematically higher metallicities for satellites, as observed. weshow this is due to the removal of the metal poor gas reservoir that normallysurrounds galaxies and acts to dilute their gas-phase metallicity (viacooling/accretion onto the disk), but is lost due to ram pressure stripping forsatellites.

1507.03643	the apostle project: local group kinematic mass constraints and  simulation candidate selection	we use a large sample of isolated dark matter halo pairs drawn fromcosmological n-body simulations to identify candidate systems whose kinematicsmatch that of the local group of galaxies (lg). we find, in agreement with the"timing argument" and earlier work, that the separation and approach velocityof the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) galaxies favour a total mass for thepair of ~ 5*10^12 m_sun. a mass this large, however, is difficult to reconcilewith the small relative tangential velocity of the pair, as well as with thesmall deceleration from the hubble flow observed for the most distant lgmembers. halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses afactor of ~2 times smaller than suggested by the timing argument, but withlarge dispersion, spanning more than a decade in mass. guided by these results,we have selected 12 halo pairs with total mass in the range 1.6-3.6 *10^12m_sun for the apostle project (a project of simulations of the localenvironment), a suite of resimulations at various numerical resolution levels(reaching up to ~10^4 m_sun per gas particle) that use the hydrodynamical codeand subgrid physics developed for the eagle project. these simulationsreproduce, by construction, the main kinematics of the mw-m31 pair, and producesatellite populations whose overall number, luminosities, and kinematics are ingood agreement with observations of the mw and m31 companions. thesediagnostics are sensitive to the total mass assumed for the mw-m31 pair;indeed, the lg satellite population would be quite difficult to reproduce forpair masses as high as indicated by the timing argument. the apostle candidatesystems thus provide an excellent testbed to confront directly many of thepredictions of the lambda-cdm cosmology with observations of our localuniverse.

1507.06996	intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report results for the alignments of galaxies in the eagle and cosmo-owlssimulations as a function of galaxy separation and halo mass. the combinationof these hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four orders ofmagnitude in halo mass ($10.7&lt;log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot])&lt;15$) and alarge range of separations ($-1&lt;log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc])&lt; 2$). we focus on twoclasses of alignments: the orientations of galaxies with respect to either thedirections to, or the orientations of, surrounding galaxies. we find that thestrength of the alignment is a strongly decreasing function of the distancebetween galaxies. the orientation-direction alignment can remain significant upto ~100 mpc, for galaxies hosted by the most massive haloes in our simulations.galaxies hosted by more massive subhaloes show stronger alignment. at a fixedhalo mass, more aspherical or prolate galaxies exhibit stronger alignments. thespatial distribution of satellites is anisotropic and significantly alignedwith the major axis of the main host halo. the major axis of satellitegalaxies, when all stars are considered, are preferentially aligned towards thecentre of the main host halo. the predicted projected direction-orientationalignment, $\epsilon_{g+}(r_{p})$, is in broad agreement with recentobservations when only stars within the typical observable extent of a galaxyare used to define galaxy orientations. we find that theorientation-orientation alignment is weaker than the orientation-directionalignment on all scales. overall, the strength of galaxy alignments dependsstrongly on the subset of stars that are used to measure the orientations ofgalaxies and it is always weaker than the alignment of the dark matter haloes.thus, alignment models that use halo orientation as a direct proxy for galaxyorientation will overestimate the impact of intrinsic alignments on weaklensing analyses.

1507.08281	recycled stellar ejecta as fuel for star formation and implications for  the origin of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation	we use cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the eagle and owlsprojects to assess the significance of recycled stellar ejecta as fuel for starformation. the fractional contributions of stellar mass loss to the cosmic starformation rate (sfr) and stellar mass densities increase with time, reaching$35 \%$ and $19 \%$, respectively, at $z=0$. the importance of recyclingincreases steeply with galaxy stellar mass for $m_{\ast} &lt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$, and decreases mildly at higher mass. this trend arises from themass dependence of feedback associated with star formation and agn, whichpreferentially suppresses star formation fuelled by recycling. recycling ismore important for satellites than centrals and its contribution decreases withgalactocentric radius. the relative contribution of agb stars increases withtime and towards galaxy centers. this is a consequence of the more gradualrelease of agb ejecta compared to that of massive stars, and the preferentialremoval of the latter by star formation-driven outflows and by lock up instellar remnants. recycling-fuelled star formation exhibits a tight, positivecorrelation with galaxy metallicity, with a secondary dependence on therelative abundance of alpha elements (which are predominantly synthesized inmassive stars), that is insensitive to the subgrid models for feedback. hence,our conclusions are directly relevant for the origin of the mass-metallicityrelation and metallicity gradients. applying the relation between recycling andmetallicity to the observed mass-metallicity relation yields our best estimateof the mass-dependent contribution of recycling. for centrals with a masssimilar to that of the milky way, we infer the contributions of recycledstellar ejecta to the sfr and stellar mass to be $35 \%$ and $20 \%$,respectively.

1509.02166	dark matter annihilation radiation in hydrodynamic simulations of milky  way haloes	we obtain predictions for the properties of cold dark matter annihilationradiation using high resolution hydrodynamic zoom-in cosmological simulationsof milky way-like galaxies (apostle project) carried out as part of the"evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle) programme.galactic halos in the simulation have significantly different properties fromthose assumed in the "standard halo model" often used in dark matter detectionstudies. the formation of the galaxy causes a contraction of the dark matterhalo, whose density profile develops a steeper slope than thenavarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile between $r\approx1.5$ kpc and $r\approx10$kpc. at smaller radii, $r\lesssim1.5$ kpc, the halos develop a flatter than nfwslope. this unexpected feature may be specific to our particular choice ofsubgrid physics model but nevertheless the dark matter density profiles agreewithin 30% as the mass resolution is increased by a factor 150. the innerregions of the halos are almost perfectly spherical (axis ratios $b/a &gt; 0.97$within $r=1$ kpc) and there is no offset larger than 45 pc between the centreof the stellar distribution and the centre of the dark halo. the morphology ofthe predicted dark matter annihilation radiation signal is in broad agreementwith $\gamma$-ray observations at large galactic latitudes ($b\gtrsim3^\circ$).at smaller angles, the inferred signal in one of our four galaxies is similarto that which is observed but it is significantly weaker in the other three.

1509.05056	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: the importance of the  hydrodynamics scheme	we present results from a subset of simulations from the "evolution andassembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle) suite in which theformulation of the hydrodynamics scheme is varied. we compare simulations thatuse the same subgrid models without re-calibration of the parameters butemploying the standard gadget flavour of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)instead of the more recent state-of-the-art anarchy formulation of sph that wasused in the fiducial eagle runs. we find that the properties of most galaxies,including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the detailsof the hydrodynamics solver. however, the star formation rates of the mostmassive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurioussurface tension in the simulation using standard sph. this affects theefficiency with which agn activity can quench star formation in these galaxiesand it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the x-rayemission from these objects. the differences that can be attributed to thehydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lowerresolution. we also find that the use of a time step limiter is important forachieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of thelow-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.

1511.01098	the apostle simulations: solutions to the local group's cosmic puzzles	the local group of galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests ofmodels of cosmic structure formation. for example, observations of the milkyway (mw) and andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement withn-body simulations of the "lambda cold dark matter" ({\lambda}cdm) model: thereare far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos(the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the mostmassive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightestsatellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes ofsatellites" problem). here we present results from apostle (a project ofsimulating the local environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the localgroup (lg) members. applying the eagle code to the lg environment, we find thatour simulations match the observed abundance of lg galaxies, including thesatellite galaxies of the mw and andromeda. due to changes to the structure ofhalos and the evolution in the lg environment, the simulations reproduce theobserved relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individualdwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in theirdark matter profiles. satellite systems form with a range of spatialanisotropies, including one similar to that of the mw, confirming that such aconfiguration is not unexpected in {\lambda}cdm. finally, based on the observedvelocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of themaximum circular velocity for the halos of nine mw dwarf spheroidals.

1511.04909	the distribution of atomic hydrogen in eagle galaxies: morphologies,  profiles, and hi holes	we compare the mass and internal distribution of atomic hydrogen (hi) in 2200present-day central galaxies with m_star &gt; 10^10 m_sun from the 100 mpc eaglereference simulation to observational data. atomic hydrogen fractions arecorrected for self-shielding using a fitting formula from radiative transfersimulations and for the presence of molecular hydrogen using an empirical or atheoretical prescription from the literature. the resulting neutral hydrogenfractions, m_(hi+h2)/m_star, agree with observations to better than 0.1 dex forgalaxies with m_star between 10^10 and 10^11 m_sun. our fiducial, empirical h2model based on gas pressure results in galactic hi mass fractions, m_hi/m_star,that agree with observations from the gass survey to better than 0.3 dex, butthe alternative theoretical h2 formula leads to a negative offset inm_hi/m_star of up to 0.5 dex. visual inspection reveals that most hi disks insimulated hi-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recentaccretion events. many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large hiholes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementationin eagle. the hi mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holesin the hi disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1dex). the presence of large hi holes also makes the radial hi surface densityprofiles somewhat too low in the centre, at \sigma_hi &gt; 1 m_sun pc^-2 (by afactor of &lt;~ 2 compared to data from the bluedisk survey). in the outer region(\sigma_hi &lt; 1 m_sun pc^-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively withobservations. scaled by hi size, the simulated profiles of hi-rich (m_hi &gt;10^9.8 m_sun) and control galaxies (10^9.1 m_sun &gt; m_hi &gt; 10^9.8 m_sun) followeach other closely, as observed.

1512.02636	the link between the assembly of the inner dark matter halo and the  angular momentum evolution of galaxies in the eagle simulation	we explore the co-evolution of the specific angular momentum of dark matterhaloes and the cold baryons that comprise the galaxies within. we study overtwo thousand central galaxies within the reference cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulation of the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments"(eagle) project. we employ a methodology within which the evolutionary historyof a system is specified by the time-evolving properties of the lagrangianparticles that define it at z=0. we find a strong correlation between theevolution of the specific angular momentum of today's stars (cold gas) and thatof the inner (whole) dark matter halo they are associated with. this link isparticularly strong for the stars formed before the epoch of maximum expansionand subsequent collapse of the central dark matter halo (turnaround). spheroidsare typically assembled primarily from stars formed prior to turnaround, andare therefore destined to suffer a net loss of angular momentum associated withthe strong merging activity during the assembly of the inner dark matter halo.stellar discs retain their specific angular momentum since they are comprisedof stars formed mainly after turnaround, from gas that mostly preserves thehigh specific angular momentum it acquired by tidal torques during the lineargrowth of the halo. since the specific angular momentum loss of the stars istied to the galaxy's morphology today, it may be possible to use our results topredict, statistically, the assembly history of a halo given the morphology ofthe galaxy it hosts.

astro-ph;0006065	observational signatures of feedback in qso absorption spectra	models for the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies require strongfeedback in order to explain the observed properties of these systems. weinvestigate whether such feedback has observational consequences for theintergalactic medium, as probed in absorption towards background quasars. atypical quasar sight-line intersects one proto-cluster per unit redshift, andsignificant feedback from forming galaxies or agn, heating the proto-clustergas, will result in a large clearing of reduced absorption in the lymanalpha-forest. such a gap could be detected at redshift &gt; 3 when the meanopacity is high. feedback from lyman-break galaxies in proto-clusters can beprobed by the absorption lines produced in their winds. strong feedback fromgalaxies has a major impact on the number and properties of absorption lineswith neutral hydrogen column densities of 10^16/ cm^2. this feedback can beprobed with multiple sight-lines and by studying the unsaturated higher-orderlines of the lyman series. galactic winds from dwarf galaxies should break-upinto clouds, in order not to over produce the number of absorption lines. theseclouds can then coast to large distances.

astro-ph;0012336	discriminating weak lensing from intrinsic spin correlations using the  curl-gradient decomposition	the distortion field defined by the ellipticities of galaxy shapes projectedon the sky can be uniquely decomposed into a gradient and a curl component. ifthe observed ellipticities are induced by weak gravitational lensing, then thedistortion field is curl free. here we show that, in contrast, the distortionfield resulting from intrinsic spin alignments is not curl free. this providesa powerful discriminant between lensing and intrinsic contributions to observedellipticity correlations. we also show how these contributions can bedisentangled statistically from the ellipticity correlations or computedlocally from circular integrals of the ellipticity field. this allows for anunambiguous detection of intrinsic galaxy alignments in the data. when thedistortions are dominated by lensing, as occurs at high redshifts, thedecomposition provides a valuable tool for understanding properties of thenoise and systematic errors. these techniques can be applied equally well tothe polarization of the microwave background, where it can be used to separatecurl-free scalar perturbations from those produced by gravity waves or defects.

astro-ph;0105233	probing the intergalactic medium with the lyman alpha forest along  multiple lines of sight to distant qsos	(abridged) we present an effective implementation of analytical calculationsof the lyalpha opacity distribution of the intergalactic medium (igm) alongmultiple lines of sight (los) to distant quasars in a cosmological setting.this method fully accounts for the expected correlations between los and thecosmic variance in the large-scale modes of the dark matter distribution.strong correlations extending up to ~300 kpc (proper) and more are found atredshift z~2-&gt;3, in agreement with observations. these correlations areinvestigated using the cross-correlation coefficient and the cross-powerspectrum of the flux distribution along different los and by identifyingcoincident absorption features as fitted with a voigt profile fitting routine.the cross-correlation coefficient between the los can be used to constrain theshape-parameter gamma of the power spectrum if the temperature and thetemperature density relation of the igm can be determined indepedently. we alsopropose a new technique to recover the 3d linear dark matter power spectrum byintegrating over 1d flux cross-spectra which is complementary to the usual`differentiation' of 1d auto-spectra. the cross-power spectrum suffers muchless from errors uncorrelated in different los, like those introduced bycontinuum fitting. investigations of the flux correlations in adjacent losshould thus allow to extend studies of the dark matter power spectrum with thelyalpha forest to significantly larger scales than is possible with fluxauto-power spectra. 30 pairs with separation of 1-2 arcmin should be sufficientto determine the 1d cross-spectrum at scales of 60 mpc/h with an accuracy ofabout 30% if the error is dominated by cosmic variance.

0808.1844	a test suite for quantitative comparison of hydrodynamics codes in  astrophysics	we test four commonly used astrophysical simulation codes; enzo, flash,gadget and hydra, using a suite of numerical problems with analytic initial andfinal states. situations similar to the conditions of these tests, a sod shock,a sedov blast and both a static and translating king sphere occur commonly inastrophysics, where the accurate treatment of shocks, sound waves, supernovaeexplosions and collapsed haloes is a key condition for obtaining reliablevalidated simulations. we demonstrate that comparable results can be obtainedfor lagrangian and eulerian codes by requiring that approximately one particleexists per grid cell in the region of interest. we conclude that adaptiveeulerian codes, with their ability to place refinements in regions of rapidlychanging density, are well suited to problems where physical processes arerelated to such changes. lagrangian methods, on the other hand, are well suitedto problems where large density contrasts occur and the physics is related tothe local density itself rather than the local density gradient.

astro-ph;0110600	temperature fluctuations in the intergalactic medium	the temperature of the low-density intergalactic medium is set by the balancebetween adiabatic cooling resulting from the expansion of the universe, andphoto-heating by the uv-background. we have analysed the lyman-alpha forest ofeleven high-resolution quasar spectra using wavelets, and find strong evidenceof a marked jump in the temperature at the mean density, t_0, of 60 per centaround a redshift z=3.3, which we attribute to reionization of heliumii. thejump can be seen in all three of our spectra that straddle redshift 3.3, at asignificance of 99 per cent. below z=3.1, our results are consistent with asmooth cooling down of the universe, as expected when adiabatic expansiondominates over photo-heating by a uv-background from qsos and galaxies. we findno evidence of thermal fluctuations on scales greater than 5000 km/s largerthan 50 per cent, which could be detected by our method, suggesting that theigm follows a reasonably well-defined temperature-density relation. wedemonstrate that the mean wavelet amplitude scales inversely with t_0 andcalibrate the relation with hydrodynamical simulations. we find t_0= 12000k atz&gt;3.6. such high temperature suggest that hydrogen reionization occuredrelatively recent.

astro-ph;0210560	the impact of galaxy formation on x-ray groups	using hydrodynamical simulations of the lcdm cosmology, that include bothradiative cooling and a phenomenological model for star formation andsupernovae feedback, we investigate the impact of galaxy formation on the x-rayproperties of groups at redshift zero. motivated by the observed ``break'' inthe l_x-t_x relation at kt~1-2kev, our feedback model is based on theassumption that supernovae imprint a temperature scale on the hot gas, with thestar formation rate and corresponding reheated gas mass then depending only onthe available energy budget. we demonstrate that a strong feedback model with aheating temperature comparable to this break (kt_=2kev), and an energy budgettwice that available from supernovae (epsilon=2), raises the core entropy ofgroups sufficiently to produce an adequate match to their observed x-rayproperties. a lower value of epsilon increases the star formation rate withoutsignificantly affecting the x-ray properties of groups, and a model withepsilon~0.1 reproduces the observed fraction of baryons in stars. however, aheating temperature which is lower than the virial temperatures of the groupsleads to an excess of cooling gas that boosts their x-ray luminosities, due tothe failure of the reheated material to escape from the gravitationalpotential. a limited study of numerical resolution effects reveals that thetemperature of poorly-resolved objects is underestimated, therefore (in ourcase) a fully-resolved group population would lead to a steeper l_x-t_xrelation, bringing our results into even better agreement with theobservations.

astro-ph;0212241	dark energy effects on the lyman-alpha forest	in quintessence models, the dark energy content of the universe is describedby a slowly rolling scalar field whose pressure and energy density obey anequation of state of the form p=w $\rho$; w is in general a function of timesuch that w&lt;-1/3, in order to drive the observed acceleration of the universetoday. the cosmological constant model lcdm corresponds to the limiting casew=-1. in this paper, we explore the prospects of using the lyman-alpha forestto constrain w, using semi-analytical techniques to model the intergalacticmedium (igm). a different value of w changes both the growth factor and thehubble parameter as a function of time. the resulting change in the opticaldepth distribution affects the optical depth power spectrum, the number ofregions of high transmission per unit redshift and the cross-correlationcoefficient of spectra of quasar pairs. these can be detected in current data,provided we have independent estimates of the thermal state of the igm, itsionization parameter and the baryon density.

astro-ph;0306469	metallicity of the intergalactic medium using pixel statistics. ii. the  distribution of metals as traced by c iv	(modified) we measure the distribution of carbon in the intergalactic mediumas a function of redshift z and overdensity delta. using a hydrodynamicalsimulation to link the h i absorption to the density and temperature of theabsorbing gas, and a model for the uv background radiation, we convert ratiosof c iv to h i pixel optical depths into carbon abundances. a careful analysisof 19 high-quality quasar absorption spectra reveals that the carbon abundanceis spatially highly inhomogeneous and is well-described by a lognormaldistribution for fixed delta and z. using data in the range log(delta) = -0.5 -1.8 and z = 1.8 - 4.1, and a renormalized version of the haardt &amp; madau (2001)model for the uv background radiation from galaxies and quasars, we measure amedian metallicity of [c/h] = -3.47 + 0.08(z-3) + 0.65[log(delta)-0.5] and alognormal scatter of sigma([c/h]) = 0.76 + 0.02(z-3) - 0.23[log(delta)-0.5].thus, we find significant trends with overdensity, but no evidence forevolution. these measurements imply that gas in this density range accounts fora cosmic carbon abundance of [c/h] = -2.80 +/- 0.13 (omega_c = 2e-7), with noevidence for evolution. the dominant source of systematic error is the spectralshape of the uv background, with harder spectra yielding higher carbonabundances. while the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the spectralhardness may exceed the quoted statistical errors for delta &lt; 10, we stressthat uv backgrounds that differ significantly from our fiducial model giveunphysical results. the measured lognormal scatter is strictly independent ofthe spectral shape, provided the background radiation is uniform. we alsopresent measurements of the c iii/c iv ratio (which rule out collisionalionization) and of the evolution of the effective lyman-alpha optical depth.

astro-ph;0402441	quenching cluster cooling flows with recurrent hot plasma bubbles	the observed cooling rate of hot gas in clusters is much lower than thatinferred from the gas density profiles. this suggests that the gas is beingheated by some source. we use an adaptive-mesh refinement code (flash) tosimulate the effect of multiple, randomly positioned, injections of thermalenergy within 50 kpc of the centre of an initially isothermal cluster with massm_200=3x10^(14) msol and kt=3.1 kev. we have performed eight simulations withspherical bubbles of energy generated every 10^8 years, over a total of 1.5gyr. each bubble is created by injecting thermal energy steadily for 10^7years; the total energy of each bubble ranges from 0.1--3x10^(60) erg,depending on the simulation. we find that 2x10^(60) erg per bubble(corresponding to a average power of 6.3x10^(44) erg/s) effectively balancesenergy loss in the cluster and prevents the accumulation of gas below kt=1 kevfrom exceeding the observational limits of 30 msol/yr. this injection rate iscomparable to the radiated luminosity of the cluster, and the required energyand periodic timescale of events are consistent with observations of bubblesproduced by central agn in clusters. the effectiveness of this process dependsprimarily on the total amount of injected energy and the initial location ofthe bubbles, but is relatively insensitive to the exact duty cycle of events.

(2) for unequal massmergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. theheating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of thefinal system. (3) the bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinctepisodes. the first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock waveis generated that propagates outwards from the centre. this causes the combinedsystem to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. the secondepisode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. thisrevised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physicalunderstanding of cosmological gas simulations.

astro-ph;9704119	non-linear evolution of the tidal angular momentum of protostructures  ii: non-gaussian initial conditions	the formalism that describes the non-linear growth of the angular momentum lof protostructures from tidal torques in a friedmann universe, as developed ina previous paper, is extended to include non-gaussian initial conditions. werestrict our analysis here to a particular class of non-gaussian primordialdistributions, namely multiplicative models. in such models, stronglycorrelated phases are produced by obtaining the gravitational potential via anonlinear local transformation of an underlying gaussian random field. thedynamical evolution of the system is followed by describing the trajectories offluid particles using second-order lagrangian perturbation theory. in theeinstein-de sitter universe, the lowest-order perturbative correction to thevariance of the linear angular momentum of collapsing structures grows as t^8/3for generic non-gaussian statistics, which contrasts with the t^10/3 growthrate characteristic of gaussian statistics. this is a consequence of the factthat the lowest-order perturbative spin contribution in the non-gaussian casearises from the third moment of the gravitational potential, which isidentically zero for a gaussian field. evaluating these corrections at themaximum expansion time of the collapsing structure, we find that thesenon-gaussian and non-linear terms can be as high as the linear estimate,without the degree of non-gaussianity as quantified by skewness and kurtosis ofthe density field being unacceptably large. the results suggest thathigher-order terms in the perturbative expansion may contribute significantlyto galactic spin which contrasts with the straightforward gaussian case.

astro-ph;9805119	p3m-sph simulations of the lyman-alpha forest	(abridged) we investigate the importance of several numerical artifacts suchas lack of resolution on spectral properties of the lyman alpha forest ascomputed from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in a standard cold darkmatter universe. we assume an ionising background produced by quasars ascomputed by haardt &amp; madau. we use a new simulation code based on p3m and sph,which we compare in detail with a modified version of hydra (couchman et al.)and published results of treesph (hernquist et al.). the agreement is very goodbetween all three codes. we then use our new code to investigate severalnumerical effects such as resolution on spectral statistics deduced from voigtprofile fitting. our highest resolution simulation has a mass resolution of2.1x10^5 solar masses. the column density distribution is converged but theb-parameter distribution is only marginally converged. the simulationreproduces both the hi column density and b-parameter distribution when weassume a high baryon density, omega_b h^2 &gt; 0.028. in addition we need toimpose a higher igm temperature than predicted within our basic set ofassumptions. the simulated hi optical depth is in good agreement withobservations but the heii optical depth is lower than observed. fitting thelatter requires a larger jump between the photon flux at the h and he edge thanis present in the haardt &amp; madau spectrum.

astro-ph;9812141	dependencies of qso lyman-alpha absorption line statistics on  cosmological parameters	we have performed high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the lyman-alphaforest in a variety of popular cold dark matter dominated cosmologies,including a low density and a vacuum-dominated model. the fluctuation amplitudeof these models is chosen to match the observed abundance of galaxy clusters atlow redshift. we assume that the intergalactic medium is photoionized andphotoheated by a uniform uv-background with the required amplitude to give theobserved mean hydrogen absorption. we produce simulated spectra, analyze themby fitting voigt profiles and compare line statistics with those obtained fromhigh resolution observations. all models give column density distributions ingood agreement with observations. however, the distribution of line widths (theb-parameter distribution) reflects differences in the temperature of theintergalactic medium between the models, with colder models producing morenarrow lines. all the models with a low baryon density, omega_b h^2=0.0125, aretoo cold to produce a b-parameter distribution in agreement with observations.models with a higher baryon density, omega_b h^2=0.025, are hotter and providebetter fits. peculiar velocities contribute significantly to the line widths inmodels with low matter density, and this improves the agreement withobservations further. we briefly discuss alternative mechanisms for reconcilingthe simulations with the observed b-parameter distributions.

astro-ph;9906271	measuring the equation of state of the intergalactic medium	(abridged) numerical simulations indicate that the intergalactic medium (igm)responsible for the low column density lyman-alpha forest follows a welldefined temperature-density relation. we demonstrate that such an equation ofstate results in a cutoff in the distribution of line widths (b-parameters) asa function of column density (n) for the low column density absorption lines.this explains the existence of the lower envelope which is clearly seen inscatter plots of the b(n)-distribution in observed qso spectra. we show thatthe parameters of the cutoff in the b(n)-distribution are strongly correlatedwith the parameters of the underlying equation of state. we use simulations todetermine these relations, which can then be applied to the observed cutoff inthe b(n)-distribution to measure the equation of state of the igm. using montecarlo simulations of keck spectra at z=3, we show that determining the slope ofthe equation of state will be difficult, but that the amplitude can bedetermined to within ten per cent, even from a single qso spectrum. measuringthe evolution of the equation of state with redshift will allow us to put tightconstraints on the reionization history of the universe.

astro-ph;9908288	broadening of qso lyman-alpha forest absorbers	we investigate the dependence of qso lyman-alpha absorption features on thetemperature of the absorbing gas and on the amplitude of the underlying darkmatter fluctuations. we use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations in colddark matter dominated cosmological models. in models with a hotterintergalactic medium (igm), the increased temperature enhances the pressuregradients between low and high density regions and this changes the spatialdistribution and the velocity field of the gas. combined with more thermalbroadening, this leads to significantly wider absorption features in hottermodels. cosmological models with little small scale power also have broaderabsorption features, because fluctuations on the scale of the jeans length arestill in the linear regime . consequently, both the amplitude of dark matterfluctuations on small scales and thermal smoothing affect the flux decrementdistribution in a similar way. however, the b-parameter distribution of voigtprofile fits, obtained by deblending the absorption features into a sum ofthermally broadened lines, is largely independent of the amount of small scalepower, but does depend strongly on the igm temperature. the same is true forthe two-point function of the flux and for the flux power spectrum on smallscales. these three flux statistics are thus sensitive probes of thetemperature of the igm. we compare them computed for our models and obtainedfrom a hires spectrum of the quasar q1422+231 and conclude that the igmtemperature at z=3.25 is fairly high, t_0&gt;= 15000k.
