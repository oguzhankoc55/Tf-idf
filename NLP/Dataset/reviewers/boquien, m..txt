0903.3403	collisional debris as laboratories to study star formation	in this paper we address the question whether star formation is driven bylocal processes or the large scale environment. to do so, we investigate starformation in collisional debris where the gravitational potential well andvelocity gradients are shallower and compare our results with previous work onstar formation in non-interacting spiral and dwarf galaxies. we have performedmultiwavelength spectroscopic and imaging observations (from thefar-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared) of 6 interacting systems, identifying atotal of 60 star-forming regions in their collision debris.  our analysis indicates that in these regions a) the emission of the dust isat the expected level for their luminosity and metallicity, b) the usualtracers of star formation rate display the typical trend and scatter found inclassical star forming regions, and c) the extinction and metallicity are notthe main parameters governing the scatter in the properties of intergalacticstar forming regions; age effects and variations in the number of stellarpopulations, seem to play an important role. our work suggests that localproperties such as column density and dust content, rather than the large scaleenvironment seem to drive star formation. this means that intergalactic starforming regions can be used as a reliable tool to study star formation.

0910.0774	star-forming or starbursting? the ultraviolet conundrum	compared to starburst galaxies, normal star forming galaxies have been shownto display a much larger dispersion of the dust attenuation at fixed reddeningthrough studies of the irx-beta diagram (the ir/uv ratio "irx" versus the uvcolor "beta"). to investigate the causes of this larger dispersion and attemptto isolate second parameters, we have used galex uv, ground-based optical, andspitzer infrared imaging of 8 nearby galaxies, and examined the properties ofindividual uv and 24 micron selected star forming regions. we concentrated onstar-forming regions, in order to isolate simpler star formation histories thanthose that characterize whole galaxies. we find that 1) the dispersion is notcorrelated with the mean age of the stellar populations, 2) a range of dustgeometries and dust extinction curves are the most likely causes for theobserved dispersion in the irx-beta diagram 3) together with some potentialdilution of the most recent star-forming population by older unrelated bursts,at least in the case of star-forming regions within galaxies, 4) we alsorecover some general characteristics of the regions, including a tight positivecorrelation between the amount of dust attenuation and the metal content.although generalizing our results to whole galaxies may not be immediate, thepossibility of a range of dust extinction laws and geometries should beaccounted for in the latter systems as well.

1003.1339	total infrared luminosity estimation of resolved and unresolved galaxies	the total infrared (tir) luminosity from galaxies can be used to examine bothstar formation and dust physics. we provide here new relations to estimate thetir luminosity from various spitzer bands, in particular from the 8 micron and24 micron bands. to do so, we use 45" subregions within a subsample of nearbyface-on spiral galaxies from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) that have known oxygen abundances as well as integrated galaxy datafrom the sings, the local volume legacy survey (lvl) and engelbracht et al.(2008) samples. taking into account the oxygen abundances of the subregions,the star formation rate intensity, and the relative emission of the polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons at 8 micron, the warm dust at 24 micron and the cold dustat 70 micron and 160 micron we derive new relations to estimate the tirluminosity from just one or two of the spitzer bands. we also show that themetallicity and the star formation intensity must be taken into account whenestimating the tir luminosity from two wave bands, especially when datalongward of 24 micron are not available.

1005.2182	100 mum and 160 mum emission as resolved star-formation rate estimators  in m33 (herm33es)	over the past few years several studies have provided estimates of the sfr(star-formation rate) or the total infrared luminosity from just one infraredband. however these relations are generally derived for entire galaxies, whichare known to contain a large scale diffuse emission that is not necessarilyrelated to the latest star-formation episode. we provide new relations toestimate the sfr from resolved star-forming regions at 100 mum and 160 mum. weselect individual star-forming regions in the nearby (840 kpc) galaxy m33. weestimate the sfr combining the emission in halpha and at 24 mum to calibratethe emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as sfr estimators, as mapped withpacs/herschel. the data are obtained in the framework of the herm33es open timekey project. there is less emission in the hii regions at 160 mum than at 100mum. over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in sigma(sfr) we find that the 100mum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the sfr, whereas that at 160 mumis slightly superlinear. the behaviour of individual star-forming regions issurprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. at high sigma(sfr), starformation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations inradiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low sigma(sfr).detailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will beneeded to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess thefraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.

1005.2297	properties of compact 250 \mu m emission and hii regions in m33  (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, using the high resolutionand sensitivity of the herschel photometric data, we study the compact emissionin the local group spiral galaxy m33 to investigate the nature of the compactspire emission sources. we extracted a catalogue of sources at 250um in orderto investigate the nature of this compact emission. taking advantage of theunprecedented herschel resolution at these wavelengths, we also focus on a moreprecise study of some striking halpha shells in the northern part of thegalaxy. we present a catalogue of 159 compact emission sources in m33identified by sextractor in the 250um spire band that is the one that providesthe best spatial resolution. we also measured fluxes at 24um and halpha forthose 159 extracted sources. the morphological study of the shells alsobenefits from a multiwavelength approach including halpha, far-uv from galex,and infrared from both spitzer irac 8um and mips 24um in order to makecomparisons. for the 159 compact sources selected at 250um, we find a verystrong pearson correlation coefficient with the mips 24um emission (r24 = 0.94)and a rather strong correlation with the halpha emission, although with morescatter (rha = 0.83). the morphological study of the halpha shells shows adisplacement between far-ultraviolet, halpha, and the spire bands. the cooldust emission from spire clearly delineates the halpha shell structures. thevery strong link between the 250um compact emission and the 24um and halphaemissions, by recovering the star formation rate from standard recipes for hiiregions, allows us to provide star formation rate calibrations based on the250um compact emission alone. the different locations of the halpha andfar-ultraviolet emissions with respect to the spire cool dust emission leads toa dynamical age of a few myr for the halpha shells and the associated cooldust.

1005.2563	pacs and spire photometer maps of m33: first results of the herschel m33  extended survey (herm33es)	within the framework of the herm33es key project, we are studying the starforming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy m33,exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of herschel. we use pacs andspire maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study thevariation of the spectral energy distributions (seds) with galacto-centricdistance. detailed sed modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxesin elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dustemissivity index, are fitted to the seds between 24 and 500 micron using alsomips/spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.the far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiralstructure of m33. an underlying diffuse disk is seen in all spire maps (250-500micron). two component fits to the seds agree better than isothermal modelswith the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. the twocomponent model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radialseds. the cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warmcomponent is less than 0.3% for all the fits. the temperature of the warmcomponent is not well constrained and is found to be about 60k plus/minus 10k.the temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24k in theinner 2 kpc radius to 13k beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fittingmodel. the gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higherthan the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with thesubsolar metallicity of m33.

1005.3422	cool gas and dust in m33: results from the herschel m33 extended survey  (herm33es)	we present an analysis of the first space-based far-ir-submm observations ofm 33, which measure the emission from the cool dust and resolve the giantmolecular cloud complexes. with roughly half-solar abundances, m33 is a firststep towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able toprovide an alternative to co mapping to measure their h$_2$ content. in thisletter, we measure the dust emission cross-section $\sigma$ using spire andrecent co and \hi\ observations; a variation in $\sigma$ is present from anear-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximumbeing south of the nucleus. calculating the total h column density from themeasured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the \hi\column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in co. the h$_2$/\hi\ massratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averagedover the optical disk. the single most important observation to reduce thepotentially large systematic errors is to complete the co mapping of m 33.

1010.2201	star formation in collision debris: insights from the modeling of their  spectral energy distribution	during galaxy-galaxy interactions, massive gas clouds can be injected intothe intergalactic medium which in turn become gravitationally bound, collapseand form stars, star clusters or even dwarf galaxies. the objects resultingfrom this process are both "pristine", as they are forming their firstgeneration of stars, and chemically evolved because the metallicity inheritedfrom their parent galaxies is high. such characteristics make them particularlyinteresting laboratories to study star formation. after having investigatedtheir star-forming properties, we use photospheric, nebular and dust modelingto analyze here their spectral energy distribution (sed) from thefar-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared regime for a sample of 7 star-formingregions. our analysis confirms that the intergalactic star forming regions instephan's quintet, around arp 105, and ngc 5291, appear devoid of stellarpopulations older than 10^9 years. we also find an excess of light in thenear-infrared regime (from 2 to 4.5 microns) which cannot be attributed tostellar photospheric or nebular contributions. this excess is correlated withthe star formation rate intensity suggesting that it is probably due toemission by very small grains fluctuating in temperature as well as thepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) line at 3.3 micron. comparing theattenuation via the balmer decrement to the mid-infrared emission allows us tocheck the reliability of the attenuation estimate. it suggests the presence ofembedded star forming regions in ngc 5291 and ngc 7252. overall the sed ofstar-forming regions in collision debris (and tidal dwarf galaxies) resemblemore that of dusty star-forming regions in galactic disks than to that oftypical star-forming dwarf galaxies.

1105.5219	star formation in m33 (herm33es)	within the key project "herschel m33 extended survey" (herm33es), we arestudying the physical and chemical processes driving star formation andgalactic evolution in the nearby galaxy m33, combining the study of localconditions affecting individual star formation with properties only becomingapparent on global scales. here, we present recent results obtained by theherm33es team. combining spitzer and herschel data ranging from 3.6um to 500um,along with hi, halpha, and galex uv data, we have studied the dust at highspatial resolutions of 150pc, providing estimators of the total infrared (tir)brightness and of the star formation rate. while the temperature of the warmdust at high brightness is driven by young massive stars, evolved stellarpopulations appear to drive the temperature of the cold dust. plane-parallelmodels of photon dominated regions (pdrs) fail to reproduce fully the [cii],[oi], and co maps obtained in a first spectroscopic study of one 2'x2'subregion of m33, located on the inner, northern spiral arm and encompassingthe hii region bclmp302.

1107.2396	dust heating sources in galaxies: the case of m33 (herm33es)	dust emission is one of the main windows to the physics of galaxies and tostar formation as the radiation from young, hot stars is absorbed by the dustand reemitted at longer wavelengths. the recently launched herschel satellitenow provides a view of dust emission in the far-infrared at an unequaledresolution and quality up to 500 \mu m. in the context of the herschel herm33esopen time key project, we are studying the moderately inclined scd local groupgalaxy m33 which is located only 840 kpc away. in this article, using spitzerand herschel data ranging from 3.6 \mu m to 500 \mu m, along with hi, h\alpha\maps, and galex ultraviolet data we have studied the emission of the dust atthe high spatial resolution of 150 pc. combining spitzer and herschel bands, wehave provided new, inclination corrected, resolved estimators of the totalinfrared brightness and of the star formation rate from any combination ofthese bands. the study of the colors of the warm and cold dust populationsshows that the temperature of the former is, at high brightness, dictated byyoung massive stars but, at lower brightness, heating is taken over by theevolved populations. conversely, the temperature of the cold dust is tightlydriven by the evolved stellar populations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.2178	the dust &amp; gas properties of m83	we examine the dust and gas properties of the nearby, barred galaxy m83,which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey. using images from the pacs andspire instruments of herschel, we examine the dust temperature and dust masssurface density distribution. we find that the nuclear, bar and spiral armregions exhibit higher dust temperatures and masses compared to interarmregions. however, the distribution of dust temperature and mass are notspatially coincident. assuming a trailing spiral structure, the dusttemperature peaks in the spiral arms lie ahead of the dust surface densitypeaks. the dust mass surface density correlates well with the distribution ofmolecular gas as traced by co (j=3-2) images (jcmt) and the star formation rateas traced by h?2 with a correction for obscured star formation using 24 micronemission. using hi images from things to trace the atomic gas component, wemake total gas mass surface density maps and calculate the gas-to-dust ratio.we find a mean gas-to-dust ratio of 84 \pm 4 with higher values in the innerregion assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion factor. we also examine thegas-to-dust ratio using co-to-h2 conversion factor that varies withmetallicity.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1201.2558	dust and gas power-spectrum in m33 (herm33es)	power spectra of de-projected images of late-type galaxies in gas and/or dustemission are very useful diagnostics of the dynamics and stability of theirinterstellar medium. previous studies have shown that the power spectra can beapproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500pc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the twocorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. we present athorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at severalwavelengths in the nearby galaxy m33. in particular, we use the recentlyobtained images at five wavelengths by pacs and spire onboard herschel. thelarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determineclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations withwavelength. the break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24and 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in athicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined tothe plane. the slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,meaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. numericalsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,like m33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.varying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain arange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicelybracket the data. the small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3dbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes thestructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. m33 appears to correspond to afiducial model with an sfr of $\sim$ 0.7 mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energycoupled to the gas kinematics.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1207.3243	spectrally resolved cii emission in m~33 ({\tt herm33es}): physical  conditions and kinematics around bclmp 691	this work presents high spectral resolution observations of the \cii\ line at158 \micron, one of the major cooling lines of the interstellar medium, takenwith the hifi heterodyne spectrometer on the herschel satellite. in bclmp 691,an \hii\ region far north (3.3 kpc) in the disk of m 33, the \cii\ and co lineprofiles show similar velocities within $0.5 \kms$, while the \hi\ linevelocities are systematically shifted towards lower rotation velocities by$\sim 5\kms$. observed at the same $12"$ angular resolution, the \cii\ linesare broader than those of co by about 50% but narrower than the \hi\ lines. the\cii\ line to far-infrared continuum ratio suggests a photoelectric heatingefficiency of 1.1%. the data, together with published models indicate a uvfield $g_0 \sim 100$ in units of the solar neighborhood value, a gas density$n_h \sim 1000 \cc$, and a gas temperature $t\sim 200$ k. adopting thesevalues, we estimate the c$^+$ column density to be $n_{c^+} \approx 1.3 \times10^{17} \cmt$. the \cii\ emission comes predominantly from the warm neutralregion between the \hii\ region and the cool molecular cloud behind it. frompublished abundances, the inferred c$^+$ column corresponds to a hydrogencolumn density of $n_h \sim 2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$. the co observations suggestthat $n_h = 2 n_{h_2} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ and 21cm measurements, alsoat $12"$ resolution, yield $n_\hi \approx 1.2 \times 10^{21} \cmt$ within the\cii\ velocity range. thus, some h$_2$ not detected in co must be present, inagreement with earlier findings based on the spire 250 -- 500 $\mu$m emission.

1209.4651	the herschel virgo cluster survey xii: fir properties of  optically-selected virgo cluster galaxies	the herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) is the deepest, confusion-limitedsurvey of the virgo cluster at far-infrared (fir) wavelengths. the entiresurvey at full depth covers $\sim$55 sq. deg. in 5 bands (100-500 \micron),encompassing the areas around the central dominant elliptical galaxies (m87,m86 &amp; m49) and extends as far as the nw cloud, the w cloud and the southernextension. the survey extends beyond this region with lower sensitivity so thatthe total area covered is 84 sq. deg. in this paper we describe the data, thedata acquisition techniques and present the detection rates of the opticallyselected virgo cluster catalogue (vcc). we detect 254 (34%) of 750 vcc galaxiesfound within the survey boundary in at least one band and 171 galaxies aredetected in all five bands. for the remainder of the galaxies we have measuredstrict upper limits for their fir emission. the population of detected galaxiescontains early- as well as late-types although the latter dominate thedetection statistics. we have modelled 168 galaxies, showing no evidence of astrong synchrotron component in their fir spectra, using a single-temperaturemodified blackbody spectrum with a fixed emissivity index ($\beta = 2$). astudy of the $\chi^2$ distribution indicates that this model is not appropriatein all cases, and this is supported by the fir colours which indicate a spreadin $\beta$=1--2. statistical comparison of the dust mass and temperaturedistributions from 140 galaxies with $\chi^2_{dof=3} &lt; 7.8$ (95% confidencelevel) shows that late-types have typically colder, more massive dustreservoirs; the early-type dust masses have a mean of ${\rm log}(&lt;m&gt; /m_{\sun}) = 6.3 \pm 0.3 $, while for late-types ${\rm log}(&lt;m&gt; / m_{\sun}) =7.1\pm 0.1$...

1210.3263	dense gas in m33 (herm33es)	we aim to better understand the emission of molecular tracers of the diffuseand dense gas in giant molecular clouds and the influence that metallicity,optical extinction, density, far-uv field, and star formation rate have onthese tracers. using the iram 30m telescope, we detected hcn, hco+, 12co, and13co in six gmcs along the major axis of m33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and outto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter datafrom herschel and other observatories complement these observations. tointerpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of modelsof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for m33-type subsolarmetallicity. the observed hco+/hcn line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.similarly high ratios have been observed in the large magellanic cloud. thehcn/co ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of m33. the 12co/13coline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffusegas and the centers of gmcs of the milky way. stacking of all spectra allowedhnc and c2h to be detected. the resulting hco+/hnc and hcn/hnc ratios of ~ 8and 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. hcn abundances are lower in the subsolarmetallicity pdr models, while hco+ abundances are enhanced. for hcn this effectis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. the observed hco+/hcn and hcn/coline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar pdr models of low opticalextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -3x10^4 cm^-3, while the fuv field strength only has a small effect on themodeled line ratios. the line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by thesolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play aminor role in influencing these line ratios.

1301.5917	spectral energy distributions of hii regions in m33 (herm33es)	within the framework of the herschel m 33 extended survey herm33es we studythe spectral energy distribution (sed) of a set of hii regions in m 33 as afunction of the morphology. we present a catalogue of 119 hii regionsmorphologically classified: 9 filled, 47 mixed, 36 shell, and 27 clear shellhii regions. for each object we extract the photometry at twelve availablewavelength bands (from fuv-1516a to ir-250mi) and obtain the sed. we alsoobtain emission line profiles across the regions to study the location of thestellar, ionised gas, and dust components. we find trends for the seds relatedto the morphology, showing that the star and gas-dust configuration affects theratios of the emission in different bands. the mixed and filled regions showhigher emission at 24mi than the shells and clear shells, which could be due tothe proximity of the dust to the stellar clusters in the case of mixed andfilled regions. the fir peak for shells and clear shells seems to be locatedtowards longer wavelengths, indicating that the dust is colder for this type ofobjects.the logarithmic 100/70mi ratio for filled and mixed regions remainsconstant over one order of magnitude in halpha and fuv surface brightness,while the shells and clear shells exhibit a wider range of values of almost twoorders of magnitude. we derive dust masses and temperatures fitting theindividual seds with dust models proposed in the literature. the derived dustmass range is between 10^2-10^4 msun and the cold dust temperature spanst(cold)~12-27 k. the spherical geometrical model proposed for the halpha clearshells is confirmed by the emission profile obtained from the observations andis used to infer the electron density within the envelope: the typical electrondensity is 0.7+-0.3 cm^-3, while filled regions can reach values two to fivetimes higher.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1304.0199	gas and dust cooling along the major axis of m33 (herm33es): iso/lws cii  observations	we aim to better understand the heating of the gas by observing the prominentgas cooling line [cii] at 158um in the low-metallicity environment of the localgroup spiral galaxy m33 at scales of 280pc. in particular, we aim at describingthe variation of the photoelectric heating efficiency with galacticenvironment. in this unbiased study, we used iso/lws [cii] observations alongthe major axis of m33, in combination with herschel pacs and spire continuummaps, iram 30m co 2-1 and vla hi data to study the variation of velocityintegrated intensities. the ratio of [cii] emission over the far-infraredcontinuum is used as a proxy for the heating efficiency, and models ofphoton-dominated regions are used to study the local physical densities, fuvradiation fields, and average column densities of the molecular clouds. theheating efficiency stays constant at 0.8% in the inner 4.5kpc radius of thegalaxy where it starts to increase to reach values of ~3% in the outskirts atabout 6kpc radial distance. the rise of efficiency is explained in theframework of pdr models by lowered volume densities and fuv fields, for opticalextinctions of only a few magnitudes at constant metallicity. in view of thesignificant fraction of hi emission stemming from pdrs, and for typicalpressures found in the galactic cold neutral medium (cnm) traced by hiemission, the cnm contributes ~15% to the observed [cii] emission in the inner2kpc radius of m33. the cnm contribution remains largely undetermined in thesouth, while positions between 2 and 7.3kpc radial distance in the north of m33show a contribution of ~40%+-20%.

1304.3128	star formation &amp; dust heating in the fir bright sources of m83	we investigate star formation and dust heating in the compact fir brightsources detected in the herschel maps of m83. we use the source extraction codegetsources to detect and extract sources in the fir, as well as theirphotometry in the mir and h{\alpha}. by performing infrared sed fitting andapplying an h{\alpha} based star formation rate (sfr) calibration, we derivethe dust masses and temperatures, sfrs, gas masses and star formationefficiencies (sfes). the detected sources lie exclusively on the spiral armsand represent giant molecular associations (gmas), with gas masses and sizes of10^6-10^8 solar masses and 200-300 pc, respectively. the inferred parametersshow little to no radial dependence and there is only a weak correlationbetween the sfrs and gas masses, which suggests that more massive clouds areless efficient at forming stars. dust heating is mainly due to local starformation. however, although the sources are not optically thick, the totalintrinsic young stellar population luminosity can almost completely account forthe dust luminosity. this suggests that other radiation sources contribute tothe dust heating as well and approximately compensate for the unabsorbedfraction of uv light.

1308.3702	regional variations in the dense gas heating and cooling in m51 from  herschel far-infrared spectroscopy	we present herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy of the most importantfar-infrared cooling lines in m51, [cii](158 \mu m), [nii](122 &amp; 205 \mu m),[oi](63 and 145 \mu m) and [oiii](88 \mu m). we compare the observed flux ofthese lines with the predicted flux from a photon dominated region model todetermine characteristics of the cold gas such as density, temperature and thefar-ultraviolet radiation field, g_0, resolving details on physical scales ofroughly 600 pc. we find an average [cii]/f_tir of 4 x 10^{-3}, in agreementwith previous studies of other galaxies. a pixel-by-pixel analysis of fourdistinct regions of m51 shows a radially decreasing trend in both thefar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation field, g_0 and the hydrogen density, n, peakingin the nucleus of the galaxy, then falling off out to the arm and interarmregions. we see for the first time that the fuv flux and gas density aresimilar in the differing environments of the arm and interarm regions,suggesting that the inherent physical properties of the molecular clouds inboth regions are essentially the same.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1309.6338	cold dust but warm gas in the unusual elliptical galaxy ngc 4125	data from the herschel space observatory have revealed an unusual ellipticalgalaxy, ngc 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission fromcold dust but only very strict upper limits to its co and hi emission.depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 msun. whilethe neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (&lt; 12-30), including theionized gas traced by [cii] emission raises this limit to &lt; 39-100. the dustemission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust tostellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearbyelliptical galaxies. we suggest that ngc 4125 is currently in an unusual phasewhere evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation arepumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. in thisscenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas beingheated to temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k faster than the dust is evaporated. ifgalaxies like ngc 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutralgas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could havesignificant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies andgalaxy evolution.

1310.4155	variation in the dust emissivity index across m33 with herschel and  spitzer (herm33es)	we study the wavelength dependence of the dust emission as a function ofposition and environment across the disk of m33 at a linear resolution of 160pc using spitzer and herschel photometric data. expressing the emissivity ofthe dust as a power law, the power-law exponent (beta) is estimated from twoindependent approaches designed to properly treat the degeneracy between betaand the dust temperature. both beta and the dust temperature are higher in theinner disk than in the outer disk, contrary to reported beta-tanti-correlations found in other sources. in the cold + warm dust model, thewarm component and the ionized gas (halpha) have a very similar distributionacross the galaxy, demonstrating that the model separates the components in anappropriate fashion. the flocculent spiral arms and the dust lanes are evidentin the map of the cold component. both cold and warm dust column densities arehigh in star forming regions and reach their maxima toward the giant starforming complexes ngc604 and ngc595. beta declines from close to 2 in thecenter to about 1.3 in the outer disk. beta is positively correlated with starformation and with molecular gas column, as traced by halpha and co emission.the lower dust emissivity index in the outer parts of m33 is likely related tothe reduced metallicity (different grain composition) and possibly differentsize distribution. it is not due to the decrease in stellar radiation field ortemperature in a simple way because the fir-bright regions in the outer diskalso have a low beta. like most spirals, m33 has a (decreasing) radial gradientin star formation and molecular-to-atomic gas ratio such that the regionsbright in halpha or co tend to trace the inner disk, making it difficult todistinguish between their effects on the dust.

1312.3442	gas-to-dust mass ratios in local galaxies over a 2 dex metallicity range	this paper analyses the behaviour of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) oflocal universe galaxies over a large metallicity range. we combine threesamples: the dwarf galaxy survey, the kingfish survey and a subsample fromgalametz et al. (2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicityrange, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.0. the dust masses arehomogeneously determined with a semi-empirical dust model, including submmconstraints. the atomic and molecular gas masses are compiled from theliterature. two xco are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the galacticxco, and a xco depending on the metallicity (as z^{-2}). correlations withmorphological types, stellar masses, star formation rates and specific starformation rates are discussed. the trend between g/d and metallicity isempirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a brokenpower-law. we compare the evolution of the g/d with predictions from chemicalevolution models. we find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,metallicity is the galactic property driving the observed g/d. the g/d versusmetallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1over the whole metallicity range. the observed trend is steeper formetallicities lower than ~ 8.0. a large scatter is observed in the g/d for agiven metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1dex. the broken power-law reproduces best the observed g/d and providesestimates of the g/d that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. the good agreementof the g/d and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution modelsshows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting thedifferent star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grainsize distributions and chemical compositions across the sample.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1402.4668	the heating of mid-infrared dust in the nearby galaxy m33: a testbed for  tracing galaxy evolution	because the 8 {\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission has beenfound to correlate with other well-known star formation tracers, it has widelybeen used as a star formation rate (sfr) tracer. there are, however, studiesthat challenge the accuracy and reliability of the 8 {\mu}m emission as a sfrtracer. our study, part of the herschel m33 extended survey (herm33es) opentime key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infraredemission from the nearby spiral galaxy m33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.combining data from the herschel space observatory and the spitzer spacetelescope we find that the 8 {\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250{\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\mu}memission. the l(8)/l(24) ratio is highly depressed in 24 {\mu}m luminousregions, which correlate with known hii regions. we also compare our resultswith the dust emission models by draine &amp; li (2007). we confirm that thedepression of 8 {\mu}m pah emission near star-forming regions is higher thanwhat is predicted by models; this is possibly an effect of increased stellarradiation from young stars destroying the dust grains responsible for the 8{\mu}m emission as already suggested by other authors. we find that themajority of the 8 {\mu}m emission is fully consistent with heating by thediffuse interstellar medium, similar to what recently determined for the dustemission in m31 by draine at al. (2013). we also find that the fraction of 8{\mu}m emission associated with the diffuse interstellar radiation field rangesbetween 60% and 80% and is 40% larger than the diffuse fraction at 24 {\mu}m.

1402.5967	a resolved analysis of cold dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral  ngc 891	we investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-onspiral galaxy ngc 891. high resolution herschel pacs and spire 70, 100, 160,250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with jcmt scuba 850 $\mu$mobservations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energydistribution (sed). maps of the hi 21 cm line and co(j=3-2) emission trace theatomic and molecular hydrogen gas, respectively. we fit one-component modifiedblackbody models to the integrated sed, finding a global dust mass of8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 k. wealso fit the pixel-by-pixel seds to produce maps of the dust mass andtemperature. the dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellarpopulation as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. the derived dust temperature,which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 k, is found to correlate with the 24$\mu$m emission. allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an averagevalue of $\beta$ = 1.9$\pm$0.3. we confirm an inverse relation between the dustemissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe anyvariation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of thedisk. a comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of theism reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities ofdust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. observedasymmetries in the dust temperature, and the h$_{2}$-to-dust and totalgas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate may bethe result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel starformation in the ne compared to the sw. whilst the asymmetry likely arises fromdust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of thespiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in thene side of the disk.

1403.4272	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga): iv. dust  scaling relations at sub-kpc resolution	the imprints of dust-starlight interactions are visible in scaling relationsbetween stellar characteristics, star formation parameters and dust properties.we aim to examine dust scaling relations on a sub-kpc resolution in theandromeda galaxy (m31) by comparing the properties on a local and global scaleto other galaxies of the local universe. new herschel observations are combinedwith available data from galex, sdss, wise and spitzer to construct a datasetcovering uv to submm wavelengths. we work at the resolution of the spire $500\;\mu$m beam, with pixels corresponding to physical regions of 137 x 608 pc inthe galaxy's disk. a panchromatic spectral energy distribution was modelled foreach pixel and several dust scaling relations are investigated. we find, on asub-kpc scale, strong correlations between $m_d/m_\star$ and nuv-r, and between$m_d/m_\star$ and $\mu_\star$ (the stellar mass surface density). strikingsimilarities with corresponding relations based on integrated galaxies arefound. we decompose m31 in four macro-regions based on their fir morphology;the bulge, inner disk, star forming ring and the outer disk. all regionsclosely follow the galaxy-scale average trends. the specific star formationcharacteristics we derive for these macro-regions give strong hints of aninside-out formation of the bulge-disk geometry, as well as an internaldownsizing process. however, within each macro-region, a great diversity inindividual micro-regions is found. furthermore, we confirm that dust in thebulge of m31 is heated only by the old stellar populations. in general, thelocal dust scaling relations indicate that the dust content in m31 ismaintained by a subtle interplay of past and present star formation. thesimilarity with galaxy-based relations strongly suggests that they are in situcorrelations, with underlying processes that must be local in nature.

1409.1815	the identification of dust heating mechanisms in nearby galaxies using  herschel 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness ratios	we examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightnessratios within 24 nearby (&lt;30 mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with theherschel space observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emittingat these wavelengths. the analysis consisted of both qualitative andquantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 micron ratios to h alphaand 24 micron surface brightnesses, which trace the light from star formingregions, and 3.6 micron emission, which traces the light from the older stellarpopulations of the galaxies. we find broad variations in the heating mechanismsfor the dust. in one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at&lt;=160 microns (and in rare cases potentially at &lt;=350 microns) originates fromdust heated by star forming regions. in another subset, we found that theemission at &gt;=250 microns (and sometimes at &gt;=160 microns) originates from dustheated by the older stellar population. in the rest of the sample, either theresults are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contributeequally to the global dust heating. the observed variations in dust heatingmechanisms does not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emissionand radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dusttemperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability indust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1409.7123	[cii] 158 $\mu$m emission as a star formation tracer	the [cii] 157.74 $\mu$m transition is the dominant coolant of the neutralinterstellar gas, and has great potential as a star formation rate (sfr)tracer. using the herschel kingfish sample of 46 nearby galaxies, weinvestigate the relation of [cii] surface brightness and luminosity with sfr.we conclude that [cii] can be used for measurements of sfr on both global andkiloparsec scales in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strongactive galactic nuclei (agn). the uncertainty of the $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. the main source ofscatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm ircolors, and we provide an adjustment based on ir color that reduces thescatter. we show that the color-adjusted $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$,holding for both normal star-forming galaxies and non-agn luminous infraredgalaxies. using [cii] luminosity instead of surface brightness to estimate sfrsuffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting sfr in luminousinfrared galaxies even after ir color adjustment (although this depends on thesfr measure employed). we suspect that surface brightness relations are betterbehaved than the luminosity relations because the former are more closelyrelated to the local far-uv field strength, most likely the main parametercontrolling the efficiency of the conversion of far-uv radiation into gasheating. a simple model based on starburst99 population-synthesis code toconnect sfr to [cii] finds that heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normalgalaxies.

1411.3960	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xviii. star-forming dwarf galaxies in  a cluster environment	to assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different componentsof the interstellar medium, we analyse the fir-submm properties of a sample ofstar-forming dwarf (sfd) galaxies detected by the herschel virgo cluster survey(hevics). we determine dust masses and dust temperatures by fitting a modifiedblack body (mbb) function to the spectral energy distributions (seds). stellarand gas masses, star formation rates (sfrs), and metallicities are obtainedfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. dust is detected in 49 out of 140optically identified dwarfs covered by the hevics field; considering onlydwarfs brighter than $m_b$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. afterevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the fir-submm seds arebest-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $t_d$ = 22.4 k.assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five herschelbands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the mbb model. the excess isinversely correlated with sfr and stellar masses. to study the variations inthe global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we comparethe virgo sfds to other herschel surveys, such as kingfish, the dwarf galaxysurvey (dgs), and the hevics bright galaxy catalogue (bgc). we explore therelations between stellar mass and hi fraction, specific sfr, dust fraction,gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. highly hi-deficientvirgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formationactivity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in clusterdwarfs. however, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less thanthat of the hi component. since the virgo sfds are likely to be crossing thecluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip themore centrally concentrated dust distribution.

1412.7344	the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and  far-infrared dust emission from ngc 2403 and m83	we examine the relation between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission at 8 microns and far-infrared emission from hot dust grains at 24microns and from large dust grains at 160 and 250 microns in the nearby spiralgalaxies ngc 2403 and m83 using data from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory. we find that the pah emission in ngc 2403 is bettercorrelated with emission at 250 microns from dust heated by the diffuseinterstellar radiation field (isrf) and that the 8/250 micron surfacebrightness ratio is well-correlated with the stellar surface brightness asmeasured at 3.6 microns. this implies that the pahs in ngc 2403 are intermixedwith cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) and thatthe pahs are excited by the diffuse isrf. in m83, the pah emission appears morestrongly correlated with 160 micron emission originating from large dust grainsheated by star forming regions. however, the pah emission in m83 is low wherethe 24 micron emission peaks within star forming regions, and enhancements inthe 8/160 micron surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dustand the star forming regions within the spiral arms. this suggests that thepahs observed in the 8 micron band are not excited locally within star formingregions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star formingregions or locally by young, non-photoionising stars that have migrateddownstream from the spiral density waves. the results from just these twogalaxies show that pahs may be excited by different stellar populations indifferent spiral galaxies.

1510.07657	the imprint of rapid star formation quenching on the spectral energy  distributions of galaxies	[abridged] in high density environment, the gas content of galaxies isstripped, leading to a rapid quenching of their star formation activity. thisdramatic environmental effect is generally not taken into account in the sfhsusually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting of thesegalaxies, yielding to a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, abiased estimate of the sfr. we aim at reproducing the sfh of galaxies thatunderwent a rapid star formation quenching using a truncated delayed sfh thatwe implemented in the sed fitting code cigale. we show that the ratio betweenthe instantaneous sfr and the sfr just before the quenching ($r_{sfr}$) is wellconstrained as long as rest frame uv data are available. this sed modelling isapplied to the herschel reference survey (hrs) containing isolated galaxies andsources falling in the dense environment of the virgo cluster. the latter arehi-deficient due to ram pressure stripping. we show that the truncated delayedsfh successfully reproduces their sed while typical sfh assumptions fail. agood correlation is found between $r_{sfr}$ and hi-def, the parameterquantifying the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that sed fittingresults can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency ofgalaxies for which hi observations are not available. the hrs galaxies areplaced on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram showing that the hi-deficient sources lie inthe quiescent region confirming previous studies. using the $r_{sfr}$parameter, we derive the sfr of these sources before quenching and show thatthey were previously on the main sequence relation. we show that the $r_{sfr}$parameter is also well recovered for deeply obscured high redshift sources, aswell as in absence of ir data. sed fitting is thus a powerful tool to identifygalaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching.
