0903.3967	asteroseismic analysis of the roap star alpha circini: 84 days of  high-precision photometry from the wire satellite	we present a detailed study of the pulsation of alpha circini, the brightestof the rapidly oscillating ap stars. we have obtained 84 days of high-precisionphotometry from four runs with the star tracker on the wire satellite.simultaneously, we collected ground-based johnson b observations on 16 nightsat the south african astronomical observatory. in addition to the dominantoscillation mode at 2442 microhz, we detect two new modes that liesymmetrically around the principal mode to form a triplet. the averageseparation between these modes is 30.173+-0.004 microhz and they are nearlyequidistant with the separations differing by only 3.9 nhz. we compare theobserved frequencies with theoretical pulsation models based on constraintsfrom the recently determined interferometric radius and effective temperature,and the recently updated hipparcos parallax. we show that the theoretical largeseparations for models of alpha cir with global parameters within the 1-sigmaobservational uncertainties vary between 59 and 65 microhz. this is consistentwith the large separation being twice the observed value, indicating that thethree main modes are of alternating even and odd degrees. the frequencydifferences in the triplet are significantly smaller than those predicted fromour models, for all possible combinations of mode degrees, and may indicatethat the effects of magnetic perturbations need to be taken into account. thewire light curves are modulated by a double wave with a period of 4.479 days,and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4 mmag. this variation is due to the rotationof the star and is a new discovery, made possible by the high precision of thewire photometry. the rotational modulation confirms an earlier indirectdetermination of the rotation period.

0706.2962	variable stars in the open cluster ngc 6791 and its surrounding field	aims: this work presents a high--precision variability survey in the field ofthe old, super metal-rich open cluster ngc 6791.  methods: the data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision ccd timeseries measurements in the v band obtained mainly at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, with additional data from s. pedro martir and loiano observatories,over a time span of ten nights. the field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.  results: we have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods andamplitudes of 70 known variable stars. by means of a photometric evaluation ofthe membership in ngc 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the propermotions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster andsurrounding field in the range 16&lt;v&lt;23.5. accurate periods can be given for thevariables with p&lt;4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limitedtime-baseline hampered precise determinations. we categorized the entire sampleas follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variablesand 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables forwhich we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longerthan our time baseline.  conclusions: on the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positionsof the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 newvariable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membershipis doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. we also detected an outburst ofabout 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to thecluster and we suggest that this star could be a new u gem (dwarf nova)cataclysmic variable.

0906.0766	radius determination of solar-type stars using asteroseismology: what to  expect from the kepler mission	for distant stars, as observed by the nasa kepler satellite, parallaxinformation is currently of fairly low quality and is not complete. this limitsthe precision with which the absolute sizes of the stars and their potentialtransiting planets can be determined by traditional methods. asteroseismologywill be used to aid the radius determination of stars observed during nasa'skepler mission. we report on the recent asteroflag hare-and-hounds exercise#2,where a group of `hares' simulated data of f-k main-sequence stars that a groupof `hounds' sought to analyze, aimed at determining the stellar radii. based onthe asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-yeartime series data from the kepler mission, we demonstrate that the stellar radiican be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditionalstellar parameters from the kepler input catalogue. the radii found by thevarious methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the truevalues of the artificial stars to within 3%, when the large frequency spacingis used. this is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is notapplied. these results give strong confidence that radius estimation can beperformed to better than 3% for solar-like stars using automatic pipelinereduction. even when the stellar distance and luminosity are unknown we canobtain the same level of agreement.

0907.1198	accurate fundamental parameters of corot asteroseismic targets: the  solar-like stars hd 49933, hd 175726, hd 181420 and hd 181906	the corot satellite has provided high-quality light curves of severalsolar-like stars. analysis of the light curves provides oscillation frequenciesthat make it possible to probe the interior of the stars. however, additionalconstraints on the fundamental parameters of the stars are important for thetheoretical modelling to be successful. we will estimate the fundamentalparameters (mass, radius and luminosity) of the first four solar-like targetsto be observed in the asteroseismic field. in addition, we will determine theireffective temperature, metallicity and detailed abundance pattern. to constrainthe stellar mass, radius and age we use the shotgun software which compares thelocation of the stars in the hertzsprung-russell diagram with theoreticalevolution models. this method takes into account the uncertainties of theobserved parameters including the large separation determined from thesolar-like oscillations. we determine the effective temperatures and abundancepatterns in the stars from the analysis of high-resolution spectra. we havedetermined the mass, radius and luminosity of the four corot targets to within5-10 percent, 2-4 percent and 5-13 percent, respectively. the quality of thestellar spectra determines how well we can constrain the effective temperature.for the two best spectra we get 1-sigma uncertainties below 60 k and for theother two 100-150 k. the uncertainty on the surface gravity is less than 0.08dex for three stars while for hd 181906 it is 0.15 dex. the reason for thelarger uncertainty is that the spectrum has two components with a luminosityratio of lp/ls = 0.50+-0.15. while hipparcos astrometric data strongly suggestit is a binary star we find evidence that the fainter star may be a backgroundstar, since it is less luminous but hotter.

(2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  results. should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in ngc 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by bruntt et al. (2003). theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  conclusions. possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions. more extensive photometry with 3-4m classtelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency ofplanets in ngc 6791.

0912.3215	the radius and effective temperature of the binary ap star beta crb from  chara/fluor and vlt/naco observations	the prospects for using asteroseismology of rapidly oscillating ap (roap)stars are hampered by the large uncertainty in fundamental stellar parameters.results in the literature for the effective temperature (teff) often span arange of 1000 k. our goal is to reduce systematic errors and improve the teffcalibration of ap stars based on new interferometric measurements. we obtainedlong-baseline interferometric observations of beta crb using the chara/fluorinstrument. to disentangle the flux contributions of the two components of thisbinary star, we obtained vlt/naco adaptive optics images. we determined limbdarkened angular diameters of 0.699+-0.017 mas for beta crb a (frominterferometry) and 0.415+-0.017 mas for beta crb b (from surface brightness-color relations), corresponding to radii of 2.63+-0.09 rsun (3.4 percentuncertainty) and 1.56+-0.07 rsun (4.5 percent). the combined bolometric flux ofthe a and b components was determined from satellite uv data, spectrophotometryin the visible and broadband data in the infrared. the flux from the bcomponent constitutes 16+-4 percent of the total flux and was determined byfitting an atlas9 model atmosphere to the broad-band naco j and k magnitudes.combining the flux of the a component with its measured angular diameter, wedetermine the effective temperature teff(a) = 7980+-180 k (2.3 percent). ournew interferometric and imaging data enable a nearly model-independentdetermination of the effective temperature of beta crb a. including our recentstudy of alpha cir, we now have direct teff measurements of two of thebrightest roap stars, providing a strong benchmark for an improved calibrationof the teff scale for ap stars. this will support the use of potentially strongconstraints imposed by asteroseismic studies of roap stars.

1004.1903	absolute dimensions of eclipsing binaries. xxviii. bk pegasi and other  f-type binaries: prospects for calibration of convective core overshoot	we present a detailed study of the f-type detached eclipsing binary bk peg,based on new photometric and spectroscopic observations. the two components,which have evolved to the upper half of the main-sequence band, are quitedifferent with masses and radii of (1.414 +/- 0.007 msun, 1.988 +/- 0.008 rsun)and (1.257 +/- 0.005 msun, 1.474 +/- 0.017 rsun), respectively. the 5.49 dayperiod orbit of bk peg is slightly eccentric (e = 0.053). the measuredrotational velocities are 16.6 +/- 0.2 (primary) and 13.4 +/- 0.2 (secondary)km/s. for the secondary component this corresponds to (pseudo)synchronousrotation, whereas the primary component seems to rotate at a slightly lowerrate. we derive an iron abundance of [fe/h] =-0.12 +/- 0.07 and similarabundances for si, ca, sc, ti, cr and ni. yonsei-yale and victoria-reginaevolutionary models for the observed metal abundance reproduce bk peg at agesof 2.75 and 2.50 gyr, respectively, but tend to predict a lower age for themore massive primary component than for the secondary. we find the same agetrend for three other upper main-sequence systems in a sample of well studiedeclipsing binaries with components in the 1.15-1.70 msun range, whereconvective core overshoot is gradually ramped up in the models. we also findthat the yonsei-yale models systematically predict higher ages than thevictoria-regina models. the sample includes bw aqr, and as a supplement we havedetermined a [fe/h] abundance of -0.07 +/- 0.11 for this late f-type binary. wepropose to use bk peg, bw aqr, and other well-studied 1.15-1.70 msun eclipsingbinaries to fine-tune convective core overshoot, diffusion, and possibly otheringredients of modern theoretical evolutionary models.

1004.4891	the solar-like corot target hd 170987: spectroscopic and seismic  observations	the corot mission is in its third year of observation and the data from thesecond long run in the galactic centre direction are being analysed. thesolar-like oscillating stars that have been observed up to now have given someinteresting results, specially concerning the amplitudes that are lower thanpredicted. we present here the results from the analysis of the star hd170987.the goal of this research work is to characterise the global parametersof hd 170987. we look for global seismic parameters such as the mean largeseparation, maximum amplitude of the modes, and surface rotation because thesignal-to-noise ratio in the observations do not allow us to measure individualmodes. we also want to retrieve the stellar parameters of the star and itschemical composition.we have studied the chemical composition of the star usingground-based observations performed with the narval spectrograph. we have usedseveral methods to calculate the global parameters from the acousticoscillations based on corot data. the light curve of the star has beeninterpolated using inpainting algorithms to reduce the effect of data gaps. wefind power excess related to p modes in the range [400 - 1200]muhz with a meanlarge separation of 55.2+-0.8muhz with a probability above 95% that increasesto 55.9 +-0.2muhz in a higher frequency range [500 - 1250] muhz and a rejectionlevel of 1%. a hint of the variation of this quantity with frequency is alsofound. the rotation period of the star is estimated to be around 4.3 days withan inclination axis of i=50 deg +20/-13. we measure a bolometric amplitude perradial mode in a range [2.4 - 2.9] ppm around 1000 muhz. finally, using a gridof models, we estimate the stellar mass, m=1.43+-0.05 msun, the radius,r=1.96+-0.046 rsun, and the age ~2.4 gyr.

1005.3208	improved stellar parameters of corot-7	accurate parameters of the host stars of exoplanets are important for theinterpretation of the new planet systems that continue to emerge. the corotsatellite recently discovered a transiting rocky planet with a density similarto the inner planets in our solar system, a so-called super earth. this planetis orbiting a relatively faint g9v star called corot-7, and we wish to refineits physical properties, which are important for the interpretation of theproperties of the planet system. we used spectra from harps@eso-3.6m anduves@vlt-8.2m. from the analysis of fe-1 and fe-2 lines we determine teff, logg and microturbulence. we use the balmer lines to constrain teff and pressuresensitive mg-1b and ca lines to constrain log g. from the analysis we findteff=5250+-60k, log g = 4.47+-0.05, [m/h]=+0.12+-0.06, and vsini = 1.1 km/s. wecompared the l/m ratio with isochrones to constrain the evolutionary status.using the age estimate of 1.2-2.3 gyr based on stellar activity, we determinethe mass and radius 0.91+-0.03 msun and 0.82+-0.04 rsun. with these updatedconstraints we fitted the corot transit light curve for corot-7b. we revise theplanet radius to be slightly smaller, r = 1.58+-0.10 rearth, and the densitybecomes higher, rho = 7.2+-1.8 g/cm3. the host star corot-7 is a slowlyrotating, metal rich, unevolved type g9v star. the star is relatively faint(v=11.7) and its fundamental parameters can only be determined through indirectmethods. our methods rely on detailed spectral analyses that depend on theadopted model atmospheres. from the analysis of spectra of stars withwell-known parameters with similar parameters to corot-7 (the sun and alpha cenb) we demonstrate that our methods are robust within the claimed uncertainties.therefore our methods can be reliably used in subsequent analyses of similarexoplanet host stars.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1111.6543	modelling a high-mass red giant observed by corot	the g6 giant hr\,2582 (hd\,50890) was observed by corot for approximately 55days. mode frequencies are extracted from the observed fourier spectrum of thelight curve. numerical stellar models are then computed to determine thecharacteristics of the star (mass, age, etc...) from the comparison withobservational constraints. we provide evidence for the presence of solar-likeoscillations at low frequency, between 10 and 20\,$\mu$hz, with a regularspacing of $(1.7\pm0.1)\mu$hz between consecutive radial orders. only radialmodes are clearly visible. from the models compatible with the observationalconstraints used here, we find that hr\,2582 (hd\,50890) is a massive star witha mass in the range (3--\,5\,$m_{\odot}$), clearly above the red clump. itoscillates with rather low radial order ($n$ = 5\,--\,12) modes. itsevolutionary stage cannot be determined with precision: the star could be onthe ascending red giant branch (hydrogen shell burning) with an age ofapproximately 155 myr or in a later phase (helium burning). in order to obtaina reasonable helium amount, the metallicity of the star must be quite subsolar.our best models are obtained with a mixing length significantly smaller thanthat obtained for the sun with the same physical description (exceptovershoot). the amount of core overshoot during the main-sequence phase isfound to be mild, of the order of 0.1\,$h_{\rm p}$.

1112.1035	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxi. corot-19b: a low  density planet orbiting an old inactive f9v-star	observations of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance to ourunderstanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can bedetermined. the corot space mission allows us to achieve a very highphotometric accuracy. by combining corot data with high-precision radialvelocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. we reportthe discovery of corot-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactivef9v-type star with a period of four days. after excluding alternative physicalconfigurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radiusand mass of the planet by combining corot photometry with high-resolutionspectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs sophie, harps, fies, andsandiford. to improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observedadditional transits with the trappist and euler telescopes. using harps spectraobtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between thespin of the star and the orbit of the planet. we find that the host star ofcorot-19b is an inactive f9v-type star close to the end of its main-sequencelife. the host star has a mass m*=1.21+/-0.05 msun and radius r*=1.65+/-0.04rsun. the planet has a mass of mp=1.11+/-0.06 mjup and radius of rp=1.29+/-0.03rjup. the resulting bulk density is only rho=0.71+/-0.06 gcm-3, which is muchlower than that for jupiter. the exoplanet corot-19b is an example of a giantplanet of almost the same mass as jupiter but a 30% larger radius.

0710.3772	oscillations in procyon a: first results from a multi-site campaign	procyon a is a bright f5iv star in a binary system. although the distance,mass and angular diameter of this star are all known with high precision, theexact evolutionary state is still unclear. evolutionary tracks with differentages and different mass fractions of hydrogen in the core pass, within theerrors, through the observed position of procyon a in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram. for more than 15 years several different groups have studied thesolar-like oscillations in procyon a to determine its evolutionary state.although several studies independently detected power excess in theperiodogram, there is no agreement on the actual oscillation frequencies yet.this is probably due to either insufficient high-quality data (i.e., aliasing)or due to intrinsic properties of the star (i.e., short mode lifetimes). now aspectroscopic multi-site campaign using 10 telescopes world-wide (minimizingaliasing effects) with a total time span of nearly 4 weeks (increase thefrequency resolution) is performed to identify frequencies in this star andfinally determine its properties and evolutionary state.

1205.4071	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. ii. age dependencies and new insights	models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuringaccurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. multiplebinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these oldstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. in the firstpaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsingbinaries in the old open cluster ngc6791 sets tighter constraints on theproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, therebypotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. herewe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison todetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employingas many observational constraints as possible. we improve our photometry andcorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. we then perform anextensive comparison of the cmds and eclipsing binary measurements to victoriaand dsep isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. we also reanalyse aspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [fe/h] constraints. we find a bestestimate of the age of ~8.3 gyr while demonstrating that remaining ageuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the cno abundances. the heliummass fraction is well constrained at y = 0.30 \pm 0.01 resulting in dy/dz ~ 1.4assuming that such a relation exists. during the analysis we firmly identifyblue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for thepresence of their evolved counterparts. our analysis supports the rgb mass-lossfound from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass ofstars on the lower rgb, 1.15\pm0.02msun. this will be an important consistencycheck for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.

1401.3096	seismic constraints on the radial dependence of the internal rotation  profiles of six kepler subgiants and young red giants	context : we still do not know which mechanisms are responsible for thetransport of angular momentum inside stars. the recent detection of mixed modesthat contain the signature of rotation in the spectra of kepler subgiants andred giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this issue.  aims: our aim is to probe the radial dependance of the rotation profiles fora sample of kepler targets. for this purpose, subgiants and early red giantsare particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings aremore sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case fortheir more evolved counterparts.  methods: we first extract the rotational splittings and frequencies of themodes for six young kepler red giants. we then perform a seismic modeling ofthese stars using the evolutionary codes cesam2k and astec. by using theobserved splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, weperform inversions of the internal rotation profiles of the six stars.  results: we obtain estimates of the mean rotation rate in the core and in theconvective envelope of these stars. we show that the rotation contrast betweenthe core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. our resultsalso suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, contrary to the rgbstars whose core has been shown to spin down. for two of the stars, we showthat a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces theobserved splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile.interestingly, the depths that are found most probable for the discontinuitiesroughly coincide with the location of the h-burning shell, which separates thelayers that contract from those that expand. these results will bringobservational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport instars.

1507.01516	kic 4768731: a bright long-period roap star in the kepler field	we report the identification of 61.45 d^-1 (711.2 mu hz) oscillations, withamplitudes of 62.6-mu mag, in kic 4768731 (hd 225914) using kepler photometry.this relatively bright (v=9.17) chemically peculiar star with spectral type a5vp srcr(eu) has previously been found to exhibit rotational modulation with aperiod of 5.21 d. fourier analysis reveals a simple dipole pulsator with anamplitude that has remained stable over a 4-yr time span, but with a frequencythat is variable. analysis of high-resolution spectra yields stellar parametersof t_eff = 8100 +/- 200 k, log g = 4.0 +/- 0.2, [fe/h] = +0.31 +/- 0.24 and vsin i = 14.8 +/- 1.6 km/s. line profile variations caused by rotation are alsoevident. lines of sr, cr, eu, mg and si are strongest when the star isbrightest, while y and ba vary in anti-phase with the other elements. theabundances of rare earth elements are only modestly enhanced compared to otherroap stars of similar t_eff and log g. radial velocities in the literaturesuggest a significant change over the past 30 yr, but the radial velocitiespresented here show no significant change over a period of 4 yr.

1508.06391	lamost observations in the kepler field. database of low-resolution  spectra	the nearly continuous light curves with micromagnitude precision provided bythe space mission kepler are revolutionising our view of pulsating stars. theyhave revealed a vast sea of low-amplitude pulsation modes that wereundetectable from earth. the long time base of kepler light curves allows anaccurate determination of frequencies and amplitudes of pulsation modes neededfor in-depth asteroseismic modeling. however, for an asteroseismic study to besuccessful, the first estimates of stellar parameters need to be known and theycan not be derived from the kepler photometry itself. the kepler input catalog(kic) provides values for the effective temperature, the surface gravity andthe metallicity, but not always with a sufficient accuracy. moreover,information on the chemical composition and rotation rate is lacking. we arecollecting low-resolution spectra for objects in the kepler field of view withthe large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope (lamost, xinglongobservatory, china). all of the requested fields have now been observed atleast once. in this paper we describe those observations and provide a databaseof use to the whole astronomical community.

0806.3218	absolute dimensions of eclipsing binaries. xxvi. setting a new standard:  masses, radii, and abundances for the f-type systems ad bootis, vz hydrae,  and wz ophiuchi	we determine absolute dimensions and abundances for the three f-typemain-sequence detached eclipsing binaries ad boo, vz hya, and wz oph andperform a detailed comparison with results from recent stellar evolutionarymodels. uvby light curves and standard photometry were obtained at eso,radialvelocity observations at cfa facilities, and high-resolution spectra with eso'sferos spectrograph. state-of-the-art methods were applied for the analyses.masses and radii that are precise to 0.5-0.7% and 0.4-0.9%, respectively, havebeen established for the components, which span the ranges of 1.1 to 1.4 m_sunand 1.1 to 1.6 r_sun. the [fe/h] abundances are from -0.27 to +0.10, withuncertainties between 0.07 and 0.15 dex. we find indications of a slightalpha-element overabundance of [alpha/fe] ~ +0.1$ for wz oph. the secondarycomponent of ad boo and both components of wz oph appear to be slightly active.yale-yonsai and victoria-regina evolutionary models fit the components of adboo and vz hya almost equally well, assuming coeval formation, at ages of about1.75/1.50 gyr (ad boo) and 1.25/1.00 gyr (vz hya). basti models, however,predict somewhat different ages for the primary and secondary components. forwz oph, the models from all three grids are significantly hotter than observed.a low he content, decreased envelope convection coupled with surface activity,and/or higher interstellar absorption would remove the discrepancy, but itscause has not been definitively identified. we have demonstrated the power oftesting and comparing recent stellar evolutionary models using eclipsingbinaries, provided their abundances are known. the strongest limitations andchallenges are set by t_eff and interstellar absorption determinations, and bytheir effects on and correlation with abundance results.

astro-ph;0203305	abundance analysis of targets for the corot / mons asteroseimology  missions i. semi-automatic abundance analysis of the gamma dor star hd 49434	one of the goals of the ground-based support program for the corot andmons/roemer satellite missions is to select and characterise suitable targetstars for the part of the missions dedicated to asteroseismology. while theglobal atmospheric parameters may be determined with good accuracy from thestromgren indices, careful abundance analysis must be made for the proposedmain targets. this is a time consuming process considering the long list ofprimary and secondary targets. we have therefore developed new software calledvwa for this task. the vwa automatically selects the least blended lines fromthe atomic line database vald, and consequently adjusts the abundance in orderto find the best match between the calculated and observed spectra. thevariability of hd 49434 was discovered as part of corot ground-based supportobservations. here we present a detailed abundance analysis of hd 49434 usingvwa. for most elements we find abundances somewhat below the solar values, inparticular we find [fe/h] = -0.13(14). we also present the results from thestudy of the variability that is seen in spectroscopic and photometric timeseries observations. from the characteristics of the variation seen inphotometry and in the line profiles we propose that hd 49434 is a variable starof the gamma doradus type.

astro-ph;0501662	the non-detection of oscillations in procyon by most: is it really a  surprise?	we argue that the non-detection of oscillations in procyon by the mostsatellite reported by matthews et al. (2004) is fully consistent with publishedground-based velocity observations of this star. we also examine the claimsthat the most observations represent the best photometric precision so farreported in the literature by about an order of magnitude and are the mostsensitive data set for asteroseismology available for any star other than thesun. these statements are not correct, with the most notable exceptions beingobservations of oscillations in alpha cen a that are far superior. we furtherdisagree that the hump of excess power seen repeatedly from velocityobservations of procyon can be explained as an artefact caused by gaps in thedata. the most observations failed to reveal oscillations clearly because theirnoise level is too high, possibly from scattered earthlight in the instrument.we did find an excess of strong peaks in the most amplitude spectrum that isinconsistent with a simple noise source such as granulation, and may perhapsindicate oscillations at roughly the expected level.

astro-ph;0504469	evidence for granulation and oscillations in procyon from photometry  with the wire satellite	we report evidence for the granulation signal in the star procyon a, based ontwo photometric time series from the star tracker on the wire satellite. thepower spectra show evidence of excess power around 1 millihz, consistent withthe detection of p-modes reported from radial velocity measurements. we see asignificant increase in the noise level below 3 millihz, which we interpret asthe granulation signal. we have made a large set of numerical simulations toconstrain the amplitude and timescale of the granulation signal and theamplitude of the oscillations. we find that the timescale for granulation ist(gran) = 750(200) s, the granulation amplitude is 1.8(0.3) times solar, andthe amplitude of the p-modes is 8(3) ppm. we found the distribution of peakheights in the observed power spectra to be consistent with that expected fromp-mode oscillations. however, the quality of the data is not sufficient tomeasure the large separation or detect a comb-like structure, as seen in thep-modes of the sun. comparison with the recent negative result from the mostsatellite reveal that the most data must have an additional noise source thatprevented the detection of oscillations.

(1993) who targeted 11 turn-off starsin the open cluster m67 (ngc 2682), but the oscillation amplitudes were toosmall (&lt;20micromag) to obtain unambiguous detections. like gilliland et al.(1993) we also aim at detecting solar-like oscillations in m67, but we targetred giant stars with expected amplitudes in the range 50-500micromag andperiods of 1 to 8 hours. we analyse our recently published photometrymeasurements, obtained during a six-week multisite campaign using ninetelescopes around the world. the observations are compared with simulations andwith estimated properties of the stellar oscillations. noise levels in thefourier spectra as low as 27micromag are obtained for single sites, while thecombined data reach 19micromag, making this the best photometric time series ofan ensemble of red giant stars. these data enable us to make the first test ofthe scaling relations (used to estimate frequency and amplitude) with anhomogeneous ensemble of stars. the detected excess power is consistent with theexpected signal from stellar oscillations, both in terms of its frequency rangeand amplitude. however, our results are limited by apparent high levels ofnon-white noise, which cannot be clearly separated from the stellar signal.
