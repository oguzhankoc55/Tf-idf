0903.0205	white paper on ultra-high energy cosmic rays	a fundamental question that can be answered in the next decade is: what isthe origin of the highest energy cosmic particles? the discovery of the sourcesof the highest energy cosmic rays will reveal the workings of the mostenergetic astrophysical environments in the recent universe. candidate sourcesrange from the birth of compact objects to explosions related to gamma-raybursts or generated around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei.in addition to beginning a new era of high-energy astrophysics, the study ofultra-high energy cosmic rays will constrain the structure of the galactic andextragalactic magnetic fields. the propagation of these particles from sourceto earth also probes the cosmic background radiation and gives insight intoparticle interactions at orders of magnitude higher energy than can be achievedin terrestrial laboratories. next generation observatories designed to studythe highest energy cosmic rays will have unprecedented sensitivity toultra-high energy photons and neutrinos, which will further illuminate theworkings of the universe at the most extreme energies. for this challenge to bemet during the 2010-2020 decade, a significant increase in the integratedexposure to cosmic rays above 6 1019 ev will be necessary. the technicalcapabilities for answering this open question are at hand and the time is ripefor exploring charged particle astronomy.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1005.0041	the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the blazar rgb j0710+591	the high-frequency-peaked bl lacertae object rgb j0710+591 was observed inthe very high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) wave band by the veritas array ofatmospheric cherenkov telescopes. the observations, taken between 2008 decemberand 2009 march and totaling 22.1 hr, yield the discovery of vhe gamma rays fromthe source. rgb j0710+591 is detected at a statistical significance of 5.5standard deviations (5.5{\sigma}) above the background, corresponding to anintegral flux of (3.9 +/- 0.8) x 10-12 cm-2 s-1 (3% of the crab nebula's flux)above 300 gev. the observed spectrum can be fit by a power law from 0.31 to 4.6tev with a photon spectral index of 2.69 +/- 0.26stat +/- 0.20sys. these dataare complemented by contemporaneous multiwavelength data from the fermi largearea telescope, the swift x-ray telescope, the swift ultra-violet and opticaltelescope, and the michigan-dartmouth-mit observatory. modeling the broadbandspectral energy distribution (sed) with an equilibrium synchrotron self-comptonmodel yields a good statistical fit to the data. the addition of anexternal-compton component to the model does not improve the fit nor brings thesystem closer to equipartition. the combined fermi and veritas data constrainthe properties of the high-energy emission component of the source over 4orders of magnitude and give measurements of the rising and falling sections ofthe sed.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1110.3787	the luminosity function of fermi-detected flat-spectrum radio quasars	fermi has provided the largest sample of {\gamma}-ray selected blazars todate. in this work we use a complete sample of fsrqs detected during the firstyear of operation to determine the luminosity function (lf) and its evolutionwith cosmic time. the number density of fsrqs grows dramatically up to redshift\sim0.5-2.0 and declines thereafter. the redshift of the peak in the density isluminosity dependent, with more luminous sources peaking at earlier times; thusthe lf of {\gamma}-ray fsrqs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolutionsimilarly to that of radio-quiet agn. also using data from the swift burstalert telescope we derive the average spectral energy distribution of fsrqs inthe 10 kev-100 gev band and show that there is no correlation of the peak{\gamma}-ray luminosity with {\gamma}-ray peak frequency. the coupling of thesed and lf allows us to predict that the contribution of fsrqs to the fermiisotropic {\gamma}-ray background is 9.3(+1.6/-1.0) (\pm3% systematicuncertainty) in the 0.1-100gev band. finally we determine the lf of unbeamedfsrqs, finding that fsrqs have an average lorentz factor of {\gamma} =11.7(+3.3/-2.2), that most are seen within 5\circ of the jet axis, and thatthey represent only ~0.1 % of the parent population.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1210.8071	gamma rays from cosmic rays in supernova remnants	context: cosmic rays are thought to be accelerated at supernova remnant (snr)shocks, but conclusive evidence is lacking. aims: new data from ground-basedgamma-ray telescopes and the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope are used to test this hypothesis. a simple model for gamma-rayproduction efficiency is compared with measured gamma-ray luminosities of snrs,and the gev to tev fluxes ratios of snrs are examined for correlations with snrages. methods: the supernova explosion is modeled as an expanding sphericalshell of material that sweeps up matter from the surrounding interstellarmedium (ism). the accumulated kinetic energy of the shell, which provides theenergy available for nonthermal particle acceleration, changes when matter isswept up from the ism and the snr shell decelerates. a fraction of this energyis assumed to be converted into the energy of cosmic-ray electrons or protons.three different particle radiation processes---nuclear pion-productioninteractions, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and compton scattering---areconsidered. results: the efficiencies for gamma-ray production by these threeprocesses are compared with gamma-ray luminosities of snrs. our results suggestthat snrs become less gamma-ray luminous at &gt;~ 10^4 yr, and are consistent withthe hypothesis that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays with anefficiency of ~10% for the dissipation of kinetic energy into nonthermal cosmicrays. weak evidence for an increasing gev to tev flux ratio with snr age isfound.

1404.3727	extreme blazars studied with fermi-lat and suzaku: 1es 0347-121 and  blazar candidate hess j1943+213	we report on our study of high-energy properties of two peculiar tevemitters: the "extreme blazar" 1es 0347-121 and the "extreme blazar candidate"hess j1943+213 located near the galactic plane. both objects are characterizedby quiescent synchrotron emission with flat spectra extending up to the hardx-ray range, and both were reported to be missing gev counterparts in thefermi-lat 2-year source catalog. we analyze a 4.5 year accumulation of thefermi-lat data, resulting in the detection of 1es 0347-121 in the gev band, aswell as in improved upper limits for hess j1943+213. we also present theanalysis results of newly acquired suzaku data for hess j1943+213. the x-rayspectrum is well represented by a single power law extending up to 25 kev withphoton index 2.00+/-0.02 and a moderate absorption in excess of the galacticvalue, in agreement with previous x-ray observations. no short-term x-rayvariability was found over the 80 ks duration of the suzaku exposure. under theblazar hypothesis, we modeled the spectral energy distributions of 1es 0347-121and hess j1943+213, and derived constraints on the intergalactic magnetic fieldstrength and source energetics. we conclude that although the classification ofhess j1943+213 has not yet been determined, the blazar hypothesis remains themost plausible option, since in particular the broad-band spectra of the twoanalyzed sources along with the source model parameters closely resemble eachother, and the newly available wise and ukidss data for hess j1943+213 areconsistent with the presence of an elliptical host at the distance ofapproximately ~600 mpc.

1408.6453	the blazar paradigm and its discontents	the standard blazar paradigm consists of a supermassive black hole thatexpels relativistic jets of magnetized plasma in our direction. this plasmaentrains nonthermal synchrotron-emitting electrons that furthermore scatterinternally-produced synchrotron photons as well as externally-produced photonsfrom the accretion-disk, the broad-line region, and the infrared-emittingtorus. this picture has been very successful in reproducing the two-humpedblazar spectral energy distribution. yet various discontents persist, including(1) ultra-short variability at tev energies that is much shorter than the blackhole's dynamical timescale; (2) very-high energy (vhe; &gt;100 gev) radiation fromfsrqs; (3) evidence for a hard spectral component in high-synchrotron peakedobjects, found when deabsorbing the measured vhe spectrum using conventionalextragalactic background light (ebl) models; (4) an unusual slowly varyingclass of bl lac objects; (5) location of the gamma-ray emission region. some ofthese problems can be resolved by introducing a hadronic component into theblazar paradigm, consistent with the hypothesis that blazars are sources ofultra-high energy cosmic rays. gamma-ray observations with the cherenkovtelescope array and neutrino observations with icecube will be important totest this hypothesis.

1410.3696	the spectrum of isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 100 mev and  820 gev	the {\gamma}-ray sky can be decomposed into individually detected sources,diffuse emission attributed to the interactions of galactic cosmic rays withgas and radiation fields, and a residual all-sky emission component commonlycalled the isotropic diffuse {\gamma}-ray background (igrb). the igrb comprisesall extragalactic emissions too faint or too diffuse to be resolved in a givensurvey, as well as any residual galactic foregrounds that are approximatelyisotropic. the first igrb measurement with the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fermi) used 10 months of sky-surveydata and considered an energy range between 200 mev and 100 gev. improvementsin event selection and characterization of cosmic-ray backgrounds, betterunderstanding of the diffuse galactic emission, and a longer data accumulationof 50 months, allow for a refinement and extension of the igrb measurement withthe lat, now covering the energy range from 100 mev to 820 gev. the igrbspectrum shows a significant high-energy cutoff feature, and can be welldescribed over nearly four decades in energy by a power law with exponentialcutoff having a spectral index of $2.32\pm0.02$ and a break energy of$(279\pm52)$ gev using our baseline diffuse galactic emission model. the totalintensity attributed to the igrb is $(7.2\pm0.6) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ above 100 mev, with an additional $+15$%/$-30$% systematicuncertainty due to the galactic diffuse foregrounds.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1501.05301	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background and implications  for dark-matter annihilation	the origin of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (egb) has beendebated for some time. { the egb comprises the $\gamma$-ray emission fromresolved and unresolved extragalactic sources, such as blazars, star-forminggalaxies and radio galaxies, as well as radiation from truly diffuseprocesses.} this letter focuses on the blazar source class, the most numerousdetected population, and presents an updated luminosity function and spectralenergy distribution model consistent with the blazar observations performed bythe {\it fermi} large area telescope (lat). we show that blazars account for50$^{+12}_{-11}$\,\% of the egb photons ($&gt;$0.1\,gev), and that {\it fermi}-lathas already resolved $\sim$70\,\% of this contribution. blazars, and inparticular low-luminosity hard-spectrum nearby sources like bl lacs, areresponsible for most of the egb emission above 100\,gev. we find that theextragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission,is responsible for the high-energy cut-off observed in the egb spectrum.finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies and radio galaxies cannaturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the0.1--820\,gev range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. thisallows us to set competitive constraints on the dark-matter annihilation crosssection.

astro-ph;0110625	transient absorption features in grbs and their implications for grb  progenitors	the recent detection of a transient absorption feature in the prompt emissionof grb 990705 has sparked multiple attempts to fit this feature in terms ofphotoelectric absorption or resonance scattering out of the line of sight tothe observer. however, the physical conditions required to reproduce theobserved absorption feature turn out to be rather extreme compared to thepredictions of current grb progenitor models. in particular, strong clumping ofejecta from the grb progenitor seems to be required. using detailed 3dhydrodynamic simulations of supernova explosions as a guideline, we haveinvestigated the dynamics and structure of pre-grb ejecta predicted in variousgrb progenitor models. based on our results, combined with population synthesisstudies relevant to the he-merger model, we estimate the probability ofobserving x-ray absorption features as seen in grb 990705 to &lt;&lt; 1 %.alternatively, if the supranova model is capable of producing highly collimatedlong-duration grbs, it may be a more promising candidate to produce observable,transient x-ray absorption features.

astro-ph;0209436	nonthermal particles and radiation produced by cluster merger shocks	we have developed a numerical model for the temporal evolution of particleand photon spectra resulting from nonthermal processes at the shock frontsformed in merging clusters of galaxies. fermi acceleration is approximated byinjecting power-law distributions of particles during a merger event, subjectto constraints on maximum particle energies. we consider synchrotron,bremsstrahlung, compton, and coulomb processes for the electrons, nuclear,photomeson, and coulomb processes for the protons, and knock-on electronproduction during the merging process. the broadband radio through gamma-rayemission radiated by nonthermal protons and primary and secondary electrons iscalculated both during and after the merger event. using rosat observations toestablish typical parameters for the matter density profile of clusters ofgalaxies, we find that typical merger shocks are weak and accelerate particleswith relatively soft spectra. we consider the prospects for detectingnonthermal radio and gamma-ray emission from clusters of galaxies andimplications for the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and the diffusegamma-ray background. our results suggest that only a few of theisotropically-distributed unidentified egret sources are due to shocks formedin cluster mergers, and that only a minor contribution to the diffuseextragalactic gamma-ray background can originate from cluster merger shocks.cluster merger shocks can accelerate protons to $\lesssim 10^{19}$ ev for thestandard parameters considered here. we predict that {\it glast} will detectseveral cluster mergers and, depending on the mean magnetic fields in theintracluster medium, the low frequency array could detect anywhere from severalto several hundred.

astro-ph;9707179	multiwavelength observations of a flare from markarian 501	we present multiwavelength observations of the bl lacertae object markarian501 (mrk 501) in 1997 between april 8 and april 19. evidence of correlatedvariability is seen in very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 350 gev) gamma-rayobservations taken with the whipple observatory gamma-ray telescope, data fromthe oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment of the compton gamma-rayobservatory, and quicklook results from the all-sky monitor of the rossi x-raytiming explorer while the energetic gamma-ray experiment telescope did notdetect mrk 501. short term optical correlations are not conclusive but theu-band flux observed with the 1.2m telescope of the whipple observatory was 10%higher than in march. the average energy output of mrk 501 appears to peak inthe 2 kev to 100 kev range suggesting an extension of the synchrotron emissionto at least 100 kev, the highest observed in a blazar and ~100 times higherthan that seen in the other tev-emitting bl lac object, mrk 421. the vhegamma-ray flux observed during this period is the highest ever detected fromthis object. the vhe gamma-ray energy output is somewhat lower than the 2-100kev range but the variability amplitude is larger. the correlations seen heredo not require relativistic beaming of the emission unless the vhe spectrumextends to &gt;5 tev.

astro-ph;9801027	high energy gamma rays from ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in gamma ray  bursts	it has recently been proposed that ultrahigh energy ($\gtrsim 10^{19}$ ev)cosmic rays (uhecrs) are accelerated by the blast waves associated with grbs.we calculate the observed synchrotron radiation spectrum from protons andenergetic leptons formed in the cascades initiated by photopion production,taking into account $\gamma\gamma$ attenuation at the source. normalizing tothe emission characteristics of grb~970508, we predict $\sim 10$ mev - 100 gevfluxes at a level which may have been observed with egret from bright grbs, andcould be detected with the proposed glast experiment or with ground-based air\v cerenkov telescopes having thresholds $\lesssim $ several hundred gev. thetemporal decay of the uhecr-induced high-energy $\gamma$-ray afterglows issignificantly slower than that of the lower-energy burst and associatedsynchrotron self-compton (ssc) radiation, which provides a direct way to testthe hadronic origin of a high-energy grb afterglow. besides testing the uhecrorigin hypothesis, the short wavelength emission and afterglows can be used toprobe the level of the diffuse intergalactic infrared radiation field orconstrain redshifts of grb sources.

astro-ph;9803339	synchrotron and ssc emission and the blast-wave model of gamma-ray  bursts	we investigate the dynamics and radiation from a relativistic blast-wavewhich decelerates as it sweeps up ambient matter. the bulk kinetic energy ofthe blast-wave shell is converted into internal energy by the process ofaccreting external matter. if it takes the form of non-thermal electrons andmagnetic fields, then this internal energy will be emitted as synchrotron andsynchrotron self-compton radiation. we perform analytic and numericalcalculations for the deceleration and radiative processes and presenttime-resolved spectra throughout the evolution of the blast-wave. we alsoexamine the dependence of the burst spectra and light curves on variousparameters describing the magnetic field and non-thermal electrondistributions. we find that for bursts such as grb~910503, grb~910601 andgrb~910814, the spectral shapes of the prompt gamma-ray emission at the peaksin $\nu f_\nu$ strongly constrain the magnetic fields in these bursts to bewell below ($\la 10^{-2}$) the equipartition values. these calculations arealso considered in the context of the afterglow emission from the recentlydetected gamma-ray burst counterparts.

astro-ph;9804078	on compton scattering scenarios for blazar flares	the synchrotron reflection scenario recently proposed to explain $\gamma$-rayflares observed from blazar jets is studied. our analysis takes into accountthe angular distribution of the beamed radiation, the finite extent of thescattering region, and light travel-time effects. we compare energy densitiesand powers for synchrotron, ssc, reflected synchrotron (rsy), and externalcompton (ec) scattering processes. if the width of the scattering layer is muchlarger than $\gamma r^\prime_b$, where $\gamma$ and $ r^\prime_b$ denote thebulk lorentz factor and comoving-frame radius of the plasma blob, respectively,then the ratio of the rsy and synchrotron energy densities $\sim 4 \gamma^3n_{blr} \sigma_{t} r^\prime_b$, where $n_{blr}$ is the mean particle density inthe broad line region (blr). our results imply that thomson-thick scatteringregions of narrow extent must be present for the synchrotron reflectionmechanism to operate effectively. this process seems unlikely to cause flaresin lineless bl lac sources, where x-ray and tev flares are common and the blris thought to be weak or absent. we sketch time profiles of flares for variousscenarios, including a model where the blob is energized by sweeping upsurrounding material.

astro-ph;9804174	fireballs loading and the blast wave model of gamma ray bursts	a simple function for the spectral power $p(\epsilon,t) \equiv \nu l(\nu) $is proposed to model, with 9 parameters, the spectral and temporal evolution ofthe observed nonthermal synchrotron power flux from grbs in the blast wavemodel. here $\epsilon = h\nu/$m$_e$c$^2$ is the observed dimensionless photonenergy and $t$ is the observing time. assumptions and an issue of lack ofself-consistency are spelled out. the spectra are found to be most sensitive tothe baryon loading, expressed in terms of the initial bulk lorentz factor$\gamma_0$, and an equipartition term $q$ which is assumed to be constant intime and independent of $\gamma_0$. expressions are given for the peak spectralpower $p_p(t) = p(\epsilon_p,t)$ at the photon energy $\epsilon =\epsilon_p(t)$ of the spectral power peak. a general rule is that the totalfireball particle kinetic energy $e_0 \sim \pi_0 t_d$, where $t_d \propto\gamma_0^{-8/3}$ is the deceleration time scale and $\pi_0 \equivp(\epsilon_p,t_d) \propto \gamma_0^{8/3}$ is the maximum measured bolometricpower output in radiation, during which it is carried primarily by photons withenergy ${\cal e}_0 = \epsilon_p(t_d) \propto q\gamma_0^4$.

astro-ph;9809156	time-dependent photoelectric absorption, photoionization and  fluorescence line emission in gamma-ray burst environments	if gamma-ray bursts are associated with dense star-forming regions in younggalaxies, photoelectric absorption by the dense circumburster material (cbm)will occur. as the burst evolves, the surrounding material is photoionized,leading to fluorescence line emission and reduced photoelectric absorptionopacity. we have analyzed this process in detail, accounting for thetime-dependent photoelectric absorption, photoionization and fluorescence lineemission from the cbm. we find that even if grbs are hosted in densestar-forming regions, photoionization of the grb environment leads to aconstant, but very weak level of delayed fluorescence line emission ontimescales of weeks to years after the burst. a temporally evolving iron~k edgeabsorption feature can serve as diagnostic tool to reveal the density structureof the cbm and may provide an opportunity for redshift measurements. we alsoinvestigated whether photoelectric absorption could be responsible for thespectral evolution of the low-energy slopes of some bright batse $\gamma$-raybursts displaying extremely hard spectra below the peak energy, inconsistentwith the optically-thin synchrotron shock model. we find that a very strongmetal enrichment (~ 100 times solar-system abundances) in the gamma-ray burstenvironment and a rather peculiar spatial distribution of the cbm would benecessary in order to account for the observed hard spectra below a few 100 kevand their temporal evolution.

astro-ph;9910472	spectral energy distributions of gamma ray bursts energized by external  shocks	sari, piran, and narayan have derived analytic formulas to model the spectrafrom gamma-ray burst blast waves that are energized by sweeping up materialfrom the surrounding medium. we extend these expressions to apply to generalradiative regimes and to include the effects of synchrotron self-absorption.electron energy losses due to the synchrotron self-compton process are alsotreated in a very approximate way. the calculated spectra are compared withdetailed numerical simulation results. we find that the spectral and temporalbreaks from the detailed numerical simulation are much smoother than theanalytic formulas imply, and that the discrepancies between the analytic andnumerical results are greatest near the breaks and endpoints of the synchrotronspectra. the expressions are most accurate (within a factor of ~ 3) in theoptical/x-ray regime during the afterglow phase, and are more accurate whenepsilon_e, the fraction of swept-up particle energy that is transferred to theelectrons, is &lt;~ 0.1. the analytic results provide at best order-of-magnitudeaccuracy in the self-absorbed radio/infrared regime, and give poor fits to theself-compton spectra due to complications from klein-nishina effects andphoton-photon opacity.

0811.1160	ultra high energy cosmic rays from black hole jets of radio galaxies	the auger collaboration reports that the arrival directions of &gt;60 eevultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) cluster along the supergalactic planeand correlate with active galactic nuclei (agn) within ~100 mpc. theassociation of several events with the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a supportsthe paradigm that uhecrs are powered by supermassive black-hole engines andaccelerated to ultra-high energies in the shocks formed by variable plasmawinds in the inner jets of radio galaxies. the gzk horizon length of 75 eevuhecr protons is ~100 mpc, so that the auger results are consistent with anassumed proton composition of the uhecrs. in this scenario, the sources ofuhecrs are fr ii radio galaxies and fr i galaxies like cen a with scatteredradiation fields that enhance uhecr neutral-beam production. radio galaxieswith jets pointed away from us can still be observed as uhecr sources due todeflection of uhecrs by magnetic fields in the radio lobes of these galaxies. abroadband ~1 mev -- 10 eev radiation component in the spectra of blazar agn isformed by uhecr-induced cascade radiation in the extragalactic background light(ebl). this emission is too faint to be seen from cen a, but could be detectedfrom more luminous blazars.
