0706.2009	satellite galaxies and fossil groups in the millennium simulation	we use a semianalytic galaxy catalogue constructed from the millenniumsimulation to study the satellites of isolated galaxies in the lcdm cosmogony.this sample (~80,000$ bright primaries, surrounded by ~178,000 satellites)allows the characterization, with minimal statistical uncertainty, of thedynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a lcdm universe. wefind that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter ratherwell: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an nfwprofile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. their spatialdistribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined ``anti-holmberg''effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angularmomentum of the host halo. the isolation criteria for our primaries picks notonly galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at thecentre of ''fossil'' groups. we find that the abundance and luminosity functionof these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few availableobservational constraints. we recover the expected l_{host} \sigma_{sat}^3relation for lcdm models for truly-isolated primaries. less strict primaryselection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation.our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies thatrely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass ofthe primary galaxies.

0902.3392	evolution of cluster red-sequence galaxies from redshift 0.8 to 0.4:  ages, metallicities and morphologies	we present a comprehensive analysis of the stellar population properties(age, metallicity and the alpha-element enhancement [e/fe]) and morphologies ofred-sequence galaxies in 24 clusters and groups from z~0.75 to z~0.45. thedataset, consisting of 215 spectra drawn from the eso distant cluster survey,constitutes the largest spectroscopic sample at these redshifts for which suchan analysis has been conducted. analysis reveals that the evolution of thestellar population properties of red-sequence galaxies depend on their mass:while the properties of most massive are well described by passive evolutionand high-redshift formation, the less massive galaxies require a more extendedstar formation history. we show that these scenarios reproduce the index-sigmarelations as well as the galaxy colours. the two main results of this work are(1) the evolution of the line-strength indices for the red-sequence galaxiescan be reproduced if 40% of the galaxies with sigma &lt; 175 km/s entered thered-sequence between z=0.75 to z=0.45, in agreement with the fraction derivedin studies of the luminosity functions, and (2) the percentage the red-sequencegalaxies exhibiting early-type morphologies (e and s0) decreases by 20% fromz=0.75 to z=0.45. this can be understood if the red-sequence gets populated atlater times with disc galaxies whose star formation has been quenched. weconclude that the processes quenching star formation do not necessarily producea simultaneous morphological transformation of the galaxies entering thered-sequence.

0903.4559	effects of dark matter substructures on gravitational lensing: results  from the aquarius simulations	we use high-resolution aquarius simulations of milky way-sized haloes in thelcdm cosmology to study the effects of dark matter substructures ongravitational lensing. each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a massresolution ~ 10^3-4 m_sun/h) within its virial radius. subhaloes with masseslarger than 10^5 m_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least twoorders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. we incorporate a baryoniccomponent modelled as a hernquist profile and account for the response of thedark matter via adiabatic contraction. we focus on the "anomalous" flux ratioproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due tosubstructures. we find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 m_sun/h playan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have beenunresolved in previous studies. there is large scatter in the predicted fluxratios between different haloes and between different projections of the samehalo. in some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios iscomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it isnot. the probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violationsof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. we therefore conclude that the amount ofsubstructure in the central regions of the aquarius haloes is insufficient toexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.these conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignorethe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability.

0906.1730	the birth and growth of neutralino haloes	we use the extended-press-schechter (eps) formalism to study halo assemblyhistories in a standard $\lambda$cdm cosmology. a large ensemble of monte carlorandom walks provides the {\it entire} halo membership histories of arepresentative set of dark matter particles, which we assume to be neutralinos.the first generation halos of most particles do not have a mass similar to thefree-streaming cut-off $m_{f.s.}$ of the neutralino power spectrum, nor do theyform at high redshift. median values are $m_1 = 10^5$ to $10^7m_{f.s.}$ and$z_1 = 13$ to 8 depending on the form of the collapse barrier assumed in theeps model. for almost a third of all particles the first generation halo has$m_1&gt;10^9m_{f.s.}$. at redshifts beyond 20, most neutralinos are not yet partof any halo but are still diffuse. these numbers apply with little modificationto the neutralinos which are today part of halos similar to that of the milkyway. up to 10% of the particles in such halos were never part of a smallerobject; the typical particle has undergone $\sim 5$ "accretion events' wherethe halo it was part of falls into a more massive object. available n-bodysimulations agree well with the eps predictions for an "ellipsoidal" collapsebarrier, so these may provide a reliable extension of simulation results tosmaller scales. the late formation times and large masses of the firstgeneration halos of most neutralinos imply that they will be disrupted withhigh efficiency during halo assembly.

0909.1593	the earliest stars and their relics in the milky way	we have implemented a simple model to identify the likely sites of the firststars and galaxies in the high-resolution simulations of the formation ofgalactic dark matter halos of the aquarius project. the first star in a galaxylike the milky way formed around redshift z=35; by z=10, the young galaxycontained up to 30000 dark matter haloes capable of forming stars by molecularhydrogen cooling. these minihaloes were strongly clustered and feedback mayhave severely limited the actual number of population iii stars that formed. bythe present day, the remnants of the first stars would be strongly concentratedto the centre of the main halo. if a second generation of long-lived starsformed near the first (the first star relics), we would expect to find half ofthem within 30kpc/h of the galactic centre and a significant fraction insatellites where they may be singled out by their anomalous metallicitypatterns. the first halo in which gas could cool by atomic hydrogen lineradiation formed at z=25; by z=10, the number of such first galaxies hadincreased to ~300. feedback might have decreased the number of first galaxiesat the time they undergo significant star formation, but not the number thatsurvive to the present because near neighbours merge. half of all the "firstgalaxies" that form before z=10 merge with the main halo before z~3 and mostlose a significant fraction of their mass. however, today there should still bemore than 20 remnants orbiting within the central ~30kpc/h of the milky way.these satellites have circular velocities of a few kilometers per second ormore, comparable to those of known milky way dwarfs. they are a promisinghunting ground for the remnants of the earliest epoch of star formation.

0910.3211	galactic stellar haloes in the cdm model	we present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidaldisruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. ourmodel is based on the aquarius project, a suite of high resolution n-bodysimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we tag subsets of particles inthese simulations with stellar populations predicted by the galformsemi-analytic model. our method self-consistently tracks the dynamicalevolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. the luminosityfunction and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree wellwith observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. we find thataccreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1&lt;z&lt;7 from less than 5significant progenitors. these progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites withstellar masses similar to the brightest milky way dwarf spheroidals. incontrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of thesemajor contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. both thenumber of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherentlystochastic. this results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, whichamplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halohosts. the masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloesare consistent with expectations from the milky way and m31. each halo has acomplex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shellsand other subcomponents. this structure is not adequately described by smoothmodels. we find one example of an accreted thick disk. contrasts in age andmetallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broadagreement with recent observations.

0910.5418	photometric redshifts and cluster tomography in the eso distant cluster  survey	this paper reports the results obtained on the photometric redshiftsmeasurement and accuracy, and cluster tomography in the eso distant clustersurvey (ediscs) fields. photometric redshifts were computed using twoindependent codes (hyperz and g. rudnick's code). the accuracy of photometricredshifts was assessed by comparing our estimates with the spectroscopicredshifts of ~1400 galaxies in the 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0 domain. the accuracy for galaxiesfainter than the spectroscopic control sample was estimated using a degradedversion of the photometric catalog for the spectroscopic sample. the accuracyof photometric redshifts is typically sigma(delta z/(1+z)) ~ 0.05+/-0.01,depending on the field, the filter set, and the spectral type of the galaxies.the quality of the photometric redshifts degrades by a factor of two insigma(delta z/(1+z)) between the brightest (i~22) and the faintest (i~24-24.5)galaxies in the ediscs sample. the photometric determination of clusterredshifts in the ediscs fields using a simple algorithm based on photoz is inexcellent agreement with the spectroscopic values (delta(z) ~0.03-0.04 in thehigh-z sample and ~0.05 in the low-z sample). we also developed a method thatuses both photz codes jointly to reject interlopers at magnitudes fainter thanthe spectroscopic limit. when applied to the spectroscopic sample, this methodrejects ~50-90% of all spectroscopically confirmed non-members, while retainingat least 90% of all confirmed members. photometric redshifts are found to beparticularly useful for the identification and study of clusters of galaxies inlarge surveys. they enable efficient and complete pre-selection of clustermembers for spectroscopy, allow accurate determinations of the clusterredshifts, and provide a means of determining cluster membership.

1006.2882	the statistics of the subhalo abundance of dark matter haloes	we study the population statistics of the surviving subhaloes of lcdm darkmatter haloes using a set of very high resolution n-body simulations. theseinclude both simulations of representative regions of the universe andultra-high resolution resimulations of individual dark matter haloes. we findthat more massive haloes tend to have a larger mass fraction in subhaloes. forexample, cluster size haloes typically have 7.5 percent of their mass withinr200 in substructures of fractional mass larger than 1e-5, which is 25 percenthigher than galactic haloes. there is, however, a large variance in the subhalomass fraction from halo to halo, whereas the subhalo abundance shows muchhigher regularity. for dark matter haloes of fixed mass, the subhalo abundancedecreases by 30 percent between redshift 2 and 0. the subhalo abundancefunction correlates with the host halo concentration parameter and formationredshift. however, the intrinsic scatter is not significantly reduced fornarrow ranges of concentration parameter or formation redshift, showing thatthey are not the dominant parameters that determine the subhalo abundance in ahalo.

1008.5114	assembly history and structure of galactic cold dark matter halos	we use the aquarius simulation series to study the imprint of assemblyhistory on the structure of galaxy-mass cold dark matter halos. our resultsconfirm earlier work regarding the influence of mergers on the mass densityprofile and the inside-out growth of halos. the inner regions that contain thevisible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affectedonly by major mergers. particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers arefound predominantly in the outskirts of halos. our analysis reveals trends thatrun counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. for example,major mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10)contribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20per cent for our six aquarius halos. the bulk is contributed roughly equally byminor mergers and by "diffuse" material which is not resolved into individualobjects. this is consistent with modeling based on excursion-set theory whichsuggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a haloof any scale. interestingly, the simulations themselves suggest that asignificantly fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlierhalos by mergers prior to their joining the main system. the aquariussimulations resolve halos to much lower mass scales than are expected to retaingas or form stars. these results thus confirm that most of the baryons fromwhich visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than throughmergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affectgalaxy structure at later times.

1009.0645	the fundamental plane of ediscs galaxies - the effect of size evolution	we study the evolution of spectral early-type galaxies in clusters, groupsand the field up to redshift 0.9 using the ediscs dataset. we measure re, ie,and sigma for 154 cluster and 68 field galaxies. we study the evolution of thezero point of the fundamental plane (fp) and confirm results in the literature,but now also for the low cluster velocity dispersion regime. the mass-to-lightratio varies as delta log m/l_b=(-0.54+-0.01)z=(-1.61+-0.01)log(1+z) inclusters, independent of their velocity dispersion. the evolution is stronger(delta log m/l_b=(-0.76+-0.01)z=(-2.27+-0.03)log(1+z)) for field galaxies. thefp residuals correlate with galaxy mass and become progressively negative atlow masses. the effect is visible at z&gt;=0.7 for cluster galaxies and at z&gt;=0.5for field galaxies. we investigate the size evolution of our galaxy sample. wefind that the half-luminosity radius for a galaxy with a dynamical or stellarmass of 2x10^11 msol varies as (1+z)^{-1.0+-0.3} for both cluster and fieldgalaxies. at the same time, stellar velocity dispersions grow with redshift, as(1+z)^{0.59+-0.10} at constant dynamical mass, and as (1+z)^{0.34+- 0.14} atconstant stellar mass. the measured size evolution reduces to re (1+z)^{-0.5+-0.2} and sigma (1+z)^{0.41+-0.08}, at fixed dynamical masses, and re(1+z)^{-0.68+-0.4} and sigma (1+z)^{0.19+-0.10}, at fixed stellar masses, whenthe progenitor bias (galaxies that locally are of spectroscopic early-type, butnot very old, disappear from the ediscs high-redshift sample; these galaxiestend to be large in size) is taken into account. taken together, the variationsin size and velocity dispersion imply that the luminosity evolution withredshift derived from the zero point of the fp is somewhat milder than thatderived without taking these variations into account.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

0709.3933	understanding the shape of the halo-mass and galaxy-mass  cross-correlation functions	we use the millennium simulation to measure the cross-correlation betweenhalo centres and mass (or equivalently the average density profiles of darkhaloes) in a lcdm cosmology. we present results for radii in the range 10 kpc/h&lt; r &lt; 30 mpc/h for halo masses in the range 4e10 msol/h &lt; m200 &lt; 4e14 msol/h.both at z=0 and at z=0.76 these cross-correlations are surprisingly well fit byapproximating the inner region by a density profile of nfw or einasto form, theouter region by a biased version of the linear mass autocorrelation function,and by adopting the maximum of the two where they are comparable. we use asimulation of the formation of galaxies within the millennium simulation toexplore how these results are reflected in cross-correlations between galaxiesand mass. these are directly observable through galaxy-galaxy lensing. herealso we find that simple models can represent the simulation results remarkablywell, typically to &lt; 10%. such models can be used to extend our results toother redshifts, to cosmologies with other parameters, and to other assumptionsabout how galaxies populate dark haloes. the characteristic features predictedin the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal should provide a strong test of the lcdmcosmology as well as a route to understanding how galaxies form within it.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1107.1916	where will supersymmetric dark matter first be seen?	if the dark matter consists of supersymmetric particles, gamma-rayobservatories such as the large area telescope aboard the fermi satellite maydetect annihilation radiation from the haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters.much recent effort has been devoted to searching for this signal around themilky way's dwarf satellites. using a new suite of high-resolution simulationsof galaxy cluster haloes (the phoenix project), together with the aquariussimulations of milky-way-like galaxy haloes, we show that highersignal-to-noise and equally clean signals are, in fact, predicted to come fromnearby rich galaxy clusters. most of the cluster emission is produced by smallsubhaloes with masses less than that of the sun. the large range of mass scalescovered by our two sets of simulations allows us to deduce a physicallymotivated extrapolation to these small (and unresolved) masses. since tidaleffects destroy subhaloes in the dense inner regions of haloes, most clusteremission is then predicted to come from large radii, implying that the nearestand brightest systems should be much more extended than fermi's angularresolution limit. the most promising targets for detection are clusters such ascoma and fornax, but detection algorithms must be tuned to the predictedprofile of the emission if they are to maximize the chance of finding this weaksignal.

1112.0315	the aquila comparison project: the effects of feedback and numerical  methods on simulations of galaxy formation	we compare the results of thirteen cosmological gasdynamical codes used tosimulate the formation of a galaxy in the lcdm structure formation paradigm.the various runs differ in their hydrodynamical treatment (sph, moving-mesh andamr) but share the same initial conditions and adopt their latest publishedmodel of cooling, star formation and feedback. despite the common halo assemblyhistory, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size,morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=0, due mainly to the differentimplementations of feedback. compared with observation, most codes tend toproduce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas-rich than typicalspirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. a stellar disk isdiscernible in most simulations, though its prominence varies widely from codeto code. there is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and theseverity of the disagreement with observation. models that are more effectiveat limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observedgalaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disk component. ourconclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. some differences canalso be traced to the numerical techniques: more gas seems able to cool andbecome available for star formation in grid-based codes than in sph. however,this effect is small compared to the variations induced by different feedbackprescriptions. we conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yetuniquely predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, evenwhen the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. developingfeedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy withouthindering the formation of high-angular momentum stellar disks remains achallenge.

1201.1940	the phoenix project: the dark side of rich galaxy clusters	[abridged] we introduce the phoenix project, a set of $\lambda$cdmsimulations of the dark matter component of nine rich galaxy clusters. eachcluster is simulated at least at two different numerical resolutions. for eightof them, the highest resolution corresponds to $\sim 130$ million particleswithin the virial radius, while for one this number is over one billion. westudy the structure and substructure of these systems and contrast them withsix galaxy-sized dark matter haloes from the aquarius project, simulated atcomparable resolution. this comparison highlights the approximate massinvariance of cdm halo structure and substructure. we find little difference inthe spherically-averaged mass, pseudo-phase-space density, and velocityanisotropy profiles of aquarius and phoenix haloes. when scaled to the virialproperties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloesare also very similar, despite the fact that aquarius and phoenix haloes differby roughly three decades in virial mass. the most notable difference is thatcluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantlyless relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increasedhalo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. thisaccentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters onsurface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of three at a givenradius, depending on projection. the high apparent concentration reported forsome strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects. a morerecent assembly also explains why substructure in some phoenix haloes isslightly more abundant than in aquarius, especially in the inner regions.resolved subhaloes nevertheless contribute only $11 \pm 3%$ of the virial massin phoenix clusters. .

1203.3216	scaling relations for galaxy clusters in the millennium-xxl simulation	we present a very large high-resolution cosmological n-body simulation, themillennium-xxl or mxxl, which uses 303 billion particles to represent theformation of dark matter structures throughout a 4.1gpc box in a lambdacdmcosmology. we create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clustersusing surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxysurveys, x-ray luminosity, integrated sunyaev-zeldovich signal, and lensingmass. the unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us toexplore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with clustermass. the scatter correlates between different mass-observable relationsbecause of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation andenvironment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition ofuncorrelated structure. we show that this can account for the apparentdiscrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal sz signals measuredfor optically and x-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the plancksatellite. related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clustersdetected at high redshift. our results illustrate that cosmological conclusionsfrom galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only ofthe relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables andof the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures.

1203.5339	the journey of qso haloes from z=6 to the present	we apply a recently developed scaling technique to the millennium-xxl, one ofthe largest cosmological n-body simulations carried out to date 3x10^11particles within a cube of volume ~70gpc^3). this allows us to investigate thecosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in theextreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. we assume these objects to belikely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasarsdiscovered by the sloan digital sky survey. haloes with a similar abundance tothese quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 msun in the currently preferredcosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. rather, theirdescendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-dayclusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 msun for this same cosmology. the masses both atz=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmologicalparameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in publishedinterpretations of data from the wmap satellite. the main factor determiningthe future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of itsenvironment on scales of 7 to 14 mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6to 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. allthese features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic tohierarchical growth. finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typicallyacquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 myr, implying verylarge recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black holemasses and high luminosities of the sdss quasars.

1204.2743	planck intermediate results. iii. the relation between galaxy cluster  mass and sunyaev-zeldovich signal	we examine the relation between the galaxy cluster mass m andsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect signal d_a^2 y for a sample of 19 objects forwhich weak lensing (wl) mass measurements obtained from subaru telescope dataare available in the literature. hydrostatic x-ray masses are derived fromxmm-newton archive data and the sz effect signal is measured from planckall-sky survey data. we find an m_wl-d_a^2 y relation that is consistent inslope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses;however, there is a normalisation offset with respect to previous measuresbased on hydrostatic x-ray mass-proxy relations. we verify that our sz effectmeasurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations fromplanck data. for the present sample, the hydrostatic x-ray masses at r_500 areon average ~ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, atodds with expectations. we show that the mass discrepancy is driven by adifference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods, and, for thepresent sample, the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration isespecially large for disturbed systems. the mass discrepancy is also linked tothe offset in centres used by the x-ray and weak lensing analyses, which againis most important in disturbed systems. we outline several approaches that areneeded to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with x-ray andweak lensing observations.

1206.6923	the millennium run observatory: first light	simulations of galaxy evolution aim to capture our current understanding aswell as to make predictions for testing by future experiments. simulations andobservations are often compared in an indirect fashion: physical quantities areestimated from the data and compared to models. however, many applications canbenefit from a more direct approach, where the observing process is alsosimulated and the models are seen fully from the observer's perspective. tofacilitate this, we have developed the millennium run observatory (mrobs), atheoretical virtual observatory which uses virtual telescopes to `observe'semi-analytic galaxy formation models based on the suite of millennium run darkmatter simulations. the mrobs produces data that can be processed and analyzedusing the standard software packages developed for real observations. atpresent, we produce images in forty filters from the rest-frame uv to ir fortwo stellar population synthesis models, three different models of igmabsorption, and two cosmologies (wmap1/7). galaxy distributions for a largenumber of mock lightcones can be `observed' using models of major ground- andspace-based telescopes. the data include lightcone catalogues linked tostructural properties of galaxies, pre-observation model images, mock telescopeimages, and source extractor products that can all be traced back to the higherlevel dark matter, semi-analytic galaxy, and lightcone catalogues available inthe millennium database. here, we describe our methods and announce a firstpublic release of simulated surveys (e.g., sdss, cfht-ls, goods, goods/ers,candels, and hudf). the mrobs browser, an online tool, further facilitatesexploration of the simulated data. we demonstrate the benefits of a directapproach through a number of example applications (galaxy number counts incandels, clusters, morphologies, and dropout selections).

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

0801.2571	cosmological information in the gravitational lensing of pregalactic hi	we study the constraints which the next generation of radio telescopes couldplace on the nature of dark energy, dark matter and inflation by studying thegravitational lensing of high redshift 21 cm emission, and we compare with theconstraints obtainable from wide-angle surveys of galaxy lensing. if thereionization epoch is effectively at z ~ 8 or later, very large amounts ofcosmological information will be accessible to telescopes like ska and lofar.we use simple characterizations of reionization history and of proposedtelescope designs to investigate how well the two-dimensional convergence powerspectrum, the three-dimensional matter power spectrum, the evolution of thelinear growth function, and the standard cosmological parameters can bemeasured from radio data. the power spectra can be measured accurately over awide range of wavenumbers at z ~ 2, and the evolution in the cosmic energydensity can be probed from z ~ 0.5 to z ~ 7. this results in a characterizationof the shape of the power spectra (i.e. of the nature of dark matter and ofinflationary structure generation) which is potentially more precise than thatobtained from galaxy lensing surveys. on the other hand, the dark energyparameters in their conventional parametrization (omega_lambda, w_o, w_a) aresomewhat less well constrained by feasible 21 cm lensing surveys than by anall-sky galaxy lensing survey although a 21 cm surveys might be more powerfulthan galaxy surveys for constraining models with "early" dark energy. overall,the best constraints come from combining surveys of the two types. this resultsin extremely tight constraints on dark matter and inflation, and improvesconstraints on dark energy, as judged by the standard figure of merit, by morethan an order of magnitude over either survey alone.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

astro-ph;0005259	clustering of galaxy clusters in cdm universes	we use very large cosmological n--body simulations to obtain accuratepredictions for the two-point correlations and power spectra of mass-limitedsamples of galaxy clusters. we consider two currently popular cold dark matter(cdm) cosmogonies, a critical density model ($\tau$cdm) and a flat low densitymodel with a cosmological constant ($\lambda$cdm). our simulations each use$10^9$ particles to follow the mass distribution within cubes of side$2h^{-1}$gpc ($\tau$cdm) and $3h^{-1}$gpc ($\lambda$cdm) with a forceresolution better than $10^{-4}$ of the cube side. we investigate how thepredicted cluster correlations increase for samples of increasing mass anddecreasing abundance. very similar behaviour is found in the two cases. thecorrelation length increases from $r_0=12$ -- 13$h^{-1}$mpc for samples withmean separation $d_{\rm c}=30h^{-1}$mpc to $r_0=22$-- 27$h^{-1}$mpc for sampleswith $d_{\rm c}=100h^{-1}$mpc. the lower value here corresponds to $\tau$cdmand the upper to $\lambda$cdm. the power spectra of these cluster samples areaccurately parallel to those of the mass over more than a decade in scale. bothcorrelation lengths and power spectrum biases can be predicted to better than10% using the simple model of sheth, mo &amp; tormen (2000). this predictionrequires only the linear mass power spectrum and has no adjustable parameters.we compare our predictions with published results for the apm cluster sample.the observed variation of correlation length with richness agrees well with themodels, particularly for $\lambda$cdm. the observed power spectrum (for acluster sample of mean separation $d_{\rm c}=31h^{-1}$mpc) lies significantlyabove the predictions of both models.

astro-ph;0010587	simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological volume	we present results of large n-body-hydrodynamic simulations of galaxyformation. our simulations follow the formation of galaxies in cubic volumes ofside 100mpc, in two versions of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogony: thestandard, omega=1 scdm model and the flat, omega=0.3 lcdm model. over 2000galaxies form in each of these simulations. we examine the rate at which gascools and condenses into dark matter halos. this roughly tracks the cosmic starformation rate inferred from observations at various redshifts. galaxies in thesimulations form gradually over time in the hierarchical fashion characteristicof the cdm cosmogony. in the lcdm model, substantial galaxies first appear atz=5 and the population builds up rapidly until z=1 after which the rate ofgalaxy formation declines as cold gas is consumed and the cooling time of hotgas increases. in both cosmologies, the present-day k-band luminosity functionof the simulated galaxies resembles observations. the galaxy autocorrelationfunctions differ significantly from those of the dark matter. at the presentepoch there is little bias in either model between galaxies and dark matter onlarge scales, but a significant anti-bias on scales of 1mpc/h and a positivebias on scales of 100kpc/h. the galaxy correlation function evolves little withredshift in the range z=0-3, and depends on the luminosity of the galaxysample. the projected pairwise velocity dispersion of the galaxies is muchlower than that of the dark matter on scales less than 2mpc/h. applying avirial mass estimator to the largest galaxy clusters recovers the clustervirial masses in an unbiased way.

(1990). simulationparticles are tagged as `galaxies' so as to reproduce observed present-daycorrelations. they are then identified along the past light-cones ofhypothetical observers to create mock catalogues with the geometry and thedistance distribution of the broadhurst et al. data. we produce 1936 (2625)quasi-independent catalogues from our $\tau$cdm ($\lambda$cdm) simulation. acouple of large clumps in a catalogue can produce a high peak at lowwavenumbers in the corresponding one-dimensional power spectrum, without anyapparent large-scale periodicity in the original redshift histogram. althoughthe simulated redshift histograms frequently display regularly spaced clumps,the spacing of these clumps varies between catalogues and there is no`preferred' period over our many realisations. we find only a 0.72 (0.49) percent chance that the highest peak in the power spectrum of a $\tau$cdm($\lambda$cdm) catalogue has a peak-to-noise ratio higher than that in thebroadhurst et al. data. none of the simulated catalogues with such high peaksshows coherently spaced clumps with a significance as high as that of the realdata. we conclude that in cdm universes, the kind of regularity observed bybroadhurst et al. has a priori probability well below $10^{-3}$.

astro-ph;0012027	predicting the peculiar velocities of nearby psc-z galaxies using the  least action principle	we use the least action principle to predict the peculiar velocities of psc-zgalaxies inside $cz=2000$\km. linear theory is used to account for tidaleffects to $cz=15000$\km, and we iterate galaxy positions to account forredshift distortions. as the least action principle is valid beyond lineartheory, we can predict reliable peculiar velocities even for very nearbygalaxies (ie $cz \leq 500$\km). these predicted peculiar velocities are thencompared with the observed velocities of 12 galaxies with cepheid distances.the combination of the psc-z galaxy survey (with its large sky coverage anduniform selection), with the accurate cepheid distances, makes this comparisonrelatively free from systematic effects. we find that galaxies are good tracersof the mass, even at small ($\leq 10$\mpc) scales; and under the assumption ofno biasing, $0.25 \leq \beta \leq 0.75$ (at 90% confidence). we use thereliable predicted peculiar velocities to estimate the hubble constant \ho fromthe local volume without ``stepping up'' the distance ladder, finding aconfidence range of 65-75\kmm (at 90% confidence).

astro-ph;0109376	the cosmic shear stis parallel program - first results	since the universe is inhomogeneous on scales well below the hubble radius,light bundles from distant galaxies are deflected and distorted by the tidalgravitational field of the large-scale matter distribution as they propagatethrough the universe. two-point statistical measures of the observedellipticities, like the dispersion within a finite aperture or the ellipticitycross-correlation, can be related to the power spectrum of the large-scalestructure. the measurement of cosmic shear (especially on small angular scales)can thus be used to constrain cosmological parameters and to test cosmologicalstructure formation in the non-linear regime, without any assumptions about therelation between luminous and dark matter. in this paper we will presentpreliminary cosmic shear measurements on sub-arcminute scales, obtained fromarchival stis parallel data. the high angular resolution of hst, together withthe sensitivity and psf-stability of stis, allows us to measure cosmic shearalong many independent lines-of-sight. ongoing stis parallel observations,currently being carried out in the frame of a big go program (8562+9248), willgreatly increase the number of available useful fields and will enable us tomeasure cosmic shear with higher accuracy on sub-arcminute scales.

astro-ph;0110246	galaxy clusters in hubble volume simulations: cosmological constraints  from sky survey populations	we use giga-particle n-body simulations to study galaxy cluster populationsin hubble volumes of lcdm (omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7) and tcdm (omega_m=1)world models. mapping past light-cones of locations in the computational space,we create mock sky surveys of dark matter structure to z~1.4 over 10,000 sq degand to z~0.5 over two full spheres. calibrating the jenkins mass function atz=0 with samples of ~1.5 million clusters, we show that the fit describes thesky survey counts to &lt;~20% acccuracy over all redshifts for systems larger thanpoor groups (m&gt;5e13 msun/h). fitting the observed local temperature functiondetermines the ratio beta of specific thermal energies in dark matter andintracluster gas. we derive a scaling with power spectrum normalization beta\propto sigma8^{5/3}, and measure a 4% error on sigma8 arising from cosmicvariance in temperature-limited cluster samples. considering distant clusters,the lcdm model matches emss and rdcs x-ray-selected survey observations undereconomical assumptions for intracluster gas evolution. using transformations ofmass-limited cluster samples that mimic sigma8 variation, we explore sz searchexpectations for a 10 sq deg survey complete above 10^{14} msun/h. clustercounts are shown to be extremely sensitive to sigma8 uncertainty while redshiftstatistics, such as the sample median, are much more stable. for lcdm, thecharacteristic temperature at fixed sky surface density is a weak function ofredshift, implying an abundance of hot clusters at z&gt;1. assuming constant beta,four kt&gt;8 kev clusters lie at z&gt;2 and 40 kt&gt;5 kev clusters lie at z&gt;3 on thewhole sky. detection of coma-sized clusters at z&gt;1 violate lcdm at 95%confidence if their surface density exceeds 0.003 per sq deg, or 120 on thewhole sky.

astro-ph;0111099	simulating the formation of the local galaxy population	we simulate the formation and evolution of the local galaxy populationstarting from initial conditions with a smoothed linear density field whichmatches that derived from the iras 1.2 jy galaxy survey. our simulations trackthe formation and evolution of all dark matter haloes more massive than 10e+11solar masses out to a distance of 8000 km/s from the milky way. we implementprescriptions similar to those of kauffmann et al. (1999) to follow theassembly and evolution of the galaxies within these haloes. we focus on twovariants of the cdm cosmology: an lcdm and a tcdm model. galaxy formation ineach is adjusted to reproduce the i-band tully-fisher relation of giovanelli etal. (1997). we compare the present-day luminosity functions, colours,morphology and spatial distribution of our simulated galaxies with those of thereal local population, in particular with the updated zwicky catalog, with theiras pscz redshift survey, and with individual local clusters such as coma,virgo and perseus. we also use the simulations to study the clustering biasbetween the dark matter and galaxies of differing type. although somesignificant discrepancies remain, our simulations recover the observedintrinsic properties and the observed spatial distribution of local galaxiesreasonably well. they can thus be used to calibrate methods which use theobserved local galaxy population to estimate the cosmic density parameter or todraw conclusions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. to facilitate suchwork, we publically release our z=0 galaxy catalogues, together with theunderlying mass distribution.

astro-ph;0111289	star formation, metallicity and dust properties derived from the sapm  galaxy survey spectra	we have derived star formation rates (sfrs), gas-phase oxygen abundances andeffective dust absorption optical depths for a sample of galaxies drawn fromthe stromlo-apm redshift survey using the new charlot and longhetti (2001;cl01) models, which provide a physically consistent description of the effectsof stars, gas and dust on the integrated spectra of galaxies. our sampleconsists of 705 galaxies with measurements of the fluxes and equivalent widthsof halpha, [oii], and one or both of [nii] and [sii]. for a subset of thegalaxies, 60 and 100 micron iras fluxes are available. we compare the starformation rates derived using the models with those derived using standardestimators based on the halpha, the [oii] and the far-infrared luminosities ofthe galaxies. the cl01 sfr estimates agree well with those derived from theiras fluxes, but are typically a factor of ~3 higher than those derived fromthe halpha or the [oii] fluxes, even after the usual mean attenuationcorrection of a_halpha=1 mag is applied to the data. we show that the reasonfor this discrepancy is that the standard halpha estimator neglects theabsorption of ionizing photons by dust in hii regions and the contamination ofhalpha emission by stellar absorption. we also use our sample to studyvariations in star formation and metallicity as a function of galaxy absolutebj magnitude. for this sample, the star formation rate per unit bj luminosityis independent of magnitude. the gas-phase oxygen abundance does increase withbj luminosity, although the scatter in metallicity at fixed magnitude is large.

astro-ph;0201193	voids in the simulated local universe	we use simulations of the formation and evolution of the galaxy population inthe local universe to address the issue of whether the standard theoreticalmodel succeeds in producing empty regions as large and as dark as the observednearby ones. we follow the formation of galaxies in an lcdm universe and workwith mock catalogues which can resolve the morphology of lmc sized galaxies,and the luminosity of objects 6 times fainter. we look for a void signature insets of virialized haloes selected by mass, as well as in mock galaxy samplesselected according to observationally relevant quantities, like luminosity,colour, or morphology. we find several void regions with diameter 10 mpc/h inthe simulation where gravity seems to have swept away even the smallest haloeswe were able to track. we probe the environment density of the variouspopulations and compute luminosity functions for galaxies residing inunderdense, mean density and overdense regions. we also use nearest neighbourstatistics to check possible void populations, taking $l_{*}$ spirals asreference neighbours. down to our resolution limits, we find that all types ofgalaxies avoid the same regions, and that no class appears to populate thevoids defined by the bright galaxies.

astro-ph;0201544	the inner structure of lambdacdm halos i: a numerical convergence study	we present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role ofvarious numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated darkmatter halo. we report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art,multi-stepping, parallel n-body codes: pkdgrav and gadget. we find thatconvergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of thegravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, andparticle number. for softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effectsare negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii wherethe following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter thanthe local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristicacceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enoughparticles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longerthan the age of the universe. the most stringent requirement for convergence istypically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxationcriterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocitiesat radii where the density contrast may reach $\sim 10^6$, the region mustenclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times $10^6$ within thevirial radius). applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized $\lambda$cdm halo, wefind that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressivelyshallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slopeshallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, $r \sim 0.005 r_{200}$,with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the innerregions.

astro-ph;0202393	the abundance and clustering of dark haloes in the standard lambda cdm  cosmogony	much evidence suggests that we live in a flat cold dark matter universe witha cosmological constant. accurate analytic formulae are now available for manyproperties of the dark halo population in such a universe. assuming current``concordance'' values for the cosmological parameters, we plot halo abundanceagainst redshift as a function of halo mass, of halo temperature, of thefraction of cosmic matter in haloes, of halo clustering strength, and of theclustering strength of the z=0 descendants of high redshift haloes. these plotsare useful for understanding how nonlinear structure grows in the model. theydemonstrate a number of properties which may seem surprising, for example: 10^9solar mass haloes are as abundant at z=20 as l_* galaxies are today; 10^6khaloes are equally abundant at z=8 and at z=0; 10% of all matter is currentlyin haloes hotter than 1 kev, while more than half is in haloes too cool to trapphoto-ionized gas; 1% of all matter at z=15 is in haloes hot enough to ionisehydrogen; haloes of given mass or temperature are more clustered at higherredshift; haloes with the abundance of present-day l_* galaxies are equallyclustered at all z&lt;20; the metals produced by star-formation at z&gt;10 are moreclustered at z=0 than are l_* galaxies.

astro-ph;0207448	smoothed particle hydrodynamics for galaxy formation simulations:  improved treatments of multiphase gas, of star formation and of supernovae  feedback	we investigate a new implementation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamicstechnique (sph) designed to improve the realism with which galaxy formation canbe simulated. in situations where cooling leads to the coexistence of phases ofvery different density and temperature, our method substantially reducesartificial overcooling near phase boundaries, prevents the exclusion of hot gasfrom the vicinity of cold ``clouds'', and allows relative motion of the twophases at each point. we demonstrate the numerical stability of our scheme inthe presence of extremely steep density and temperature gradients, as well asin strong accretion shocks and cooling flows. in addition, we present newimplementations of star formation and feedback which simulate the effect ofenergy injection into multiphase gas more successfully than previous schemes.our feedback recipes deposit thermal energy separately in cold dense gas andhot diffuse gas, and can explicitly reinject cold gas into the hot phase. theymake it possible to damp star formation effectively, to reheat cold gas, and todrive outflows into the galaxy halo and beyond. we show feedback effects to bestrongest in small mass objects where much of the gas can be expelled. afteridealised tests, we carry out a first low resolution study of galaxy formationin a $\lambda$cdm universe. feedback results in substantial and mass-dependentreductions in the total baryonic mass gathered onto the final object as well asin significant modulation of the star formation history.

astro-ph;0207664	stable clustering, the halo model and nonlinear cosmological power  spectra	we present the results of a large library of cosmological n-body simulations,using power-law initial spectra. the nonlinear evolution of the matter powerspectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulaebased on the work of hamilton et al. the scaling approach has assumed thathighly nonlinear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in propercoordinates. our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarityscaling, the scale-free spectra define a nonlinear locus that is clearlyshallower than would be required under stable clustering. furthermore, thesmall-scale nonlinear power increases as both the power-spectrum index n andthe density parameter omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accountedfor by the previous scaling formulae. this breakdown of stable clustering canbe understood as resulting from the modification of dark-matter haloes bycontinuing mergers. these effects are naturally included in the analytic `halomodel' for nonlinear structure; using this approach we are able to fit both ourscale-free results and also our previous cdm data. this approach is moreaccurate than the commonly-used peacock--dodds formula and should be applicableto more general power spectra. code to evaluate nonlinear power spectra usingthis method is available fromhttp://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/~res/software.html following publication, wewill make the power-law simulation data available through the virgo websitehttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/virgo

astro-ph;0301293	simulating igm reionization	we have studied the igm reionization process in its full cosmological contextincluding structure evolution and a realistic galaxy population. we have used acombination of high-resolution n-body simulations (to describe the dark matterand diffuse gas component), a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation (to trackthe evolution of the sources of ionizing radiation) and the monte carloradiative transfer code crash (to follow the propagation of ionizing photonsinto the igm). the process has been followed in the largest volume ever usedfor this kind of study, a field region of the universe with a comoving lengthof l~20/h mpc, embedded in a much larger cosmological simulation. to assess theeffect of environment on the reionization process, the same radiative transfersimulations have been performed on a 10/h mpc comoving box, centered on aclustered region. we find that, to account for the all ionizing radiation,objects with total masses of m~10^9 msun must be resolved. in this case, thesimulated stellar population produces a volume averaged ionization fractionx_v=0.999 by z~8, consistent with observations without requiring any additionalsources of ionization. we also find that environment substantially affects thereionization process. in fact, although the simulated proto-cluster occupies asmaller volume and produces a higher number of ionizing photons, it getstotally ionized later. this is because high density regions, which are morecommon in the proto-cluster, are difficult to ionize because of their highrecombination rates.

astro-ph;0302451	early reionization by the first galaxies	large-scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background measured by thewmap satellite requires a mean optical depth to thomson scattering, tau_e ~0.17. the reionization of the universe must therefore have begun at relativelyhigh redshift. we have studied the reionization process using supercomputersimulations of a large and representative region of a universe which hascosmological parameters consistent with the wmap results. our simulationsfollow both the radiative transfer of ionizing photons and the formation andevolution of the galaxy population which produces them. a previously publishedmodel with a standard stellar imf, with a moderate photon escape fraction fromgalaxies and with ionizing photon production as expected for zero metallicitystars produces tau_e = 0.104, which is within 1.0 to 1.5-sigma of the ``best''wmap value. values up to 0.16 can be produced by taking larger escape fractionsor a top heavy imf. the data do not require a separate populations of``miniquasars'' or of stars forming in objects with total masses below 10^9m_sun. reconciling such early reionization with the observed gunn-petersontroughs in z&gt;6 quasars may be challenging. possible resolutions of this problemare discussed.

astro-ph;0306205	substructures in cold dark matter haloes	we analyse the properties of substructures within dark matter halos(subhalos) using a set of high-resolution numerical simulations of theformation of structure in a lambda-cdm universe. our simulation set includes 11high-resolution simulations of massive clusters as well as a region of meandensity, allowing us to study the spatial and mass distribution ofsubstructures down to a mass resolution limit of 10^9 h^(-1)mo. we alsoinvestigate how the properties of substructures vary as a function of the massof the `parent' halo in which they are located. we find that the substructuremass function depends at most weakly on the mass of the parent halo and is welldescribed by a power-law. the radial number density profiles of substructuresare steeper in low mass halos than in high mass halos. more massivesubstructures tend to avoid the centres of halos and are preferentially locatedin the external regions of their parent halos. we also study the mass accretionand merging histories of substructures, which we find to be largely independentof environment. we find that a significant fraction of the substructuresresiding in clusters at the present day were accreted at redshifts z &lt; 1. thisimplies that a significant fraction of present-day `passive' cluster galaxiesshould have been still outside the cluster progenitor and more active at z~1.

astro-ph;0310576	the inner structure of lcdm halos ii: halo mass profiles and lsb  rotation curves	we use a set of high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations toinvestigate the inner mass profile of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (cdm)halos. these simulations extend the thorough numerical convergence studypresented in paper i of this series (power et al. 2003), and demonstrate thatthe mass profile of cdm halos can be robustly estimated beyond a minimumconverged radius of order r_conv ~ 1 kpc/h in our highest resolution runs. thedensity profiles of simulated halos become progressively shallow from thevirial radius inwards, and show no sign of approaching a well-defined power-lawbehaviour near the centre. at r_conv, the logarithmic slope of the densityprofile is steeper than the asymptotic \rho \propto r^-1 expected from theformula proposed by navarro, frenk, and white (1996), but significantlyshallower than the steeply divergent \rho \propto r^-1.5 cusp proposed by mooreet al. (1999). we perform a direct comparison of the spherically-averaged darkmatter circular velocity (v_c) profiles with rotation curves of low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies from the samples of de blok et al. (2001), de blokand bosma (2002), and swaters et al. (2003). most (about two-thirds) lsbgalaxies in this dataset are roughly consistent with cdm halo v_c profiles.however, about one third of lsbs in these samples feature a sharp transitionbetween the rising and flat part of the rotation curve that is not seen in thev_c profiles of cdm halos. this discrepancy has been interpreted as excludingthe presence of cusps, but we argue that it might simply reflect the differencebetween circular velocity and gas rotation speed likely to arise in gaseousdisks embedded within realistic, triaxial cdm halos.

astro-ph;0311060	the physical properties of star forming galaxies in the low redshift  universe	(modified) we present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of\~10^5 galaxies with measurable star formation in the sdss. by comparingphysical information extracted from the emission lines with continuumproperties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies atz&lt;0.2. we take out essentially all aperture bias using resolved imaging,allowing an accurate estimate of the total sfrs in galaxies. we determine thesfr density to be 1.915^{+0.02}_{-0.01}(rand.)^{+0.14}_{-0.42} (sys.) h7010^{-2} msun/yr/mpc^3 at z=0.1 (for a kroupa imf) and we study the distributionof star formation as a function of various physical parameters. the majority ofthe star formation in the low redshift universe takes place in moderatelymassive galaxies (10^10-10^11 msun), typically in hsb disk galaxies. roughly15% of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of anactive nucleus. about 20% occurs in starburst galaxies. we show that thepresent to past-average star formation rate, the scalo b-parameter; is almostconstant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only atm*&gt;10^10 msun. the volume averaged b parameter is 0.408^{+0.005}_{-0.002}(rand).^{+0.029}_{-0.090} (sys.) h70^{-1}. we use this value constrain the starformation history of the universe. in agreement with other work we find acorrelation between $b$ and morphological type, as well as a tight correlationbetween the 4000aa break (d4000) and b. we discuss how d4000 can be used toestimate b parameters for high redshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0405537	the origin of the mass--metallicity relation: insights from 53,000  star-forming galaxies in the sdss	we utilize sloan digital sky survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass andgas-phase metallicity. we derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar massesusing new techniques which make use of the latest stellar evolutionarysynthesis and photoionization models. we find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlationbetween stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude instellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. the relation is relativelysteep from 10^{8.5} - 10^{10.5} m_sun, in good accord with known trends betweenluminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10^{10.5} m_sun. we use indirectestimates of the gas mass based on the h-alpha luminosity to compare our datato predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. we show thatmetal loss is strongly anti-correlated with baryonic mass, with low mass dwarfgalaxies being 5 times more metal-depleted than l* galaxies at z~0.1. evidencefor metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies, but is found in galaxieswith masses as high as 10^{10} m_sun. we interpret this as strong evidence bothof the ubiquity of galactic winds and of their effectiveness in removing metalsfrom galaxy potential wells.

astro-ph;0408132	disk galaxy rotation curves in triaxial cdm halos	we use n-body hydrodynamical simulations to study the structure of disks intriaxial potentials resembling cdm halos. our analysis focuses on the accuracyof the dark mass distribution inferred from rotation curves derived fromsimulated long-slit spectra. we consider a massless disk embedded in a halowith axis ratios of 0.5:0.6:1.0 and with its rotation axis aligned with theminor axis of the halo. closed orbits for the gaseous particles deviate fromcoplanar circular symmetry, resulting in a variety of long-slit rotation curveshapes, depending on the orientation of the disk relative to the line of sight.rotation curves may thus differ significantly from the spherically-averagedcircular velocity profile of the dark matter halo. "solid-body" rotationcurves--typically interpreted as a signature of a constant density core in thedark matter distribution--are obtained about 25% of the time for randomorientations although the dark matter follows the cuspy density profileproposed by navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw). we conclude that the discrepanciesreported between the shape of the rotation curve of low surface brightnessgalaxies and the structure of cdm halos may be resolved once the complexeffects of halo triaxiality on the dynamics of the gas component is properlytaken into account.

astro-ph;0505440	feedback and metal enrichment in cosmological sph simulations i. a model  for chemical enrichment	we discuss a model for treating chemical enrichment by snii and sniaexplosions in simulations of cosmological structure formation. our modelincludes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in densecollapsed gas clumps. metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar mediumby star particles using a local sph smoothing kernel. a variety of chemicalabundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to thedifferent yields and lifetimes of snii and snia progenitor stars. in the caseof snii chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. because of thesensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactichaloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infalland the build up of the stellar components. indeed, in simulations of isolatedgalaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent coolingproduces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with aprimordial cooling function. in the highly-enriched central regions, theevolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here thegas is always dense enough to cool. a similar situation is found incosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes whichcould spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffusegas. we demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adoptsuper-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar massand in the metal distributions. we also find that the impact of metallicity onthe star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particularevolutionary history. our results hence emphasise the importance of feedbackprocesses for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment.

astro-ph;0506269	the host galaxies of radio-loud agn: mass dependencies, gas cooling and  agn feedback	the properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215radio-loud agn with redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3, defined from the sdss, areinvestigated. these are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4ghzluminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 w/hz. the fraction of galaxies that hostradio-loud agn with l(1.4ghz) &gt; 10^23 w/hz is a strong function of stellarmass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 msun to more than30% at 5x10^11 msun. the integral radio luminosity function is derived in sixranges of stellar and black hole mass. its shape is very similar in all ofthese ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. its normalisationvaries strongly with mass, as m_*^2.5 or m_bh^1.6; this scaling only begins tobreak down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. there is nocorrelation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud agnin the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud isindependent of whether it is optically classified as an agn. the host galaxiesof the radio-loud agn have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies ofthe same mass.  all of these findings support the conclusion that the optical agn and lowradio luminosity agn phenomena are independent and are triggered by differentphysical mechanisms. intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of theradio-loud agn fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from thehot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. it is speculated that gas coolingprovides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud agn activity,and it is argued that agn heating could plausibly balance the cooling of thegas over time.

astro-ph;0512391	the evolution of the star formation activity in galaxies and its  dependence on environment	we study how the proportion of star-forming galaxies evolves between z=0.8and z=0 as a function of galaxy environment, using the [oii] line in emissionas a signature of ongoing star formation. our high-z dataset comprises 16clusters, 10 groups and another 250 galaxies in poorer groups and the field atz=0.4-0.8 from the eso distant cluster survey, plus another 9 massive clustersat similar redshifts. as a local comparison, we use samples of galaxy systemsselected from the sloan digital sky survey at 0.04&lt; z &lt; 0.08. at high-z mostsystems follow a broad anticorrelation between the fraction of star-forminggalaxies and the system velocity dispersion. at face value, this suggests thatat z=0.4-0.8 the mass of the system largely determines the proportion ofgalaxies with ongoing star formation. at these redshifts the strength of starformation (as measured by the [oii] equivalent width) in star-forming galaxiesis also found to vary systematically with environment. sloan clusters have muchlower fractions of star-forming galaxies than clusters at z=0.4-0.8 and, incontrast with the distant clusters, show a plateau for velocity dispersions $\ge 550 km s^-1$, where the fraction of galaxies with [oii] emission does notvary systematically with velocity dispersion. we quantify the evolution of theproportion of star-forming galaxies as a function of the system velocitydispersion and find it is strongest in intermediate-mass systems (sigma ~500-600 km s^-1 at z=0). to understand the origin of the observed trends, weuse the press-schechter formalism and the millennium simulation and show thatgalaxy star formation histories may be closely related to the growth history ofclusters and groups. we propose a scheme that is able to account for theobserved relations between the star-forming fraction and \sigma [abridged].

astro-ph;0610172	why does the clustering of haloes depend on their formation history	we discuss in the framework of the excursion set formalism a recent discoveryfrom n-body simulations that the clustering of haloes of given mass depends ontheir formation history. we review why the standard implementation of thisformalism is unable to explain such dependencies, and we show that this can, inprinciple, be rectified by implementing in full an ellipsoidal collapse modelwhere collapse depends not only on the overdensity but also on the shape of theinitial density field. we also present an alternative remedy for thisdeficiency, namely the inclusion of collapse barriers for pancakes andfilaments, together with the assumption that formation history depends on whenthese barriers are crossed. we implement both these extensions in a generalisedexcursion set method, and run large monte carlo realisations to quantify theeffects. our results suggest that effects as large as those found insimulations can only arise in the excursion set formalism if the formationhistory of a halo does indeed depend on the size of its progenitor filamentsand pancakes. we also present conditional distributions of progenitor pancakesand filaments for low-mass haloes identified at present epoch, and discuss arecent claim by mo et.al. that most low-mass haloes were embedded in massivepancakes at $z\sim 2$.

astro-ph;0702241	virial scaling of massive dark matter halos: why clusters prefer a high  normalization cosmology	we present a precise estimate of the bulk virial scaling relation of halosformed via hierarchical clustering in an ensemble of simulated cold dark mattercosmologies. the result is insensitive to cosmological parameters, the presenceof a trace, dissipationless gas component, and numerical resolution down to alimit of ~1000 particles. the dark matter velocity dispersion scales with totalmass as log(sigma_{dm}(m,z)) = log(1082.9 +- 4.0 \kms) + (0.3361 +- 0.0026)log(h(z)m_{200}/10^{15} msun), with h(z) the dimensionless hubble parameter. atfixed mass, the velocity dispersion likelihood is nearly log-normal, withscatter sigma_{ln sigma} = 0.0426 +- 0.015, except for a tail to higherdispersions containing 10% of the population that are merger transients. wecombine this relation with the halo mass function in lcdm models, and show thata low normalization condition, s_8 = sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^{0.35} \= 0.69,favored by recent wmap and sdss analysis requires that galaxy and gas specificenergies in rich clusters be 50% larger than that of the underlying darkmatter. such large energetic biases are in conflict with the current generationof direct simulations of cluster formation. a higher normalization, s_8 = 0.80,alleviates this tension and implies that the hot gas fraction within r_{500} is(0.71 +- 0.09) h_{70}^{-3/2} omega_b/\omega_m, a value consistent with recentsunyaev-zel'dovich observations.

astro-ph;9412088	an analytic model for the gravitational clustering of dark matter haloes	we develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of darkhaloes. the statistical properties of dark haloes are determined from theinitial density field (assumed to be gaussian) through an extension of thepress-schechter formalism. gravitational clustering is treated by a sphericalmodel which describes the concentration of dark haloes in collapsing regions.we test this model against results from a variety of n-body simulations. theautocorrelation function of dark haloes in such simulations dependssignificantly on how haloes are identified. our predictions agree well withresults based on algorithms which break clusters into subgroups moreefficiently than the standard friends-of-friends algorithm. the agreement isbetter than that found by assuming haloes to lie at the present positions ofpeaks of the linear density field. we use these techniques to study how thedistribution of haloes is biased with respect to that of the mass. the initial(lagrangian) positions of haloes identified at a given redshift and havingcircular velocities $v_c=v_c^*(z)$ (i.e. mass equal to the characteristicnonlinear mass $m^*$ at that redshift) are very weakly correlated with thelinear density field or among themselves. as a result of dynamical evolution,however, the present-day correlations of these haloes are similar to those ofthe mass. haloes with lower $v_c$ are biased toward regions with negativeoverdensity, while those with higher $v_c$ are biased toward regions withpositive overdensity. among the haloes identified at any given epoch, thosewith higher circular velocities are more strongly correlated today. among thehaloes of given circular velocity, those at higher redshifts are also morestrongly clustered today. in the ``standard cdm'' model, haloes with

astro-ph;9504020	galaxy dynamics in clusters	we use high resolution simulations to study the formation and distribution ofgalaxies within a cluster which forms hierarchically. we follow both darkmatter and baryonic gas which is subject to thermal pressure, shocks andradiative cooling. galaxy formation is identified with the dissipative collapseof the gas into cold, compact knots. we examine two extreme representations ofgalaxies during subsequent cluster evolution --- one purely gaseous and theother purely stellar. the results are quite sensitive to this choice.gas-galaxies merge efficiently with a dominant central object whilestar-galaxies merge less frequently. thus, simulations in which galaxies remaingaseous appear to suffer an ``overmerging'' problem, but this problem is muchless severe if the gas is allowed to turn into stars. we compare the kinematicsof the galaxy population in these two representations to that of dark halos andof the underlying dark matter distribution. galaxies in the stellarrepresentation are positively biased (\ie over-represented in the cluster) bothby number and by mass fraction. both representations predict the galaxies to bemore centrally concentrated than the dark matter, whereas the dark halopopulation is more extended. a modest velocity bias also exists in bothrepresentations, with the largest effect, $\sigma_{gal}/\sigma_{dm} \simeq0.7$, found for the more massive star-galaxies. phase diagrams show that thegalaxy population has a substantial net inflow in the gas representation, whilein the stellar case it is roughly in hydrostatic equilibrium. virial massestimators can underestimate the true cluster mass by up to a factor of 5. thediscrepancy is largest if only the most massive galaxies are used, reflectingsignificant mass segregation.

astro-ph;9512127	an analytic model for the spatial clustering of dark matter haloes	we develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of darkmatter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is biased relativeto that of the mass. the statistical distribution of dark haloes within theinitial density field (assumed gaussian) is determined by an extension of thepress-schechter formalism. modifications of this distribution caused bygravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapseapproximation. we test this model against results from a variety of n-bodysimulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function.this bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation betweendark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulationresults and analytic predictions. because haloes are spatially exclusive, thevariance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensityis significantly smaller than the poisson value. this seriously complicates anyanalytic calculation of the autocorrelation function of dark halos. oursimulation results show that this autocorrelation function is proportional tothat of the mass over a wide range in $r$, even including scales where bothfunctions are significantly greater than unity. the constant of proportionalityis very close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. thisresult permits an entirely analytic estimate of the autocorrelation function ofdark haloes. we use our model to study how the distribution of galaxies may bebiased with respect to that of the mass. in conjunction with other data thesetechniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic massfluctuations and the density of the universe.

astro-ph;9602052	the correlation function of clusters of galaxies and the amplitude of  mass fluctuations in the universe	we show that if a sample of galaxy clusters is complete above some massthreshold, then hierarchical clustering theories for structure formationpredict its autocorrelation function to be determined purely by the clusterabundance and by the spectrum of linear density fluctuations. thus if the shapeof the initial fluctuation spectrum is known, its amplitude $\sigma_8$ can beestimated directly from the correlation length of a cluster sample in a waywhich is independent of the value of $\omega_0$. if the cluster masscorresponding to the sample threshold is also known, it provides an independentestimate of the quantity $\sigma_8\omega_0^{0.6}$. thus cluster data shouldallow both $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_0$ to be determined observationally. weexplore these questions using n-body simulations together with a simple butaccurate analytical model based on extensions of press-schechter theory.applying our results to currently available data we find that if the linearfluctuation spectrum has a shape similar to that suggested by the apm galaxysurvey, then a correlation length $r_0$ in excess of $20\mpch$ for abellclusters would require $\sigma_8&gt;1$, while $r_0&lt;15\mpch$ would require$\sigma_8&lt;0.5$. with conventional estimates of the relevant mass thresholdthese imply $\omega_0\la 0.3$ and $\omega_0\ga 1$ respectively.

astro-ph;9903179	diffuse x-ray emission from late-type galaxy haloes	current theories of galaxy formation predict that spiral galaxies areembedded in a reservoir of hot gas. this gas is able to cool onto the galaxyreplenishing cold gas that is consumed by star formation. estimates of thex-ray luminosity emitted in the cooling region suggest a bolometric luminosityof order 10 x 10^41 ergs/s in massive systems. we have used rosat pspc data tosearch for extended x-ray emission from the haloes of three nearby, massive,late-type galaxies: ngc 2841, ngc 4594 and ngc 5529. we infer 95 per cent upperlimits on the bolometric x-ray luminosities of the haloes of ngc 2841, ngc 4594and ngc 5529 of 0.4, 1.2 and 3.8 x 10^41 ergs/s respectively. thus the trueluminosity lies well below the straightforward theoretical prediction. wediscuss this discrepancy and suggest a number of ways in which the theoreticalmodel can be brought into agreement with the observational results. a possiblesolution is that the gravitational potentials of the dark matter haloes ofthese galaxies are weaker than assumed in the current model. alternatively, thepresent day accretion may be substantially less than is required on average tobuild the disk over the hubble time. our results are, however, based on onlythree galaxies, none of which is ideal for this kind of study. a larger dataset is required to explore this important problem further.

astro-ph;9905182	a comparison of the pscz and stromlo-apm redshift surveys	we present a direct comparison of the clustering properties of two redshiftsurveys covering a common volume of space: the recently completed iras pointsource catalogue redshift survey (pscz) containing 14500 galaxies with alimiting flux of 0.6 jy at 60 microns, and the optical stromlo-apm surveycontaining 1787 galaxies in a region of 4300 deg^2 in the southern galacticcap. we use three methods to compare the clustering properties: thecounts-in-cells comparison of efstathiou (1995), the two-point crosscorrelation function, and the tegmark (1998) `null-buster' test. we find thatthe stromlo variances are systematically higher than those of pscz, as expecteddue to the deficit of early-type galaxies in iras samples. however we find thatthe differences between the cell counts are consistent with a linear biasbetween the two surveys, with a relative bias parameter b_rel =b_stromlo/b_pscz \approx 1.3 which appears approximately scale-independent. thecorrelation coefficient r between optical and iras densities on scales \sim 20mpc/h is r &gt; 0.72 at 95% c.l., placing limits on types of `stochastic bias'which affect optical and iras galaxies differently.

astro-ph;9906035	on density and velocity fields and beta from the iras pscz survey	we present a version of the fourier bessel method first introduced by fisheret al (1994) and zaroubi et al (1994) with two extensions: (a) we amend theformalism to allow a generic galaxy weight which can be constant rather thanthe more conventional overweighting of galaxies at high distances, and (b) wecorrect for the masked zones by extrapolation of fourier bessel modes ratherthan by cloning from the galaxy distribution in neighbouring regions. we testthe procedure extensively on n-body simulations and find that it givesgenerally unbiased results but that the reconstructed velocities tend to beoverpredicted in high-density regions. applying the formalism to the pszzredshift catalog, we find that beta = 0.7 +/- 0.5 from a comparison of thereconstructed local group velocity to the cmb dipole. from an anisotropy testof the velocity field, we find that beta = 1 cdm models models normalized tothe current cluster abundance can be excluded with 90% confidence. the densityand velocity fields reconstructed agree with the fields found by branchini etal (1998) in most points. we find a back-infall into the great attractor region(hydra-centaurus region) but tests suggest that this may be an artifact. weidentify all the major clusters in our density field and confirm the existenceof some previously identified possible ones.

astro-ph;9906160	the santa barbara cluster comparison project: a comparison of  cosmological hydrodynamics solutions	we have simulated the formation of an x-ray cluster in a cold dark matteruniverse using 12 different codes. the codes span the range of numericaltechniques and implementations currently in use, including sph and grid methodswith fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. the goal of this comparison is toassess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters inthe simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed tobe non-radiative. we compare images of the cluster at different epochs, globalproperties such as mass, temperature and x-ray luminosity, and radial profilesof various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. on the whole, theagreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number ofdiscrepancies exist. agreement is best for properties of the dark matter andworst for the total x-ray luminosity. even in this case, simulations thatadequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total x-rayluminosities that agree to within a factor of two. other quantities arereproduced to much higher accuracy. for example, the temperature and gas massfraction within the virial radius agree to about 10%, and the ratio of specifickinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5%. various factorscontribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, includingdifferences in the internal timing of the simulations. based on the overallconsistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of thecluster we have modelled.

astro-ph;9912073	non-linear stochastic galaxy biasing in cosmological simulations	we study the biasing relation between dark-matter halos or galaxies and theunderlying mass distribution, using cosmological $n$-body simulations in whichgalaxies are modelled via semi-analytic recipes. the nonlinear, stochasticbiasing is quantified in terms of the mean biasing function and the scatterabout it as a function of time, scale and object properties. the biasing ofgalaxies and halos shows a general similarity and a characteristic shape, withno galaxies in deep voids and a steep slope in moderately underdense regions.at $\sim 8\hmpc$, the nonlinearity is typically $\lsim 10$ percent and thestochasticity is a few tens of percent, corresponding to $\sim 30$ percentvariations in the cosmological parameter $\beta=\omega^{0.6}/b$. biasingdepends weakly on halo mass, galaxy luminosity, and scale. the time evolutionis rapid, with the mean biasing larger by a factor of a few at $z\sim 3$compared to $z=0$, and with a minimum for the nonlinearity and stochasticity atan intermediate redshift. biasing today is a weak function of the cosmologicalmodel, reflecting the weak dependence on the power-spectrum shape, but the timeevolution is more cosmology-dependent, relecting the effect of the growth rate.we provide predictions for the relative biasing of galaxies of different typeand color, to be compared with upcoming large redshift surveys. analytic modelsin which the number of objects is conserved underestimate the evolution ofbiasing, while models that explicitly account for merging provide a gooddescription of the biasing of halos and its evolution, suggesting that mergingis a crucial element in the evolution of biasing.

astro-ph;9912223	the iras pscz dipole	we use the pscz iras galaxy redshift survey to analyze the cosmologicalgalaxy dipole out to a distance 300 h$^{-1}$ mpc. the masked area is filled inthree different ways, firstly by sampling the whole sky at random, secondly byusing neighbouring areas to fill a masked region, and thirdly using a sphericalharmonic analysis. the method of treatment of the mask is found to have asignificant effect on the final calculated dipole.  the conversion from redshift space to real space is accomplished by using ananalytical model of the cluster and void distribution, based on 88 nearbygroups, 854 clusters and 163 voids, with some of the clusters and all of thevoids found from the pscz database.  the dipole for the whole pscz sample appears to have converged within adistance of 200 $h^{-1}$mpc and yields a value for $\beta = \omega^{0.6}/b$ =0.75 (+0.11,-0.08), consistent with earlier determinations from iras samples bya variety of methods. for b = 1, the $2-\sigma$ range for $\omega_{o}$ is0.43-1.02.  the direction of the dipole is within 13$^o$ of the cmb dipole, the mainuncertainty in direction being associated with the masked area behind thegalactic plane. the improbability that further major contributions to thedipole amplitude will come from volumes larger than those surveyed here meansthat the question of the origin of the cmb dipole is essentially resolved.

0809.5035	ray-tracing through the millennium simulation: born corrections and  lens-lens coupling in cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing	(abridged) we study the accuracy of various approximations to cosmic shearand weak galaxy-galaxy lensing and investigate effects of born corrections andlens-lens coupling. we use ray-tracing through the millennium simulation tocalculate various cosmic-shear and galaxy-galaxy-lensing statistics. we comparethe results from ray-tracing to semi-analytic predictions. we find: (i) thelinear approximation provides an excellent fit to cosmic-shear power spectra aslong as the actual matter power spectrum is used as input. common fittingformulae, however, strongly underestimate the cosmic-shear power spectra. halomodels provide a better fit to cosmic shear-power spectra, but there are stillnoticeable deviations. (ii) cosmic-shear b-modes induced by born correctionsand lens-lens coupling are at least three orders of magnitude smaller thancosmic-shear e-modes. semi-analytic extensions to the linear approximationpredict the right order of magnitude for the b-mode. compared to theray-tracing results, however, the semi-analytic predictions may differ by afactor two on small scales and also show a different scale dependence. (iii)the linear approximation may under- or overestimate the galaxy-galaxy-lensingshear signal by several percent due to the neglect of magnification bias, whichmay lead to a correlation between the shear and the observed number density oflenses. we conclude: (i) current semi-analytic models need to be improved inorder to match the degree of statistical accuracy expected for futureweak-lensing surveys. (ii) shear b-modes induced by corrections to the linearapproximation are not important for future cosmic-shear surveys. (iii)magnification bias can be important for galaxy-galaxy-lensing surveys.

0706.0849	imaging the cosmic matter distribution using gravitational lensing of  pregalactic hi	21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen during and before the epoch of cosmicreionisation is gravitationally lensed by material at all lower redshifts.low-frequency radio observations of this emission can be used to reconstructthe projected mass distribution of foreground material, both light and dark. wecompare the potential imaging capabilities of such 21-cm lensing with those offuture galaxy lensing surveys. we use the millennium simulation to simulatelarge-area maps of the lensing convergence with the noise, resolution andredshift-weighting achievable with a variety of idealised observationprogrammes. we find that the signal-to-noise of 21-cm lens maps can far exceedthat of any map made using galaxy lensing. if the irreducible noise limit canbe reached with a sufficiently large radio telescope, the projected convergencemap provides a high-fidelity image of the true matter distribution, allowingthe dark matter halos of individual galaxies to be viewed directly, and givinga wealth of statistical and morphological information about the relativedistributions of mass and light. for instrumental designs like that planned forthe square kilometer array (ska), high-fidelity mass imaging may be possiblenear the resolution limit of the core array of the telescope.
