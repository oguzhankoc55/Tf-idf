0909.2996	quenching of the accretion disk strong aperiodic variability at the  magnetospheric boundary	we study power density spectra (pds) of x-ray flux variability in binarysystems where the accretion flow is truncated by the magnetosphere. pds ofaccreting x-ray pulsars where the neutron star is close to the corotation withthe accretion disk at the magnetospheric boundary, have a distinct break/cutoffat the neutron star spin frequency. this break can naturally be explained inthe "perturbation propagation" model, which assumes that at any given radius inthe accretion disk stochastic perturbations are introduced to the flow withfrequencies characteristic for this radius. these perturbations are thenadvected to the region of main energy release leading to a self-similarvariability of x-ray flux p~f^{-1...-1.5}. the break in the pds is then anatural manifestation of the transition from the disk to magnetospheric flow atthe frequency characteristic for the accretion disk truncation radius(magnetospheric radius). the proximity of the pds break frequency to the spinfrequency in corotating pulsars strongly suggests that the typical variabilitytime scale in accretion disks is close to the keplerian one. in transientaccreting x-ray pulsars characterized by large variations of the mass accretionrate during outbursts, the pds break frequency follows the variations of thex-ray flux, reflecting the change of the magnetosphere size with the accretionrate. above the break frequency the pds steepens to ~f^{-2} law which holdsover a broad frequency range. these results suggest that strong f^{-1...-1.5}aperiodic variability which is ubiquitous in accretion disks is notcharacteristic for magnetospheric flows.

1003.2965	interstellar extinction and the distribution of stellar populations in  the direction of the ultra-deep chandra galactic field	we studied the stellar population in the central 6.6x6.6arcmin,region of theultra-deep (1msec) chandra galactic field - the "chandra bulge field" (cbf)approximately 1.5 degrees away from the galactic center - using the hubblespace telescope acs/wfc blue (f435w) and red (f625w) images. we mainly focus onthe behavior of red clump giants - a distinct stellar population, which isknown to have an essentially constant intrinsic luminosity and color. bystudying the variation in the position of the red clump giants on a spatiallyresolved color-magnitude diagram, we confirm the anomalous total-to-selectiveextinction ratio, as reported in previous work for other galactic bulge fields.we show that the interstellar extinction in this area is &lt;a_(f625w)&gt;= 4 onaverage, but varies significantly between ~3-5 on angular scales as small as 1arcminute. using the distribution of red clump giants in anextinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram, we constrain the shape of astellar-mass distribution model in the direction of this ultra-deep chandrafield, which will be used in a future analysis of the population of x-raysources. we also show that the adopted model for the stellar densitydistribution predicts an infrared surface brightness in the direction of the"chandra bulge field" in good agreement (i.e. within ~15%) with the actualmeasurements derived from the spitzer/irac observations.

1006.2463	integral/ibis 7-year all-sky hard x-ray survey. part i: image  reconstruction	this paper is the first in a series devoted to the hard x-ray whole skysurvey performed by the integral observatory over seven years. here we presentan improved method for image reconstruction with the ibis coded mask telescope.the main improvements are related to the suppression of systematic effectswhich strongly limit sensitivity in the region of the galactic plane (gp),especially in the crowded field of the galactic center (gc). we extended theibis/isgri background model to take into account the galactic ridge x-rayemission (grxe). to suppress residual systematic artifacts on a reconstructedsky image we applied nonparametric sky image filtering based on waveletdecomposition. the implemented modifications of the sky reconstruction methoddecrease the systematic noise in the ~20 ms deep field of gc by ~44%, andpractically remove it from the high-latitude sky images. new observational datasets, along with an improved reconstruction algorithm, allow us to conduct thehard x-ray survey with the best currently available minimal sensitivity 3.7e-12erg/s/cm2 ~0.26 mcrab in the 17-60 kev band at a 5 sigma detection level. thesurvey covers 90% of the sky down to the flux limit of 6.2e-11 erg/s/cm2 (~4.32mcrab) and 10% of the sky area down to the flux limit of 8.6e-12 erg/s/cm2(~0.60 mcrab).

0708.3215	cumulative hard x-ray spectrum of local agn: a link to the cosmic x-ray  background	we determine the cumulative spectral energy distribution (sed) of local agnin the 3-300 kev band and compare it with the spectrum of the cosmic x-raybackground (cxb) in order to test the widely accepted paradigm that the cxb isa superposition of agn and to place constraints on agn evolution. we performeda stacking analysis of the hard x-ray spectra of agn detected in two recentall-sky surveys, performed by the ibis/isgri instrument aboard integral and bythe pca instrument aboard rxte, taking into account the space densities of agnwith different luminosities and absorption column densities. we derived thecollective sed of local agn in the 3-300 kev energy band. those agn withluminosities below 10^43.5 erg/s (17-60 kev) provide the main contribution tothe local volume hard x-ray emissivity, at least 5 times more than moreluminous objects. the cumulative spectrum exhibits (although with marginalsignificance) a cutoff at energies above 100-200 kev and is consistent with thecxb spectrum if agn evolve over cosmic time in such a way that the sed of theircollective high-energy emission has a constant shape and the relative fractionof obscured agn remains nearly constant, while the agn luminosity densityundergoes strong evolution between z~1 and z=0, a scenario broadly consistentwith results from recent deep x-ray surveys. the first direct comparisonbetween the collective hard x-ray sed of local agn and the cxb spectrumdemonstrates that the popular concept of the cxb being a superposition of agnis generally correct. by repeating this test using improved agn statistics fromcurrent and future hard x-ray surveys, it should be possible to tighten theconstraints on the cosmic history of black hole growth.

1009.6165	observational evidence for matter propagation in accretion flows	we study simultaneous x-ray and optical observations of three intermediatepolars ex hya, v1223 sgr and tv col with the aim to understand the propagationof matter in their accretion flows. we show that in all cases the power spectraof flux variability of binary systems in x-rays and in optical band are similarto each other and the majority of x-ray and optical fluxes are correlated withtime lag &lt;1 sec. these findings support the idea that optical emission ofaccretion disks, in these binary systems,largely originates as reprocessing ofx-ray luminosity of their white dwarfs. in the best obtained dataset of ex hyawe see that the optical lightcurve unambiguously contains some component, whichleads the x-ray emission by ~7 sec. we interpret this in the framework of themodel of propagating fluctuations and thus deduce the time of travel of thematter from the innermost part of the truncated accretion disk to the whitedwarf surface. this value agrees very well with the time expected for matterthreaded onto the magnetosphere of the white dwarf to fall to its surface. thedatasets of v1223 sgr and tv col in general confirm these findings,but havepoorer quality.

1108.2778	coronal radiation of a cusp of spun-up stars and the x-ray luminosity of  sgr a*	chandra has detected optically thin, thermal x-ray emission with a size of ~1arcsec and luminosity ~10^33 erg/s from the direction of the galacticsupermassive black hole (smbh), sgr a*. we suggest that a significant or evendominant fraction of this signal may be produced by several thousand late-typemain-sequence stars that possibly hide in the central ~0.1 pc region of thegalaxy. as a result of tidal spin-ups caused by close encounters with otherstars and stellar remnants, these stars should be rapidly rotating and hencehave hot coronae, emitting copious amounts of x-ray emission with temperatureskt&lt;~ a few kev. the chandra data thus place an interesting upper limit on thespace density of (currently unobservable) low-mass main-sequence stars near sgra*. this bound is close to and consistent with current constraints on thecentral stellar cusp provided by infrared observations. if coronally activestars do provide a significant fraction of the x-ray luminosity of sgr a*, itshould be variable on hourly and daily time scales due to giant flaresoccurring on different stars. another consequence is that the quiescent x-rayluminosity and accretion rate of the smbh are yet lower than believed before.

1109.2471	integral constraints on the galactic hard x-ray background from the  milky way anticenter	we present results of a study of the galactic ridge x-ray emission (grxe) inhard x-rays with the ibis telescope on board integral in the region near thegalactic anticenter (ga) at l=155 deg. we assumed a conservative 2 sigma upperlimit on the flux from the ga in the 25-60 kev energy band of 1.25e-10erg/s/cm^2 (12.8 mcrab) per ibis field of view, or 6.6e-12 erg/s/cm^2 (0.7mcrab) per degree longitude in the 135 deg. &lt; l &lt; 175 deg. region. this upperlimit exceeds the expected grxe intensity in the ga direction by an order ofmagnitude, given the near-infrared (nir) surface brightness of the milky way inthis region and the standard hard x-ray-to-nir intensity ratio for the grxe,assuming stellar origin. based on the cgro/egret surface brightness of thegalaxy above 100 mev as a tracer of the cosmic-ray (cr) induced gamma-raybackground, the expected grxe flux in ga exceeds the measured 2 sigma upperlimit by a factor of 4. therefore, the non-detection of hard x-ray emissionfrom the ga does not contradict the stellar nature of the grxe, but isinconsistent with cr origin.

1207.5825	a mexican hat with holes: calculating low resolution power spectra from  data with gaps	a simple method for calculating a low-resolution power spectrum from datawith gaps is described. the method is a modification of the $\delta$-variancemethod previously described by stutzki and ossenkopf. a mexican hat filter isused to single out fluctuations at a given spatial scale and the variance ofthe convolved image is calculated. the gaps in the image, defined by the mask,are corrected for by representing the mexican hat filter as a differencebetween two gaussian filters with slightly different widths, convolving theimage and mask with these filters and dividing the results before calculatingthe final filtered image. this method cleanly compensates for data gaps even ifthese have complicated shapes and cover a significant fraction of the data. themethod was developed to deal with problematic 2d images, where irregulardetector edges and masking of contaminating sources compromise the powerspectrum estimates, but it can also be straightforwardly applied to 1d timinganalysis or 3d data cubes from numerical simulations.

1208.1612	contribution of the accretion disk, hot corona, and obscuring torus to  the luminosity of seyfert galaxies: integral and spitzer observations	we estimate the relative contributions of the supermassive black hole (smbh)accretion disk, corona, and obscuring torus to the bolometric luminosity ofseyfert galaxies, using spizter mid-infrared (mir) observations of a completesample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei from the integral all-sky hard x-ray(hx) survey. this is the first hx-selected (above 15 kev) sample of agns withcomplementary high angular resolution, high signal to noise, mir data.correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between hxand mir luminosities: l_mir l_hx^(0.74+/-0.06). assuming that the observed miremission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dustytorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (asinferred from the declining fraction of obscured agns), the intrinsic diskluminosity, l_d, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the coronain the 2-300 kev energy band, l_c, with the l_d/l_c ratio varying by a factorof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. this ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller thanfor typical quasars producing the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). therefore,over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, hx radiation carries a large, androughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of agns. we estimate thecumulative bolometric luminosity density of local agns at ~(1-3)x10^40erg/s/mpc^3. finally, the compton temperature ranges between kt_c~2 and ~6 kevfor nearby agns, compared to kt_c~2 kev for typical quasars, confirming thatradiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulatingsmbh growth.

1310.2173	long time-scale variability of x-ray binaries with late type giant  companions	in this paper we propose and examine a physical mechanism which can lead tothe generation of noise in the mass accretion rate of low mass x-ray binarieson time-scales comparable to the orbital period of the system. we considermodulations of mass captured by the compact object from the companion star'sstellar wind in binaries with late type giants, systems which usually have longorbital periods. we show that a hydrodynamical interaction of the wind matterwithin a binary system even without eccentricity results in variability of themass accretion rate with characteristic time-scales close to the orbitalperiod. the cause of the variability is an undeveloped turbulent motion(perturbed motion without significant vorticity) of wind matter near thecompact object. our conclusions are supported by 3d simulations with twodifferent hydrodynamic codes based on lagrangian and eulerian approaches -- thesph code gadget and the eulerian code pluto. in this work we assume that thewind mass loss rate of the secondary is at the level of $(0.5-1)\times10^{-7}m_\odot$/year, required to produce observable variations of the mass accretionrate on the primary. this value is higher than that, estimated for single giantstars of this type, but examples of even higher mass loss rate of late typegiants in binaries do exist. our simulations show that the stellar wind matterintercepted by the compact object might create observational appearancessimilar to that of an accretion disc corona/wind and could be detected via highenergy resolution observations of x-ray absorption lines, in particular, highlyionized ions of heavy elements.

astro-ph;0001450	frequency resolved spectroscopy of cyg x-1: fast variability of the  reflected emission in the soft state	using the rxte/pca data we study the fast variability of the reflectedemission in the soft spectral state of cyg x-1 by means of fourier frequencyresolved spectroscopy. we find that the rms amplitude of variations of thereflected emission has the same frequency dependence as the primary radiationdown to time scales of &lt;30-50 msec. this might indicate that the reflected fluxreproduces, with nearly flat response, variations of the primary emission. suchbehavior differs notably from the hard spectral state, in which variations ofthe reflected flux are significantly suppressed in comparison with the primaryemission, on time scales shorter than ~0.5-1 sec. if related to the finitelight crossing time of the reflector, these results suggest that thecharacteristic size of the reflector -- presumably an optically thick accretiondisk, in the hard spectral state is larger by a factor of &gt;5-10 than in thesoft spectral state. modeling the transfer function of the disk, we estimatethe inner radius of the accretion disk r_in~100r_g in the hard and r_in&lt;10r_gin the soft state for a 10m_sun black hole.

astro-ph;0006227	soft state of cygnus x-1: stable disk and unstable corona	two component x-ray spectra (soft multicolor black body plus harder powerlaw) are frequently observed from accreting black holes. these components arepresumably associated with the different parts of the accretion flow (opticallythick and optically thin respectively) in the vicinity of the compact source.most of the aperiodic variability of the x-ray flux on the short time scales isassociated with the harder component. we suggest that drastically differentamplitudes of variability of these two components are simply related to thevery different viscous time scales in the geometrically thin and geometricallythick parts of the accretion flow. in the geometrically thin disks variationsof viscosity or mass accretion rate occurring at large radius from the blackhole on the local dynamical or thermal time scales do not cause any significantvariations of the mass accretion rate at smaller radii due to a very longdiffusion time. any variations on the time scales shorter than the diffusiontime scale are effectively dampened. on the contrary such variations can easilysurvive in the geometrically thick flows and as a result the mass accretionrate in the innermost region of the flow will reflect modulations of the massaccretion rate added to the flow at any distance from the black hole. thereforeif primary instabilities operate on the short time scales then the stability ofthe soft component (originating from the geometrically thin and optically thickflow) and variability of the hard component (coming from the geometricallythick and optically thin flow) are naturally explained.

astro-ph;0109269	v4641sgr - super-eddington source enshrouded by an extended envelope	an optical spectroscopy of an unusual fast transient v4641 sgr constrains itsmass to 8.7-11.7m_sun (9.6m_sun is the best fit value) and the distance to7.4--12.3 kpc (orosz et al. 2001). at this distance the peak flux of 12 crab inthe 2--12 kev energy band, measured by asm/rxte, implies the x-ray luminosityexceeding 2-3e39 erg/s, i.e. near or above the eddington limit for a 9.6m_sunblack hole. an optical photometry shows that at the peak of the opticaloutburst the visual magnitude increased by delta m_v &gt; 4.7^m relative to thequiescent level and reached m_v &lt; 8.8^m. an assumption that this opticalemission is due to irradiated surface of an accretion disk or a companion starwith the the black body shape of the spectrum would mean that the bolometricluminosity of the system exceeds l&gt;3e41 erg/s &gt; 300 l_edd.  we argue that the optical data strongly suggest presence of an extendedenvelope surrounding the source which absorbs primary x-rays flux and reemitsit in optical and uv. the data also suggests that this envelope should beoptically thin in uv, euv and soft x-rays. the observed properties of v4641 sgrat the peak of an optical flare are very similar to those of ss433. thisenvelope is likely the result of near or super eddington rate of mass accretiononto the black hole and it vanishes during subsequent evolution of the sourcewhen apparent luminosity drops well below the eddington value. thus thistransient source provides us direct proof of the dramatic change in thecharacter of an accretion flow at the mass accretion rate near or above thecritical eddington value as predicted long time ago by the theoretical models.

astro-ph;0204132	super-eddington outburst of v4641 sgr	x-ray transients provide unique opportunity to probe accretion regimes of ata vastly different accretion rates. we analyze a collection of the rxteobservations (galactic center scans, asm monitoring and a pointed observation)of enigmatic transient source high mass x-ray binary v4641 sgr and argue thatthey broadly support the hypothesis that giant september 1999 outburst wasassociated with an episode of super-eddington accretion onto the black hole.during the outburst an extended optically thick envelope/outflow has beenformed around the source making the observational appearance of v4641 sgr inmany aspects very similar to that of ss433. these results suggest that objectslike v4641 sgr and ss433 indeed represent the class of objects accreting matterat a rate comparable or above eddington value and the formation of anenvelope/outflow is a generic characteristic of supercritical accretion.  when the accretion rate decreased the envelope vanished and the source shortterm variability and spectral properties started to resemble those of othergalactic black hole candidates accreting at a rate well below the eddingtonvalue. interestingly that during this phase the source spectrum was verysimilar to the cygnus x-1 spectrum in the low state inspite of more than orderof magnitude larger x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;0306569	the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background observed by rtxe/pca	we have analyzed a large set of rxte/pca scanning and slewing observationsperformed between april 1996 and march 1999. we obtained the 3-20 kev spectrumof the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) by subtracting earth-occulted observationsfrom observations of the x-ray sky at high galactic latitude and far away fromsources. the sky coverage is approximately ~22600 sq.deg. the pca spectrum ofcxb in 3-20 kev energy band is adequately approximated by a single power lawwith photon index gamma~1.4 and normalization at 1 kev ~9.5 phot/s/cm2/kev/sr.instrumental background uncertainty precludes accurate rxte/pca measurements ofthe spectrum of cosmic x-ray background at energies above 15 kev and thereforewe can not detect the high energy cutoff observed by heao-1 a2 experiment. deepobservations of the 6 high latitude points used to model the pca backgroundprovide a coarse measure of the spatial variation of the cxb. the cxbvariations are consistent with a fixed spectral shape and variablenormalization characterized by a fractional rms amplitude of ~7% on angularscales of ~1 square deg.

astro-ph;0312445	doppler broadening of the iron line and r-gamma correlation in black  hole binaries	rxte/pca observations of several black hole x-ray binaries in the lowspectral state revealed a tight correlation between spectral parameters andcharacteristic frequencies of variability of x-ray flux. in particular, theamplitude of reflection increases and the slope of comptonized radiationsteepens as the noise frequencies increase. the data also suggest that there isa correlated increase of the width of the fe fluorescent line, probably relatedto the doppler broadening of the reflection features. moreover, the width ofthe line seems to follow deltae/e ~ nu_qpo^{1/3} law. if confirmed with higherenergy resolution observations, this result will have significant impact on themodels of the accretion flow and on our understanding of the nature ofcharacteristic frequencies of variability in x-ray binaries. in particular, itwill lend support to the truncated disk picture, confirming that the spectralvariations are indeed related to changes of the position of the inner diskboundary and that characteristic variability frequencies are proportional tothe keplerian frequency at the inner boundary of the accretion disk.

astro-ph;0411351	positron annihilation spectrum from the galactic center region observed  by spi/integral	the electron-positron annihilation spectrum observed by spi/integral duringdeep galactic center region exposure is reported. the line energy(510.954$\pm$0.075 kev) is consistent with the unshifted annihilation line. thewidth of the annihilation line is 2.37$\pm$0.25 kev (fwhm), while the strengthof the ortho-positronium continuum suggests that the dominant fraction ofpositrons (94$\pm$6%) form positronium before annihilation. compared to theprevious missions these deep integral observations provide the most stringentconstraints on the line energy and width.  under the assumption of an annihilation in a single-phase medium thesespectral parameters can be explained by a warm $t_e\sim 7000-4~10^4$ k gas withthe degree of ionization larger than a few $10^{-2}$. one of the wide-spreadism phases - warm ($t_e \sim 8000$ k) and weakly ionized (degree of ionization$\sim$ 0.1) medium satisfies these criteria. other single-phase solutions arealso formally allowed by the data (e.g. cold, but substantially ionized ism),but such solutions are believed to be astrophysically unimportant.  the observed spectrum can also be explained by the annihilation in amulti-phase ism. the fraction of positrons annihilating in a very hot ($t_e \ge10^6$ k) phase is constrained to be less than $\sim$8%. neither a moderatelyhot ($t_e \ge 10^5$ k) ionized medium nor a very cold ($t_e \le 10^3$ k)neutral medium can make a dominant contribution to the observed annihilationspectrum. however, a combination of cold/neutral, warm/neutral and warm/ionizedphases in comparable proportions could also be consistent with the data.

astro-ph;0501516	broad band variability of ss433: accretion disk at work?	we present broad band power spectra of variations of ss433 in radio, opticaland x-ray spectral bands. we show that at frequencies lower than 1e-5 hz thesource demonstrates the same variability pattern in all these bands. the broadband power spectrum can be fitted by one power law down to frequencies ~1e-7 hzwith flattening afterwards. such a flattening means that on time scales longerthan ~1e7 sec the source variability becomes uncorrelated. this naturally leadsto the appearance of quasi-poissonian flares in the source light curve, whichhave been regularly observed in radio and optical spectral bands. the radioflux power spectrum appears to have a second break at fourier frequencies ~1e-5hz which can be caused by the smearing of the intrinsic radio variability ontimescale of the light-crossing time of the radio emitting region. we find acorrelation of the radio and optical fluxes of ss433 and the radio flux isdelayed by about ~2 days with respect to the optical one. power spectra ofoptical and x-ray variabilities continue with the same power law from 1e-7 hzup to ~0.01-0.05 hz. the broad band power spectrum of ss433 can be interpretedin terms of self-similar accretion rate modulations in the accretion diskproposed by lyubarskii (1997) and elaborated by churazov et al.

astro-ph;0506019	boundary layer emission and z-track in the color-color diagram of  luminous lmxbs	we demonstrate that fourier-frequency resolved spectra of atoll and z-sources are identical, despite significant difference in their average spectraand luminosity (by a factor of ~10-20). this result fits in the picture wesuggested earlier, namely that the f&gt; 1 hz variability in luminous lmxbs isprimarily due to variations of the boundary layer luminosity. in this picturethe frequency resolved spectrum equals the boundary layer spectrum, whichtherefore can be straightforwardly determnined from the data. the obtained soboundary layer spectrum is well approximated by the saturated comptonizationmodel, its high energy cut-off follows kt~2.4 kev black body. its independenceon the global mass accretion rate lends support to the theoretical suggestionby inogamov &amp;sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressuresupported. with this assumption we constrain the gravity on the neutron starsurface and its mass and radius. equipped with the knowledge of the boundarylayer spectrum we attempt to relate the motion along the z-track to changes ofphysically meaningful parameters. our results suggest that the contribution ofthe boundary layer to the observed emission decreases along the z-track fromconventional ~50% on the horizontal branch to a rather small number on thenormal branch. this decrease can be caused, for example, by obscuration of theboundary layer by the geometrically thick accretion disk at mdot ~ mdot_edd.alternatively, this can indicate significant change of the structure of theaccretion flow at mdot ~ mdot_ edd and disappearance of the boundary layer as adistinct region of the significant energy release associated with the neutronstar surface.

astro-ph;0510049	x-ray luminosity function of faint point sources in the milky way	we assess the contribution to the x-ray (above 2 kev) luminosity of the milkyway from different classes of low-mass binary systems and single stars. webegin by using the rxte slew survey of the sky at |b|&gt;10 to construct an x-rayluminosity function (xlf) of nearby x-ray sources in the range10^30&lt;lx(erg/s)&lt;10^34 (where lx is the luminosity over 2-10 kev), occupied bycoronally active binaries (abs) and cataclysmic variables (cvs). we then extendthis xlf down to lx~10^27.5 erg/s using the rosat all-sky survey in soft x-raysand available information on the 0.1-10 kev spectra of typical sources. we findthat the local cumulative x-ray (2-10 kev) emissivities (per unit stellar mass)of abs and cvs are (2.0+/-0.8)x10^27 and (1.1+/-0.3)x10^27 erg/s/msol,respectively. in addition to abs and cvs, representing old stellar populations,young stars emit locally (1.5+/-0.4)x10^27 erg/s/msol. we finally attach to thexlf of abs and cvs a high luminosity branch (up to ~10^39 erg/s) composed ofneutron-star and black-hole low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), derived inprevious work. the combined xlf covers ~12 orders of magnitude in luminosity.the estimated combined contribution of abs and cvs to the 2-10 kev luminosityof the milky way is ~2x10^38 erg/s, or ~3% of the integral luminosity of lmxbs(averaged over nearby galaxies). the xlf obtained in this work is usedelsewhere (revnivtsev et al.) to assess the contribution of point sources tothe galactic ridge x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0510050	origin of the galactic ridge x-ray emission	we analyze a map of the galactic ridge x-ray emission (grxe) constructed inthe 3-20 kev energy band from rxte/pca scan and slew observations. we show thatthe grxe intensity closely follows the galactic near-infrared surfacebrightness and thus traces the galactic stellar mass distribution. the grxeconsists of two spatial components which can be identified with the bulge/barand the disk of the galaxy. the parameters of these components determined fromx-ray data are compatible with those derived from near-infrared data. theinferred ratio of x-ray to near-infrared surface brightness i(3-20 kev) (1e-11erg/s/cm2/deg2)/i_(3.5micron)(mjy/sr)=0.26+/-0.05, and the ratio of x-ray tonear-infrared luminosity l_(3-20 kev)/l_(3-4 micron)=(4.1+/-0.3)e-5. thecorresponding ratio of the 3-20 kev luminosity to the stellar mass isl_x/m_sun=  (3.5\pm0.5) 10^{27} erg/s, which agrees within the uncertainties with thecumulative emissivity per unit stellar mass of point x-ray sources in the solarneighborhood, determined in an accompanying paper (sazonov et al.). thissuggests that the bulk of the grxe is composed of weak x-ray sources, mostlycataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries. the fractionalcontributions of these classes of sources to the total x-ray emissivitydetermined from the solar neighborhood data can also explain the grxe energyspectrum. based on the luminosity function of local x-ray sources we predictthat in order to resolve 90% of the grxe into discrete sources a sensitivitylimit of ~10^{-16} erg/s/cm2 (2--10 kev) will need to be reached in futureobservations.

astro-ph;0512361	boundary layer emission in luminous lmxbs	we show that aperiodic and quasiperiodic variability of bright lmxbs - atolland z- sources, on ~sec - msec time scales is caused primarily by variations ofthe boundary layer luminosity. the accretion disk emission is less variable onthese time scales and its power density follows 1/f law, contributing toobserved flux variation at low frequencies and low energies only. the khz qposhave the same origin as variability at lower frequencies - independent of thenature of the "clock", the actual luminosity modulation takes place on the nssurface. the boundary layer spectrum remains nearly constant during luminosityvariations and can be represented by the fourier frequency resolved spectrum.in the range of mdot~(0.1-1)*mdot_edd it depends weakly on the global massaccretion rate and in the limit mdot~mdot_edd is close to wien spectrum withkt~2.4 kev. its independence on the mdot lends support to the suggestion byinogamov &amp; sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressuresupported.  based on the knowledge of the boundary layer spectrum we attempt to relatethe motion along the z-track to changes of physically meaningful parameters.our results suggest that the contribution of the boundary layer to the observedemission decreases along the z-track from conventional ~50% on the horizontalbranch to a rather small number on the normal branch. this decrease can becaused, for example, by obscuration of the boundary layer by the geometricallythickened accretion disk at mdot~mdot_edd. alternatively, this can indicatesignificant change of the structure of the accretion flow at mdot~mdot_edd anddisappearance of the boundary layer as a distinct region of the significantenergy release associated with the ns surface.

astro-ph;0701836	integral/ibis all-sky survey in hard x-rays	we present results of an all-sky hard x-ray survey based on almost four yearsof observations with the ibis telescope on board the integral observatory. thedead time-corrected exposure of the survey is ~33 ms. approximately 12% and 80%of the sky have been covered to limiting fluxes lower than 1 and 5 mcrab,respectively. our catalog of detected sources includes 400 objects, 339 ofwhich exceed a 5 sigma detection threshold on the time-averaged map of the skyand the rest were detected in various subsamples of exposures. among theidentified sources, 213 are galactic (87 low-mass x-ray binaries, 74 high-massx-ray binaries, 21 cataclysmic variables, 6 coronally active stars, and othertypes) and 136 are extragalactic, including 131 active galactic nuclei (agns)and 3 clusters of galaxies. we obtained number-flux functions for agns andgalactic sources. the logn-logs relation of agns (excluding blazars) is basedon 69 sources with fluxes higher than s_lim=1.1 x 10^{-11} erg/s/cm^2 (~0.8mcrab) in the 17-60 kev energy band. the cumulative number-flux function ofagns located at galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;5^\circ$, where the survey ischaracterized by high identification completeness, can be described by a powerlaw with a slope of 1.62 +/- 0.15 and normalization of (5.7 +/- 0.7) x 10^{-3}sources per deg^2 at fluxes &gt;1.43 x 10^{-11} erg/s/cm^2 (&gt;1 mcrab). agns withfluxes higher than s_lim make up ~1% of the cosmic x-ray background at 17-60kev. we present evidence of strong inhomogeneity in the spatial distribution ofnearby (&lt;70 mpc) agns, which reflects the large-scale structure in the localuniverse.

astro-ph;0702578	x-ray emission from the stellar population in m32	using chandra observations, we study the x-ray emission of the stellarpopulation in the compact dwarf elliptical galaxy m32. the proximity of m32allows one to resolve all bright point sources with luminosities higher than8e33 erg/s in the 0.5--7 kev band. the remaining (unresolved) emission closelyfollows the galaxy's optical light and is characterized by an emissivity perunit stellar mass of ~4.3e27 erg/s/m_sun in the 2--10 kev energy band. thespectrum of the unresolved emission above a few kev smoothly joins the x-rayspectrum of the milky way's ridge measured with rxte and integral. theseresults strongly suggest that weak discrete x-ray sources (accreting whitedwarfs and active binary stars) provide the bulk of the ``diffuse'' emission ofthis gas-poor galaxy. within the uncertainties, the average x-ray properties ofthe m32 stars are consistent with those of the old stellar population in themilky way. the inferred cumulative soft x-ray (0.5--2 kev) emissivity ishowever smaller than is measured in the immediate solar vicinity in our galaxy.this difference is probably linked to the contribution of young (age &lt;1gyr)stars, which are abundant in the solar neighborhood but practically absent inm32. combining chandra, rxte and integral data, we obtain a broad-band (0.5--60kev) x-ray spectrum of the old stellar population in galaxies.

astro-ph;9804173	rxte broad band observations of x-ray nova xte j1755-324	the properties of x-ray nova xte j1755-324, observed with rxte and granatobservatories in 1997 are reported. the lightcurve of the source was typicalfor x-ray novae, except for somewhat shorter decay time scale and the timeelapsed between primary and subsequent secondary and tertiary outbursts. at thepeak of the lightcurve the source had two-component spectrum, typical for thebright x-ray novae, with disk blackbody temperature tin~0.8 kev and photonindex of the hard power law tail \alpha~ 2.0. the peak luminosity can beestimated as l~10^{38} erg/s (0.1-100 kev, assuming 8.5 kpc distance). anotable and peculiar feature of the spectral evolution of the source was ashort, ~10 days long, episode of increased hardness, occurred shortly beforethe tertiary maximum of the light curve. during the last pointed observations~100 days after the primary outburst the source has been found in the hardspectral state with luminosity ~fewx10^{36} erg/s. the overall pattern of thetemporal and spectral evolution of xte j1755-324 resemble in general that of``canonical'' x-ray novae (e.g. nova muscae 1991) and suggests that the compactobject in the binary system is a black hole

astro-ph;9805152	the millisecond x-ray pulsar/burster sax j1808.4-3658: the outburst  light curve and the power law spectrum	the x-ray light curve and broad band spectral properties of the millisecondx-ray pulsar/burster sax j1808.4-3658 are reported. in the course of rxteobservations in april--may 1998 the 3--150 kev luminosity of the sourcedecreased by a factor of ~100 from the peak value of ~9e36 erg/s (for a 4 kpcdistance). however, the spectrum was remarkably stable and maintained a roughlypower law shape with a photon index of ~2 without a strong high energy cut-offbelow 100 kev, similar to that sometimes observed in the low spectral state ofx-ray bursters. an approximation of the averaged spectrum with an exponentiallycut-off power law with a superimposed reflected component yields the 90% lowerlimit on the e-folding energy ~270 kev. we speculate that comptonization on thebulk motion in the radiation dominated shock might be a possible mechanism ofspectral formation. the decaying part of the x-ray light curve was cut offabruptly at luminosity ~few 1e35 erg/s. such behavior might be due tocentrifugal inhibition of accretion (transition to the ``propeller'' regime) aswell as to disk instability. in either case an upper limit on the neutron starmagnetic field strength is b &lt; few 1e7 gauss.

astro-ph;9808211	sigma and xte observations of the soft x-ray transient xtej1755-324	we present observations of the x-ray transient xtej1755-324 performed duringsummer 1997 with the xte satellite and with the sigma hard x-ray telescopeonboard the granat observatory. the source was first detected in soft x-rayswith xte on july 25 1997 with a rather soft x-ray spectrum and its outburst wasmonitored in soft x-rays up to november 1997. on september 16 it was firstdetected in hard x-rays by the french soft gamma ray telescope sigma during agalactic center observation. the flux was stronger on september 16 and 17reaching a level of about 110 mcrab in the 40-80 kev energy band. on the samedays the photon index of the spectrum was determined to be alpha =-2.3 +/- 0.9(1 sigma error) while the 40-150 kev luminosity was about 8 x 10^{36} erg/s fora distance of 8.5 kpc. sigma and xte results on this source indicate that thissource had an ultrasoft-like state during its main outburst and a hardersecondary outburst in september. these characteristics make the source similarto x-nova muscae 1991, a well known black hole candidate.

astro-ph;9812186	restrictions on the parameters of boundary layer and accretion disk of  x-ray bursters in the low state	using asca observations of several x-ray bursters in the low spectral statelx~1-5x10^{36} erg/s) restrictions on the parameters of the accretion disk andthe boundary layer were obtained. the low state spectra of x-ray burstersobserved with asca often can be well described by a power law with photon indexof 1.7--2.2 and are not consistent with significant contribution of the softspectral component to the total luminosity. for a blackbody spectrum withtemperature of 0.2--2 kev the upper limits correspond to &lt;10--20% of the total0.5--10 kev luminosity. on the other hand, theoretical calculations predictthat in the case of a keplerian accretion disk around a slowly rotating neutronstar (with radius of 3rg) ~2/3 of the total gravitational energy released inthe system can be released in the boundary layer between the inner part of theaccretion disk and the neutron star surface.  more accurate analysis of the asca spectra shows that:  (1) the inner radius of the standard geometrically thin optically thick partof the accretion disk exceeds $r_{in} &gt; 10-25 r_g$.  (2) the characteristic temperature in the inner part of the accretion flowincluding the boundary layer exceeds $\sim$2 kev independently upon theassumption about the density in the accretion flow. the electron scatteringgives the dominant contribution to the opacity in this region.

astro-ph;9906198	frequency resolved spectroscopy of cyg x-1: fast variability of the fe  k_alpha line	we studied the frequency resolved energy spectra of cyg x--1 during thestandard low (hard) spectral state using the data of the rossi x-ray timingexplorer. we found that the relative amplitude of the reflection features --the iron fluorescent line at ~6.5 kev and the smeared edge above ~7 kev --decreases with the increasing frequency. in particular we found that theequivalent width of the iron line decreases above ~1 hz and drops twice atfrequency of ~10 hz.  an assumption that such behavior is solely due to a finite light crossingtime of the reflecting media, would imply the characteristic size of thereflector ~5e8 cm, corresponding to ~150 rg for a 10msun black hole.alternatively lack of high frequency oscillations of the reflected componentmay indicate that the short time scale, ~50-100 msec, variations of the primarycontinuum appear in geometrically different, likely inner, part of theaccretion flow and give a rise to a significantly weaker, if any, reflectedemission than the longer time scale events.

astro-ph;9910084	reflection and noise in cygnus x-1	we analyzed rxte/pca observations of cyg x-1 from 1996-1998. we found a tightcorrelation between the characteristic noise frequencies (e.g. the breakfrequency nu_br) and the spectral parameters in the low spectral state. theamplitude of reflection increases and the spectrum of primary radiationsteepens as the noise frequency increases (nu_br changes by a factor of ~15 inour sample). this can be understood assuming that increase of the noisefrequency is associated with the shift of the inner boundary of the opticallythick accretion disk towards the compact object. the related increase of thesolid angle, subtended by the disk, and of the influx of the soft photons tothe comptonization region lead to an increase of the amount of reflection andsteepening of the comptonized spectrum. the correlation between the slope ofprimary radiation and the amplitude of reflection extends to the soft spectralstate. a similar correlation between reflection and slope was found for thefrequency resolved spectra in the 0.01-15 hz frequency range. such acorrelation could appear if the longer time scale variations are associatedwith emission originating closer to the optically thick disk and, therefore,having steeper comptonized spectra with larger reflection.
