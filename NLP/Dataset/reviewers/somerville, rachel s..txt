0812.5111	biases and uncertainties in physical parameter estimates of lyman break  galaxies from broad-band photometry	we investigate the biases and uncertainties in estimates of physicalparameters of high-redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs), such as stellar mass,mean stellar population age, and star formation rate (sfr), obtained frombroad-band photometry. by combining lcdm hierarchical structure formationtheory, semi-analytic treatments of baryonic physics, and stellar populationsynthesis models, we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select lbgsat redshifts z ~ 3.4, 4.0, and 5.0. the broad-band spectral energydistributions (seds) of these model lbgs are then analysed by fitting galaxytemplate seds derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothlydeclining sfrs. we compare the statistical properties of lbgs' physicalparameters -- such as stellar mass, sfr, and stellar population age -- asderived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from thesemi-analytic model. we find some trends in these distributions: first, whenthe redshift is known, sed-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions oflbgs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimatethe masses overall, but with substantial scatter. second, there are largesystematic biases in the distributions of best-fit sfrs and mean ages, in thesense that single-component sed-fitting methods underestimate sfrs andoverestimate ages. we attribute these trends to the different star formationhistories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxytemplates used in sed-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from thecurrent generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. thesebiases, which arise from the sed-fitting procedure, can significantly affectinferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.

0901.1130	the many manifestations of downsizing: hierarchical galaxy formation  models confront observations	[abridged] it has been widely claimed that several lines of observationalevidence point towards a "downsizing" (ds) of the process of galaxy formationover cosmic time. this behavior is sometimes termed "anti-hierarchical", andcontrasted with the "bottom-up" assembly of the dark matter structures in colddark matter models. in this paper we address three different kinds ofobservational evidence that have been described as ds: the stellar massassembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in localgalaxies. we compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with thepredictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation withinthe lambda-cdm framework. in the data, we see only weak evidence at best of dsin stellar mass and in star formation rate. we find that, when observationalerrors on stellar mass and sfr are taken into account, the models acceptablyreproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift rangethat we consider. however, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in themodels and are too passive at late times. thus, the models do not correctlyreproduce the ds trend in stellar mass or the archaeological ds, while theyqualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the sfr. we demonstratethat these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellitegalaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation ofcentral galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities ~100-200km/s.

0901.4111	the effects of gas on morphological transformation in mergers:  implications for bulge and disk demographics	transformation of disks into spheroids via mergers is a well-accepted elementof galaxy formation models. however, recent simulations have shown that bulgeformation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. we investigate theglobal implications of these results in a cosmological framework, usingindependent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies arepopulated in halos according to observations) and semi-analytic models. inboth, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production ofspheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to bebulge-dominated (b/t~0.5 at &lt;10^10 m_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),even if they have avoided major mergers. including the different physicalbehavior of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulgeformation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (givingb/t~0.1 at &lt;10^10 m_sun, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreementwith observations). simulations and analytic models which neglect thesimilarity-breaking behavior of gas have difficulty reproducing the strongobserved morphology-mass relation. however, the observed dependence of gasfractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-richmergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. discrepancies betweenobservations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; inmodels that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be lessbulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. wediscuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observationaltests.

0902.3465	the effect of dry mergers on the color-magnitude relation	we investigate the effect of gas-poor (so-called "dry") mergers on thecolor-magnitude relation (cmr) of early-type galaxies through a simple toymodel and compare with low-z observations from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). the observed red sequence shows a tilt towards bluer colors and adecrease in scatter at the bright end. these characteristics are predicted byour model, based on merger trees from a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation. we assume galaxies move onto a "creation red sequence" when theyundergo major gas-rich mergers. subsequent dry mergers move galaxies along therelation by increasing their mass, but also make them slightly bluer. thisoccurs because bright galaxies are most likely to merge with one of the morenumerous fainter and consequently bluer galaxies that lie further down therelation. bright galaxies undergo a higher fraction of dry mergers than faintgalaxies, which causes a change in the slope of the cmr. a more realistic modelthat includes scatter in the initial relation shows that dry merging causes atightening of the cmr towards the bright end. the small scatter in the observedcmr thus cannot be used to argue against significant mass growth from drymerging.

0903.3700	history of galaxy interactions and their impact on star formation over  the last 7 gyr from gems	we perform a comprehensive estimate of the frequency of galaxy mergers andtheir impact on star formation over z~0.24--0.80 (lookback time t_b~3--7 gyr)using 3698 (m*&gt;=1e9 msun) galaxies with gems hst, combo-17, and spitzer data.our results are: (1) among 790 high mass (m*&gt;=2.5e10 msun) galaxies, thevisually-based merger fraction over z~0.24--0.80, ranges from 9%+-5% to 8%+-2%.lower limits on the major and minor merger fractions over this interval rangefrom 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. this is the firstapproximate empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers at z&lt;1. for avisibility timescale of ~0.5 gyr, it follows that over t_b~3--7 gyr, ~68% ofhigh mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio &gt;1/10, with ~16%, 45%,and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous`major or minor' mergers. the mean merger rate is a few x 1e-4 gyr-1 mpc-3. (2)we compare the empirical merger fraction and rate for high mass galaxies to asuite of lambda cdm-based models: halo occupation distribution models,semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic sph simulations. we find qualitativeagreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) mergerfraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show afactor of five dispersion. near-future improvements can now start to rule outcertain merger scenarios. (3) among ~3698 m*&gt;=1e9 msun galaxies, we find thatthe mean sfr of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared tonon-interacting galaxies over z~0.24--0.80. visibly merging systems onlyaccount for less than 30% of the cosmic sfr density over t_b~3--7 gyr. thissuggests that the behavior of the cosmic sfr density over the last 7 gyr ispredominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies.

0903.4681	luminosity function and radial distribution of milky way satellites in a  lcdm universe	we study the luminosity function and the radial distribution of satellitegalaxies within milky way sized haloes as predicted in cold dark matter basedmodels of galaxy formation, making use of numerical n-body techniques as wellas three different semi-analytic model (sams) galaxy formation codes. weextract merger trees from very high-resolution dissipationless simulations offour galaxy-sized dm haloes, and use these as common input for thesemi-analytic models. we present a detailed comparison of our predictions withthe observational data recently obtained on the milky way satellite luminosityfunction (lf). we find that semi-analytic models with rather standardastrophysical ingredients are able to reproduce the observed luminosityfunction over six orders of magnitude in luminosity, down to magnitudes asfaint as m_v=-2. we also perform a comparison with the actual observed numberof satellites as a function of luminosity, by applying the selection criteriaof the sdss survey to our simulations instead of correcting the observationsfor incompleteness. using this approach we again find good agreement for boththe luminosity and radial distributions of mw satellites. we investigate whichphysical processes in our models are responsible for shaping the predictedsatellite lf, and find that tidal destruction, suppression of gas infall by aphoto-ionizing background, and supernova feedback all make importantcontributions. we conclude that the number and luminosity of milky waysatellites can be naturally accounted for within the (lambda) cold dark matterparadigm, and this should no longer be considered a problem.

0903.4682	constraints on the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass at  low and high redshift	we use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between thestellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in whichthey reside. we obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (shm) relation bypopulating halos and subhalos in an n-body simulation with galaxies andrequiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. we find goodagreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions ofsemi-analytic models. using this mapping, and the positions of the halos andsubhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions forthe galaxy two-point correlation function (cf) as a function of stellar massare in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the sdssat z=0. we show that the clustering data do not provide additional strongconstraints on the shm function and conclude that our model can thereforepredict clustering as a function of stellar mass. we compute the conditionalmass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar massesin the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass m. we study the redshiftdependence of the shm relation and show that, for low mass halos, the shm ratiois lower at higher redshift. the derived shm relation is used to predict thestellar mass dependent galaxy cf and bias at high redshift. our model predictsthat not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at allredshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift formassive galaxies than for low mass ones. we present convenient fittingfunctions for the shm relation as a function of redshift, the conditional massfunction, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.

0905.1144	gev gamma-ray attenuation and the high-redshift uv background	we present new calculations of the evolving uv background out to the epoch ofcosmological reionization and make predictions for the amount of gev gamma-rayattenuation by electron-positron pair production. our results are based onrecent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, which provide predictions ofthe dust-extinguished uv radiation field due to starlight, and empiricalestimates of the contribution due to quasars. we account for the reprocessingof ionizing photons by the intergalactic medium. we test whether our models canreproduce estimates of the ionizing background at high redshift from fluxdecrement analysis and proximity effect measurements from quasar spectra, andidentify a range of models that can satisfy these constraints. pair-productionagainst soft diffuse photons leads to a spectral cutoff feature for gamma raysobserved between 10 and 100 gev. this cutoff varies with redshift and theassumed star formation and quasar evolution models. we find only negligibleamounts of absorption for gamma rays observed below 10 gev for any emissionredshift. with observations of high-redshift sources in sufficient numbers bythe fermi gamma-ray space telescope and new ground-based instruments it shouldbe possible to constrain the extragalactic background light in the uv andoptical portion of the spectrum.

0905.4189	galactic chemical evolution in hierarchical formation models - i.  early-type galaxies in the local universe	we study the metallicities and abundance ratios of early-type galaxies incosmological semi-analytic models (sams) within the hierarchical galaxyformation paradigm. to achieve this we implemented a detailed galactic chemicalevolution (gce) model and can now predict abundances of individual elements forthe galaxies in the semi-analytic simulations. this is the first time a samwith feedback from active galactic nuclei (agn) has included a chemicalevolution prescription that relaxes the instantaneous recycling approximation.we find that the new models are able to reproduce the observed mass-metallicity(m*-[z/h]) relation and, for the first time in a sam, we reproduce the observedpositive slope of the mass-abundance ratio (m*-[$alpha$/fe]) relation. ourresults indicate that in order to simultaneously match these observations ofearly-type galaxies, the use of both a very mildly top-heavy imf (i.e., with aslope of x=1.15 as opposed to a standard x=1.3), and a lower fraction ofbinaries that explode as type ia supernovae appears to be required. we alsoexamine the rate of supernova explosions in the simulated galaxies. inearly-type (non-star forming) galaxies, our predictions are also consistentwith the observed sne rates. however, in star-forming galaxies, a higherfraction of sn ia binaries than in our preferred model is required to match thedata. if, however, we deviate from the classical model and introduce apopulation of sne ia with very short delay times, our models simultaneouslyproduce a good match to the observed metallicities, abundance ratios and snrates.

0905.4525	the effect of dry mergers on the color-magnitude relation of early-type  galaxies	we investigate the effect of dry merging on the color-magnitude relation(cmr) of galaxies and find that the amount of merging predicted by ahierarchical model results in a red sequence that compares well with theobserved low-redshift relation. a sample of 29,000 early-type galaxies selectedfrom the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 shows that the bright end ofthe cmr has a shallower slope and smaller scatter than the faint end. thismagnitude dependence is predicted by a simple toy model in which gas-richmergers move galaxies onto a "creation red sequence" (crs) by quenching theirstar formation, and subsequent mergers between red, gas-poor galaxies(so-called "dry" mergers) move galaxies along the relation. we use galaxymerger trees from a semianalytic model of galaxy formation to test theamplitude of this effect and find a change in slope at the bright end thatbrackets the observations, using gas fraction thresholds of 10-30% to separatewet and dry mergers. a more realistic model that includes scatter in the crsshows that dry merging decreases the scatter at the bright end. contrary toprevious claims, the small scatter in the observed cmr thus cannot be used toconstrain the amount of dry merging.

0906.0764	can gas prevent the destruction of thin stellar discs by minor mergers?	we study the effect of dissipational gas physics on the vertical heating andthickening of disc galaxies during minor mergers. we produce a suite of minormerger simulations for milky way-like galaxies. this suite consists ofcollisionless simulations as well as hydrodynamical runs including a gaseouscomponent in the galactic disc. we find that in dissipationless simulationsminor mergers cause the scale height of the disc to increase by up to a factorof ~2. when the presence of gas in the disc is taken into account thisthickening is reduced by 25% (50%) for an initial disc gas fraction of 20%(40%), leading to a final scale height z0 between 0.6 and 0.7 kpc, regardlessof the initial scale height. we argue that the presence of gas reduces discheating via two mechanisms: absorption of kinetic impact energy by the gasand/or formation of a new thin stellar disc that can cause heated stars torecontract towards the disc plane. we show that in our simulations most of thegas is consumed during the merger and thus the regrowth of a new thin disc hasa negligible impact on the z0 of the post merger galaxy. final disc scaleheights found in our simulations are in good agreement with studies of thevertical structure of spiral galaxies where the majority of the systems arefound to have scale heights of 0.4 kpc &lt; z0 &lt; 0.8 kpc. we also found no tensionbetween recent measurements of the scale height of the milky way thin disc andresults coming from our hydrodynamical simulations. we conclude that theexistence of a thin disc in the milky way and in external galaxies is not inobvious conflict with the predictions of the cdm model.

0907.3728	less than 10 percent of star formation in z=0.6 massive galaxies is  triggered by major interactions	both observations and simulations show that major tidal interactions ormergers between gas-rich galaxies can lead to intense bursts of starformation.yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (sfr) in major mergers andthe contribution of such events to the cosmic sfr are not well estimated. herewe use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and uv sfrs from combo-17, 24micron sfrs from spitzer and morphologies from two deep hst cosmological surveyfields (ecdfs/gems and a901/stages) to study the enhancement in sfr as afunction of projected galaxy separation. we apply two-point projectedcorrelation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selectedvery close pairs (separation &lt;2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the hstimaging. our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems areindeed interacting or merging. yet, for massive (m* &gt; 10^10 msun) star-forminggalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8, we find that the sfrs of galaxies undergoing a majorinteraction (mass ratios &lt;1:4 and separations &lt; 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30times higher than the sfrs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over allinteractions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with otherobservational works.  we demonstrate that these results imply that &lt;10% of star formation at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these eventsare not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.

1001.1737	a cosmic variance cookbook	deep pencil beam surveys (&lt;1 deg^2) are of fundamental importance forstudying the high-redshift universe. however, inferences about galaxypopulation properties are in practice limited by 'cosmic variance'. this is theuncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxiesarising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. this source ofuncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only smallareas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. cosmic variance for a givengalaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark mattertheory and the galaxy bias. in this paper we provide tools for experimentdesign and interpretation. for a given survey geometry we present the cosmicvariance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z and redshift bin sizedz. using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive thegalaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a givenstellar mass range. in the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxysamples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance.we present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic varianceas a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z, dz and stellar massm*. we also provide tabulated values and a software tool. we find that forgoods at z=2 and with dz=0.5 the relative cosmic variance of galaxies withm*&gt;10^11 msun is ~38%, while it is ~27% for gems and ~12% for cosmos. forgalaxies of m*~10^10 msun the relative cosmic variance is ~19% for goods, ~13%for gems and ~6% for cosmos. this implies that cosmic variance is a significantsource of uncertainty at z=2 for small fields and massive galaxies, while forlarger fields and intermediate mass galaxies cosmic variance is less serious.

1006.5717	the dependence of agn activity on stellar and halo mass in semi-analytic  models	agn feedback is believed to play an important role in shaping a variety ofobserved galaxy properties, as well as the evolution of their stellar massesand star formation rates. in particular, in the current theoretical paradigm ofgalaxy formation, agn feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulatingthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at lowredshift. only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical informationon the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass andhierarchy has become available. in this paper, we compare the fractions ofgalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, agn and radioactive) with predictions from four different and independently developedsemi-analytical models. we adopt empirical relations to convert physicalproperties into observables (h_alpha emission lines, oiii line strength andradio power). we demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce theoverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as afunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongestradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-massgalaxies/halos respectively. however, model predictions differ fromobservational measurements in a number of ways. all models used in our studypredict that almost every &gt;1.e12 msun dark matter halo and/or &gt;1.e11 msungalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction ofgalaxies belong to this class in the data. in addition, radio brightness isexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,while strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.our results highlight that the distribution of agn as a function of stellarmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gasaccretion schemes.

1010.1966	improving the estimation of star formation rates and stellar population  ages of high-redshift galaxies from broadband photometry	we explore methods to improve the estimates of star formation rates and meanstellar population ages from broadband photometry of high redshift star-forminggalaxies. we use synthetic spectral templates with a variety of simpleparametric star formation histories to fit broadband spectral energydistributions. these parametric models are used to infer ages, star formationrates and stellar masses for a mock data set drawn from a hierarchicalsemi-analytic model of galaxy evolution. traditional parametric modelsgenerally assume an exponentially declining rate of star-formation after aninitial instantaneous rise. our results show that star formation histories witha much more gradual rise in the star formation rate are likely to be bettertemplates, and are likely to give better overall estimates of the agedistribution and star formation rate distribution of lyman break galaxies. forb- and v-dropouts, we find the best simple parametric model to be one where thestar formation rate increases linearly with time. the exponentially-decliningmodel overpredicts the age by 100 % and 120 % for b- and v-dropouts, onaverage, while for a linearly-increasing model, the age is overpredicted by 9 %and 16 %, respectively. similarly, the exponential model underpredictsstar-formation rates by 56 % and 60 %, while the linearly-increasing modelunderpredicts by 15 % 22 %, respectively. for u-dropouts, the models where thestar-formation rate has a peak (near z ~ 3) provide the best match for age --overprediction is reduced from 110 % to 26 % -- and star-formation rate --underprediction is reduced from 58 % to 22 %. we classify different types ofstar-formation histories in the semi-analytic models and show how the biasesbehave for the different classes. we also provide two-band calibration formulaefor stellar mass and star formation rate estimations.

1104.0246	the effects of a hot gaseous halo in galaxy major mergers	cosmological hydrodynamical simulations as well as observations indicate thatspiral galaxies are comprised of five different components: dark matter halo,stellar disc, stellar bulge, gaseous disc and gaseous halo. while the firstfour components have been extensively considered in numerical simulations ofbinary galaxy mergers, the effect of a hot gaseous halo has usually beenneglected even though it can contain up to 80% of the total gas within thegalaxy virial radius. we present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of majormergers of disc galaxies, that for the first time include a diffuse, rotating,hot gaseous halo. through cooling and accretion, the hot halo can dissipate andrefuel the cold gas disc before and after a merger. this cold gas cansubsequently form stars, thus impacting the morphology and kinematics of theremnant. simulations of isolated systems with total mass m~10^12msun show anearly constant star formation rate of ~5msun/yr if the hot gaseous halo isincluded, while the star formation rate declines exponentially if it isneglected. we conduct a detailed study of the star formation efficiency duringmergers and find that the presence of a hot gaseous halo reduces the starburstefficiency (e=0.5) compared to simulations without a hot halo (e=0.68).moreover we find cases where the stellar mass of the merger remnant is lowerthan the sum of the stellar mass of the two progenitor galaxies when evolved inisolation. this suggests a revision to semi-analytic galaxy formation modelswhich assume that a merger always leads to enhanced star formation. we showthat adding the hot gas component has a significant effect on the kinematicsand internal structure of the merger remnants, like an increased abundance offast rotators and an r^(1/4) surface brightness profile at small scales.

0704.2601	gems: galaxy fitting catalogues and testing parametric galaxy fitting  codes	in the context of measuring structure and morphology of intermediate redshiftgalaxies with recent hst/acs surveys, we tune, test, and compare two widelyused fitting codes (galfit and gim2d) for fitting single-component sersicmodels to the light profiles of both simulated and real galaxy data. we findthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. exponentialdisks are well fit with sersic models and have small measurement errors,whereas fits to de vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to thelarge amount of light at large radii. we find that both codes provide reliablefits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness isabove that of the sky. moreover, both codes return errors that significantlyunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated withsimulations. we find that gim2d suffers significant systematic errors forspheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively maskingout neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to thisimportant systematic in gim2d's current implementation. while this crowdingerror affects only a small fraction of galaxies in gems, it must be accountedfor in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fieldswith gim2d. in contrast, galfit results are robust to the presence of neighborsbecause it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions therebydeblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. we find galfit'srobustness to nearby companions and factor of &gt;~20 faster runtime speed areimportant advantages over gim2d for analyzing large hst/acs datasets. finallywe include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected ingems.

1105.3753	candels: the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy  survey	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over theapproximate redshift (z) range 8--1.5. it will image &gt;250,000 distant galaxiesusing three separate cameras on the hubble space telescope, from themid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure type iasupernovae at z&gt;1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles forcosmology. five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each withextensive ancillary data. the use of five widely separated fields mitigatescosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples ofgalaxies down to a stellar mass of 10^9 m_\odot to z \approx 2, reaching theknee of the ultraviolet luminosity function (uvlf) of galaxies to z \approx 8.the survey covers approximately 800 arcmin^2 and is divided into two parts. thecandels/deep survey (5\sigma\ point-source limit h=27.7 mag) covers \sim 125arcmin^2 within goods-n and goods-s. the candels/wide survey includes goods andthree additional fields (egs, cosmos, and uds) and covers the full area to a5\sigma\ point-source limit of h \gtrsim 27.0 mag. together with the hubbleultra deep fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding cake" approachthat has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. data from the survey arenonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. inthis paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the candels teamscience goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selectionand geometry, and the observing design. the hubble data processing and productsare described in a companion paper.

1108.2508	the major and minor galaxy merger rates at z &lt; 1.5	calculating the galaxy merger rate requires both a census of galaxiesidentified as merger candidates, and a cosmologically-averaged `observability'timescale t_obs(z) for identifying galaxy mergers. while many have countedgalaxy mergers using a variety of techniques, t_obs(z) for these techniqueshave been poorly constrained. we address this problem by calibrating threemerger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations andthree galaxy formation models. we estimate t_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairswith a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator g-m20, and(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry a. then we apply these timescales to theobserved merger fractions at z &lt; 1.5 from the recent literature. when ourphysically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger ratesbecome largely consistent. the remaining differences between the galaxy mergerrates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured bydifferent techniques and differing parent galaxy selection. the major mergerrate per unit co-moving volume for samples selected with constant numberdensity evolves much more strongly with redshift (~ (1+z)^(+3.0 \pm 1.1)) thansamples selected with constant stellar mass or passively evolving luminosity (~(1+z)^(+0.1 \pm 0.4)). we calculate the minor merger rate (1:4 &lt;m_{sat}/m_{primary} &lt;~ 1:10) by subtracting the major merger rate from closepairs from the `total' merger rate determined by g-m20. the implied minormerger rate is ~3 times the major merger rate at z ~ 0.7, and shows littleevolution with redshift.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1112.0029	on the evolution of the star formation rate function of massive  galaxies. constraints at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.8 from the goods-music catalogue	[abridged] we study the evolution of the star formation rate function (sfrf)of massive galaxies over the 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.8 redshift range and its implications forour understanding of the physical processes responsible for galaxy evolution.we use multiwavelength observations included in the goods-music catalogue,which provides a suitable coverage of the spectral region from 0.3 to 24 micronand either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for each object. individualsfrs have been obtained by combining uv and 24 micron observations, when thelatter were available. for all other sources an "sed fitting" sfr estimate hasbeen considered. we then define a stellar mass limited sample, complete in themstar&gt;1.e10 msun range and determine the sfrf using the 1/vmax algorithm. wedefine simulated galaxy catalogues based on three different semi-analyticalmodels of galaxy formation and evolution. we show that the theoretical sfrfsare well described by a double power law functional form and its redshiftevolution is approximated with high accuracy by a pure evolution of the typicalsfr. we find good agreement between model predictions and the high-sfr end ofthe sfrf, when the observational errors on the sfr are taken into account.however, the observational sfrf is characterised by a double peaked structure,which is absent in its theoretical counterparts. at z&gt;1.0 the observed sfrfshows a relevant density evolution, which is not reproduced by sams, due to thewell known overprediction of intermediate mass galaxies at z~2. the agreementat the low-sfr end is poor: all models overpredict the space density of sfr~1msun/yr and no model reproduces the double peaked shape of the observationalsfrf. if confirmed by deeper ir observations, this discrepancy will provide akey constraint on theoretical modelling of star formation and stellar feedback.

1112.1077	modeling the red sequence: hierarchical growth yet slow luminosity  evolution	we explore the effects of mergers on the evolution of massive early-typegalaxies by modeling the evolution of their stellar populations in ahierarchical context. we investigate how a realistic red sequence populationset up by z~1 evolves under different assumptions for the merger and starformation histories, comparing changes in color, luminosity and mass. thepurely passive fading of existing red sequence galaxies, with no furthermergers or star formation, results in dramatic changes at the bright end of theluminosity function and color-magnitude relation. without mergers there is toomuch evolution in luminosity at a fixed space density compared to observations.the change in color and magnitude at a fixed mass resemble that of a passivelyevolving population that formed relatively recently, at z~2. mergers amongstthe red sequence population ("dry mergers") occurring after z=1 build up mass,counteracting the fading of the existing stellar populations to give smallerchanges in both color and luminosity for massive galaxies. by allowing somegalaxies to migrate from the blue cloud onto the red sequence after z=1 throughgas-rich mergers, younger stellar populations are added to the red sequence.this manifestation of the progenitor bias increases the scatter in age andresults in even smaller changes in color and luminosity between z=1 and z=0 ata fixed mass. the resultant evolution appears much slower, resembling thepassive evolution of a population that formed at high redshift (z~3-5) and isin closer agreement with observations. measurements of the luminosity and colorevolution alone are not sufficient to distinguish between the purely passiveevolution of an old population and cosmologically motivated hierarchicalgrowth, although these scenarios have very different implications for the massgrowth of early-type galaxies over the last half of cosmic history.

1201.2410	physical properties of herschel selected galaxies in a semi-analytic  galaxy formation model	[abridged] we make use of a semi-analytic cosmological model that includessimple prescriptions for dust attenuation and emission to make predictions forthe observable and physical properties of galaxies that may be detected by therecently launched herschel space observatory in deep fields such asgoods-herschel. we compare our predictions for differential galaxy numbercounts in the pacs (100 &amp; 160) and spire (250, 350, and 500 micron) bands withavailable observations. we find very good agreement with the counts in the pacsbands, for the overall counts and for galaxies binned by redshift at z&lt; 2. at z&gt; 2 our model underpredicts the number of bright galaxies by a factor of ten.the agreement is much worse for all three spire bands, and becomesprogressively worse with increasing wavelength. we discuss a number of possiblereasons for these discrepancies, and hypothesize that the effect of blending onthe observational flux estimates is likely to be the dominant issue. we notethat the pacs number counts are relatively robust to changes in the dustemission templates, while the predicted spire number counts are more templatedependent. we present quantitative predictions for the relationship between theobserved pacs 160 and spire 250 micron fluxes and physical quantities such ashalo mass, stellar mass, cold gas mass, star formation rate, and total infrared(ir) luminosity, at different redshifts. we also present quantitativepredictions for the correlation between pacs 160 micron flux and theprobability that a galaxy has experienced a recent major or minor merger.although our models predict a strong correlation between these quantities, suchthat more ir-luminous galaxies are more likely to be merger-driven, we findthat more than half of all high redshift ir-luminous galaxies detected byherschel are able to attain their high star formation rates without enhancementby a merger.

0711.1440	expected z&gt;5 qso number counts in large area deep near-infrared surveys	the qso luminosity function at z&gt;5 provides strong constraints on models ofjoint evolution of qso and their hosts. however, these observations arechallenging because the low space densities of these objects necessitatesurveying of large areas, in order to obtain statistically meaningful samples,while at the same time cosmological redshifting and dimming means that ratherdeep near infrared (nir) imaging must be carried out. several upcoming andproposed facilities with wide-field nir imaging capabilities will open up thisnew region of parameter space. in this paper we present predictions for theexpected number counts of z&gt;5 qsos, based on simple empirical andsemi-empirical models of qso evolution, as a function of redshift, depth andsurveyed area. we compute the evolution of observed-frame qso magnitudes andcolors in a representative photometric system covering the wavelength range550nm&lt;lambda&lt;1800nm, and combine this information with different estimates forthe evolution of the qso luminosity function. we conclude that plannedground-based surveys such as pan-starrs and vista should be able to detect alarge number of luminous qsos up to z&lt;7.5, but that space-based missions suchas euclid (formerly space/dune) or snap are probably required in order toobtain substantial samples at higher redshift. we also use our models topredict the expected number counts for future x-ray space missions (such asxeus and constellation-x), and show that because of their small field-of-view,these telescopes are unlikely to discover significant numbers of agn at veryhigh redshift. however, x-ray follow-up of objects detected at longerwavelength will be an important means of confirming their identity as agn andconstraining obscuration.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1206.6112	origin of the anti-hierarchical growth of black holes	observational studies have revealed a "downsizing" trend in black hole (bh)growth: the number densities of luminous agn peak at higher redshifts thanthose of faint agn. this would seem to imply that massive black holes formedbefore low mass black holes, in apparent contradiction to hierarchicalclustering scenarios. we investigate whether this observed "downsizing" in bhgrowth is reproduced in a semi-analytic model for the formation and evolutionof galaxies and black holes, set within the hierarchical paradigm for structureformation (somerville et al. 2008; s08). in this model, black holes evolve fromlight seeds (\sim100m\odot) and their growth is merger-driven. the original s08model (baseline model) reproduces the number density of agn at intermediateredshifts and luminosities, but underproduces luminous agn at very highredshift (z &gt; 3) and overproduces them at low redshift (z &lt; 1). in addition,the baseline model underproduces low-luminosity agn at low redshift (z &lt; 1). tosolve these problems we consider several modifications to the physicalprocesses in the model: (1) a 'heavy' black hole seeding scenario (2) asub-eddington accretion rate ceiling that depends on the cold gas fraction, and(3) an additional black hole accretion mode due to disk instabilities. withthese three modifications, the models can explain the observed downsizing,successfully reproduce the bolometric agn luminosity function andsimultaneously reproduce galaxy and black hole properties in the localuniverse. we also perform a comparison with the observed soft and hard x-rayluminosity functions of agn, including an empirical correction for torus-levelobscuration, and reach similar conclusions. our best-fit model suggests ascenario in which disk instabilities are the main driver for moderatelyluminous seyfert galaxies at low redshift, while major mergers are the maintrigger for luminous agn.

1208.4366	an empirical prediction for stellar metallicity distributions in nearby  galaxies	we combine star-formation histories derived from observations of highredshift galaxies with measurements of the z~0 relation between gas-phasemetallicity, stellar mass, and star formation rate to make an explicit andcompletely empirical connection between near-field and distant galaxyobservations. our approach relies on two basic assumptions: 1) galaxies'average paths through time in stellar mass vs. star formation rate space arerepresented by a family of smooth functions that are determined by thegalaxies' final stellar mass, and 2) galaxies grow and become enriched withheavy elements such that they always evolve along the mass--metallicity--starformation rate relation. by integrating over these paths, we can track thechemical evolution of stars in galaxies in a model independent way, without theneed for explicit assumptions about gas inflow, outflow, or star formationefficiency. using this approach, we present predictions of stellar metallicity(i.e., o/h) distribution functions for present day star-forming galaxies ofdifferent stellar masses and the evolution of the alpha-element stellarmetallicity-mass relation since z~1. the metallicity distribution functions arefairly well described as gaussians, truncated at high metallicity, withpower-law tails to low metallicity. we find that the stellar metallicitydistribution for milky way mass galaxies is in reasonable agreement withobservations for our galaxy, and that the predicted stellar mass vs. meanstellar metallicity relation at z=0 agrees quite well with results derived fromgalaxy surveys. this validates the assumptions that are implicit in our simpleapproach. upcoming observations will further test these assumptions and theirrange of validity, by measuring the mean stellar mass-metallicity relation upto z~1, and by measuring the stellar metallicity distributions over a range ofgalaxy masses.

1210.5522	numerical hydrodynamic simulations based on semi-analytic galaxy merger  trees: method and milky-way like galaxies	we present a new approach to study galaxy evolution in a cosmologicalcontext. we combine cosmological merger trees and semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation to provide the initial conditions for multi-mergerhydrodynamic simulations. in this way we exploit the advantages of mergersimulations (high resolution and inclusion of the gas physics) andsemi-analytic models (cosmological background and low computational cost), andintegrate them to create a novel tool. this approach allows us to study theevolution of various galaxy properties, including the treatment of the hotgaseous halo from which gas cools and accretes onto the central disc, which hasbeen neglected in many previous studies. this method shows several advantagesover other methods. as only the particles in the regions of interest areincluded, the run time is much shorter than in traditional cosmologicalsimulations, leading to greater computational efficiency. using cosmologicalsimulations, we show that multiple mergers are expected to be more common thansequences of isolated mergers, and therefore studies of galaxy mergers shouldtake this into account. in this pilot study, we present our method andillustrate the results of simulating ten milky way-like galaxies since z=1. wefind good agreement with observations for the total stellar masses, starformation rates, cold gas fractions and disc scale length parameters. we expectthat this novel numerical approach will be very useful for pursuing a number ofquestions pertaining to the transformation of galaxy internal structure throughcosmic time.

1312.3233	a comparison between semi-analytic model predictions for the candels  survey	we compare the predictions of three independently developed semi-analyticgalaxy formation models that are being used to aid in the interpretation ofresults from the candels survey. these models are each applied to the same setof halo merger trees extracted from the "bolshoi" simulation and are carefullytuned to match the local galaxy stellar mass function using the powerful methodof bayesian inference coupled with mcmc or by hand. the comparisons reveal thatin spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formationand feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similarpredictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and starformation over cosmic time. we show that the sams generally require strongoutflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present daystellar mass function. however, all of the models considered producepredictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxiesthat are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. wesuggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and smalldifferences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem fromdifferent assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor. importantly, whilemore accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, sfr and metallicityof galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;5 will discriminate between models, the discrepanciesbetween the models and existing data of these observables have already revealedchallenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxyformation. the three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs ofmock galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the candels survey,which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases anduncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real observations.-abridged

1402.0866	bulge growth and quenching since z = 2.5 in candels/3d-hst	exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 candels fields, andaccurate redshift information provided by 3d-hst, we investigate the relationbetween structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764galaxies above 10^10 msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. for thefirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single sersic fit andtwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the h-band lightdistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolvedstellar population modeling. we confirm that the increased bulge prominenceamong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-opticalobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellarmass. moreover, we observe an increase of the typical sersic index andbulge-to-total ratio (with median b/t reaching 40-50%) among star-forminggalaxies above 10^11 msun. given that quenching for these most massive systemsis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growthprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. we demonstrate thatthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a morereliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy thanthe total stellar mass. the same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-artsemi-analytic model by somerville et al. in the latter, bulges and black holesgrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and agn-feedbackshuts off star formation. further observations will be required to pin downstar formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must beinternal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.

1403.6198	steadily increasing star formation rates in galaxies observed at 3 &lt;~ z  &lt;~ 5 in the candels/goods-s field	we investigate the star formation histories (sfhs) of high redshift (3 &lt;~ z&lt;~ 5) star-forming galaxies selected based on their rest-frame ultraviolet (uv)colors in the candels/goods-s field. by comparing the results from thespectral-energy-distribution-fitting analysis with two different assumptionsabout the sfhs --- i.e., exponentially declining sfhs as well as increasingones, we conclude that the sfhs of high-redshift star-forming galaxies increasewith time rather than exponentially decline. we also examine the correlationsbetween the star formation rates (sfrs) and the stellar masses. when thegalaxies are fit with rising sfrs, we find that the trend seen in the dataqualitatively matches the expectations from a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation. the mean specific sfr is shown to increase with redshift, also inagreement with the theoretical prediction. from the derived tight correlationbetween stellar masses and sfrs, we derive the mean sfh of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range of 3 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 5, which shows a steep power-law(with power alpha = 5.85) increase with time. we also investigate the formationtimescales and the mean stellar population ages of these star-forming galaxies.our analysis reveals that uv-selected star-forming galaxies have a broad rangeof the formation redshift. the derived stellar masses and the stellarpopulation ages show positive correlation in a sense that more massive galaxiesare on average older, but with significant scatter. this large scatter impliesthat the galaxies' mass is not the only factor which affects the growth or starformation of high-redshift galaxies.

1407.0594	understanding the structural scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we use a large suite of hydrodynamical simulations of binary galaxy mergersto construct and calibrate a physical prescription for computing the effectiveradii and velocity dispersions of spheroids. we implement this prescriptionwithin a semi-analytic model embedded in merger trees extracted from thebolshoi lambda-cdm n-body simulation, accounting for spheroid growth via majorand minor mergers as well as disk instabilities. we find that without diskinstabilities, our model does not predict sufficient numbers of intermediatemass early-type galaxies in the local universe. spheroids also form earlier inmodels with spheroid growth via disk instabilities. our model correctlypredicts the normalization, slope, and scatter of the low-redshift size-massand fundamental plane relations for early type galaxies. it predicts a degreeof curvature in the faber-jackson relation that is not seen in localobservations, but this could be alleviated if higher mass spheroids have morebottom-heavy initial mass functions. the model also correctly predicts theobserved strong evolution of the size-mass relation for spheroids out to higherredshifts, as well as the slower evolution in the normalization of thefaber-jackson relation. we emphasize that these are genuine predictions of themodel since it was tuned to match hydrodynamical simulations and not theseobservations.

1407.1850	a parametric study of possible solutions to the high-redshift  overproduction of stars in modeled dwarf galaxies	both numerical hydrodynamic and semi-analytic cosmological models of galaxyformation struggle to match observed star formation histories of galaxies inlow mass halos (m$_{\rm{h}} \lesssim 10^{11} m_\odot$), predicting more starformation at high redshift and less star formation at low redshift thanobserved. the fundamental problem is that galaxies' gas accretion and starformation rates are too closely coupled in the models: the accretion ratelargely drives the star formation rate. observations point to gas accretionrates that outpace star formation at high redshift, resulting in a buildup ofgas and a delay in star formation until lower redshifts. we present threeempirical adjustments of standard recipes in a semi-analytic model motivated bythree physical scenarios that could cause this decoupling: 1) the mass-loadingfactors of outflows driven by stellar feedback may have a steeper dependence onhalo mass at earlier times, 2) the efficiency of star formation may be lower inlow mass halos at high redshift, and 3) gas may not be able to accreteefficiently onto the disk in low mass halos at high redshift. these newrecipes, once tuned, better reproduce the evolution of $f_\star \equivm_\star/m_{\rm{h}}$ as a function of halo mass as derived from abundancematching over redshifts $z=0$ to $3$, though they have different effects oncold gas fractions, star formation rates, and metallicities. changes to gasaccretion and stellar-driven winds are promising, while direct modification ofthe star formation timescale requires drastic measures that are not physicallywell-motivated.

1407.6012	the relation between sfr and stellar mass for galaxies at 3.5 $\le z\le$  6.5 in candels	distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formationrates (sfr) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxyformation. here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatterof the sfr-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ usingmulti-wavelength photometry in goods-s from the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and spitzer extended deep survey. wedescribe an updated, bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method thatincorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories thatare constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions(starburst and small magellanic cloud). from $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forminggalaxies in candels follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar massand sfr that follows sfr $\sim$ $m_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. this evolution requires a star formationhistory that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the sfrs ofindividual galaxies rise with time). the observed scatter in the sfr-stellarmass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{sfr}/\mathrm{m}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})&lt;0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log m_\star/\mathrm{m}_\odot &gt; 9$ dex.assuming that the sfr is tied to the net gas inflow rate (sfr $\sim$$\dot{m}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is alsosmaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass andredshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.we further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected onthe basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolutionin the sfr-stellar mass relation.

1408.2227	de-confusing blended field images using graphs and bayesian priors	we present a new technique for overcoming confusion noise in deepfar-infrared \herschel space telescope images making use of prior informationfrom shorter $\lambda&lt;2$\micron wavelengths. for the deepest images obtained by\herschels, the flux limit due to source confusion is about a factor of threebrighter than the flux limit due to instrumental noise and (smooth) skybackground. we have investigated the possibility of de-confusing simulated\herschel pacs-160\micron images by using strong bayesian priors on thepositions and weak priors on the flux of sources. we find the blended sourcesand group them together and simultaneously fit their fluxes. we derive theposterior probability distribution function of fluxes subject to these priorsthrough monte carlo markov chain (mcmc) sampling by fitting the image. assumingwe can predict fir flux of sources based on ultraviolet-optical part of theirseds to within an order of magnitude, the simulations show that we can obtainreliable fluxes and uncertainties at least a factor of three fainter than theconfusion noise limit of $3\sigma_{c} $=2.7 mjy in our simulated pacs-160image. this technique could in principle be used to mitigate the effects ofsource confusion in any situation where one has prior information of positionsand plausible fluxes of blended sources. for \herschel, application of thistechnique will improve our ability to constrain the dust content in normalgalaxies at high redshift.

1408.2527	the mass evolution of the first galaxies: stellar mass functions and  star formation rates at $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$ in the candels goods-south field	we measure new estimates for the galaxy stellar mass function and starformation rates for samples of galaxies at $z \sim 4,~5,~6~\&amp;~7$ using data inthe candels goods south field. the deep near-infrared observations allow us toconstruct the stellar mass function at $z \geq 6$ directly for the first time.we estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectralenergy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular lineand continuum emission. the observed uv luminosity functions for the samplesare consistent with previous observations, however we find that the observed$m_{uv}$ - m$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constantmass to light ratio and a normalisation which evolves with redshift. ourstellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha \approx -1.9$),steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of theuv luminosity function. integrating our new mass functions, we find theobserved stellar mass density evolves from $\log_{10} \rho_{*} =6.64^{+0.58}_{-0.89}$ at $z \sim 7$ to $7.36\pm0.06$ $\text{m}_{\odot}\text{mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4$. finally, combining the measured uv continuumslopes ($\beta$) with their rest-frame uv luminosities, we calculate dustcorrected star-formation rates (sfr) for our sample. we find the specificstar-formation rate for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst theglobal sfr density falls rapidly over this period. our new sfr densityestimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.

1412.2712	physical models of galaxy formation in a cosmological framework	modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of thegreatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales andnumerous physical processes involved. here we review the current status ofmodels that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxyformation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. wefocus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of theglobal and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon($z\sim 2-3$) to the present. although minor discrepancies remain, overall,models show remarkable convergence between different methods and makepredictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. modelers seemto have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical forshaping galaxy properties. this core set includes cosmological accretion,strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black holefeedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, andstructural and morphological evolution through merging and environmentalprocesses. however, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenologicalimplementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned toobservations. many details of how these diverse processes interact within ahierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. emergingmulti-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar andcosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically groundedfooting. concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide newchallenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraininginflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.

1501.06840	quenching and morphological transformation in semi-analytic models and  candels	we examine the spheroid growth and star formation quenching experienced bygalaxies from z~3 to the present by studying the evolution with redshift of thequiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the candels andgama surveys. we compare the observed fractions with predictions from asemi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and agnfeedback due to mergers and disk instabilities. we facilitate directmorphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar massratios to sersic indices. we then subdivide our population into the fourquadrants of the ssfr-sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of thesesubpopulations. we find that the fraction of star forming disks declinessteadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time.the fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are bothnon-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, atabout 10% and 15-20% respectively. our model is qualitatively successful atreproducing the evolution of the two "main" populations (star formingdisk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), andapproximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predictsa stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks,than seen in the observations. a model with an additional channel for bulgegrowth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations thana model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. we study evolutionarytracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphologicaltransformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physicaldrivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and diskinstabilities). we find that complex histories with multiple transformativeevents are the norm.

1502.01342	using galaxy pairs to probe star formation during major halo mergers	currently-proposed galaxy quenching mechanisms predict very differentbehaviours during major halo mergers, ranging from significant quenchingenhancement (e.g., clump-induced gravitational heating models) to significantstar formation enhancement (e.g., gas starvation models). to test realgalaxies' behaviour, we present an observational galaxy pair method forselecting galaxies whose host haloes are preferentially undergoing majormergers. applying the method to central l* (10^10 msun &lt; m_* &lt; 10^10.5 msun)galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) at z&lt;0.06, we find that majorhalo mergers can at most modestly reduce the star-forming fraction, from 59% to47%. consistent with past research, however, mergers accompany enhancedspecific star formation rates for star-forming l* centrals: ~10% when a pairedgalaxy is within 200 kpc (approximately the host halo's virial radius),climbing to ~70% when a paired galaxy is within 30 kpc. no evidence is seen foreven extremely close pairs (&lt;30 kpc separation) rejuvenating star formation inquenched galaxies. for galaxy formation models, our results suggest: (1)quenching in l* galaxies likely begins due to decoupling of the galaxy fromexisting hot and cold gas reservoirs, rather than a lack of available gas orgravitational heating from infalling clumps, (2) state-of-the-art semi-analyticmodels currently over-predict the effect of major halo mergers on quenching,and (3) major halo mergers can trigger enhanced star formation in non-quenchedcentral galaxies.

1504.00005	an increasing stellar baryon fraction in bright galaxies at high  redshift	recent observations have shown that the characteristic luminosity of therest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function does not significantly evolveat 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 and is approximately m*_uv ~ -21. we investigate this apparentnon-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, m_uv &lt; -21 galaxies at z=4to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. including deepspitzer/irac imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find thatm*_uv galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(m/msol)=9.6-9.9 andare thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. however, bright galaxiesat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly brightgalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formationrates and levels of dust attenuation. we match the abundances of these brightz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the bolshoi lambda-cdm simulation toestimate the halo masses. we find that the typical halo masses in ~m*_uvgalaxies decrease from log(m_h/msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(m_h/msol)=11.4 at z=7.thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multipleredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. thestellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean omega_b/omega_m rises from5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigmalevel. this rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, isallowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars athigh redshifts.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1505.04607	nifty cosmology: comparison of galaxy formation models	we present a comparison of 14 galaxy formation models: 12 differentsemi-analytical models and 2 halo-occupation distribution models for galaxyformation based upon the same cosmological simulation and merger treeinformation derived from it. the participating codes have proven to be verysuccessful in their own right but they have all been calibrated independentlyusing various observational data sets, stellar models, and merger trees. inthis paper we apply them without recalibration and this leads to a wide varietyof predictions for the stellar mass function, specific star formation rates,stellar-to- halo mass ratios, and the abundance of orphan galaxies. the scatteris much larger than seen in previous comparison studies primarily because thecodes have been used outside of their native environment within which they arewell tested and calibrated. the purpose of the `nifty comparison of galaxyformation models' is to bring together as many different galaxy formationmodellers as possible and to investigate a common approach to modelcalibration. this paper provides a unified description for all participatingmodels and presents the initial, uncalibrated comparison as a baseline for ourfuture studies where we will develop a common calibration framework and addressthe extent to which that reduces the scatter in the model predictions seenhere.

1507.01599	star formation in mergers with cosmologically motivated initial  conditions	we use semi-analytic models and cosmological merger trees to provide theinitial conditions for multi-merger numerical hydrodynamic simulations, andexploit these simulations to explore the effect of galaxy interaction andmerging on star formation (sf). we compute numerical realisations of twelvemerger trees from z=1.5 to z=0. we include the effects of the large hot gaseoushalo around all galaxies, following recent obervations and predictions ofgalaxy formation models. we find that including the hot gaseous halo has anumber of important effects. firstly, as expected, the star formation rate onlong timescales is increased due to cooling of the hot halo and refuelling ofthe cold gas reservoir. secondly, we find that interactions do not alwaysincrease the sf in the long term. this is partially due to the orbitinggalaxies transferring gravitational energy to the hot gaseous haloes andraising their temperature. finally we find that the relative size of thestarburst, when including the hot halo, is much smaller than previous studiesshowed. our simulations also show that the order and timing of interactions areimportant for the evolution of a galaxy. when multiple galaxies interact at thesame time, the sf enhancement is less than when galaxies interact in series.all these effects show the importance of including hot gas and cosmologicallymotivated merger trees in galaxy evolution models.

1507.04746	from discs to bulges: effect of mergers on the morphology of galaxies	we study the effect of mergers on the morphology of galaxies by means of thesimulated merger tree approach first proposed by moster et al. this methodcombines n-body cosmological simulations and semi-analytic techniques toextract realistic initial conditions for galaxy mergers. these are then evolvedusing high resolution hydrodynamical simulations, which include dark matter,stars, cold gas in the disc and hot gas in the halo. we show that the satellitemass accretion is not as effective as previously thought, as there issubstantial stellar stripping before the final merger. the fraction of stellardisc mass transferred to the bulge is quite low, even in the case of a majormerger, mainly due to the dispersion of part of the stellar disc mass into thehalo. we confirm the findings of hopkins et al., that a gas rich disc is ableto survive major mergers more efficiently. the enhanced star formationassociated with the merger is not localised to the bulge of galaxy, but asubstantial fraction takes place in the disc too. the inclusion of the hot gasreservoir in the galaxy model contributes to reducing the efficiency of bulgeformation. overall, our findings suggest that mergers are not as efficient aspreviously thought in transforming discs into bulges. this possibly alleviatessome of the tensions between observations of bulgeless galaxies and thehierarchical scenario for structure formation.

1507.04748	on the dependence of galaxy morphologies on galaxy mergers	the distribution of galaxy morphological types is a key test for models ofgalaxy formation and evolution, providing strong constraints on the relativecontribution of different physical processes responsible for the growth of thespheroidal components. in this paper, we make use of a suite of semi-analyticmodels to study the efficiency of galaxy mergers in disrupting galaxy discs andbuilding galaxy bulges. in particular, we compare standard prescriptionsusually adopted in semi-analytic models, with new prescriptions proposed bykannan et al., based on results from high-resolution hydrodynamicalsimulations, and we show that these new implementations reduce the efficiencyof bulge formation through mergers. in addition, we compare our model resultswith a variety of observational measurements of the fraction ofspheroid-dominated galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass, showingthat the present uncertainties in the data represent an important limitation toour understanding of spheroid formation. our results indicate that the maintension between theoretical models and observations does not stem from thesurvival of purely disc structures (i.e. bulgeless galaxies), rather from thedistribution of galaxies of different morphological types, as a function oftheir stellar mass.

1509.00034	what shapes the far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies?	to explore the connection between the global physical properties of galaxiesand their far-infrared (fir) spectral energy distributions (seds), we study thevariation in the fir seds of a set of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies thatare generated by performing dust radiative transfer in post-processing. oursample includes both isolated and merging systems at various stages of themerging process and covers infrared (ir) luminosities and dust masses that arerepresentative of both low- and high-redshift galaxies. we study the fir sedsusing principle component analysis (pca) and find that 97\% of the variance inthe sample can be explained by two principle components (pcs). the first pccharacterizes the wavelength of the peak of the fir sed, and the second encodesthe breadth of the sed. we find that the coefficients of both pcs can bepredicted well using a double power law in terms of the ir luminosity and dustmass, which suggests that these two physical properties are the primarydeterminants of galaxies' fir sed shapes. incorporating galaxy sizes does notsignificantly improve our ability to predict the fir seds. our results suggestthat the observed redshift evolution in the effective dust temperature at fixedir luminosity is not driven by geometry: the seds of $z \sim 2-3$ ultraluminousir galaxies (ulirgs) are cooler than those of local ulirgs not because thehigh-redshift galaxies are more extended but rather because they have higherdust masses at fixed ir luminosity. finally, based on our simulations, weintroduce a two-parameter set of sed templates that depend on both irluminosity and dust mass.

astro-ph;0002449	what damped ly-alpha systems tell us about the radial distribution of  cold gas at high redshift	we investigate the properties of damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) insemi-analytic models, focusing on whether the models can reproduce thekinematic properties of low-ionization metal lines described by prochaska &amp;wolfe (1997b, 1998). we explore a variety of approaches for modelling theradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in ourmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. if weuse an approach based on fall &amp; efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of thediscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that themajority of the dlas correspond to a single galactic disc. these modelsgenerically fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths. inalternative models in which the gas discs are considerably more extended, asignificant fraction of dlas arise from lines of sight intersecting multiplegas discs in a common halo. these models produce kinematics that fit theobservational data, and also seem to agree well with the results of recenthydrodynamical simulations. thus we conclude that cold dark matter based modelsof galaxy formation can be reconciled with the kinematic data, but only at theexpense of the standard assumption that dlas are produced by rotationallysupported gas discs whose sizes are determined by conservation of angularmomentum. we suggest that the distribution of cold gas at high redshift may bedominated by another process, such as tidal streaming due to mergers.

0808.1227	a semi-analytic model for the co-evolution of galaxies, black holes, and  active galactic nuclei	we present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growthof supermassive black holes (bh) and their host galaxies within the context ofthe lcdm cosmological framework. in our model, the energy emitted by accretingblack holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galacticscale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jetsthat heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. we present acomprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observationalmeasurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as coldgas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formationrates. we find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponentialcutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densitiesat z~0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. we also find that our model ofself-regulated bh growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between bhmass and bulge mass. we explore the global formation history of galaxies in ourmodels, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation,stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. we find that models assuming the"concordance" lcdm cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass athigh redshift (z&gt;2). a model with less small-scale power predicts less starformation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellarmass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas inquasar absorption systems at high redshift (z~3-4).

astro-ph;0011261	galaxy formation at z~3: constraints from spatial clustering	we use n-body simulations combined with semi-analytic models to compute theclustering properties of modeled galaxies at z~3, and confront thesepredictions with the clustering properties of the observed population oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). several scenarios for the nature of lbgs areexplored, which may be broadly categorized into models in which high-redshiftstar formation is driven by collisional starbursts and those in which quiescentstar formation dominates. for each model, we make predictions for the lbgoverdensity distribution, the variance of counts-in-cells, the correlationlength, and close pair statistics. models which assume a one-to-onerelationship between massive dark-matter halos and galaxies are disfavored byclose pair statistics, as are models in which colliding halos are associatedwith galaxies in a simplified way. however, when modeling of gas consumptionand star formation is included using a semi-analytic treatment, the quiescentand collisional starburst models predict similar clustering properties and noneof these models can be ruled out based on the available clustering data. noneof the ``realistic'' models predict a strong dependence of clustering amplitudeon the luminosity threshold of the sample, in apparent conflict with someobservational results.

astro-ph;0011475	probing galaxy formation with high energy gamma-rays	we discuss how measurements of the absorption of $\gamma$-rays from gev totev energies via pair production on the extragalactic background light (ebl)can probe important issues in galaxy formation. we use semi-analytic models(sams) of galaxy formation, set within the hierarchical structure formationscenario, to obtain predictions of the ebl for 0.1-1000$\mu$m. sams incorporatesimplified physical treatments of the key processes of galaxy formation ---including gravitational collapse and merging of dark matter halos, gas coolingand dissipation, star formation, supernova feedback and metal production ---and have been shown to reproduce key observations at low and high redshift.here we also introduce improved modelling of the spectral energy distributionsin the mid-to-far-ir arising from emission by dust grains. assuming a flat\lcdm cosmology with $\omega_m=0.3$ and hubble parameter $h=0.65$, weinvestigate the consequences of variations in input assumptions such as thestellar initial mass function (imf) and the efficiency of converting cold gasinto stars. we conclude that observational studies of the absorption of$\gamma$-rays with energies from 10s of gev to 10s of tev will help todetermine the ebl, and also help to explain its origin by constraining some ofthe most uncertain features of galaxy formation theory, including the imf, thehistory of star formation, and the reprocessing of light by dust.

astro-ph;0105168	modeling angular-momentum history in dark-matter halos	we model the acquisition of spin by dark-matter halos in semi-analytic mergertrees. we explore two different algorithms; one in which halo spin is acquiredfrom the orbital angular momentum of merging satellites, and another in whichhalo spin is gained via tidal torquing on shells of material while still in thelinear regime. we find that both scenarios produce the characteristic spindistribution of halos found in n-body simulations, namely, a log-normaldistribution with mean ~0.04 and standard deviation ~0.5 in the log. a perfectmatch requires fine-tuning of two free parameters. both algorithms alsoreproduce the general insensitivity of the spin distribution to halo mass,redshift and cosmology seen in n-body simulations. the spin distribution can bemade strictly constant by physically motivated scalings of the free parameters.in addition, both schemes predict that halos which have had recent majormergers have systematically larger spin values. these algorithms can beimplemented within semi-analytic models of galaxy formation based on mergertrees. they yield detailed predictions of galaxy properties that stronglydepend on angular momentum (such as size and surface brightness) as a functionof merger history and environment.

astro-ph;0106293	galaxy halo occupation at high redshift	we discuss how current and future data on the clustering and number densityof z~3 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) can be used to constrain their relationshipto dark matter haloes. we explore a three-parameter model in which the numberof lbgs per dark halo scales like a power-law in the halo mass: n(m) =(m/m_1)^s for m&gt;m_m. here, m_m is the minimum mass halo that can host an lbg,m_1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloeshost more than one observed lbg, and s determines the strength of the massdependence. we show how these three parameters are constrained by threeobservable properties of lbgs: the number density, the large-scale bias, andthe fraction of objects in close pairs. given these three quantities, the threeunknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a fullexploration of parameter space. as an example, we assume an lcdm cosmology andconsider the observed properties of a recent sample of spectroscopicallyconfirmed lbgs. we find that the favored range for our model parameters is m_m= (0.4-8)x10^10 msun/h, m_1 = (6-10)x10^12 msun/h, and 0.9 &lt; s &lt; 1.1. thepreferred region in m_m expands by an order of magnitude and slightly shallowerslopes are acceptable if the allowed range of bias is permitted to span allrecent observational estimates. we also discuss how the observed clustering oflbgs as a function of luminosity can be used to constrain halo occupation,although due to current observational uncertainties we are unable to reach anystrong conclusions. our methods and results can be used to constrain morerealistic models that aim to derive the occupation function n(m) from firstprinciples, and offer insight into how basic physical properties affect theobserved properties of lbgs.

astro-ph;0107507	can photoionization squelching resolve the sub-structure crisis?	cold dark matter theory predicts that the local group should contain manymore dwarf-sized objects than the observed number of dwarf galaxies --- theso-called sub-structure problem. we investigate whether the suppression of starformation in these small objects due to the presence of a photoionizingbackground can resolve the problem. we make use of results from recenthydrodynamic simulations to build a recipe for the suppression of gas infallinto semi-analytic galaxy formation models, and use these to predict theluminosity function of dwarf galaxies in the local group. in the models withoutphotoionization ``squelching'', we predict a large excess of faint dwarfgalaxies compared with the observed number in the local group --- thus, theusual recipe for supernovae feedback used in semi-analytic models does notsolve the sub-structure problem on its own. when we include photoionizationsquelching, we find good agreement with the observations. we have neglectedtidal destruction, which probably further reduces the number of dwarf galaxies.we conclude that photoionizing squelching easily solves the sub-structureproblem. in fact, it is likely that once this effect is taken into account,models with reduced small-scale power (e.g. warm dark matter) wouldunderproduce dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0107538	squelched galaxies and dark halos	there is accumulating evidence that the faint end of the galaxy luminosityfunction might be very different in different locations. the luminosityfunction might be rising in rich clusters and flat or declining in regions oflow density. if galaxies form according to the model of hierarchical clusteringthen there should be many small halos compared to the number of big halos. ifthis theory is valid then there must be a mechanism that eliminates at leastthe visible component of galaxies in low density regions. a plausible mechanismis photoionization of the intergalactic medium at a time before the epoch thatmost dwarf galaxies form in low density regions but after the epoch offormation for similar systems that ultimately end up in rich clusters. thedynamical timescales are found to accommodate this hypothesis in a flatuniverse with omega_m &lt; 0.4.  if small halos exist but simply cannot be located because they have neverbecome the sites of significant star formation, they still might have dynamicalmanifestations. these manifestations are hard to identify in normal groups ofgalaxies because small halos do not make a significant contribution to theglobal mass budget. however, it could be entertained that there are clusters ofhalos where there are only small systems, clusters that are at the low mass endof the hierarchical tree. there may be places where only a few small galaxiesmanaged to form, enough for us to identify and use as test probes of thepotential. it turns out that such environments might be common. four probablegroups of dwarfs are identified within 5 mpc and the assumption they aregravitationally bound suggests m/l_b ~ 300 - 1200 m_sun/l_sun, 6 +/- factor 2times higher than typical values for groups with luminous galaxies.

astro-ph;0110390	lcdm-based models for the milky way and m31 i: dynamical models	we apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction withincuspy halo models predicted by the standard lcdm cosmology. the resultingmodels score remarkably well when confronted with the broad range ofobservational data available for the milky way and m31 galaxies, giving a milkyway virial mass of 1-2x10^12msun and concentration c=12-17. we consider twotypes of models, in which: (a) baryons conserve angular momentum and (b) someof the angular momentum of the baryons is transferred to the dark matter.type-a models produce good agreement with observed rotation curves and obeyconstraints in the solar neighborhood, but may have too much dark matter in thecenter to allow a fast rotating bar. the type-b models with angular momentumtransport have a slightly more massive disk and less dark matter in the centralpart, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. both classes of models probablyhave sufficient baryonic mass in the central 3.5kpc to reproduce recentobservational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards thegalactic center. all models require that about 1/2 of all baryons expectedinside the virial radius must not be in the disk or bulge. we investigatewhether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models iscompatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function, and find arange of parameter space that is allowed by this constraint. we conclude thatrotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' high surface brightnessspiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard lcdm.

astro-ph;0110584	the masses, ancestors and descendents of extremely red objects:  constraints from spatial clustering	wide field near-infrared (ir) surveys have revealed a population of galaxieswith very red optical$-$ir colors, which have been termed ``extremely redobjects'' (eros). modeling suggests that such red colors (r-k &gt; 5) could beproduced by galaxies at z&gt;~1 with either very old stellar populations or veryhigh dust extinction. recently it has been discovered that eros are stronglyclustered. are these objects the high-redshift progenitors of present day giantellipticals (ges)? are they already massive at this epoch? are they thedescendents of the $z\sim3$ lyman break galaxies (lbg), which have also beenidentified as possible high redshift progenitors of giant ellipticals? weaddress these questions within the framework of the cold dark matter paradigmusing an analytic model that connects the number density and clustering or biasof an observed population with the halo occupation function (the number ofobserved galaxies per halo of a given mass). we find that eros reside inmassive dark matter halos, with average mass &lt;m&gt; &gt; 1e13/h100 msun. theoccupation function that we derive for eros is very similar to the one wederive for z=0, l&gt;l* early type galaxies, whereas the occupation function forlbgs is skewed towards much smaller host halo masses (&lt;m&gt; ~ 1e11 to 1e12/h100msun. we then use the derived occupation function parameters to explore thepossible evolutionary connections between these three populations.

astro-ph;0112504	the masses of lyman break galaxies	data on galaxies at high redshift, identified by the lyman-break photometrictechnique, can teach us about how galaxies form and evolve. the stellar massesand other properties of such lyman break galaxies (lbgs) depend sensitively onthe details of star formation. in this paper we consider three different starformation prescriptions, and use semi-analytic methods applied to thenow-standard $\lambda$cdm theory of hierarchical structure formation to showhow these assumptions about star formation affect the predicted masses of thestars in these galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos that host them.we find that, within the rather large uncertainties, recent estimates of thestellar masses of lbgs from multi-color photometry are consistent with thepredictions of all three models. however, the estimated stellar masses are moreconsistent with the predictions of two of the models in which star formation isaccelerated at high redshifts $z\gsim3$, and of these models the one in whichmany of the lbgs are merger-driven starbursts is also more consistent withindications that many high redshift galaxies are gas rich. the clusteringproperties of lbgs have put some constraints on the masses of their host halos,but due to similarities in the halo occupation of the three models we considerand degeneracies between model parameters, current constraints are not yetsufficient to distinguish between realistic models.

astro-ph;0211231	damped lyman alpha systems and galaxy formation models - ii. high ions  and lyman limit systems	we investigate a model for the high-ionization state gas associated withobserved damped lyman-alpha systems, based on a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation set within the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation. in ourmodel, the hot gas in halos and sub-halos gives rise to civ absorption, whilethe low-ionization state gas is associated with the cold gas in galaxies. themodel matches the distribution of civ column densities and leads naturally tokinematic properties that are in good agreement with the data.  we examine the contribution of both hot and cold gas to sub-damped systemsand suggest that the properties of these systems can be used as an importanttest of the model. we expect that sub-dla systems will generally be composed ofa single gas disk and thus predict that they should have markedly differentkinematics than the damped systems.  finally, we find that hot halo gas produces less than one third of lymanlimit systems at redshift three. we model the contribution of mini-halos (haloswith virial velocities &lt; 35 km/s) to lyman limit systems and find that they maycontain as much gas as is observed in these systems. however, if we adoptrealistic models of the gas density distribution we find that these systems arenot a significant source of lyman limit absorption. instead we suggest thatuncollapsed gas outside of virialized halos is responsible for most of thelyman limit systems at high redshift.

astro-ph;0303017	star formation at the twilight of the dark ages: which stars reionized  the universe?	we calculate the global star formation rate density (sfrd) from z ~ 30-3using a semi-analytic model incorporating the hierarchical assembly of darkmatter halos, gas cooling via atomic hydrogen, star formation, supernovafeedback, and suppression of gas collapse in small halos due to the presence ofa photoionizing background. we compare the results with the predictions ofsimpler models based on the rate of dark matter halo growth and a fixed ratioof stellar-to-dark mass, and with observational constraints on the sfrd at 3 &lt;z &lt; 6. we also estimate the star formation rate due to very massive, metal-freepop iii stars using a simple model based on the halo formation rate, calibratedagainst detailed hydrodynamic simulations of pop iii star formation. we findthat the total production rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons during the probableepoch of reionization (15 &lt; z &lt; 20) is approximately equally divided betweenpop ii and pop iii stars, and that if reionization is late (less than about 15,close to the lower limit of the range allowed by the wmap results), then pop iistars alone may be able to reionize the universe.

astro-ph;0309058	the size evolution of high redshift galaxies	hubble space telescope images of high-redshift galaxies selected via colorand photometric redshifts are used to examine the size and axial-ratiodistribution of galaxies as a function of redshift at lookback times t &gt; 8 gyr.these parameters are measured at rest-frame uv wavelengths (1200-2000angstroms) on images with a rest-frame resolution of less than 0.8 kpc. galaxyradii are found to scale with redshift approximately as the inverse of thehubble parameter h(z). this is in accord with the theoretical expectation thatthe typical sizes of the luminous parts of galaxies should track the expectedevolution in the virial radius of dark-matter halos. the mean ratio ofsemi-major to semi-minor axis for a bright well-resolved sample of galaxies atz ~ 4 is b/a = 0.65, suggesting that these lyman break galaxies are not drawnfrom a spheroidal population. however the median concentration index of thissample is c = 3.5, which is closer to the typical concentration indices, c ~ 4,of nearby elliptical galaxies than to the values, c&lt;2 for local disk galaxiesof type sb and later.

astro-ph;0309067	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies in the great  observatories origins deep survey as a test of galaxy formation scenarios	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies is often used toattempt to discriminate between the classical view of galaxy formation, inwhich present-day luminous galaxies were assembled at early times and evolvedue to the passive aging of their stellar populations, and that of hierarchicalstructure formation, in which galaxies were assembled more recently via themerging of smaller objects. we carry out such a test here, by computing thedistribution of photometric redshifts of k_ab&lt;22 galaxies in the greatobservatories origins deep field survey goods southern field, and comparing theresults with predictions from a semi-analytic model based on hierarchicalstructure formation, and a classical `passive evolution' model. we find thatthe redshift distributions at z &lt;~ 1.5 of both the hierarchical and passivemodels are very similar to the observed one. at z&gt;~1.5, the hierarchical modelshows a deficit of galaxies, while the passive model predicts an excess. weinvestigate the nature of the observed galaxies in the redshift range where themodels diverge, and find that the majority have highly disturbed morphologies,suggesting that they may be merger-induced starbursts. while the hierarchicalmodel used here does not produce these objects in great enough numbers, theappearance of this population is clearly in better qualitative agreement withthe hierarchical picture than with the classical passive evolution scenario. weconclude that the observations support the general framework of hierarchicalformation, but suggest the need for new or modified physics in the models.

astro-ph;0309071	cosmic variance in the great observatories origins deep survey	cosmic variance is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the volumedensity of extragalactic objects such as galaxies or quasars arising from theunderlying large-scale density fluctuations. this is often a significant sourceof uncertainty, especially in deep galaxy surveys, which tend to coverrelatively small areas. we present estimates of the relative cosmic variancefor one-point statistics (i.e. number densities) for typical scales and volumessampled by the great observatories origins deep survey (goods). we use twoapproaches: for objects with a known two-point correlation function that iswell-approximated by a power law, one can use the standard analytic formalismto calculate the cosmic variance (in excess of shot noise). we use thisapproach to estimate the cosmic variance for several populations that are beingstudied in the goods program: extremely red objects (ero) at z~1, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) at z~3 and z~4, using clustering information for similarpopulations in the literature. for populations with unknown clustering, one canuse predictions from cold dark matter theory to obtain a rough estimate of thevariance as a function of number density. we present a convenient plot whichallows one to use this approach to read off the cosmic variance for apopulation with a known mean redshift and estimated number density. we concludethat for the volumes sampled by goods, cosmic variance is a significant sourceof uncertainty for strongly clustered objects (~40-60% for eros) and lessserious for less clustered objects, ~10-20% for lbgs.

astro-ph;0309187	morphologies and spectral energy distributions of extremely red galaxies  in the goods-south field	using u'- through ks-band imaging data in the goods-south field, we constructa large, complete sample of 275 ``extremely red objects'' (eros; k_s&lt;22.0,r-k_s&gt;3.35; ab), all with deep hst/acs imaging in b_435, v_606, i_775, andz_850, and well-calibrated photometric redshifts. quantitative concentrationand asymmetry measurements fail to separate eros into distinct morphologicalclasses. we therefore visually classify the morphologies of all eros into fourbroad types: ``early'' (elliptical-like), ``late'' (disk galaxies),``irregular'' and ``other'' (chain galaxies and low surface brightnessgalaxies), and calculate their relative fractions and comoving space densities.for a broad range of limiting magnitudes and color thresholds, the relativenumber of early-type eros is approximately constant at 33-44%, and the comovingspace densities of early- and late-type eros are comparable. mean rest-framespectral energy distributions (seds) at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1.2 um areconstructed for all eros. the seds are extremely similar in their range ofshapes, independent of morphological type. the implication is that anydifferences between the broad-band seds of early-type eros and the other typesare relatively subtle, and there is no robust way of photometricallydistinguishing between different morphological types with usualoptical/near-infrared photometry.

astro-ph;0310888	evolution in the colors of lyman-break galaxies from z~4 to z~3	the integrated colors of distant galaxies provide a means for interpretingthe properties of their stellar content. here, we use rest-frame uv-to-opticalcolors to constrain the spectral-energy distributions and stellar populationsof color-selected, b-dropout galaxies at z ~ 4 in the great observatoriesorigins deep survey. we combine the acs data with ground-based near-infraredimages, which extend the coverage of galaxies at z ~ 4 to the rest-frameb-band. we observe a color-magnitude trend in the rest-frame m(uv) - b versus bdiagram for the z ~ 4 galaxies that has a fairly well-defined "blue-envelope",and is strikingly similar to that of color-selected, u-dropout galaxies at z ~3. we also find that although the co-moving luminosity density at rest-frame uvwavelengths (1600 angstroms) is roughly comparable at z ~ 3 and z ~ 4, theluminosity density at rest-frame optical wavelengths increases by aboutone-third from z ~ 4 to z ~ 3. although the star-formation histories ofindividual galaxies may involve complex and stochastic events, the evolution inthe global luminosity density of the uv-bright galaxy population corresponds toan average star-formation history with a star-formation rate that is constantor increasing over these redshifts. this suggests that the evolution in theluminosity density corresponds to an increase in the stellar-mass density ofmore than 33%.

astro-ph;0503135	simulations of dust in interacting galaxies i: dust attenuation	a new monte-carlo radiative-transfer code, sunrise, is used in conjunctionwith hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers to calculate the effectsof dust in such systems. the simulations are in good agreement withobservations of dust absorption in starburst galaxies, and the dust has aprofound effect on their appearance. the dust attenuation increases withluminosity such that at peak luminosities ~90% of the bolometric luminosity isabsorbed by dust. in general, the detailed appearance of the merging eventdepends on the stage of the merger and the geometry of the encounter. thefraction of bolometric energy absorbed by the dust, however, is a robustquantity that can be predicted from the intrinsic properties bolometricluminosity, baryonic mass, star-formation rate, and metallicity of the system.this paper presents fitting formulae, valid over a wide range of masses andmetallicities, from which the absorbed fraction of luminosity (and consequentlyalso the infrared dust luminosity) can be predicted. the attenuation of theluminosity at specific wavelengths can also be predicted, albeit with a largerscatter due to the variation with viewing angle. these formulae for dustattenuation appear to be valid for both isolated and interacting galaxies, areconsistent with earlier studies, and would be suitable for inclusion intheoretical models, e.g. semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0505297	the evolution of the optical and near-infrared galaxy luminosity  functions and luminosity densities to z~2	using hubble space telescope and ground-based u through k- band photometryfrom the great observatories origins deep survey (goods), we measure theevolution of the luminosity function and luminosity density in the rest-frameoptical (ubr) to z ~ 2, bridging the poorly explored ``redshift desert''between z~1 and z~2. we also use deep near-infrared observations to measure theevolution in the rest-frame j-band to z~1. compared to local measurements fromthe sdss, we find a brightening of the characteristic magnitude, (m*), by ~2.1,\~0.8 and ~0.7 mag between z=0.1 and z=1.9, in u, b, and r bands, respectively.the evolution of m* in the j-band is in the opposite sense, showing a dimmingbetween redshifts z=0.4 and z=0.9. this is consistent with a scenario in whichthe mean star formation rate in galaxies was higher in the past, while the meanstellar mass was lower, in qualitative agreement with hierarchical galaxyformation models. we find that the shape of the luminosity function is stronglydependent on spectral type and that there is strong evolution with redshift inthe relative contribution from the different spectral types to the luminositydensity.  we find good agreement in the luminosity function derived from an r-selectedand a k-selected sample at z~1, suggesting that optically selected surveys ofsimilar depth (r &lt; 24) are not missing a significant fraction of objects atthis redshift relative to a near-infrared-selected sample. we compare therest-frame b-band luminosity functions from z~0--2 with the predictions of asemi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy formation, and find qualitativelygood agreement. in particular, the model predicts at least as many opticallyluminous galaxies at z~1--2 as are implied by our observations.

astro-ph;0506425	dry mergers in gems: the dynamical evolution of massive early-type  galaxies	we have used the 28'x 28' hst image mosaic from the gems (galaxy evolutionfrom morphology and seds) survey in conjunction with the combo-17 photometricredshift survey to constrain the incidence of major mergers betweenspheroid-dominated galaxies with little cold gas (dry mergers) since z = 0.7. aset of n-body merger simulations was used to explore the morphologicalsignatures of such interactions: they are recognizable either as &lt; 5kpcseparation close pairs or because of broad, low surface brightness tidalfeatures and asymmetries. data with the depth and resolution of gems aresensitive to dry mergers between galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5 for z &lt; 0.7; drymergers at higher redshifts are not easily recovered in single-orbit hstimaging. six dry mergers (12 galaxies) with luminosity ratios between 1:1 and4:1 were found from a sample of 379 red early-type galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5and 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. the simulations suggest that the morphological signatures ofdry merging are visible for ~250myr and we use this timescale to convert theobserved merger incidence into a rate. on this basis we find that present dayspheroidal galaxies with m_v &lt; -20.5 on average have undergone between 0.5 and2 major dry mergers since z ~ 0.7. we have compared this result with thepredictions of a cold dark matter based semi-analytic galaxy formation model.the model reproduces the observed declining major merger fraction of brightgalaxies and the space density of luminous early-type galaxies reasonably well.the predicted dry merger fraction is consistent with our observational result.hence, hierarchical models predict and observations now show that major drymergers are an important driver of the evolution of massive early-type galaxiesin recent epochs.

astro-ph;0508090	the large-scale and small-scale clustering of lyman-break galaxies at  3.5 &lt; z&lt; 5.5 from the goods survey	we report on the angular correlation function of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs)at z~4 and 5 from deep samples obtained from the great observatories deeporigins survey (goods). similar to lbgs at z~3, the shape of w(theta) of thegoods lbgs is well approximated by a power-law with slope beta~0.6 at angularseparation theta &gt; 10 arcsec. the clustering strength of z~4, 5 lbgs alsodepends on the rest-frame uv luminosity, with brighter galaxies more stronglyclustered than fainter ones, implying a general correlation between halos' massand lbgs' star-formation rate. at smaller separations, w(theta) of deep samplessignificantly exceeds the extrapolation of the large-scale power-law fit,implying enhanced spatial clustering at scales r &lt; 1 mpc. we also find thatbright lbgs statistically have more faint companions on scales theta &lt; 20arcsec than fainter ones, showing that the enhanced small-scale clustering isvery likely due to sub-structure, namely the fact that massive halos can hostmultiple galaxies. a simple model for the halo occupation distribution and thecdm halo mass function reproduce well the observed w(theta). the scalingrelationship of the clustering strength with volume density and with redshiftis quantitatively consistent with that of cdm halos. a comparison of theclustering strength of three samples of equal luminosity limit at z ~ 3, 4 and5 shows that the lbgs at z~5 are hosted in halos about one order of magnitudeless massive than those in the lower redshift bins, suggesting thatstar-formation was more efficient at higher-redshift.

astro-ph;0602290	the relation between quasar and merging galaxy luminosity functions and  the merger-induced star formation rate of the universe	using a model for self-regulated growth of black holes (bhs) in mergersinvolving gas-rich galaxies, we study the relationship between quasars and thepopulation of merging galaxies and predict the merger-induced star formationrate density of the universe. mergers drive nuclear gas inflows, fuelingstarbursts and 'buried quasars' until accretion feedback expels the gas,rendering a briefly visible optical quasar. star formation is shut down andaccretion declines, leaving a passively evolving remnant with propertiestypical of red, elliptical galaxies. based on evolution of these events in oursimulations, we demonstrate that the observed statistics of merger rates,luminosity functions (lfs) and mass functions, sfr distributions, specificsfrs, quasar and quasar host galaxy lfs, and elliptical/red galaxy lfs areself-consistent and follow from one another as predicted by the mergerhypothesis. we use our simulations to de-convolve both quasar and merginggalaxy lfs to determine the birthrate of black holes of a given final mass andmerger rates as a function of stellar mass. we use this to predict the merginggalaxy lf in several observed wavebands, color-magnitude relations, massfunctions, absolute and specific sfr distributions and sfr density, and quasarhost galaxy lfs, as a function of redshift from z=0-6. we invert this andpredict e.g. quasar lfs from observed merger lfs or sfr distributions. ourresults agree well with observations, but idealized models of quasarlightcurves are ruled out by comparison of merger and quasar observations at&gt;99.9% confidence. using only observations of quasars, we estimate thecontribution of mergers to the sfr density of the universe even to highredshifts z~4.

astro-ph;0607280	ultracompact blue dwarf galaxies: hubble space telescope imaging and  stellar population analysis	we present deep hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys / highresolution channel u, narrow-v, and i images of nine "ultracompact" blue dwarfgalaxies (ucbds) selected from the sloan digital sky survey. we define ucbds aslocal (z &lt; 0.01) star-forming galaxies having angular diameters &lt; 6" andphysical sizes &lt; 1 kpc. they are also among the most metal-poor galaxies known,and are found to reside within voids. both the hst images and the objects'optical spectra reveal that they are composites of young (~1 myr) populationsthat dominate their light, and older (~10 gyr) populations that dominate theirstellar masses, which we estimate to be ~10^7 - 10^8 msol. an intermediate-agepopulation is also indicated in most cases. the objects are not as dynamicallydisturbed as the prototype ucbd, pox 186, but the structure of several of themsuggests that their current starbursts have been triggered by thecollisions/mergers of smaller clumps of stars. in one case, hs 0822+3542, theacs/hrc images resolve the object into two small (~100 pc) components whichappear to have recently collided, supporting this interpretation. in six of theobjects much of their star formation is concentrated in young massive starclusters. the evidence that the galaxies consist mainly of ~10 gyr old starsestablishes that they are not protogalaxies; their low metallicities are morelikely to be the result of the escape of supernova ejecta, as opposed to youth.these results are consistent with recent galaxy formation simulations whichpredict that cosmic re-ionization at z ~ 6 significantly limited the subsequentstar formation of dwarf galaxies in voids due to the photo-evaporation ofbaryons from their cold dark matter halos (abridged).

astro-ph;0607632	the hubble ultra deep field	this paper presents the hubble ultra deep field (hudf), a one million secondexposure of an 11 square minute-of-arc region in the southern sky with thehubble space telescope. the exposure time was divided among four filters, f435w(b435), f606w (v606), f775w (i775), and f850lp (z850), to give approximatelyuniform limiting magnitudes mab~29 for point sources. the image contains atleast 10,000 objects presented here as a catalog. few if any galaxies atredshifts greater than ~4 resemble present day spiral or elliptical galaxies.using the lyman break dropout method, we find 504 b-dropouts, 204 v-dropouts,and 54 i-dropouts. using these samples that are at different redshifts butderived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in thecharacteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in theirnumber densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. the ultraviolet luminositydensity of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than thecharacteristic luminosity, and the hudf reveals considerably more luminositythan shallower surveys. the apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxiesappears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6. thehighest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at theearliest epochs that galaxies have been observed, less than one billion yearsafter the big bang.

astro-ph;0612428	an explanation for the observed weak size evolution of disk galaxies	surveys of distant galaxies with the hubble space telescope and from theground have shown that there is only mild evolution in the relationship betweenradial size and stellar mass for galactic disks from z~1 to the present day.using a sample of nearby disk-dominated galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), and high redshift data from the gems (galaxy evolution frommorphology and seds) survey, we investigate whether this result is consistentwith theoretical expectations within the hierarchical paradigm of structureformation. the relationship between virial radius and mass for dark matterhalos in the lcdm model evolves by about a factor of two over this interval.however, n-body simulations have shown that halos of a given mass have lesscentrally concentrated mass profiles at high redshift. when we compute theexpected disk size-stellar mass distribution, accounting for this evolution inthe internal structure of dark matter halos and the adiabatic contraction ofthe dark matter by the self-gravity of the collapsing baryons, we find that thepredicted evolution in the mean size at fixed stellar mass since z~1 is about15-20 percent, in good agreement with the observational constraints from gems.at redshift z~2, the model predicts that disks at fixed stellar mass were onaverage only 60% as large as they are today. similarly, we predict that therotation velocity at a given stellar mass (essentially the zero-point of thetully-fisher relation) is only about 10 percent larger at z~1 (20 percent atz~2) than at the present day.

astro-ph;9604051	the small scale velocity dispersion of galaxies: a comparison of  cosmological simulations	the velocity dispersion of galaxies on small scales ($r\sim1h^{-1}$ mpc),$\sigma_{12}(r)$, can be estimated from the anisotropy of the galaxy-galaxycorrelation function in redshift space. we apply this technique to``mock-catalogs'' extracted from n-body simulations of several differentvariants of cold dark matter dominated cosmological models to obtain resultswhich may be consistently compared to similar results from observations. wefind a large variation in the value of $\sigma_{12}(1 h^{-1} mpc)$ in differentregions of the same simulation. we conclude that this statistic should not beconsidered to conclusively rule out any of the cosmological models we havestudied. we attempt to make the statistic more robust by removing clusters fromthe simulations using an automated cluster-removing routine, but this appearsto reduce the discriminatory power of the statistic. however, studying$\sigma_{12}$ as clusters with different internal velocity dispersions areremoved leads to interesting information about the amount of power on clusterand subcluster scales. we also compute the pairwise velocity dispersiondirectly and compare this to the values obtained using the davis-peeblesmethod, and find that the agreement is fairly good. we evaluate the models usedfor the mean streaming velocity and the pairwise peculiar velocity distributionin the original davis-peebles method by comparing the models with the resultsfrom the simulations.

astro-ph;9712142	cdm-variant cosmological models - i: simulations and preliminary  comparisons	we present two matched sets of five simulations each, covering five presentlyfavored simple modifications to the standard cold dark matter (cdm) scenario.one simulation suite, with a linear box size of 75 mpc/h, is designed for highresolution and good statistics on the group/poor cluster scale, and the other,with a box size of 300 mpc/h, is designed for good rich cluster statistics. allruns had 57 million cold particles, and models with massive neutrinos had anadditional 113 million hot particles. we consider separately models withmassive neutrinos, tilt, curvature, and a nonzero cosmological constant inaddition to the standard cdm model. we find that our tiltedomega+omega_lambda=1 (tlcdm) model produces too much small-scale power by afactor of ~3, and our open lambda=0 (ocdm) model also exceeds observedsmall-scale power by a factor of 2. in addition, we take advantage of the largedynamic range in detectable halo masses our simulations allow to check theshape of the press-schechter approximation. we find good fits at cluster massesfor delta_c=1.27--1.35 for a gaussian filter and delta_c=1.57--1.73 for atophat filter. however, press-schechter overpredicts the number density ofhalos compared to the simulations in the high resolution suite by a weaklycosmology-dependent factor of 1.5--2 at galaxy and group masses, which cannotbe fixed by adjusting delta_c within reasonable bounds. an appendix generalizesthe spherical collapse model to any isotropic cosmology.

astro-ph;9806263	the nature of lyman-break galaxies	using semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, we investigate the propertiesof $z\sim3$ galaxies and compare them with the observed population oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs). in addition to the usual quiescent mode of starformation, we introduce a physical model for starbursts triggered bygalaxy-galaxy interactions. we find that with the merger rate that arisesnaturally in the cdm-based merging hierarchy, a significant fraction of brightgalaxies identified at high redshift ($z \ga 2$) are likely to be low-mass,bursting satellite galaxies. the abundance of lbgs as a function of redshiftand the luminosity function of lbgs both appear to be in better agreement withthe data when the starburst mode is included, especially when effects of dustextinction are considered. the objects that we identify as lbgs have observableproperties including low velocity dispersions that are in good agreement withthe available data. in this ``bursting satellite'' scenario, quiescent starformation at $z\ga2$ is relatively inefficient and most of the observed lbgsare starbursts triggered by satellite mergers within massive halos. inhigh-resolution n-body simulations, we find that the most massive dark matterhalos cluster at redshift $z\sim 3$ much as the lbgs are observed to do. thisis true for both the $\omega=1$ chdm model and low-$\omega$ \lcdm and ocdmmodels, all of which have fluctuation power spectra $p(k)$ consistent with thedistribution of low-redshift galaxies. the bursting satellite scenario canresolve the apparent paradox of lbgs that cluster like massive dark matterhalos but have narrow linewidths and small stellar masses.

astro-ph;9807277	evaluating semi-analytic halo merging histories	we evaluate the accuracy of semi-analytic merger-trees by comparing them withthe merging histories of dark-matter halos in n-body simulations, focusing onthe joint distribution of the number of progenitors and their masses. we firstconfirm that the halo mass function as predicted directly by thepress-schechter (ps) model deviates from the simulations by up to 50% dependingon the mass scale and redshift, while the means of the projected distributionsof progenitor number and mass for a halo of a given mass are more accuratelypredicted by the extended ps model. we then use the full merger trees to studythe joint distribution as a function of redshift and parent-halo mass. we findthat while the deviation of the mean quantities due to the inaccuracy of theextended ps model partly propagates into the higher moments of thedistribution, the merger-tree procedure does not introduce a significantadditional source of error. in particular, certain properties of the merginghistory such as the mass ratio of the progenitors and the total accretion rateare reproduced quite accurately for galaxy sized halos ($\sim 10^{12}\msun$),and less so for larger masses. we conclude that although there could be $\sim50%$ deviations in the absolute numbers and masses of progenitors and in thehigher order moment of these distributions, the relative properties ofprogenitors for a given halo are reproduced fairly well by the merger trees.they can thus provide a useful framework for modelling galaxy formation oncethe above-mentioned limitations are taken into account.

astro-ph;9811001	the star formation history in a hierarchical universe	observations now probe the star formation history of the universe back to aredshift of $z\sim5$. we investigate whether the predictions of semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation based on hierarchical cold dark matter (cdm) typemodels are in agreement with these direct observations and also with the``fossil'' evidence contained in constraints on the ages of present dayearly-type galaxies. previous models predicted that the star formation ratedensity falls off rather steeply at $z\ga 2$, and correspondingly that themajority of the stars in the universe formed at relatively low redshift. weinvestigate the effect of including a bursting mode of star formation, assumingthat galaxy-galaxy mergers trigger starbursts and using the merger rate thatarises naturally in the cdm merging hierarchy. the resulting starburstssubstantially increase the global star formation rate at high redshift, leadingto predictions that are in good agreement with the star formation rate densityat $z\sim3$ obtained from sub-millimeter observations (scuba) and optical/uvestimates after correction for dust extinction. the mass of stars formed at $z\ge 3$ is correspondingly in better agreement with the fossil evidence. we alsoinvestigate complementary global quantities such as the mass of cold gas andthe average metallicity of cold gas as a function of redshift, and theintegrated extra-galactic background light. we argue that these observations,taken together, provide strong constraints on the star formation history of theuniverse, and that hierarchical models of the cdm type are in reasonableagreement with these observations when starbursts are included.

astro-ph;9812368	cosmological implications of lyman-break galaxy clustering	we review our analysis of the clustering properties of ``lyman-break''galaxies (lbgs) at redshift z~3, previously discussed in wechsler et al (1998).we examine the likelihood of spikes found by steidel et al (1998) in theredshift distribution of lbgs, within a suite of models for the evolution ofstructure in the universe. using high-resolution dissipationless n-bodysimulations, we analyze deep pencil-beam surveys from these models in the sameway that they are actually observed, identifying lbgs with the most massivedark matter halos. we find that all the models (with scdm as a marginalexception) have a substantial probability of producing spikes similar to thoseobserved, because the massive halos are much more clumped than the underlyingmatter -- i.e., they are biased. therefore, the likelihood of such a spike isnot a good discriminator among these models. the lbg correlation functions areless steep than galaxies today (gamma~1.4), but show similar or slightly longercorrelation lengths. we have extened this analysis and include a preliminarycomparison to the new data presented in adelberger et al (1998). we alsodiscuss work in progress, in which we use semi-analytic models to identifylyman-break galaxies within dark-matter halos.

astro-ph;9812369	making damped lyman alpha systems in semi-analytic models	the velocity profiles of weak metal absorption lines can be used toobservationally probe the kinematic state of gas in damped lyman-alpha systems.prochaska and wolfe have argued that the flat distribution of velocity widthscombined with the asymmetric line profiles indicate that the dlas are diskswith large rotation velocities. an alternative explanation has been proposed byhaehnelt, steinmetz, and rauch, in which the observed large velocity widths andasymmetric profiles can be produced by lines of sight passing through two ormore clumps each having relatively small internal velocity dispersions. weinvestigate the plausibility of this scenario in the context of semi-analyticmodels based on hierarchical merging trees and including simple treatments ofgas dynamics, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical evolution. wefind that all the observed properties of the metal-line systems including thedistribution of velocities and the asymmetric profiles, can be reproduced bylines of sight passing through sub-clumps that are bound within largervirialized dark matter halos. in order to produce enough multiple hits, we findthat the cold gas must be considerably more extended than the optical radius ofthe proto-galaxies, perhaps even beyond the tidal radius of the sub-halo. thiscould occur due to tidal stripping or supernova-driven outflows.

astro-ph;9908159	profiles of dark haloes: evolution, scatter, and environment	we study dark-matter halo density profiles in a high-resolution n-bodysimulation of an lcdm cosmology. our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloesin the range 10^{11}-10^{14} m_sun. the profiles are parameterized by an nfwform with two parameters, an inner radius r_s and a virial radius r_v, and wedefine the halo concentration c_v = r_v/r_s. first, we find that, for a givenhalo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is c_v ~1/(1+z), corresponding to a roughly constant r_s with redshift. we present animproved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relationsbetween halo parameters and their redshift dependence. the implications arethat high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer thanexpected before. second, we find that the scatter in log(c_v) is ~0.18,corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of dv/v ~ 0.12. wediscuss implications for modelling the tully-fisher relation, which has asmaller reported intrinsic scatter. third, haloes in dense environments tend tobe more concentrated than isolated haloes. these results suggest that c_v is anessential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discussimplications for the universality of the tully-fisher relation, the formationof low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the hubble sequence.

0810.2794	the correlation of star formation quenching with internal galaxy  properties and environment	we investigate the correlation of star formation quenching with internalgalaxy properties and large scale environment (halo mass) in empirical data andtheoretical models. we make use of the halo-based group catalog of yang andcollaborators, which is based on the sloan digital sky survey. data from thegalaxy evolution explorer (galex) are also used to extract the recent starformation rate. in order to investigate the environmental effects, we examinethe properties of "central" and "satellite" galaxies separately. for centralgalaxies, we are unable to conclude whether star formation quenching isprimarily connected with halo mass or stellar mass, because these twoquantities are themselves strongly correlated. for satellite galaxies, a nearlyequally strong dependence on halo mass and stellar mass is seen. we make thesame comparison for five different semi-analytic models based on threeindependently developed codes. we find that the models with agn feedbackreproduce reasonably well the dependence of the fraction of central red andpassive galaxies on halo mass and stellar mass. however, for satellitegalaxies, the same models badly overproduce the fraction of red/passivegalaxies and do not reproduce the empirical trends with stellar mass or halomass. this {\em satellite overquenching problem} is caused by the too-rapidstripping of the satellites' hot gas halos, which leads to rapid strangulationof star formation.

0810.3918	evaluating and improving semi-analytic modelling of dust in galaxies  based on radiative transfer calculations	the treatment of dust attenuation is crucial in order to compare thepredictions of galaxy formation models with multiwavelength observations. mostpast studies have either used simple analytic prescriptions or else fullradiative transfer (rt) calculations. here, we couple star formation historiesand morphologies predicted by the semi-analytic galaxy formation model morganawith rt calculations from the spectrophotometric and dust code grasil to createa library of galaxy seds from the uv/optical through the far infrared, andcompare the predictions of the rt calculations with analytic prescriptions. weconsider a low and high redshift sample, as well as an additional libraryconstructed with empirical, non-cosmological star formation histories andsimple (pure bulge or disc) morphologies. based on these libraries, we derivefitting formulae for the effective dust optical depth as a function of galaxyphysical properties such as metallicity, gas mass, and radius. we show thatsuch fitting formulae can predict the v-band optical depth with a scattersmaller than 0.4 dex for both the low and high redshift samples, but that thereis a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in the shapes of attenuation curves,probably due to geometrical variations, which our simple recipe does notcapture well. however, our new recipe provides a better approximation to thegrasil results at optical wavelength than standard analytic prescriptions fromthe literature, particularly at high redshift.

0706.0893	clustering of lyman alpha emitters at z ~ 4.5	we present the clustering properties of 151 lyman alpha emitting galaxies atz ~ 4.5 selected from the large area lyman alpha (lala) survey. our catalogcovers an area of 36' x 36' observed with five narrowband filters. we assumethat the angular correlation function w(theta) is well represented by a powerlaw a_w = theta^(-beta) with slope beta = 0.8, and we find a_w = 6.73 +/- 1.80.we then calculate the correlation length r_0 of the real-space two-pointcorrelation function xi(r) = (r/r_0)^(-1.8) from a_w through the limbertransformation, assuming a flat, lambda-dominated universe. neglectingcontamination, we find r_0 = 3.20 +/- 0.42 mpc/h. taking into account apossible 28% contamination by randomly distributed sources, we find r_0 = 4.61+/- 0.6 mpc/h. we compare these results with the expectations for theclustering of dark matter halos at this redshift in a cold dark matter model,and find that the measured clustering strength can be reproduced if theseobjects reside in halos with a minimum mass of 1-2 times 10^11 solar masses/h.our estimated correlation length implies a bias of b ~ 3.7, similar to that oflyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z ~ 3.8-4.9. however, lyman alpha emitters are afactor of ~ 2-16 rarer than lbgs with a similar bias value and implied hosthalo mass. therefore, one plausible scenario seems to be that lyman alphaemitters occupy host halos of roughly the same mass as lbgs, but shine with arelatively low duty cycle of 6-50%.
