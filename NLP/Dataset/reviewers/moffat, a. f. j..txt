0901.0698	a first orbital solution for the very massive 30 dor main-sequence  wn6h+o binary r145	we report the results of a spectroscopic and polarimetric study of themassive, hydrogen-rich wn6h stars r144 (hd 38282 = bat99-118 = brey 89) andr145 (hde 269928 = bat99-119 = brey 90) in the lmc. both stars have beensuspected to be binaries by previous studies (r144: schnurr et al. 2008b; r145:moffat 1989). we have combined radial-velocity (rv) data from these two studieswith previously unpublished polarimetric data. for r145, we were able toestablish, for the first time, an orbital period of 158.8 days, along with thefull set of orbital parameters, including the inclination angle i, which wasfound to be i = 38 \pm 9 deg. by applying a modified version of theshift-and-add method developed by demers et al. (2002), we were able to isolatethe spectral signature of the very faint-line companion star. with the rvamplitudes of both components in r145, we were thus able to estimate theirabsolute masses. we find minimum masses m_wr sin^{3}i = (116 \pm 33) m_sol andm_o sin^{3}i = (48 \pm 20)$ m_sol for the wr and the o component, respectively.thus, if the low inclination angle were correct, resulting absolute masses ofthe components would be at least 300 and 125 m_sol, respectively. however, suchhigh masses are not supported by brightness considerations when r145 iscompared to systems with known, very high masses such as ngc3603-a1 or wr20a.an inclination angle close to 90 degrees would remedy the situation, but isexcluded by the currently available data. more and better data are thusrequired to firmly establish the nature of this puzzling, yet potentially verymassive and important system. as to r144, however, the combined data sets arenot sufficient to find any periodicity.

0901.4419	binary planetary nebulae nuclei towards the galactic bulge. i. sample  discovery, period distribution and binary fraction	binarity has been hypothesised to play an important, if not ubiquitous, rolein the formation of planetary nebulae (pne). yet there remains a severe paucityof known binary central stars required to test the binary hypothesis and toplace strong constraints on the physics of the common-envelope (ce) phase ofbinary stellar evolution. large photometric surveys offer an unrivalledopportunity to efficiently discover many binary central stars. we have combinedphotometry from the ogle microlensing survey with the largest sample of pnetowards the galactic bulge to systematically search for new binaries. a totalof 21 periodic binaries were found thereby more than doubling the known sample.the orbital period distribution was found to be best described by ce populationsynthesis models when no correlation between primary and secondary masses isassumed for the initial mass ratio distribution. a comparison with post-cewhite dwarf binaries indicates both distributions are representative of thetrue post-ce period distribution with most binaries exhibiting periods lessthan one day. an estimated close binary fraction of 12--21% is derived and isthe first robust and independent validation of the prevailing 10--15% fractionestimated by bond (2000). this suggests that binarity is not a precondition forthe formation of pne and that close binaries do not play a dominant role in theshaping of nebular morphologies. systematic effects and biases of the surveyare discussed with implications for future photometric surveys.

0902.4540	orbitally modulated dust formation by the wc7+o5 colliding-wind binary  wr140	we present high-resolution infrared (2--18 micron) images of the archetypalperiodic dust-making wolf-rayet binary system wr140 (hd 193793) taken between2001 and 2005, and multi-colour (j -- [19.5]) photometry observed between 1989and 2001. the images resolve the dust cloud formed by wr140 in 2001, allowingus to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking theaverage temperature and total mass of the dust. the combination of the twodatasets constrains the optical properties of the dust. the most persistentdust features, two concentrations at the ends of a `bar' of emission to thesouth of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of324+/-8 and 243+/-7 mas/y. longer wavelength (4.68-micron and 12.5-micron)images shows dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous(1993) periastron passage and dust-formation episode. a third persistent dustconcentration to the east of the binary (the `arm') was found to have a propermotion ~ 320 mas/y. extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back tothe binary suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion 4--5 months earlierthan those in the southern `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of thebinary axis and wind-collision region (wcr) on the sky. comparison of modeldust images and the observations constrain the intervals when the wcr wasproducing sufficiently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the wcr, andsuggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axisof the wcr, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane.

physics;0703153	reduction of time-resolved space-based ccd photometry developed for most  fabry imaging data	the most (microvariability &amp; oscillations of stars) satellite obtainsultraprecise photometry from space with high sampling rates and duty cycles.astronomical photometry or imaging missions in low earth orbits, like most, areespecially sensitive to scattered light from earthshine, and all these missionshave a common need to extract target information from voluminous data cubes.they consist of upwards of hundreds of thousands of two-dimensional ccd frames(or sub-rasters) containing from hundreds to millions of pixels each, where thetarget information, superposed on background and instrumental effects, iscontained only in a subset of pixels (fabry images, defocussed images,mini-spectra). we describe a novel reduction technique for such data cubes:resolving linear correlations of target and background pixel intensities. thisstepwise multiple linear regression removes only those target variations whichare also detected in the background. the advantage of regression analysisversus background subtraction is the appropriate scaling, taking into accountthat the amount of contamination may differ from pixel to pixel. themultivariate solution for all pairs of target/background pixels is minimallyinvasive of the raw photometry while being very effective in reducingcontamination due to, e.g., stray light. the technique is tested anddemonstrated with both simulated oscillation signals and real most photometry.

0907.1929	a search for p-modes and other variability in the binary system 85  pegasi using most photometry	context: asteroseismology has great potential for the study of metal-poorstars due to its sensitivity to determine stellar ages. aims: our goal was todetect p-mode oscillations in the metal-poor sub-dwarf 85 peg a and to searchfor other variability on longer timescales. methods: we have obtainedcontinuous high-precision photometry of the binary system 85 pegasi with themost space telescope in two seasons (2005 &amp; 2007). furthermore, we redeterminedvsini for 85 peg a using high resolution spectra obtained through the esoarchive, and used photometric spot modeling to interpret long periodicvariations. results: our frequency analysis yields no convincing evidence forp-modes significantly above a noise level of 4 ppm. using simulated p-modepatterns we provide upper rms amplitude limits for 85 peg a. the light curveshows evidence for variability with a period of about 11 d and this periodicityis also seen in the follow up run in 2007; however, as different methods toremove instrumental trends in the 2005 run yield vastly different results, theexact shape and periodicity of the 2005 variability remain uncertain. ourre-determined vsini value for 85 peg a is comparable to previous studies and weprovide realistic uncertainties for this parameter. using these values incombination with simple photometric spot models we are able to reconstruct theobserved variations. conclusions: the null-detection of p-modes in 85 peg a isconsistent with theoretical values for pulsation amplitudes in this star. thedetected long-periodic variation must await confirmation by furtherobservations with similar or better precision and long-term stability. if the11 d periodicity is real, rotational modulation of surface features on one ofthe components is the most likely explanation.

1101.4959	the influence of binarity on dust obscuration events in the planetary  nebula m 2-29 and its analogues	the central star of the planetary nebula (cspn) m 2-29 shows an extraordinaryr coronae borealis-like fading event in its optical lightcurve. the only othercspn to show these events are cpd-568032 (hen 3-1333) and v651 mon (ngc 2346).dust cloud formation in the line of sight appears responsible but the exacttriggering mechanism is not well understood. understanding how planetarynebulae (pne) trigger dust obscuration events may help understand the sameprocess in a wide range of objects including population-i wc9 stars, symbioticstars and perhaps asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars with long secondaryperiods (lsps). a binary scenario involving an eccentric, wide companion thattriggers dust formation via interaction at periastron is a potentialexplanation that has been suggested for lsp variables. model fits to thelightcurves of cpd-568032 and m 2-29 show the dust forms in excess of 70 au atthe inner edge of a dust disk. in the case of cpd-568032 this radius is far toolarge to coincide with a binary companion trigger, although a binary may havebeen responsible for the formation of the dust disk. we find no direct evidenceto support previous claims of binarity in m 2-29 either from the oglelightcurve or deep medium-resolution vlt flames spectroscopy of the cspn. weclassify the cspn as of(h) with t_eff=50+-10 kk and log g=4.0+-0.3. we find amean distance of 7.4+-1.8 kpc to m 2-29 at which the m_v=-0.9 mag cspn couldpotentially hide a subgiant luminosity or fainter companion. a companion wouldhelp explain the multiple similarities with d'-type symbiotic stars whose outernebulae are thought to be bona-fide pne. the 7.4 kpc distance, oxygen abundanceof 8.3 dex and galactic coordinates (l=4.0, b=-3.0) prove that m 2-29 is agalactic bulge pn and not a halo pn as commonly misconceived.

1103.0101	global x-ray properties of the o and b stars in carina	the key empirical property of the x-ray emission from o stars is a strongcorrelation between the bolometric and x-ray luminosities. in the framework ofthe chandra carina complex project, 129 o and b stars have been detected asx-ray sources; 78 of those, all with spectral type earlier than b3, have enoughcounts for at least a rough x-ray spectral characterization. this leads to anestimate of the lx/lbol ratio for an exceptional number of 60 o stars belongingto the same region and triples the number of carina massive stars studiedspectroscopically in x-rays. the derived log(lx/lbol) is -7.26 for singleobjects, with a dispersion of only 0.21dex. using the properties of hot massivestars listed in the literature, we compare the x-ray luminosities of differenttypes of objects. in the case of o stars, the lx/lbol ratios are similar forbright and faint objects, as well as for stars of different luminosity classesor spectral types. binaries appear only slightly harder and slightly moreluminous in x-rays than single objects; the differences are not formallysignificant (at the 1% level), except for the lx/lbol ratio in the medium(1.0--2.5kev) energy band. weak-wind objects have similar x-ray luminositiesbut they display slightly softer spectra compared to "normal" o stars with thesame bolometric luminosity. discarding three overluminous objects, we find avery shallow trend of harder emission in brighter objects. the properties ofthe few b stars bright enough to yield some spectral information appear to bedifferent overall (constant x-ray luminosities, harder spectra), hinting thatanother mechanism for producing x-rays, besides wind shocks, might be at work.however, it must be stressed that the earliest and x-ray brightest amongstthese few detected objects are similar to the latest o stars, suggesting apossibly smooth transition between the two processes.

1209.6326	discovery of a magnetic field in the rapidly-rotating o-type secondary  of the colliding-wind binary hd 47129 (plaskett's star)	we report the detection of a strong, organized magnetic field in thesecondary component of the massive o8iii/i+o7.5v/iii double-lined spectroscopicbinary system hd 47129 (plaskett's star), in the context of the magnetism inmassive stars (mimes) survey. eight independent stokes $v$ observations wereacquired using the espadons spectropolarimeter at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope and the narval spectropolarimeter at the t\'elescope bernard lyot.using least-squares deconvolution we obtain definite detections of signal instokes $v$ in 3 observations. no significant signal is detected in thediagnostic null ($n$) spectra. the zeeman signatures are broad and track theradial velocity of the secondary component; we therefore conclude that therapidly-rotating secondary component is the magnetized star. correcting thepolarized spectra for the line and continuum of the (sharp-lined) primary, wemeasured the longitudinal magnetic field from each observation. thelongitudinal field of the secondary is variable and exhibits extreme values of$-810\pm 150$ g and $+680\pm 190$ g, implying a minimum surface dipole polarstrength of $2850\pm 500$ g. in contrast, we derive an upper limit ($3\sigma$)to the primary's surface magnetic field of 230 g. the combination of a strongmagnetic field and rapid rotation leads us to conclude that the secondary hostsa centrifugal magnetosphere fed through a magnetically confined wind. werevisit the properties of the optical line profiles and x-ray emission -previously interpreted as a consequence of colliding stellar winds - in thiscontext. we conclude that hd 47129 represents a heretofore unique stellarsystem - a close, massive binary with a rapidly rotating, magnetized component- that will be a rich target for further study.

1304.4591	r144 revealed as a double-lined spectroscopic binary	r144 is a wn6h star in the 30 doradus region. it is suspected to be a binarybecause of its high luminosity and its strong x-ray flux, but no periodicitycould be established so far. here, we present new xshooter multi-epochspectroscopy of r144 obtained at the eso very large telescope (vlt). we detectvariability in position and/or shape of all the spectral lines. we measureradial velocity variations with an amplitude larger than 250 km/s in niv and nvlines. furthermore, the niii and nv line doppler shifts are anti-correlated andthe niv lines show a double-peaked profile on six of our seven epochs. we thusconclude that r144 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. possible orbitalperiods range from 2 to 6 months, although a period up to one year is allowedif the orbit is highly eccentric. we estimate the spectral types of thecomponents to be wn5-6h and wn6-7h, respectively. the high luminosity of thesystem (log lbol/lsun ~ 6.8) suggests a present-day total mass content in therange of about 200 to 300 msun, depending on the evolutionary stage of thecomponents. this makes r144 the most massive binary identified so far, with atotal mass content at birth possibly as large as 400 msun. we briefly discussthe presence of such a massive object 60 pc away from the r136 cluster core inthe context of star formation and stellar dynamics.

1406.3778	brite-constellation: nanosatellites for precision photometry of bright  stars	brite-constellation (where brite stands for bright target explorer) is aninternational nanosatellite mission to monitor photometrically, in two colours,the brightness and temperature variations of stars generally brighter thanmag(v) ~ 4, with precision and time coverage not possible from the ground.  the current mission design consists of six nanosats (hence constellation):two from austria, two from canada, and two from poland. each 7 kg nanosatcarries an optical telescope of aperture 3 cm feeding an uncooled ccd. oneinstrument in each pair is equipped with a blue filter, the other with a redfilter. each brite instrument has a wide field of view (~24 degrees), so up toabout 15 bright stars can be observed simultaneously, sampled in 32 pixel x 32pixel sub-rasters. photometry of additional fainter targets, with reducedprecision but thorough time sampling, will be possible through onboard dataprocessing.  the brite sample is dominated by the most intrinsically luminous stars:massive stars seen at all evolutionary stages, and evolved medium-class starsat the very end of their nuclear burning phases. the goals ofbrite-constellation are to (1) measure p- and g-mode pulsations to probe theinteriors and ages of stars through asteroseismology; (2) look for varyingspots on the stars surfaces carried across the stellar disks by rotation, whichare the sources of co-rotating interaction regions in the winds of the mostluminous stars, probably arising from magnetic subsurface convection; and (3)search for planetary transits.

0803.1721	most photometry of the roap star 10 aql	context: we present 31.2 days of nearly continuous most photometry of theroap star 10aql. aims:the goal was to provide an unambiguous frequencyidentification for this little studied star, as well as to discuss the detectedfrequencies in the context of magnetic models and analyze the influence of themagnetic field on the pulsation. methods: using traditional fourier analysistechniques on three independent data reductions, intrinsic frequencies for thestar are identified. theoretical non-adiabatic axisymmetric modes influenced bya magnetic field having polar field strengths bp = 0-5kg were computed tocompare the observations to theory. results: the high-precision data allow usto identify three definite intrinsic pulsation frequencies and two othercandidate frequencies with low s/n. considering the observed spacings, only one(50.95microhz) is consistent with the main sequence nature of roap stars. thecomparison with theoretical models yields a best fit for a 1.95msun modelhaving solar metallicity, suppressed envelope convection, and homogenous heliumabundance. furthermore, our analysis confirms the suspected slow rotation ofthe star and sets new lower limits to the rotation period (prot&gt;1 month) andinclination (i&gt;30\pm10deg.). conclusions:the observed frequency spectrum is notrich enough to unambiguously identify a model. on the other hand, the modelshardly represent roap stars in detail due to the approximations needed todescribe the interactions of the magnetic field with stellar structure andpulsation. consequently, errors in the model frequencies needed for the fittingprocedure can only be estimated. nevertheless, it is encouraging that modelswhich suppress convection and include solar metallicity, in agreement withcurrent concepts of roap stars, fit the observations best.

1501.01377	spectroscopic variability of two oe stars	the oe stars hd45314 and hd60848 have recently been found to exhibit verydifferent x-ray properties: whilst hd60848 has an x-ray spectrum and emissionlevel typical of most ob stars, hd45314 features a much harder and brighterx-ray emission, making it a so-called gamma cas analogue. monitoring theoptical spectra could provide hints towards the origin of these very differentbehaviours. we analyse a large set of spectroscopic observations of hd45314 andhd60848, extending over 20 years. we further attempt to fit the h-alpha lineprofiles of both stars with a simple model of emission line formation in akeplerian disk. strong variations in the strengths of the h-alpha, h-beta, andhe i 5876 emission lines are observed for both stars. in the case of hd60848,we find a time lag between the variations in the equivalent widths of theselines. the emission lines are double peaked with nearly identical strengths ofthe violet and red peaks. the h-alpha profile of this star can be successfullyreproduced by our model of a disk seen under an inclination of 30 degrees. inthe case of hd45314, the emission lines are highly asymmetric and displaystrong line profile variations. we find a major change in behaviour between the2002 outburst and the one observed in 2013. this concerns both the relationshipbetween the equivalent widths of the various lines and their morphologies atmaximum strength (double-peaked in 2002 versus single-peaked in 2013). oursimple disk model fails to reproduce the observed h-alpha line profiles ofhd45314. our results further support the interpretation that oe stars do havedecretion disks similar to those of be stars. whilst the emission lines ofhd60848 are explained by a disk with a keplerian velocity field, the disk ofhd45314 seems to have a significantly more complex velocity field that could berelated to the phenomenon that produces its peculiar x-ray emission.

astro-ph;0201091	atca radio imaging of the proplyd-like objects in the giant hii region  ngc 3603	three cometary-shaped objects in the giant hii region ngc 3603, originallyfound and identified as proto-planetary disks (proplyds) by brandner et al.2000 using hst+vlt in the optical and near-infrared, have been detected withthe australia telescope compact array (atca) in the radio continuum at 3 and6cm. all three proplyd-like objects are clearly resolved with an extent of afew arcseconds. the integrated 6cm fluxes are up to 1.3 times higher than the3cm fluxes with spectral indices averaged over the whole clump between$\alpha=-0.1$ and -0.5 ($s_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$), indicating the likelypresence of non-thermal emission in at least some of the sources. all measuredfluxes are at least one order of magnitude higher than those predicted bybrandner et al. 2000. due to the unexpectedly large radio luminosities of theproplyd-like features and because the radio emission is extended a(proto-)stellar origin of the non-thermal emission from a dust enshrouded starappears unlikely. instead we propose that magnetized regions within theenvelope of the proplyd-like nebulae exist.

astro-ph;0204212	high-resolution x-ray imaging of the colliding wind shock in wr147	we analyze new high-resolution chandra x-ray images of the wolf-rayet binarysystem wr147. this system contains a wn8 star with an early-type companionlocated 0.6'' to its north, and is the only known early-type binary with aseparation on the sky large enough for the wind-wind collision between thestars to currently be resolved at x-ray energies. the 5 ksec chandra hrc-iimage provides the first direct evidence for spatially extended x-ray emissionin an early-type binary system. the x-ray emission peaks close to the positionof the radio bow shock and north of the wn8 star. a deeper x-ray image isneeded to accurately determine the degree of spatial extension, to exactlyalign the x-ray and optical/radio frames, and to determine whether part of thedetected x-ray emission arises in the individual stellar winds. simulated x-rayimages of the wind-wind collision have a fwhm consistent with the data, andmaximum likelihood fits suggest that a deeper observation may also constrainthe inclination and wind momentum ratio of this system. however, as the wr winddominates the colliding wind x-ray emission it appears unlikely that themass-loss rate and the terminal velocity of the companion wind can beseparately determined from x-ray observations. we also note an inconsistencybetween numerical and analytical estimates of the x-ray luminosity ratio of thestronger and weaker wind components, and conclude that the analytical resultsare in error.

astro-ph;0602036	delta ceti is not monoperiodic: seismic modeling of a beta cephei star  from most spacebased photometry	the beta cephei star delta ceti was considered one of the few monoperiodicvariables in the class. despite (or perhaps because of) its apparently simpleoscillation spectrum, it has been challenging and controversial to identifythis star's pulsation mode and constrain its physical parameters seismically.broadband time-resolved photometry of delta ceti spanning 18.7 days with a dutycycle of about 65% obtained by the most (microvariability &amp; oscillations ofstars) satellite -- the first scientific observations ever obtained by most --reveals that the star is actually multiperiodic. besides the well-knowndominant frequency of f1 = 6.205886/d, we have discovered in the most data itsfirst harmonic 2f1 and three other frequencies (f2 = 3.737/d, f3 = 3.673/d andf4 = 0.318/d), all detected with s/n &gt; 4. in retrospect, f2 was also present inarchival spectral line profile data but at lower s/n. we present seismic modelswhose modes match exactly the frequencies f1 and f2. only one model fallswithin the common part of the error boxes of the star's observed surfacegravity and effective temperature from photometry and spectroscopy. in thismodel, f1 is the radial (l = 0) first overtone and f2 is the g2 (l = 2, m = 0)mode. this model has a mass of 10.2+/-0.2 msun and an age of 17.9+/-0.3 millionyears, making delta ceti an evolved beta cephei star. if f2 and f3 arerotationally split components of the same g2 mode, then the star's equatorialrotation velocity is either 27.6 km/s or half this value. given its vsini ofabout 1 km/s, this implies we are seeing delta ceti nearly pole-on.

astro-ph;9901269	a 2.3-day periodic variability in the apparently single wolf-rayet star  wr 134: collapsed companion or rotational modulation?	we present the results of an intensive campaign of spectroscopic andphotometric monitoring of the peculiar wolf-rayet star wr 134 from 1989 to1997.  this unprecedentedly large data set allows us to confirm unambiguously theexistence of a coherent 2.25 +/- 0.05 day periodicity in the line-profilechanges of he ii 4686, although the global pattern of variability is differentfrom one epoch to another. this period is only marginally detected in thephotometric data set. assuming the 2.25 day periodic variability to be inducedby orbital motion of a collapsed companion, we develop a simple model aiming atinvestigating (i) the effect of this strongly ionizing, accreting companion onthe wolf-rayet wind structure, and (ii) the expected emergent x-ray luminosity.we argue that the predicted and observed x-ray fluxes can only be matched ifthe accretion on the collapsed star is significantly inhibited. additionally,we performed simulations of line-profile variations caused by the orbitalrevolution of a localized, strongly ionized wind cavity surrounding the x-raysource. a reasonable fit is achieved between the observed and modeledphase-dependent line profiles of he ii 4686. however, the derived size of thephotoionized zone substantially exceeds our expectations, given the observedlow-level x-ray flux. alternatively, we explore rotational modulation of apersistent, largely anisotropic outflow as the origin of the observed cyclicalvariability. although qualitative, this hypothesis leads to greater consistencywith the observations.

0810.1932	photometric variability of wc9 stars	do some wolf-rayet stars owe their strong winds to something else besidesradiation pressure? the answer to this question is still not entirely obvious,especially in certain wolf-rayet subclasses, mainly wn8 and wc9. both of thesetypes of wolf-rayet stars are thought to be highly variable, as suggested byobservations, possibly due to pulsations. however, only the wn8 stars have sofar been vigorously and systematically investigated for variability. we presenthere the results of a systematic survey during 3 consecutive weeks of 19galactic wc9 stars and 1 wc8 star for photometric variability in two opticalbands, v and i. of particular interest are the correlated variations inbrightness and colour index in the context of carbon-dust formation, whichoccurs frequently in wc9 and some wc8 stars. in the most variable case, wr76,we used this information to derive a typical dust grain size of ~ 0.1 um.however, most photometric variations occur at surprisingly low levels and infact almost half of our sample shows no significant variability at all abovethe instrumental level (sigma ~ 0.005 - 0.01 mag).
