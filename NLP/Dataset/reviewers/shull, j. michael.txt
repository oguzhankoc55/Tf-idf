0904.4901	a large reservoir of ionized gas in the galactic halo: ionized silicon  in high-velocity and intermediate-velocity clouds	the low galactic halo is enveloped by a sheath of ionized, low-metallicitygas, which can provide a substantial (1 m_sun/yr) cooling inflow to replenishstar formation in the disk. using absorption spectra from the hst and fusetoward 37 active galactic nuclei at high latitude, we detect widespreadinterstellar siiii 1206.5 absorption: 61 high-velocity clouds (hvcs) along 30sight lines and 22 intermediate-velocity clouds (ivcs) along 20 sight lines. wefind a segregation of redshifted and blueshifted absorbers across the galacticrotation axis at l=180, consistent with a lag in the rotation velocity abovethe galactic plane. the hvc sky coverage is large (81+-5% for 30/37 directions)with siiii optical depth typically 4-5 times that of ovi 1032. the mean hvccolumn density per sight line, &lt;log n_siiii&gt;=13.42+-0.21, corresponds to totalcolumn density n_hii~6x10^18)/(z_si/0.2z_sun) of ionized low-metallicity gas,similar to that inferred in ovi. this reservoir could total 10^8 m_sun andproduce a mass infall rate ~1 m_sun/yr. by modeling siii, siiii, siiv, and hiin a subset of absorbers, we constrain the mean photoionization parameter inthe low halo, &lt;log u&gt; = -3.0 (+0.3,-0.4), approximately ten times lower thanobserved in the low-redshift intergalactic medium. the metallicities in somehvcs, derived from [siii/hi], are 10-30% solar, whereas values found from allthree silicon ions are lower in the pure-photoionization models. thse formallylower metallicities are highly uncertain, since some of the higher ions may becollisionally ionized. the mean si metallicities, &lt;logz_si/z_sun)&gt;=-2.1(+1.1,-0.3) in 17 hvcs and -1.0(+0.6,-1.0) in 19 ivcs, are somewhatuncertain owing to ionization modeling, but consistent with the medianphotometric metallicity, [fe/h]=-1.46+-0.30, for ~2e5 halo f/g stars in sdss.

0906.5001	highly ionized envelopes of high velocity clouds	we present recent results on highly ionized gas in galactic high-velocityclouds (hvcs), originally surveyed in ovi (sembach et al. 2003). in a newfuse/hst survey of siii/iii/iv (shull et al. 2009) toward 37 agn, we detectedsiiii (lambda 1206.500 a) absorption with a sky coverage fraction 81 +/- 5% (61hvcs along 30 of 37 high-latitude sight lines). the siiii (lambda 1206.500 a)line is typically 4-5 times stronger than ovi (lambda 1031.926 a). the mean hvccolumn density of perhaps 10^19 cm^-2 of low-metallicity (0.1 - 0.2 z_sun)ionized gas in the low halo. recent determinations of hvc distances allow us toestimate a total reservoir of ~10^8 m_sun. estimates of infall velocitiesindicate an infall rate of around 1 m_sun yr^-1, comparable to thereplenishment rate for star formation in the disk. hvcs appear to be sheathedby intermediate-temperature gas (10^4.0 - 10^4.5 k) detectable in siiii andsiiv, as well as hotter gas seen in ovi and other high ions. to prepare for hstobservations of 10 hvc-selected sight lines with the cosmic originsspectrograph (cos), we compile fuse/stis spectra of these ions, plus feiii,ciii, civ, and siv. better constraints on the physical properties of hvcenvelopes and careful treatment of hvc kinematics and infall rates should comefrom high-quality (s/n ~ 30-40) cos data.

0912.1603	broad hi absorbers as metallicity-independent tracers of the warm-hot  intergalactic medium	thermally broadened ly alpha absorbers (blas) offer an alternative method tohighly-ionized metal lines for tracing the whim. we compile a catalog ofreliable bla candidates along seven agn sight lines from a larger set of lyaabsorbers observed by hst/stis. we compare our measurements based onindependent reduction and analysis of the data to those published by otherresearch groups. purported blas are grouped into probable (15), possible (48)and non-bla (56) categories. we infer a line frequency (dn/dz)_bla=18+-11,comparable to observed ovi absorbers. there is significant overlap between blaand ovi absorbers (20-40%) and we find that ovi detections in blas are foundcloser to galaxies than ovi non-detections. based on 164 measured cog hi linemeasurements, we statistically correct the observed line widths via a monte-carlo simulation. gas temperature and neutral fraction f(hi) are inferred fromthese statistically-corrected line widths and lead to a distribution of totalhydrogen columns. we find omega_bla=(6.3+1.1-0.8)x10^-3. there are a number ofcritical systematic assumptions implicit in this calculation, and we discusshow each affects our results and those of previously published work. taking ourvalue, current ovi and bla surveys can account for ~20% of the baryons in thelocal universe. finally, we present new, high-s/n observations of several ofthe bla candidate lines from early release observations made by the cosmicorigins spectrograph on hst.

1006.3519	the effect of galactic properties on the escape fraction of ionizing  photons	the escape fraction, fesc, of ionizing photons from early galaxies is acrucial parameter for determining whether the observed galaxies at z &gt; 6 areable to reionize the high-redshift intergalactic medium. previous attempts tomeasure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 tonearly 1. rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify throughmodeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the densityand distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate ofionizing photons production. we find that the escape fraction dependssensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of theclumped and interclump medium. one must therefore be cautious when dealing withan inhomogeneous medium. fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escapefraction than more numerous low-density clumps. when more ionizing photons areproduced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily fromthe gas layers. large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused bydifferences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observeddifferences in fesc among galaxies. values of fesc must also be consistent withthe reionization history. high-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize theuniverse, because fesc &gt; 1 would be required. small galaxies are needed toachieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past.

1009.0261	the nature of the warm/hot intergalactic medium i. numerical methods,  convergence, and ovi absorption	we perform a series of cosmological simulations using enzo, an eulerianadaptive-mesh refinement, n-body + hydrodynamical code, applied to study thewarm/hot intergalactic medium. the whim may be an important component of thebaryons missing observationally at low redshift. we investigate the dependenceof the global star formation rate and mass fraction in various baryonic phaseson spatial resolution and methods of incorporating stellar feedback. althoughboth resolution and feedback significantly affect the total mass in the whim,all of our simulations find that the whim fraction peaks at z ~ 0.5, decliningto 35-40% at z = 0. we construct samples of synthetic ovi absorption lines fromour highest-resolution simulations, using several models of oxygen ionizationbalance. models that include both collisional ionization and photoionizationprovide excellent fits to the observed number density of absorbers per unitredshift over the full range of column densities (10^13 cm-2 &lt;= n_ovi &lt;= 10^15cm^-2). models that include only collisional ionization provide better fits forhigh column density absorbers (n_ovi &gt; 10^14 cm^-2). the distribution of ovi indensity and temperature exhibits two populations: one at t ~ 10^5.5 k(collisionally ionized, 55% of total ovi) and one at t ~ 10^4.5 k(photoionized, 37%) with the remainder located in dense gas near galaxies.while not a perfect tracer of hot gas, ovi provides an important tool for awhim baryon census.

0708.4362	the metallicity of intergalactic gas in cosmic voids	we have used the hubble/stis and fuse archives of ultraviolet spectra ofbright agn to identify intergalactic lya absorbers in nearby (z &lt; 0.1) voids.  from a parent sample of 651 lya absorbers, we identified 61 void absorberslocated more than 1.4/h_70 mpc from the nearest l* or brighter galaxy.searching for metal absorption in high-quality (s/n &gt; 10) spectra at thelocation of three diagnostic metal lines (o vi 1032, c iv 1548, si iii 1206),we detected no metal lines in any individual absorber, or in any group ofabsorbers using pixel co-addition techniques. the best limits on metal-lineabsorption in voids were set using four strong lya absorbers with n(h i) &gt;10^{14} cm^-2, with 3-sigma equivalent-width limits ranging from 8 ma (o vi),7-15 ma (c iv), and 4-10 ma (si iii). photoionization modeling yieldsmetallicity limits z &lt; 10^{-1.8+/-0.4} z_sun, from non-detections of c iv and ovi, some 6 times lower than those seen in lya and ovi absorbers at z &lt; 0.1.although the void lya absorbers could be pristine material, considerably deeperspectra are required to rule out a universal metallicity floor produced bybursts of early star formation, with no subsequent star formation in the voids.the most consistent conclusion derived from these low-z results, and similarsearches at z = 3-5, is that galaxy filaments have increased their mean igmmetallicity by factors of 30-100 since z = 3.

0709.0022	critical metallicities for second-generation stars	the first massive stars may influence the formation of second-generationstars, in part by their metal enrichment of the surrounding gas. we investigatethe "critical metallicity", defined as the the value, z_crit, at whichprimordial gas cools more efficiently by fine-structure lines of o i (63.18microns, si ii 34.8 microns, fe ii (25.99 and 35.35 microns), and c ii (157.74microns) than by either h i or h2 line emission. we explore the time-dependentthermodynamics and fragmentation of cooling gas at redshifts z = 10-30, seededby trace heavy elements expelled from early supernovae. because different modesof nucleosynthesis (alpha-process, fe-group) produce abundance ratios far fromsolar values, these early stellar populations are likely to be influenced by o,si, and fe cooling. our models also include radiative coupling of the finestructure lines and h2 to the cosmic microwave background (cmb), which sets atemperature floor (70-80k at z = 25-30) that may increase the jeans mass. theh2 forms from catalytic effects of electrons left over from the recombinationepoch or produced during virialization. these electrons form the h^- ion (h + e-&gt; h- + gamma), which in turn forms h2 through associative detachment (h- + h-&gt; h2 + e). in virialized halos at z = 10-30, the gas densities (n = 1-100cm^{-3}) are well below the critical densities, n_cr = 10^{5-6} cm^{-3}, atwhich (o, si, fe) fine-structure lines reach lte populations and produce theirmost efficient cooling. thus, z_crit may initially exceed 0.01 z_sun at n =1-100 cm^{-3}, and then drop to 10^{-3.5} z_sun at n = 10^6 cm^{-3}, where thejeans mass may be imprinted on the stellar mass function. primordial clouds of10^8 m_sun at 0.01 z_sun and 200k will produce redshifted fine structure lines,with fluxes between 10^{-22} and 10^{-21} watts/m^2 at z = 4.

1012.0592	ultraviolet and x-ray variability of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy markarian  817	we present an investigation of the ultraviolet and x-ray spectra of theseyfert 1.5 galaxy markarian 817. the ultraviolet analysis includes two recentobservations taken with the cosmic origins spectrograph in august and december2009, as well as archival spectra from the international ultraviolet explorerand the hubble space telescope. twelve ly-alpha absorption features aredetected in the 1997 ghrs and 2009 cos spectra - of these, four are associatedwith high-velocity clouds in the interstellar medium, four are atlow-significance, and the remaining four are intrinsic features, which varybetween the ghrs and cos observations. the strongest intrinsic absorber in the1997 spectrum has a systemic velocity of ~ -4250 km/s. the correspondingfeature in the cos data is five times weaker than the ghrs absorber. the threeadditional weak (equivalent width from 13-54 ma) intrinsic ly-alpha absorbersare at systemic velocities of -4100 km/s, -3550 km/s, and -2600 km/s. however,intrinsic absorption troughs from highly ionized c iv and n v, are not detectedin the cos observations. no ionized absorption signatures are detected in the ~14 ks xmm-newton epic spectra. the factor of five change in the intrinsicly$\alpha$ absorber is most likely due to bulk motions in the absorber, sincethere is no drastic change in the uv luminosity of the source from the ghrs tothe cos observations. in a study of variability of mrk 817, we find that thex-ray luminosity varies by a factor of ~40 over 20 years, while the uvcontinuum/emission lines vary by at most a factor of ~2.3 over 30 years. thevariability of the x-ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the x-raypower-law index, but no correlation is found with the simultaneous optical/uvphotometry.

1102.1980	multiple absorption-line spectroscopy of the intergalactic medium. i.  model	we present a physically-based absorption-line model for the spectroscopicstudy of the intergalactic medium (igm). this model adopts results from cloudysimulations and theoretical calculations by gnat and sternberg (2007) toexamine the resulting observational signatures of the absorbing gas with thefollowing ionization scenarios: collisional ionization equilibrium (cie),photoionization equilibrium, hybrid (photo- plus collisional ionization), andnon-equilibrium cooling. as a demonstration, we apply this model to newobservations made with the cosmic origins spectrograph aboard the hubble spacetelescope of the igm absorbers at z~0.1877 along the 1es 1553+113 sight line.we identify ly alpha, c iii, o vi, and n v absorption lines with two distinctvelocity components (blue at z_b=0.18757; red at z_r=0.18772) separated bydelta(cz)/(1+z)~38 km/s. joint analyses of these lines indicate that none ofthe examined ionization scenarios can be applied with confidence to the bluevelocity component, although photoionization seems to play a dominant role. forthe red component, cie can be ruled out, but pure photoionization and hybridscenarios (with t&lt;1.3e5 k) are more acceptable. the constrained ranges ofhydrogen density and metallicity of the absorbing gas are n_h=(1.9-2.3)e-5cm^-3 and z=(0.43-0.67)z_solar. these constraints indicate ovi and hiionization fractions, f_ovi=0.10-0.15 and f_hi=(3.2-5.1)e-5, with totalhydrogen column density n_h=(0.7-1.2)e18 cm^-2. this demonstration shows thatjoint analysis of multiple absorption lines can constrain the ionization stateof an absorber, and results used to estimate the baryonic matter contained inthe absorber.

1112.2706	the baryon census in a multiphase intergalactic medium: 30% of the  baryons may still be missing	for low-redshift cosmology and galaxy formation rates, it is important toaccount for all the baryons synthesized in the big bang. although galaxies andclusters contain 10% of the baryons, many more reside in the photoionizedlyman-alpha forest and shocked-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) at t= 10^5 to 10^7 k. current tracers of whim at 10^5 to 10^6 k include the o vi1032, 1038 absorption lines, together with broad lyman-alpha absorbers (blas)and euv/x-ray absorption lines from ne viii, o vii, and o viii. we improve theo vi baryon surveys with corrections for oxygen metallicity (z/zsun) and o viionization fraction (f_ovi) using cosmological simulations of heating, cooling,and metal transport in a density-temperature structured medium. statistically,their product correlates with column density, (z/zsun)(f_ovi) =(0.015)(n_ovi/10^{14} cm^-2)^0.70. the n_ovi-weighted mean is 0.01, whichdoubles previous estimates of whim baryon content. we also reanalyze h i datafrom the hubble space telescope, applying redshift corrections for absorberdensity, photoionizing background, and proper length, dl/dz. we findsubstantial baryon fractions in the photoionized lya forest (28 +/- 11%), ovi/bla-traced whim (25 +/- 8%), and collapsed phase (18 +/- 4%) in galaxies,groups, clusters, and circumgalactic gas. the baryon shortfall is 29 +/- 13%,which may be detected in x-ray absorbers from hotter whim or in weaker lya ando vi absorbers. further progress will require higher-precision baryon surveysof weak absorbers at column densities n_hi &gt; 10^{12.0} cm^-2, n_ovi &gt; 10^{12.5}cm^-2, and n_ovii &gt; 10^{14.5} cm^-2, with moderate-resolution uv and x-rayspectrographs.

1202.0010	gamma-ray-burst host galaxy surveys at redshift z&gt;4: probes of star  formation rate and cosmic reionization	measuring the star formation rate (sfr) at high redshift is crucial forunderstanding cosmic reionization and galaxy formation. two commoncomplementary approaches are lyman-break-galaxy (lbg) surveys for large samplesand gamma-ray-burst (grb) observations for sensitivity to sfr in smallgalaxies. the z&gt;4 grb-inferred sfr is higher than the lbg rate, but thisdifference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modelingassumptions. using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model,with star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature tvir&gt;2e4 k(m_dm&gt;2e8 m_sun), we show that grb and lbg-derived sfrs are consistent if grbsextend to faint galaxies (m_ab&lt;-11). to test star formation below the detectionlimit l_lim~0.05l^*_{z=3} of lbg surveys, we propose to measure the fractionf_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) of grb hosts with l&gt;l_lim. this fraction quantifies themissing star formation fraction in lbg surveys, constraining themass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modelingassumptions. because f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of starformation rates derived from lbg and grb surveys, if these estimators areunbiased, measuring f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution ofthe grb production rate per unit mass of star formation. our analysis predictssignificant success for grb host detections at z~5 with f_det(l&gt;l_lim,z)~0.4,but rarer detections at z&gt;6. by analyzing the upper limits on host-galaxyluminosities of six z&gt;5 grbs from literature data, we infer that galaxies withm_ab&gt;-15 were present at z&gt;5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating the key roleplayed by very faint galaxies during reionization.

1212.4452	the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from galaxies	the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies plays a critical role in theevolution of gas in galaxies, and the heating and ionization history of theintergalactic medium. we present semi-analytic calculations of the escapefraction of ionizing radiation for both hydrogen and helium from galaxiesranging from primordial systems to disk-type galaxies that are not heavilydust-obscured. we consider variations in the galaxy density profile, sourcetype, location, and spectrum, and gas overdensity/distribution factors. forsufficiently hard first-light sources, the helium ionization fronts closelytrack or advance beyond that of hydrogen. key new results in this work includecalculations of the escape fractions for he i and he ii ionizing radiation, andthe impact of partial ionization from x-rays from early agn or stellar clusterson the escape fractions from galaxy halos. when factoring infrequency-dependent effects, we find that x-rays play an important role inboosting the escape fractions for both hydrogen and helium, but especially forhe ii. we briefly discuss the implications of these results for recentobservations of the he ii reionization epoch at low redshifts, as well as theuv data and emission-line signatures from early galaxies anticipated fromfuture satellite missions.

1212.5658	characterizing the circumgalactic medium of nearby galaxies with hst/cos  and hst/stis absorption-line spectroscopy	the circumgalactic medium (cgm) of late-type galaxies is characterized usinguv spectroscopy of 11 targeted qso/galaxy pairs at z &lt; 0.02 with the hubblespace telescope cosmic origins spectrograph and ~60 serendipitousabsorber/galaxy pairs at z &lt; 0.2 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph.cgm warm cloud properties are derived, including volume filling factors of3-5%, cloud sizes of 0.1-30 kpc, masses of 10-1e8 solar masses andmetallicities of 0.1-1 times solar. almost all warm cgm clouds within 0.5virial radii are metal-bearing and many have velocities consistent with beingbound, "galactic fountain" clouds. for galaxies with l &gt; 0.1 l*, the total massin these warm cgm clouds approaches 1e10 solar masses, ~10-15% of the totalbaryons in massive spirals and comparable to the baryons in their parent galaxydisks. this leaves &gt;50% of massive spiral-galaxy baryons "missing". dwarfs(&lt;0.1 l*) have smaller area covering factors and warm cgm masses (&lt;5% baryonfraction), suggesting that many of their warm clouds escape. constant warmcloud internal pressures as a function of impact parameter ($p/k ~ 10 cm^{-3}k) support the inference that previous cos detections of broad, shallow o viand ly-alpha absorptions are of an extensive (~400-600 kpc), hot (t ~ 1e6 k)intra-cloud gas which is very massive (&gt;1e11 solar masses). while the warm cgmclouds cannot account for all the "missing baryons" in spirals, the hotintra-group gas can, and could account for ~20% of the cosmic baryon census atz ~ 0 if this hot gas is ubiquitous among spiral groups.

1301.4242	hst/cos spectra of three qsos that probe the circumgalactic medium of a  single spiral galaxy: evidence for gas recycling and outflow	we have used the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) to obtain far-uv spectraof three closely-spaced qso sight lines that probe the circumgalactic medium(cgm) of an edge-on spiral galaxy, eso 157-49, at impact parameters of 74 and93 kpc near its major axis and 172 kpc along its minor axis. h i ly\alpha\absorption is detected at the galaxy redshift in the spectra of all three qsos,and metal lines of si iii, si iv, and c iv are detected along the twomajor-axis sight lines. photoionization models of these clouds suggestmetallicities close to the galaxy metallicity, cloud sizes of ~1 kpc, and gasmasses of ~10^4 solar masses. given the high covering factor of these clouds,eso 157-49 could harbor ~2x10^9 solar masses of warm cgm gas. we detect nometals in the sight line that probes the galaxy along its minor axis, but gasat the galaxy metallicity would not have detectable metal absorption withionization conditions similar to the major-axis clouds. the kinematics of themajor-axis clouds favor these being portions of a "galactic fountain" ofrecycled gas, while two of the three minor-axis clouds are constrainedgeometrically to be outflowing gas.  in addition, one of our qso sight lines probes a second more distant spiral,eso 157-50, along its major axis at an impact parameter of 88 kpc. strong h ily\alpha\ and c iv absorption only are detected in the qso spectrum at theredshift of eso 157-50.

1307.2244	bringing simulation and observation together to better understand the  intergalactic medium	the methods by which one characterizes the distribution of matter incosmological simulations is intrinsically different from how one performs thesame task observationally. in this paper, we make substantial steps towardscomparing simulations and observations of the intergalactic medium (igm) in amore sensible way. we present a pipeline that generates and fits synthetic qsoabsorption spectra using sight lines cast through a cosmological simulation,and simultaneously identifies structure by directly analyzing the variations inhi and ovi number density. we compare synthetic absorption spectra with a lessobservationally motivated, but more straightforward density threshold-basedmethod for finding absorbers. our efforts focus on hi and ovi to bettercharacterize the warm/hot intergalactic medium, a subset of the igm that ischallenging to conclusively identify observationally. we find that the twomethods trace roughly the same quantities of hi and ovi above observable columndensity limits, but the synthetic spectra typically identify more substructurein absorbers. we use both methods to characterize hi and ovi absorberproperties. we find that both integrated and differential column densitydistributions from both methods generally agree with observations. thedistribution of doppler parameters between the two methods are similar for lyaand compare reasonably with observational results, but while the two methodsagree with each other with ovi systems, they both are systematically differentfrom observations. we find a strong correlation between ovi baryon fraction andovi column density. we also discuss a possible bimodality in the temperaturedistribution of the gas traced by ovi.

1307.6560	ultraviolet emission-line correlations in hubble/cos spectra of active  galactic nuclei: single-epoch black hole masses	effective methods of measuring supermassive black hole masses in activegalactic nuclei (agn) are of critical importance to studies of galaxyevolution. while there has been much success obtaining masses throughreverberation mapping, the extensive observing time required by this method haslimited the practicality of applying it to large samples at a variety ofredshifts. this limitation highlights the need to estimate these masses usingsingle-epoch spectroscopy of ultraviolet emission lines. we use ultravioletspectra of 44 agn from hst/cos, iue, and fuse of the civ 1549, ovi 1035, oiii]1664, heii 1640, cii 1335, and mgii 2800 emission lines and explore theirpotential as tracers of the broad-line region and supermassive black hole mass.the higher s/n and better spectral resolution of the cosmic originsspectrograph on hubble space telescope resolves agn intrinsic absorption andproduces more accurate line widths. from these, we test the viability ofmass-scaling relationships based on line widths and luminosities and carry outa principal component analysis based on line luminosities, widths, skewness,and kurtosis. at l_{1450} &lt; 10^{45} erg/s, the uv line luminosities correlatewell with hbeta, as does the 1450 angstrom continuum luminosity. we find thatciv, ovi, and mgii can be used as reasonably accurate estimators of agn blackhole masses, while heii and cii are uncorrelated.

1401.5799	where do galaxies end?	our current view of galaxies considers them as systems of stars and gasembedded in extended halos of dark matter, much of it formed by the infall ofsmaller systems at earlier times. the true extent of a galaxy remains poorlydetermined, with the virial radius (r_vir) providing a characteristicseparation between collapsed structures in dynamical equilibrium and externalinfalling matter. other physical estimates of the extent of gravitationalinfluence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and"galactopause" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range ofoutflow parameters and confining gas pressures. physical criteria are proposedto define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of r_vir (m*,m_h, z_a) for stellar mass m* and halo mass m_h, half of which formed at"assembly redshifts" z_a = 0.7-1.3. we estimate the extent of bound gas anddark matter around l* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. the new virial radii, with meanr_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent hst/cosdetections of h i and o vi absorbers around galaxies. in the new formalism, themilky way stellar mass, log m* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to r_vir = 153(+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03. the frequencyper unit redshift of low-redshift o vi absorption lines in qso spectra suggestsabsorber sizes ~150 kpc when related to intervening 0.1l* galaxies. thisformalism is intended to clarify semantic differences arising from observationsof extended gas in galactic halos, circumgalactic medium (cgm), and filamentsof the intergalactic medium (igm). astronomers should refer to bound gas in thegalactic halo or cgm, and unbound gas at the cgm-igm interface, on its way intothe igm.

1501.01976	the efficiency of stellar reionization: effects of rotation,  metallicity, and initial mass function	we compute the production rate of photons in the ionizing lyman continua(lyc) of h i (lambda &lt; 912 a), he i (lambda &lt; 504 a), and he ii (lambda &lt; 228a) using recent stellar evolutionary tracks coupled to a grid of non-lte,line-blanketed (wm-basic) model atmospheres. the median lyc productionefficiency is q_lyc = (6+/-2)x10^60 lyc photons per msun of star formation(range [3.1-9.4]x10^60) corresponding to a revised calibration of10^{53.3+/-0.2} photons/s per msun/yr. efficiencies in the helium continua areq_hei ~ 10^60 photons/msun and q_heii ~ 10^56 photons/msun at solar metallicityand larger at low metallicity. the critical star formation rate needed tomaintain reionization against recombinations at z = 7 is rho_sfr = (0.012msun/yr/mpc^3) [(1+z)/8]^3 [(c_h /3) (0.2/ f_esc) for fiducial values of igmclumping factor c_h = 3 and lyc escape fraction f_esc = 0.2. the boost in lycproduction efficiency is an important ingredient, together with metallicity,c_h, and f_esc, in assessing whether igm reionization was complete by z ~ 7.monte-carlo sampled spectra of coeval starbursts during the first 5 myr haveintrinsic flux ratios of f(1500)/f(900) = 0.4-0.5 and f(912^-)/f(912^+) =0.4-0.7 in the far-uv (1500a), the lyc (900a), and at the lyman edge (912a).these ratios can be used to calibrate the lyc escape fractions in starbursts.

1502.00637	the metagalactic ionizing background: a crisis in uv photon production  or incorrect galaxy escape fractions?	recent suggestions of a "photon underproduction crisis" (kollmeier \etal\2014) have generated concern over the intensity and spectrum of ionizingphotons in the metagalactic ultraviolet background (uvb). the balance ofhydrogen photoionization and recombination determines the opacity of thelow-redshift intergalactic medium (igm). we calibrate the hydrogenphotoionization rate ($\gamma_{\rm h}$) by comparing {\it hubble spacetelescope} spectroscopic surveys of the low-redshift column densitydistribution of \hi\ absorbers and the observed ($z &lt; 0.4$) mean \lya\ fluxdecrement, $d_a = (0.014)(1+z)^{2.2}$, to new cosmological simulations. thedistribution, $f(n_{\rm hi}, z) \equiv d^2 {\cal n} / d(\log n_{\rm hi}) dz$,is consistent with an increased uvb that includes contributions from bothquasars and galaxies. our recommended fit, $\gamma_{\rm h}(z) = (4.6 \times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1})(1+z)^{4.4}$ for $0 &lt; z &lt; 0.47$, corresponds tounidirectional lyc photon flux $\phi_0 \approx 5700$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ at $z =0$. this flux agrees with observed igm metal ionization ratios (\ciii/\civ\ and\siiii/\siiv) and suggests a 25-30\% contribution of \lya\ absorbers to thecosmic baryon inventory. the primary uncertainties in the low-redshift uvb arethe contribution from massive stars in galaxies and the lyc escape fraction($f_{\rm esc}$), a highly directional quantity that is difficult to constrainstatistically. we suggest that both quasars and low-mass starburst galaxies areimportant contributors to the ionizing uvb at $z &lt; 2$. their additionalionizing flux would resolve any crisis in photon underproduction.

0806.0392	constraints on first-light ionizing sources from optical depth of the  cosmic microwave background	we examine the constraints on high-redshift star formation, ultraviolet andx-ray pre-ionization, and the epoch of reionization at redshift z_r, inferredfrom the recent wmap-5 measurement, tau_e = 0.084 +/- 0.016, of the electronscattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background (cmb). half of thisscattering can be accounted for by the optical depth, tau_e = 0.04-0.05, of afully ionized intergalactic medium (igm) at z &lt; z_gp = 6-7, consistent withgunn-peterson absorption in neutral hydrogen. the required additional opticaldepth, delta-tau_e = 0.03 +/- 0.02 at z &gt; z_gp, constrains the ionizingcontributions of first light sources. wmap-5 also measured a significantincrease in small-scale power, which lowers the required efficiency of starformation and ionization from mini-halos. early massive stars (uv radiation)and black holes (x-rays) can produce a partially ionized igm, adding to theresidual electrons left from incomplete recombination. inaccuracies incomputing the ionization history, x_e(z), and degeneracies in cosmologicalparameters (omega_m, omega_b, sigma_8, n_s) add systematic uncertainty to themeasurement and modeling of $\tau_e$. from the additional optical depth fromsources at z &gt; z_gp, we limit the star-formation efficiency, the rate ofionizing photon production for pop iii and pop ii stars, and the photon escapefraction, using standard histories of baryon collapse, minihalo star formation,and black-hole x-ray preionization.

astro-ph;0011303	probing the first stars with hydrogen and helium recombination emission	unusual patterns of recombination emission from gas ionized by metal-freestars may distinguish early star-forming galaxies from their present-daycounterparts. this pattern arises from the harder ionizing spectrum expectedfrom metal-free stars, which strongly enhances the strength of he iirecombination lines. our calculations indicate that line fluxes of he ii 1640and 4686 are sufficiently large to be detected by narrowband and spectroscopicsearches for high-redshift emission-line sources at redshift z ~ 5 usingcurrent instruments. an unknown fraction of lya emitters may harborlow-metallicity or metal-free stars. as the predicted he ii 1640 flux iscomparable to and may exceed hydrogen lya, searches for high-redshift galaxiesshould consider he ii recombination lines as possible identifications forsingle emission lines in observed spectra. spectra of metal-free stars may showboth h i and he ii emission lines, improving the constraints on their redshiftand identification. we assess the considerable uncertainties that affect ourexpectations for the detection and identification of true first-generationstars with present search techniques, including the role of stellar mass lossin spectral evolution and the confusion of ionization by primordial stellarsources and agn in the early universe.

astro-ph;0012335	feedback from galaxy formation: production and photodissociation of  primordial molecular hydrogen	we use one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to study the evolutionof h_2 gas-phase (h^- catalyzed) formation and photo-dissociation regions inthe primordial universe. we find a new positive feedback mechanism capable ofproducing shells of h_2 in the intergalactic medium, which are optically thickin some lyman-werner bands. while these shells exist, this feedback effect isimportant in reducing the h_2 dissociating background flux and the size ofphoto-dissociation spheres around each luminous object. the maximum backgroundopacity of the igm in the h_2 lyman-werner bands is \tau_{h_2} ~ 1-2 for arelic molecular fraction x_{h_2}=2 x 10^{-6}, about 6 times greater than foundby haiman, abel &amp; rees. therefore, the relic molecular hydrogen can decreasethe photo-dissociation rate by about an order of magnitude. the problem isrelevant to the formation of small primordial galaxies with masses m_{dm} &lt;10^8 m_\odot, that rely on molecular hydrogen cooling to collapse.alternatively, the universe may have remained dark for several hundred millionyears after the birth of the first stars, until galaxies with virialtemperature t_{vir} &gt; 10^4 k formed.

astro-ph;0107473	hubble and fuse studies of ly-alpha absorbers at low redshift	ultraviolet spectrographs aboard the hubble space telescope (hst) and the farultraviolet spectroscopic explorer (fuse) have proved their value as sensitiveprobes of the low-density intergalactic medium (igm) at low redshifts (z &lt;0.1). recent observations in ly-alpha, ly-beta, and occasional higher lymanlines show that warm photoionized gas in the low-z igm may contain 20-25% ofthe baryons, with a n(hi)^-1.8 distribution in column density. measurements ofresonance lines of si iii, c iii, c iv, and o vi suggest that the metallicityof these absorbers ranges from 1-10% of solar abundance down to values below0.003 z(solar). a comparison of ly-beta/ly-alpha ratios (fuse and hst) yields adistribution of doppler parameters with mean b = 31.4 +/- 7.4 km/s and median28 km/s, comparable to values at z = 2-3. the curve-of-growth (cog) b-valuesare considerably less than widths derived from ly-alpha profile fitting, withmean b(cog)/b(width) = 0.52, which suggests that low-z absorbers containsizable non-thermal motions or velocity components arising from cosmologicalexpansion and infall. a challenge for future uv spectroscopic missions (hst/cosand suvo) is to obtain precision measurements of omega(igm) and metallicitiesfor the strong ly-alpha absorbers that dominate the igm baryon content. thisprogram will require accurate determinations of: (1) curves of growth usinghigher lyman series lines; (2) the ionizing radiation field at 1-5 ryd; and (3)characteristic sizes and shapes of the absorbers.

astro-ph;0108168	heating and ionization of the intergalactic medium by an early x-ray  background	observational studies indicate that the intergalactic medium (igm) is highlyionized up to redshifts just over 6. a number of models have been developed todescribe the process of reionization and the effects of the ionizing photonsfrom the first luminous objects. in this paper, we study the impact of an x-raybackground, such as high-energy photons from early quasars, on the temperatureand ionization of the igm prior to reionization, before the fully ionizedbubbles associated with individual sources have overlapped. x-rays, which havelarge mean free paths relative to euv photons, and their photoelectrons canhave significant effects on the thermal and ionization balance. we find thathydrogen ionization is dominated by the x-ray photoionization of neutral heliumand the resulting secondary electrons. thus, the igm may have been warm andweakly ionized prior to full reionization. we examine several relatedconsequences, including the filtering of the baryonic jeans mass scale,signatures in the cosmic microwave background, and the h$^{-}$-catalyzedproduction of molecular hydrogen.

astro-ph;0109220	high-velocity cloud complex c: galactic fuel or galactic waste?	we present hst ghrs and stis observations of five qsos that probe theprominent high-velocity cloud (hvc) complex c, covering 10% of the northernsky. based upon a single sightline measurement (mrk 290), a metallicity[s/h]=-1.05+/-0.12 has been associated with complex c by wakker et al.(1999a,b). when coupled with its inferred distance (5&lt;d&lt;30 kpc) andline-of-sight velocity (v=-100 to -200 km/s), complex c appeared to representthe first direct evidence for infalling low-metallicity gas onto the milky way,which could provide the bulk of the fuel for star formation in the galaxy. wehave extended the abundance analysis of complex c to encompass five sightlines.we detect sii absorption in three targets (mrk 290, mrk 817, and mrk 279); theresulting [sii/hi] values range from -0.36 (mrk 279) to -0.48 (mrk 817) to-1.10 (mrk 290). our preliminary oi fuse analysis of the mrk 817 sightline alsosupports the conclusion that metallicities as high as 0.3 times solar areencountered within complex c. these results complicate an interpretation ofcomplex c as infalling low-metallicity galactic fuel. ionization correctionsfor hii and siii cannot easily reconcile the higher apparent metallicitiesalong the mrk 817 and mrk 279 sightlines with that seen toward mrk 290, sinceh-alpha emission measures preclude the existence of sufficient hii. if gasalong the other lines of sight has a similar pressure and temperature to thatsampled toward mrk 290, the predicted h-alpha emission measures would be 900mr. it may be necessary to reclassify complex c as mildly enriched galacticwaste from the milky way or processed gas torn from a disrupted neighboringdwarf, as opposed to low-metallicity galactic fuel.

astro-ph;0110431	the fate of the first galaxies. i. self-consistent cosmological  simulations with radiative transfer	in cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogonies, low-mass objects play an importantrole in the evolution of the universe. not only are they the first luminousobjects to shed light in a previously dark universe, but, if their formation isnot inhibited by their own feedback, they dominate the galaxy mass functionuntil redshift z \sim 5. in this paper we present and discuss theimplementation of a 3d cosmological code that includes most of the neededphysics to simulate the formation and evolution of the first galaxies with aself-consistent treatment of radiative feedback. the simulation includescontinuum radiative transfer using the ``optically thin variable eddingtontensor'' (otvet) approximation and line-radiative transfer in the h_2lyman-werner bands of the background radiation. we include detailed chemistryfor h_2 formation/destruction, molecular and atomic cooling/heating processes,ionization by secondary electrons, and heating by ly\alpha resonant scattering.  we find that the first galaxies ("small-halos") are characterized by abursting star formation, self-regulated by a feedback process that acts oncosmological scales. their formation is not suppressed by feedback processes;therefore, their impact on cosmic evolution cannot be neglected. the main focusof this paper is on the methodology of the simulations, and we only brieflyintroduce some of the results. an extensive discussion of the results and thenature of the feedback mechanism are the focus of a companion paper.

astro-ph;0110432	the fate of the first galaxies. ii. effects of radiative feedback	[abridged]we use 3d cosmological simulations with radiative transfer to studythe formation and evolution of the first galaxies in a lcdm cosmology. we findthat the first luminous objects ("small-halos") are characterized by a burstingstar formation (sf) that is self-regulated by a feedback process acting oncosmological instead of galactic scales. the global star formation history isregulated by the mean number of ionizing photons that escape from each source,\epsilon_{uv}\fesc. it is almost independent of the assumed star formationefficiency parameter, \epsilon_*, and the intensity of the dissociatingbackground. the main feedback process that regulates the sf is the re-formationof h_2 in front of hii regions and inside relic hii regions. the hii regionsremain confined inside filaments, maximizing the production of h_2 in overdenseregions through cyclic destruction/reformation of h_2. if \epsilon_{uv}\fesc &gt;10^{-8}/\epsilon_* the sf is self-regulated, photo-evaporation of "small-halo"objects dominate the metal pollution of the low density igm, and the mass ofproduced metals depends only on \fesc. if \epsilon_{uv}\fesc \simlt10^{-8}/\epsilon_*, positive feedback dominates, and "small-halo" objectsconstitute the bulk of the mass in stars and metals at least until redshift z\sim 10. "small-halo" objects cannot reionize the universe because the feedbackmechanism confines the hii regions inside the large scale structure filaments.in contrast to massive objects, which can reionize voids, "small-halo" objectspartially ionize only the dense filaments while leaving the voids mostlyneutral.

astro-ph;0401036	the local ly-alpha forest iv: stis g140m spectra and results on the  distribution and baryon content of hi absorbers	we present hst stis/g140m spectra of 15 extragalactic targets, which wecombine with ghrs/g160m data to examine the statistical properties of the low-zly-alpha forest. we evaluate the physical properties of these ly-alphaabsorbers and compare them to their high-z counterparts. we determine that thewarm, photoionized igm contains 29+/-4% of the total baryon inventory at z = 0.we derive the distribution in column density, n_hi^(1.65+/-0.07) for 12.5 &lt; log[n_hi] &lt; 14.5, breaking to a flatter slope above log [n_hi] &gt; 14.5. the slowingof the number density evolution of high-w ly-alpha clouds is not as great aspreviously measured, and the break to slower evolution may occur later thanpreviously suggested (z~1.0 rather than 1.6). we find a 7.2sigma excess in thetwo-point correlation function (tpcf) of ly-alpha absorbers for velocityseparations less than 260 km/s, which is exclusively due to the higher columndensity clouds. from our previous result that higher column density ly-alphaclouds cluster more strongly with galaxies, this tpcf suggests a physicaldifference between the higher and lower column density clouds in our sample.

astro-ph;0401376	nucleosynthesis, reionization, and the mass function of the first stars	we critique the hypothesis that the first stars were very massive stars (vms;m &gt; 140 msun). we review the two major lines of evidence for the existence ofvms: (1) that the relative metal abundances of extremely metal-poor galactichalo stars show evidence of vms enrichment, and (2) that the highelectron-scattering optical depth (tau_e) to the cmb found by wmap requires vmsfor reionization in a concordance lambdacdm cosmology. the supernova yieldpatterns of vms are incompatible with the fe-peak and r-process abundances inhalo stars. models including type ii supernovae and/or ``hypernovae'' frommetal-free progenitors with 8 - 40 msun can better explain the observed trends.with a simple metal-transport model, we estimate that halo enrichment curtailsmetal-free star formation after ~10^8 yr at z ~ 20. because the ionizing photonefficiency of metal-free stars peaks at ~120 msun and declines at higher mass,an imf with a lower bound at m ~ 10 - 20 msun and no vms can maximize theionizing photon budget and still be consistent with the nucleosyntheticevidence. an imf devoid of low-mass stars is justified independently by modelsof the formation of primordial stars. using a semi-analytic model for h i andhe ii reionization, we find that such an imf can reproduce tau_e = 0.10 - 0.14,consistent with the range from wmap. we conclude, on the basis of theseresults, that vms are not necessary to meet the existing constraints commonlytaken to motivate them.

astro-ph;0407352	the baryon content of the local intergalactic medium	we describe our surveys of low column density lyman-alpha absorbers [n(hi) =10^(12.5-16.0) cm^-2], which show that the warm photoionized igm contains 30%of all baryons at z &lt; 0.1. this fraction is consistent with cosmologicalsimulations, which also predict that an additional 20-40% of the baryons residein hotter 10^(5-7) k gas, the warm-hot igm (whim). the observed line density oflya absorbers, dn/dz = 170 for n(hi) &gt; 10^(12.8) cm^-2, is dominated bylow-n(hi) systems that exhibit slower redshift evolution than those with n(hi)&gt;10^(14). hst/fuse surveys of ovi absorbers, together with recent detections ofo vii with chandra and xmm/newton, suggest that 20-70% of all baryons couldreside in the whim, depending on its assumed abundance (o/h = 10% solar). atthe highest column densities, n(hi) &gt; 10^(20.3), the damped lya systems areoften identified with gas-rich disks of galaxies over a large range inluminosities (0.03-1 l*) and morphologies. lyman-limit systems [n(hi) =10^(17.3-20.3)] appear to be associated with bound, bright (0.1-0.3 l*) galaxyhalos. the lya absorbers with n(hi) = 10^(13-16) cm^-2 are associated withfilaments of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution, although somemay arise in unbound winds from dwarf galaxies. our discovery that ~20% oflow-z lya absorbers reside in galaxy voids suggests that a substantial fractionof baryons may be entirely unrelated to galaxies. in the future, hubble (andfuse) can provide a census of the local baryons and the distribution of heavyelements in the igm. these studies can be conducted quite efficiently if nasacan install the cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) on hubble, allowing anorder-of-magnitude improvement in throughput and a comparable increase in ourability to study the igm.

astro-ph;0501054	an ovi baryon census of the low-z warm-hot intergalactic medium	intergalactic absorbers along lines of sight to distant quasars are apowerful diagnostic for the evolution and content of the intergalactic medium(igm). in this study, we use the fuse satellite to search 129 known lyaabsorption systems at z&lt;0.15 toward 31 agn for corresponding absorption fromhigher lyman lines and the important metal ions ovi. we detect ovi in 40systems over a smaller range of column density than seen in hi. theco-existence of ovi and hi suggests a multiphase igm, with warm photoionizedand hot ionized components. with improved ovi detection statistics, we find asteep distribution in ovi column density, dn(ovi)/dn_ovi n_ovi^(-2.2+-0.1),suggesting that numerous weak ovi absorbers contain baryonic mass comparable tothe rare strong absorbers. the total cosmological mass fraction in this hot gasis at least omega_whim=(0.0022+-0.0003. gas in the whim at 10^5-6 k contributesat least 4.8+-0.9% of the total baryonic mass at z&lt;0.15. we then combineempirical scaling relations for the observed "multiphase ratio", n_hi/n_ovin_hi^(0.9+-0.1), and for hydrogen overdensity in cosmological simulations, n_hidelta_h^{0.7}, with the hi photoionization correction to derive the mean oxygenmetallicity, z_o (0.09 z_sun)(f_ovi/0.2)^(-1) in the low-z multiphase gas.given the spread in the empirical relations and in f_ovi, the baryon content inthe ovi whim could be as large as 10%. our survey is based on a largeimprovement in the number of ovi absorbers (40 vs. 10) and total redshiftpathlength (dz 2.2 vs. dz 0.5) compared to earlier surveys.

astro-ph;0507581	a fuse survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen toward high-latitude  agn	we report results from a fuse survey of interstellar molecular hydrogen (h2)along 45 sight lines to agn at high galactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 20 degrees). most(39 of 45) of the sight lines show detectable galactic h2 absorption from lymanand werner bands between 1000 and 1126 a, with column densities ranging fromn(h2) = 10^(14.17-19.82) cm^-2. in the northern galactic hemisphere, weidentify many regions of low column, n(h2) &lt; 10^15 cm^-2, between longitude l =60-180 degrees and at b &gt; 54 degrees. these `"h2 holes" provide valuable,uncontaminated sight lines for extragalactic uv spectroscopy, and a few may berelated to the "northern chimney" (low na i absorption) and "lockman hole" withlow n(hi). a comparison of high-latitude h2 with 139 ob-star sight linessurveyed in the galactic disk suggests that high-latitude and disk h2 cloudsmay have different rates of heating, cooling, and uv excitation. for rotationalstates j = 0 and 1, the mean excitation temperature at high latitude,&lt;t_01(high)&gt; = 124 +/- 8 k, is somewhat above that in the galactic disk,&lt;t_01(disk)&gt; = 86 +/- 20 k. for j = 2-4, the &lt;t_exc&gt; = 498 +/- 28 k, and thecolumn-density ratios, n(3)/n(1), n(4)/n(0), and n(4)/n(2), indicate acomparable degree of uv excitation in the disk and low halo for sight lineswith n(h2) &gt; 10^18. the distribution of molecular fractions at high latitudeshows a transition at lower total hydrogen column density, log n_h = 20.38 +/-0.13, than in the galactic disk, log n_h(disk) = 20.7. if the fuv radiationfields are similar in disk and low halo, this suggests an enhanced(dust-catalyzed) h2 formation rate in higher-density, compressed clouds, whichcould be detectable as high-latitude, sheetlike infrared cirrus.

astro-ph;0508163	the radiative transport of dust in primordial galaxies and  second-generation star formation	we investigate the radiative transport of dust in primordial galaxies in thepresence of the uv radiation field from the first metal-free stars. we findthat dust created in the first supernova (sn) explosions can be driven throughthe interior of the sn remnant to accumulate in the sn shells, wheresecond-generation stars may form from compressed cooling gas. this scenariorequires metal-free stars to form continuously over timescales of up to 10 myr,consistent with recent estimates. silicate and graphite grains, as well asiron-bearing magnetites, are transported to the shells for reasonable parameterassumptions, but their relative yields from primordial sne is an importantfactor in the resulting abundance ratios. we compare the results of segregatedgrain transport with the current nucleosynthetic data on extremely metal-poorgalactic halo stars. fossil signatures of this process may already have beendetected in those iron-poor stars with enhanced carbon and silicate elementssuch as magnesium, silicon and oxygen. we discuss the implications of ourresults for the transition from first- to second-generation star formation inprimordial galaxies, and the role played by the radiative transport of dust inthis process.

astro-ph;0509101	critical metallicity and fine-structure emission of primordial gas  enriched by the first stars	the influence of the first stars on the formation of second-generationobjects at high redshift may be determined, in part, by their metal enrichmentof surrounding gas. at a critical metallicity, zcrit, primordial gas cools moreefficiently by fine-structure lines of cii (157.74 um), oi (63.18 um, 145.5um), siii (34.8 um), and feii (25.99 um, 35.35 um) than by hi or h2 emission.this cooling may alter the process of fragmentation into smaller units. westudy the time-dependent cooling of primordial gas enriched by heavy elementsfrom early massive stars, particularly o, si, and fe. we define zcrit as thepoint when the total cooling rate by metals plus h2 equals the adiabaticcompressional heating. we explore two metallicity scenarios: (1) a singlemetallicity for all heavy elements; (2) individual metallicities (z_c, z_o,z_si, z_fe) from theoretical supernova yields. for dense gas [n &gt; 10^3 cm^(-3)]with metals in relative solar abundances, fragmentation occurs at zcrit ~10^(-3.5) z_sun. however, for lower density gas, [n = 1-100 cm^(-3)],particularly in halos enriched in si, o, and fe, we find zcrit = 0.1-1% zsun.the critical metallicity approaches a minimum value at high-n set by efficientlte cooling, with thermalized level populations of fine-structure states and h2rotational states (j = 2 and j = 3). primordial clouds of 10^8 msun at 200k aredetectable in redshifted fine-structure lines, with far-infrared fluxes between10^-22 and 10^-21 w/m^2. for metallicities z_o = 10^(-3) and molecularfractions f(h2) = 10^(-3) the fine-structure emission lines of oi, siii, andfeii could be 10^2 - 10^3 times stronger than the h2 rotational lines at 28.22um (j = 2-0) and 17.03 um (j = 3-1).

astro-ph;0509822	the galaxy environment of o vi absorption systems	we combine a fuse sample of ovi absorbers (z &lt; 0.15) with a database of 1.07million galaxy redshifts to explore the relationship between absorbers andgalaxy environments. all 37 absorbers with n(ovi) &gt; 10^{13.2} cm^-2 lie within800 h_70^-1 kpc of the nearest galaxy, with no compelling evidence for oviabsorbers in voids. the ovi absorbers often appear to be associated withenvironments of individual galaxies. gas with 10 +/- 5% of solar metallicity(ovi and ciii) has a median spread in distance of 350-500 kpc around l*galaxies and 200-270 kpc around 0.1 l* galaxies (ranges reflect uncertainmetallicities of gas undetected in lya absorption). in order to match the oviline frequency, dn/dz = 20 for n(ovi) &gt; 10^{13.2} cm^-2, galaxies with l &lt; 0.1l* must contribute to the cross section. the lya absorbers with n(hi) &gt;10^{13.2} cm^-2 cover ~50% of the surface area of typical galaxy filaments.two-thirds of these show ovi and/or ciii absorption, corresponding to a 33-50%covering factor at 0.1 z_sun and suggesting that metals are spread to a maximumdistance of 800 kpc, within typical galaxy supercluster filaments.approximately 50% of the ovi absorbers have associated lya line pairs withseparations delta v = 50-200 km/s. these pairs could represent shocks at thespeeds necessary to create copious ovi, located within 100 kpc of the nearestgalaxy and accounting for much of the two-point correlation function of low-zlya forest absorbers.

astro-ph;0608308	what is the total deuterium abundance in the local galactic disk?	analyses of spectra obtained with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer(fuse) satellite, together with spectra from the copernicus and imapsinstruments, reveal an unexplained very wide range in the observeddeuterium/hydrogen (d/h) ratios for interstellar gas in the galactic diskbeyond the local bubble. we argue that spatial variations in the depletion ofdeuterium onto dust grains can explain these local variations in the observedgas-phase d/h ratios. we present a variable deuterium depletion model thatnaturally explains the constant measured values of d/h inside the local bubble,the wide range of gas-phase d/h ratios observed in the intermediate regime (logn(h i} = 19.2-20.7), and the low gas-phase d/h ratios observed at largerhydrogen column densities. we consider empirical tests of the deuteriumdepletion hypothesis: (i) correlations of gas-phase d/h ratios with depletionsof the refractory metals iron and silicon, and (ii) correlation with themolecular hydrogen rotational temperature. both of these tests are consistentwith deuterium depletion from the gas phase in cold, not recently shocked,regions of the ism, and high gas-phase d/h ratios in gas that has been shockedor otherwise heated recently. we argue that the most representative value forthe total (gas plus dust) d/h ratio within 1 kpc of the sun is &gt;=23.1 +/- 2.4(1 sigma) parts per million (ppm). this ratio constrains galactic chemicalevolution models to have a very small deuterium astration factor, the ratio ofprimordial to total (d/h) ratio in the local region of the galactic disk, whichwe estimate to be f_d &lt;= 1.19 +/-0.16 (1 sigma) or &lt;= 1.12 +/- 0.14 (1 sigma)depending on the adopted light element nuclear reaction rates.

astro-ph;9509136	cosmic metal production and the contribution of qso absorption systems  to the ionizing background	the recent discovery by cowie \etal and tytler \etal of metals in the \lyaclouds shows that the intergalactic medium (igm) at high redshift iscontaminated by the products of stars, and suggests that ionizing photons frommassive star formation may be a significant contributor to the uv backgroundradiation at early epochs. we assess the validity of the stellarphotoionization hypothesis. based on recent computations of metal yields ando-star lyman continuum (lyc) fluxes, we find that 0.2\% of the rest-mass energyof the metals produced is radiated as lyc. by modeling the transfer of ionizingradiation through the igm and the rate of chemical enrichment, we demonstratethat the background intensity of photons at 1 ryd that accompanies theproduction of metals in the \lya forest clouds may be significant, approaching$0.5\times 10^{-21}\uvunits$ at $z\approx 3$ if the lyc escape fraction is$\gta 0.25$. together with quasars, massive stars could then, in principle,provide the hydrogen and helium lyc photons required to ionize the universe athigh redshifts. we propose that observations of the \heii gunn-peterson effectand of the metal ionization states of the \lya forest and lyman-limit absorbersshould show the signature of a stellar spectrum. we also note that the stellarphotoionization model fails if a large fraction of the uv radiation emittedfrom stars cannot escape into the igm, as suggested by the recent {\it hopkinsultraviolet telescope} observations by leitherer \etal of low-redshiftstarburst galaxies, or if most of the metals observed at $z\approx 3$ wereproduced at much earlier epochs.

astro-ph;9510054	intergalactic hydrogen clouds at low-redshift: connections to voids and  dwarf galaxies	we provide new post-costar data on one sightline (mrk 421) and updated datafrom another (i zw 1) from our hubble space telescope (hst) survey ofintergalactic lyman-alpha clouds located along sightlines to four brightquasars passing through well-mapped galaxy voids (16,000 km/s pathlength) andsuperclusters (18,000 km/s). we report two more definite detections of low-zlyman-alpha clouds in voids: one at 3047 km/s (heliocentric) toward mrk 421 anda second just beyond the local supercluster at 2861 km/s toward i zw 1,confirming our earlier discovery of lyman-alpha absorption clouds in voids(stocke et al. 1995). we have now identified 10 definite and 1 probablelow-redshift neutral hydrogen absorption clouds toward four targets, afrequency of approximately one absorber every 3400 km/s above 10^12.7 cm^-2column density. of these 10 absorption systems, 3 lie within voids; theprobable absorber also lies in a void. thus, the tendency of lyman-alphaabsorbers to ``avoid the voids'' is not as clear as we found previously. if thelyman-alpha clouds are approximated as homogeneous spheres of 100 kpc radius,their masses are ~ 10^9 msun (about 0.01 times that of bright l* galaxies) andthey are 40 times more numerous, comparable to the density of dwarf galaxiesand of low-mass halos in numerical cdm simulations. the lyman-alpha cloudscontribute a fraction omega_cl ~ 0.003 h75^-1 to the closure density of theuniverse, comparable to that of luminous matter. these clouds probably requirea substantial amount of non-baryonic dark matter for gravitational binding.they may represent extended haloes of low- mass protogalaxies which have notexperienced significant star formation or low-mass dwarf galaxies whose starformation ceased long ago, but blew out significant gaseous material.

astro-ph;9701160	the influence of the photoionizing radiation spectrum on metal-line  ratios in ly alpha forest clouds	recent measurements of si iv/c iv ratios in the high-redshift ly-alpha forest(songaila &amp; cowie, aj, 112, 335 [1996a]; savaglio et al., a&amp;a, in press [1997])have opened a new window on chemical enrichment and the first generations ofstars. however, the derivation of accurate si/c abundances requires reliableionization corrections, which are strongly dependent on the spectral shape ofthe metagalactic ionizing background and on the ``local effects'' of hot starsin nearby galaxies. recent models have assumed power-law quasar ionizingbackgrounds plus a decrement at 4 ryd to account for he ii attenuation inintervening clouds. however, we show that realistic ionizing backgrounds basedon cosmological radiative transfer models produce more complex ionizing spectrabetween 1-5 ryd that are critical to interpreting ions of si and c. we alsomake a preliminary investigation of the effects of he ii ionization frontnon-overlap. because the attenuation and re-emission by intervening cloudsenhance si iv relative to c iv, the observed high si iv/c iv ratios do notrequire an unrealistic si overproduction [si/c $\geq 3 (si/c)_{\odot}$]. if theionizing spectrum is dominated by ``local effects'' from massive stars, evenlarger si iv/c iv ratios are possible. however, unless stellar radiationdominates quasars by more than a factor of 10, we confirm the evidence for somesi overproduction by massive stars; values si/c $\approx 2 (si/c)_{\odot}$ fitthe measurements better than solar abundances. ultimately, an adequateinterpretation of the ratios of c iv, si iv, and c ii may require hot,collisionally ionized gas in a multiphase medium.

astro-ph;9802246	the high-redshift he ii gunn-peterson effect: implications and future  prospects	absorption due to heii ly-alpha has been detected at low resolution in thespectra of four quasars between redshifts z = 2.74-3.29. we assess theseobservations, giving particular attention to the radiative transfer of theionizing background radiation, cloud diffuse emission and ionization physics,and statistical fluctuations. we use high-resolution observations of hiabsorption towards quasars to derive improved models for the opacity of theintergalactic medium (igm) and use these models to calculate the hi and heiiphotoionization history in both optically-thin and self-shielded clouds, andthe average line-blanketing contribution to heii absorption. the derivedionization rate at z = 2-4, gamma(hi) = (1-3)x10^-12 s^-1, is consistent withthe ionizing background intensity inferred from the proximity effect, but itremains larger than that inferred by n-body hydrodynamical simulations of thelya absorber distribution. the heii observations are con- sistent with lineblanketing from clouds with n(hi) &gt; 10^12 cm^-2, although a contribution from amore diffuse igm would help to explain the observed opacity. we compute theexpected heii optical depth and examine the sizable fluc- tuations that arisefrom variations in the cloud numbers and ionizing radiation field. we assesshow heii absorption constrains the intensity and spectrum of the ionizingradiation and the fractional contributions of the dominant sources (quasars andstarburst galaxies). finally, we demonstrate how high-resolution uvobservations can distinguish between absorption from the diffuse igm and thelya forest clouds and determine the source of the ionizing background.

astro-ph;9810322	the spectroscopic detectability of argon in the lunar atmosphere	direct measurements of the abundance of argon in the lunar atmosphere weremade in 1973 by instruments placed on the moon during the apollo 17 mission,but the total daytime abundance is unknown due to instrument saturationeffects; thus, until we are able to return to the moon for improved directmeasurements, we must use remote sensing to establish the daytime abundance. inthis paper, we present a complete analysis of the potential for measuring argonin the lunar atmosphere via emission-line or absorption-line observations. wecome to the surprising conclusion that the lower limit established by the insitu lunar argon measurements implies that any absorption-line measurement ofargon in the lower, dayside lunar atmosphere requires analysis in theoptically-thick regime. in light of this result, we present the results of oureuvs sounding rocket observations of the lunar occultation of spica, whichprovide a new upper limit on the abundance of argon in the daytime lunaratmosphere. we also re-analyze a recently reported weak detection of lunaratmospheric ar i 1048 in emission by the orfeus satellite, and show that thosedata are inconsistent with the emission being due to argon over a wide range oftemperatures. this result is primarily due to our use of a more complete curveof growth analysis, and improved values for the argon fluorescent emissionrates from radiation and solar wind interactions. we find that the detectionreported by orfeus would imply an argon surface density significantly greaterthan the total surface density of the lunar atmosphere for argon accommodatedto typical daytime surface temperatures (~400 k), and also is inconsistent witha high-density transient event. we conclude that the reported argon detectionis untenable.

astro-ph;9912006	feedback from galaxy formation: escaping ionizing radiation from  galaxies at high redshift	several observational and theoretical arguments suggest that starburstgalaxies may rival quasars as sources of metagalactic ionizing radiation atredshifts z &gt; 3. reionization of the intergalactic medium (igm) at z &gt; 5 mayarise, in part, from the first luminous massive stars. to be an importantsource of radiative feedback from star formation, a substantial fraction (\sim1-10%) of the ionizing photons must escape the gas layers of the galaxies.using models of smoothly distributed gas confined by dark-matter (dm)potentials, we estimate the fraction, f_esc, of lyc flux that escapes the halosof spherical galaxies as a function of their mass and virialization redshift.the gas density profile is found by solving the equation of hydrostaticequilibrium for the baryonic matter in the potential well of a dm halo with thedensity profile found by navarro et. al. (1996). we then perform a parametricstudy to understand the dependence of fesc on redshift, mass, star-formationefficiency (sfe), stellar density distribution, and ob association luminosityfunction. we give useful analytical formulas for f_esc(z,m_{dm}). using thepress-schechter formalism, we find that stellar reionization at z \sim 7 isprobably dominated by small galactic sub-units, with m_{dm} \simlt 10^7 m_\odotand sfe \sim 10 times that in the milky way. this may affect the distributionof heavy elements throughout the intergalactic medium.
