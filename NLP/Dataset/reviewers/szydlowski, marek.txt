hep-th;0608219	phantom cosmology as a scattering process	we study the general chaotic features of dynamics of the phantom fieldmodelled in terms of a single scalar field conformally coupled to gravity. wedemonstrate that the dynamics of the frw model with dark energy in the form ofphantom field can be regarded as a scattering process of two types: multiplechaotic and classical non-chaotic. it depends whether the spontaneouslysymmetry breaking takes place. in the first class of models with thespontaneously symmetry breaking the dynamics is similar to the yang-millstheory. we find the evidence of a fractal structure in the phase space ofinitial conditions. we observe similarities to the phenomenon of a multiplescattering process around the origin. in turn the class of models without thespontaneously symmetry breaking can be described as the classical non-chaoticscattering process and the methods of symbolic dynamic are also used in thiscase. we show that the phantom cosmology can be treated as a simple model withscattering of trajectories which character depends crucially on a sign of asquare of mass. we demonstrate that there is a possibility of chaotic behaviorin the flat universe with a conformally coupled phantom field in the systemconsidered on non-zero energy level. we obtain that the acceleration is ageneric feature in the considered model without the spontaneously symmetrybreaking. we observe that the effective eos coefficient oscillates and thenapproach to $w=-1$.

0906.0335	twister quintessence scenario	we study generic solutions in a non-minimally coupled to gravity scalar fieldcosmology. it is shown that dynamics for both canonical and phantoms scalarfields with the potential can be reduced to the dynamical system from which theexact forms for an equation of the state parameter can be derived. we havefound the stationary solutions of the system and discussed their stability.within the large class of admissible solutions we have found a non-degeneratecritical points and we pointed out multiple attractor type of trajectorytravelling in neighborhood of three critical points at which we have theradiation dominating universe, the barotropic matter dominating state andfinally the de sitter attractor. we have demonstrated the stability of thistrajectory which we call the twister solution. discovered evolutional path isonly realized if there exist the non-minimal coupling constant. we have foundsimple duality relations between twister solutions in phantom and canonicalscalar fields in the radiation domination phase. for the twister trajectory wehave found an oscillating regime of approaching the de sitter attractor.

0906.2503	effective dynamics of the closed loop quantum cosmology	in this paper we study dynamics of the closed frw model with holonomycorrections coming from loop quantum cosmology. we consider models with ascalar field and cosmological constant. in case of the models with cosmologicalconstant and free scalar field, dynamics reduce to 2d system and analysis ofsolutions simplify. if only free scalar field is included then universeundergoes non-singular oscillations. for the model with cosmological constant,different behaviours are obtained depending on the value of $\lambda$. if thevalue of $\lambda$ is sufficiently small, bouncing solutions with asymptotic desitter stages are obtained. however if the value of $\lambda$ exceeds criticalvalue $\lambda_{\text{c}} =\frac{\sqrt{3}m^2_{\text{pl}}}{2\pi\gamma^3} \simeq21 m^2_{\text{pl}}$ then solutions become oscillatory. subsequently we studymodels with a massive scalar field. we find that this model possess genericinflationary attractors. in particular field, initially situated in the bottomof the potential, is driven up during the phase of quantum bounce. thissubsequently leads to the phase of inflation. finally we find that, comparingwith the flat case, effects of curvature do not change qualitatively dynamicsclose to the phase of bounce. possible effects of inverse volume correctionsare also briefly discussed.

0704.1651	route to lambda in conformally coupled phantom cosmology	in this letter we investigate acceleration in the flat cosmological modelwith a conformally coupled phantom field and we show that acceleration is itsgeneric feature. we reduce the dynamics of the model to a 3-dimensionaldynamical system and analyze it on a invariant 2-dimensional submanifold. thenthe concordance frw model with the cosmological constant $\lambda$ is a globalattractor situated on a 2-dimensional invariant space. we also study thebehaviour near this attractor, which can be approximated by the dynamics of thelinearized part of the system. we demonstrate that trajectories of theconformally coupled phantom scalar field with a simple quadratic potentialcrosses the cosmological constant barrier infinitely many times in the phasespace. the universal behaviour of the scalar field and its potential is alsocalculated. we conclude that the phantom scalar field conformally coupled togravity gives a natural dynamical mechanism of concentration of the equation ofstate coefficient around the magical value $w_{\text{eff}}=-1$. we demonstrateroute to lambda through the infinite times crossing the $w_{\text{eff}}=-1$phantom divide.

0707.4471	extended quintessence with non-minimally coupled phantom scalar field	we investigate evolutional paths of an extended quintessence with anon-minimally coupled phantom scalar field $\psi$ to the ricci curvature. thedynamical system methods are used to investigate typical regimes of dynamics atthe late time. we demonstrate that there are two generic types of evolutionalscenarios which approach the attractor (a focus or a node type critical point)in the phase space: the quasi-oscillatory and monotonic trajectories approachto the attractor which represents the frw model with the cosmological constant.we demonstrate that dynamical system admits invariant two-dimensionalsubmanifold and discussion that which cosmological scenario is realized dependson behavior of the system on the phase plane $(\psi, \psi')$. we formulatesimple conditions on the value of coupling constant $\xi$ for whichtrajectories tend to the focus in the phase plane and hence dampingoscillations around the mysterious value $w=-1$. we describe this condition interms of slow-roll parameters calculated at the critical point. we discoverthat the generic trajectories in the focus-attractor scenario come from theunstable node. it is also investigated the exact form of the parametrization ofthe equation of state parameter $w(z)$ (directly determined from dynamics)which assumes a different form for both scenarios.

1005.0814	observational hints on the big bounce	in this paper we study possible observational consequences of the bouncingcosmology. we consider a model where a phase of inflation is preceded by acosmic bounce. while we consider in this paper only that the bounce is due toloop quantum gravity, most of the results presented here can be applied fordifferent bouncing cosmologies. we concentrate on the scenario where the scalarfield, as the result of contraction of the universe, is driven from the bottomof the potential well. the field is amplified, and finally the phase of thestandard slow-roll inflation is realized. such an evolution modifies thestandard inflationary spectrum of perturbations by the additional oscillationsand damping on the large scales. we extract the parameters of the model fromthe observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. in particular,the value of inflaton mass is equal to $m=(2.6 \pm 0.6) \cdot 10^{13}$ gev. inour considerations we base on the seven years of observations made by the wmapsatellite. we propose the new observational consistency check for the phase ofslow-roll inflation. we investigate the conditions which have to be fulfilledto make the observations of the big bounce effects possible. we translate themto the requirements on the parameters of the model and then put theobservational constraints on the model. based on assumption usually made inloop quantum cosmology, the barbero-immirzi parameter was shown to beconstrained by $\gamma&lt;1100$ from the cosmological observations. we havecompared the big bounce model with the standard big bang scenario and showedthat the present observational data is not informative enough to distinguishthese models.

1008.1432	uniting cosmological epochs through the twister solution in cosmology  with non-minimal coupling	we investigate dynamics of a flat frw cosmological model with a barotropicmatter and a non-minimally coupled scalar field (both canonical and phantom).in our approach we do not assume any specific form of a potential function forthe scalar field and we are looking for generic scenarios of evolution. we showthat dynamics of universe can be reduced to a 3-dimensional dynamical system.we have found the set of fixed points and established their character. thesecritical points represent all important epochs in evolution of the universe :(a) a finite scale factor singularity, (b) an inflation (rapid-roll andslow-roll), (c) a radiation domination, (d) a matter domination and (e) aquintessence era. we have shown that the inflation, the radiation and matterdomination epochs are transient ones and last for a finite amount of time. theexistence of the radiation domination epoch is purely the effect of anon-minimal coupling constant. we show the existence of a twister type solutionwandering between all these critical points.

0801.0638	aic, bic, bayesian evidence against the interacting dark energy model	recent astronomical observations have indicated that the universe is in thephase of accelerated expansion. while there are many cosmological models whichtry to explain this phenomenon, we focus on the interacting $\lambda$cdm modelwhere the interaction between the dark energy and dark matter sectors takesplace. this model is compared to its simpler alternative---the $\lambda$cdmmodel. to choose between these models the likelihood ratio test was applied aswell as the model comparison methods (employing occam's principle): the akaikeinformation criterion (aic), the bayesian information criterion (bic) and thebayesian evidence. using the current astronomical data: snia (union2.1),$h(z)$, bao, alcock--paczynski test and cmb we evaluated both models. theanalyses based on the aic indicated that there is less support for theinteracting $\lambda$cdm model when compared to the $\lambda$cdm model, whilethose based on the bic indicated that there is the strong evidence against itin favor the $\lambda$cdm model. given the weak or almost none support for theinteracting $\lambda$cdm model and bearing in mind occam's razor we areinclined to reject this model.

1308.4069	scalar field cosmology -- geometry of dynamics	we study the scalar field cosmology (sfc) using the geometric language of thephase space. we define and study an ensemble of dynamical systems as a banachspace with a sobolev metric. the metric in the ensemble is used to measure adistance between different models. we point out the advantages of visualisationof dynamics in the phase space. it is investigated the genericity of some classof models in the context of fine tuning of the form of the potential functionin the ensemble of sfc.  we also study the symmetries of dynamical systems of sfc by searching fortheir exact solutions. in this context we stressed the importance of scalingsolutions. it is demonstrated that scaling solutions in the phase space arerepresented by unstable separatrices of the saddle points. only critical pointitself located on two dimensional stable submanifold can be identified asscaling solution. we have also found a class of potentials of the scalar fieldsforced by the symmetry of differential equation describing the evolution of theuniverse. a class of potentials forced by scaling (homology) symmetries wasgiven. we point out the role of the notion of a structural stability in thecontext of the problem of indetermination of the potential form of the scalarfield cosmology. we characterise also the class of potentials which reproducesthe \lambda cdm model, which is known to be structurally stable. we show thatthe structural stability issue can be effectively used is selection of thescalar field potential function. this enables us to characterise a structurallystable and therefore a generic class of sfc models. we have found a nonemptyand dense subset of structurally stable models. we show that these modelspossess symmetry of homology.

1310.1961	dynamical complexity of the brans-dicke cosmology	the dynamics of the brans-dicke theory with a quadratic scalar fieldpotential function and barotropic matter is investigated. the dynamical systemmethods are used to reveal complexity of dynamical evolution in homogeneous andisotropic cosmological models. the structure of phase space crucially dependson the parameter of the theory $\omega_{\textrm{bd}}$ as well as barotropicmatter index $w_{m}$. in our analysis these parameters are treated asbifurcation parameters. we found sets of values of these parameters which leadto generic evolutional scenarios. we show that in isotropic and homogeneousmodels in the brans-dicke theory with a quadratic potential function the desitter state appears naturally. stability conditions of this state are fullyinvestigated. it is shown that these models can explain accelerated expansionof the universe without the assumption of the substantial form of dark matterand dark energy. the poincare construction of compactified phase space with acircle at infinity is used to show that phase space trajectories in a physicalregion can be equipped with a structure of a vector field on nontrivialtopological closed space. for $\omega_{\textrm{bd}}&lt;-3/2$ we show new types ofearly and late time evolution leading from the anti-de sitter to the de sitterstate through an asymmetric bounce. in the theory without a ghost we findbouncing solutions and the coexistence of the bounces and the singularity.following the peixoto theorem some conclusions about structural stability aredrawn.

0803.1742	universe from vacuum in loop-string cosmology	in this paper we study the description of the universe based on the lowenergy superstring theory modified by the loop quantum gravity effects.thisapproach was proposed by de risi et al. in the phys. rev. d {\bf 76} (2007)103531. we show that in the contrast with the string motivated pre-big bangscenario, the cosmological realisation of the $t$-duality transformation is notnecessary to avoid an initial singularity. in the model considered the universestarts its evolution in the vacuum phase at time $t\to - \infty$. in this phasethe scale factor $a\to 0$, energy density $\rho \to 0$ and coupling of theinteractions $g^2_s \to 0$. after this stage the universe evolves to thenon-singular hot big bang phase $\rho \to \rho_{\text{max}} &lt; \infty$. then thestandard classical universe emerges. during the whole evolution the scalefactor increases monotonically. we solve this model analytically. we alsopropose and solve numerically the model with an additional dilaton potential inwhich the universe starts the evolution from the asymptotically free vacuumphase $g^2_s \to 0$ and then evolves non-singularly to the emerging dark energydominated phase with the saturated coupling constant $g^2_s \to \text{const}$.

0705.1772	acceleration of the universe driven by the casimir force	we investigate an evolutional scenario of the frw universe with the casimirenergy scaling like $(-)(1+z)^4$. the casimir effect is used to explain thevacuum energy differences (its value measured from astrophysics is so smallcompared to value obtained from quantum field theory calculations). thedynamics of the frw model is represented in terms of a two-dimensionaldynamical system to show all evolutional paths of this model in the phase spacefor all admissible initial conditions. we find also an exact solution for nonflat evolutional paths of universe driven by the casimir effect. the maindifference between the frw model with the casimir force and the $\lambda$cdmmodel is that their generic solutions are a set of evolutional paths with abounce solution and an initial singularity, respectively. the evolutionalscenario are tested by using the snia data, friib radiogalaxies, baryonoscillation peak and cmb observation. we compare the power of explanation ofthe model considered and the $\lambda$cdm model using the bayesian informationcriterion and bayesian factor. our investigation of the information criteria ofmodel selection showed the preference of the $\lambda$cdm model over the modelconsidered. however the presence of negative like the radiation term can removea tension between the theoretical and observed primordial ${}^4$he and dabundance.

0804.2778	effects of the quantisation ambiguities on the big bounce dynamics	in this paper we investigate dynamics of the modified loop quantum cosmologymodels using dynamical systems methods. modifications considered come from thechoice of the different field strength operator $\hat{f}$ and result indifferent forms of the effective hamiltonian. such an ambiguity of the choiceof this expression from some class of functions is allowed in the framework ofloop quantisation. our main goal is to show how such modifications caninfluence the bouncing universe scenario in the loop quantum cosmology. ineffective models considered we classify all evolutional paths for alladmissible initial conditions. the dynamics is reduced to the form of adynamical system of the newtonian type on a 2-dimensional phase plane. thesemodels are equivalent dynamically to the frw models with the decaying effectivecosmological term parametrised by the canonical variable $p$ (or by the scalefactor $a$). we find that for the positive cosmological constant there is aclass of oscillating models without the initial and final singularities. thenew phenomenon is the appearance of curvature singularities for the finitevalues of the scale factor, but we find that for the positive cosmologicalconstant these singularities can be avoided. for the positive cosmologicalconstant the evolution begins at the asymptotic state in the past representedby the desitter contracting (des$_{-}$) spacetime or the static einsteinuniverse h=0 or $h=-\infty$ state and reaches the desitter expanding state(des$_{+}$), the state h=0 or $h=+\infty$ state. in the case of the negativecosmological constant we obtain the past and future asymptotic states as theeinstein static universes.

1502.04471	cosmology with a decaying vacuum energy parametrization derived from  quantum mechanics	within the quantum mechanical treatment of the decay problem one finds thatat late times $t$ the survival probability of an unstable state cannot have theform of an exponentially decreasing function of time $t$ but it has an inversepower-like form. this is a general property of unstable states following frombasic principles of quantum theory. the consequence of this property is that inthe case of false vacuum states the cosmological constant becomes dependent ontime: $\lambda - \lambda_{\text{bare}}\equiv \lambda(t) -\lambda_{\text{bare}}\sim 1/t^{2}$. we construct the cosmological model with decaying vacuum energydensity and matter for solving the cosmological constant problem and thecoincidence problem. we show the equivalence of the proposed decaying falsevacuum cosmology with the $\lambda(t)$ cosmologies (the $\lambda(t)$cdmmodels). the cosmological implications of the model of decaying vacuum energy(dark energy) are discussed. we constrain the parameters of the model withdecaying vacuum using astronomical data. for this aim we use the observation ofdistant supernovae of type ia, measurements of $h(z)$, bao, cmb and others. themodel analyzed is in good agreement with observation data and explain a smallvalue of the cosmological constant today.

1502.04737	cosmological model with decaying vacuum energy law from principles of  quantum mechanics	we construct the cosmological model to explain the cosmological constantproblem. we built the extension of the standard cosmological model $\lambda$cdmby consideration of decaying vacuum energy represented by the runningcosmological term. from the principles of quantum mechanics one can find thatin the long term behavior survival probability of unstable states is adecreasing function of the cosmological time and has the inverse power-likeform. this implies that cosmological constant $\rho_{\text{vac}} = \lambda(t) =\lambda_{\text{bare}} + \frac{\alpha}{t^2}$ where $\lambda_{\text{bare}}$ and$\alpha$ are constants. we investigate the dynamics of this model usingdynamical system methods due to a link to the $\lambda(h)$ cosmologies. we havefound the exact solution for the scale factor as well as the indicators of itsvariability like the deceleration parameter and the jerk. from the calculationof the jerk we obtain a simple test of the decaying vacuum in the frw universe.using astronomical data (snia, $h(z)$, cmb, bao) we have estimated the modelparameters and compared this model with the $\lambda$cdm model. our statisticalresults indicate that the decaying vacuum model is a little worse than the$\lambda$cdm model. but the decaying vacuum cosmological model explains thesmall value of the cosmological constant today.

0805.2665	dynamical emergence of frw cosmological models	recent astronomical observations strongly indicate that the current universeis undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion. the discovery of this fact wasunexpected and resulted in the comeback of cosmological constant. theconception of standard cosmological model has its roots in this context. thepaper relates to the methodological status of effective theories in the contextof cosmological investigations. we argue that the standard cosmological model(lcdm model) as well as the cdm have a status of effective theories only,similarly to the standard model of particle physics. the lcdm model is studiedfrom the point of view of the methodological debate on reductionism andepistemological emergence in the science. it is shown in the paper thatbifurcation as well as structural instability notion can be useful in thedetection of emergence the lcdm model from the cdm model. we demonstrate thatthe structural stability of the lcdm model can explain the flexibility of themodel to accommodation of the observational data. we show that lcdm model canbe derived from cdm as the bifurcation. it is an example of acausal derivationof lambda term. the case study of emergence of lcdm model suggests that it canbe understood in terms of bifurcation and structural stability issue. thereduction from the upper models represented in terms of dynamical system tolow-level ones can be realized in any case by application of a mathematicallimit (boundary crossing) with respect to the model parameter. it is a simpleconsequence of mathematical theorem about smooth dependence solutions withrespect to time, initial condition and the parameters.

1507.02114	cosmology with decaying cosmological constant -- exact solutions and  model testing	we study dynamics of $\lambda(t)$ cosmological models which are a naturalgeneralization of the standard cosmological model (the $\lambda$cdm model). weconsider a class of models: the ones with a prescribed form of$\lambda(t)=\lambda_{\text{bare}}+\frac{\alpha^2}{t^2}$. this type of a$\lambda(t)$ parametrization is motivated by different cosmological approaches.we interpret the model with running lambda ($\lambda(t)$) as a special model ofan interacting cosmology with the interaction term $-d\lambda(t)/dt$ in whichenergy transfer is between dark matter and dark energy sectors. for the$\lambda(t)$ cosmology with a prescribed form of $\lambda(t)$ we have found theexact solution in the form of bessel functions. our model shows that fractionaldensity of dark energy $\omega_e$ is constant and close to zero during theearly evolution of the universe.  we have also constrained the model parameters for this class of models usingthe astronomical data such as snia data, bao, cmb, measurements of $h(z)$ andthe alcock-paczy{\'n}ski test. in this context we formulate a simple criterionof variability of $\lambda$ with respect to $t$ in terms of variability of thejerk or sign of estimator $(1-\omega_{\text{m},0}-\omega_{\lambda,0})$. thecase study of our model enable us to find an upper limit $\alpha^2 &lt; 0.012$($2\sigma$ c.l.) describing the variation from the cosmological constant whilethe lcdm model seems to be consistent with various data.

1508.05637	cosmological models with running cosmological term and decaying dark  matter	we investigate the dynamics of the generalized $\lambda$cdm model, which the$\lambda$ term is running with the cosmological time. the $\lambda(t)$ termemerges from the covariant theory of the scalar field $\phi$ with theself-interacting potential $v(\phi)$. on the example of the model$\lambda(t)=\lambda_{\text{bare}}+\frac{\alpha^2}{t^2}$ we show the existenceof a mechanism of the modification of the scaling law for energy density ofdark matter: $\rho_{\text{dm}}\propto a^{-3+\lambda(t)}$. we discuss theevolution of $\lambda(t)$ term and pointed out that during the cosmic evolutionthere is a long phase in which this term is approximately constant. this effectjustifies alcaniz and lima's approach to $\lambda(h)$ cosmologies. we alsopresent the statistical analysis of both the $\lambda(t)$cdm model with darkenergy and decaying dark matter and the $\lambda$cdm standard cosmologicalmodel. we divide the observational data into two groups: low $z$ data (snia,bao, $h(z)$ and ap test) and high $z$ data (planck, wp and lensing). while forthe former we find the best fit value of the parameter $\lambda$ is positive($\lambda=0.0338$, energy transfer is from the dark energy to dark mattersector), for the latter we find that $\lambda$ is $-0.0199$ which is anevidence that the energy transfer is from decaying dark matter. thisdisagreement correlates with estimated values of $h_0$ ($67.77$ km/(s mpc) and$65.62$ km/(s mpc) respectively). the decaying dark matter causes to lowering amass of dark matter particles which are lighter than cdm particles and remainrelativistic. the rate of the process of decaying matter is estimated. we showthat in the models of decaying dark matter, the cosmological constant problemdisappears naturally. the model with decaying dark matter possesses oneparameter more but in light of the aic it is better than the $\lambda$cdmstandard cosmological model.

0705.3017	vortex in axion condensate as a dark matter halo	we study the possibility of the vortices formation in axion condensate on thegalactic scale. such vortices can occur as a result of global rotation of theearly universe. we study analytical models of vortices and calculate exemplarygalaxy rotation curves. depending on the setup it is possible to obtain avariety of shapes which give a good qualitative agreement with observationalresults. however, as we show, the extremely low velocity dispersions of theaxions velocity are required to form the single vortex on the galactic scales.we find that the required velocity dispersion is of the order of $\sigma\approx 10^{-12} \frac{m}{s}$. this is much smaller that predicted within thepresent understanding of the axion physics. the vortices in axion condensatecan be however formed on the much smaller scales and give seeds to the galaxyformation and to their angular momenta. on the other hand, the vortices can beformed on the galactic scales, but only if the mass of the axion-like particlesis of the order of $10^{-30}$ev. in this case, the particle de brogliewavelength is comparable with the galactic diameter. this condition must befulfilled in order to keep the coherence of the quantum condensate on thegalactic scales.

astro-ph;0303248	dark energy and global rotation of the universe	we discuss the problem of universe acceleration driven by global rotation.the redshift-magnitude relation is calculated and discussed in the context ofsn ia observation data. it is shown that the dynamics of considered problem isequivalent to the friedmann model with additional non-interacting fluid withnegative pressure. we demonstrate that the universe acceleration increase isdue to the presence of global rotation effects, although the cosmologicalconstant is still required to explain the sn ia data. we discuss someobservational constraints coming from sn ia imposed on the behaviour of thehomogeneous newtonian universe in which matter rotates relative localgyroscopes. in the newtonian theory $\omega_{\text{r},o}$ can be identifiedwith $\omega_{\omega,0}$ (only dust fluid is admissible) rotation can existwith $\omega_{\text{r},0}=\omega_{\omega,0} \le 0$. however, the best-fit flatmodel is the model without rotation, i.e., $\omega_{\omega,0}=0$. in theconsidered case we obtain the limit for $\omega_{\omega,0}&gt;-0.033$ at 1\sigma$level$. we are also beyond the model and postulate the existence od additionalmatter which scales like radiation matter and then analyse how that model fitsthe sn ia data. in this case the limits on rotation coming from bbn and cmbanisotropies are also obtained. if we assume that the current estimates are$\omega_{\text{m},0}\sim 0.3$, $\omega_{\text{r},0} \sim 10^{-4}$, then the snia data show that $\omega_{\omega,0} \ge -0.01$ (or $\omega &lt; 2.6 \cdot10^{-19} \text{rad}/\text{s}$). the statistical analysis gives us that theinterval for any matter scaling like radiation is $\omega_{\text{r},0} in(-0.01, 0.04)$.

astro-ph;0403305	generalized chaplygin gas models tested with snia	the so called generalized chaplygin gas (gcg) with the equation of state $p =- \frac{a}{{\rho}^{\alpha}}$ was recently proposed as a candidate for darkenergy in the universe. in this paper we confront the gcg with snia data.specifically we have tested the gcg cosmology in three different classes ofmodels with (1) $\omega_m= 0.3$, $\omega_{ch}= 0.7$; (2) $\omega_m= 0.05$,$\omega_{ch}= 0.95$ and (3) $\omega_m = 0$, $\omega_{ch} = 1$, as well as themodel withouth any assumption on $\omega_m$. the best fitted models areobtained by minimalizing the $\chi^2$ function and $\chi^2$ levels in the$(a_0, \alpha)$ plane. we supplemented our analysis with confidence intervalsin the $(a_0, \alpha)$ plane, as well as one-dimensional probabilitydistribution functions for models parameter. the general conclusion is thatsnia data strongly support the chaplygin gas (with $\alpha = 1$). extending ouranalysisby relaxing the flat prior lead to the result that even though the bestfitted values of $\omega_k$ are formally non-zero, still they are close to flatcase. it should be viewed as an advantage of the gcg model since in similaranalysisof $\lambda$cdm model high negative value of $\omega_{k}$ were found tobe bestfitted to the data and independent inspiration from cmbr andextragalactic astronomy has been invoked to fix the curvature problem. ourresults show clearly that in generalized chaplygin gas cosmology distant $z &gt;1$supernovae should be brighter than in $\lambda$cdm model.this prediction seemsto be confirmed with new riess high redshift snia sample. moreover, we arguethat with the future snap data it would be possible to differentiate betweenmodels with various value of $\alpha$ parameter and/or discriminated betweengcg, cardassian and $\lambda$cdm models

astro-ph;0404299	brane universes tested by supernovae ia	we discuss observational constrains coming from supernovae ia imposed on thebehaviour of the randall-sundrum models. in the case of dust matter on thebrane, the difference between the best-fit perlmutter model with a$\lambda$-term and the best-fit brane models becomes detectable for redshifts$z &gt; 1.2$. it is interesting that brane models predict brighter galaxies forsuch redshifts which is in agreement with the measurement of the $z = 1.7$supernova. we also demonstrate that the fit to supernovae data can also beobtained, if we admit the "super-negative" dark energy (phantom matter) $p= -(4/3) \varrho$ on the brane, where the dark energy in a way mimics theinfluence of the cosmological constant. it also appears that the dark energyenlarges the age of the universe which is demanded in cosmology. finally, wepropose to check for dark radiation and brane tension by the application of theangular diameter of galaxies minimum value test. we point out the existence ofcoincidence problem for the brane tension parameter.

astro-ph;0404612	transition redshift from the v-reconstruction method	we show the effectiveness of using the procedure of the potentialreconstruction (the v-method) in the estimation of the transition redshiftcorresponding to switch from deceleration to acceleration phase of theuniverse. we investigate the frw models with dark energy by applying theparticle-like description of their dynamics. in this picture the evolution ofthe universe is represented by motion of a fictitious particle in theone-dimensional potential $v(a)$ or v(z)$ where $a$ is the scale factor and $z$is the redshift. the v-method solves the inverse problem where we reconstructthe potential function from empirical data. we use the riess et al.'s gold andgold+silver samples of sn ia data in this reconstruction. in the same frameworkwe obtain both the estimates of the form of the equation of state for darkenergy and the transition redshift. we obtain that transition redshift is$0.38_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$ (gold subset) and $0.37_{-0.07}^{+0.06}$ (gold+silversample) when the linear model of dark energy ($w(z)=w_{0} + w_{1}z$) and$\omega_{m,0}=0.3$ are assumed. we compare the estimation of transitionredshift with the riess et al. results. the v-method also alows us to find thevalue of hubble function at the moment of transition.

astro-ph;0409073	dynamics of the universe with global rotation	we analyze dynamics of the frw models with global rotation in terms ofdynamical system methods. we reduce dynamics of these models to the frw modelswith some fictitious fluid which scales like radiation matter. this fluidmimics dynamically effects of global rotation. the significance of the globalrotation of the universe for the resolution of the acceleration and horizonproblems in cosmology is investigated. it is found that dynamics of theuniverse can be reduced to the two-dimensional hamiltonian dynamical system.then the construction of the hamiltonian allows for full classification ofevolution paths. on the phase portraits we find the domains of cosmicacceleration for the globally rotating universe as well as the trajectories forwhich the horizon problem is solved. we show that the frw models with globalrotation are structurally stable. this proves that the universe acceleration isdue to the global rotation. it is also shown how global rotation gives anatural explanation of the empirical relation between angular momentum forclusters and superclusters of galaxies. the relation $j \sim m^2$ is obtainedas a consequence of self similarity invariance of the dynamics of the frw modelwith global rotation. in derivation of this relation we use the lie group ofsymmetry analysis of differential equation.

astro-ph;0502034	cosmological model with energy transfer	the observations of snia suggest that we live in the acceleration epoch whenthe densities of the cosmological constant term and matter are almost equal.this leads to the cosmic coincidence conundrum. as the explanation for thisproblem we propose the frw model with dark matter and dark energy whichinteract each other exchanging energy. we show that the cubic correction to thehubble law, measured by distant supernovae type ia, probes this interaction. wedemonstrate that influences between nonrelativistic matter and vacuum sectorsare controlled by third and higher derivatives of the scale factor. as anexample we consider flat decaying $\lambda(t)$ frw cosmologies. we point outthe possibility of measure of the energy transfer by the cubic and highercorrections to hubble's law. the statistical analysis of snia data is used asan evidence of energy transfer. we find that there were the transfer from thedark energy sector to the dark matter one without any assumption about physicsgoverning this process. we confront this hypothesis about the transfer withsnia observations and find that the transfer the phantom and matter sector isadmissible for $\omega_{\text{m},0}=0.27$. we also demonstrate that it ispossible to differentiate between the energy transfer model and the variablecoefficient equation of state model.

astro-ph;0504464	can the initial singularity be detected by cosmological tests?	in the present paper we raise the question whether initial cosmologicalsingularity can be proved from the cosmological tests. the classical generalrelativity predict the existence of singularity in the past if only some energyconditions are satisfied. on the other hand the latest quantum gravityapplications to cosmology suggest of possibility of avoiding the singularityand replace it with the bounce. the distant type ia supernovae data are used toconstraints on bouncing evolutional scenario where square of the hubblefunction $h^2$ is given by formulae$h^2=h^2_0[\omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{m}-\omega_{n,0}(1+z)^{n}]$, where $\omega_{m,0},\omega_{n,0}&gt;0$ are density parameters and $n&gt;m&gt;0$. we show that the on thebase of the snia data standard bouncing models can be ruled out on the$4\sigma$ confidence level. if we add the cosmological constant to the standardbouncing model then we obtain as the best-fit that the parameter $\omega_{n,0}$is equal zero which means that the snia data do not support the bouncing termin the model. the bounce term is statistically insignificant the present epoch.we also demonstrate that bbn offer the possibility of obtaining stringentconstraints of the extra term $\omega_{n,0}$. the other observational testmethods like cmb and the age of oldest objects in the universe are used. wealso use the akaike informative criterion to select a model according to thegoodness of fit and we conclude that this term should be ruled out by occam'srazor, which makes that the big bang is favored rather then bouncing scenario.

astro-ph;0505202	equation of state for universe from similarity symmetries	in this paper we proposed to use the group of analysis of symmetries of thedynamical system to describe the evolution of the universe. this methods isused in searching for the unknown equation of state. it is shown that group ofsymmetries enforce the form of the equation of state for noninteracting scalingmultifluids. we showed that symmetries give rise the equation of state in theform $p=-\lambda+w_{1}\rho(a)+w_{2}a^{\beta}+0$ and energy density$\rho=\lambda+\rho_{01}a^{-3(1+w)}+\rho_{02}a^{\beta}+\rho_{03}a^{-3}$, whichis commonly used in cosmology. the frw model filled with scaling fluid (calledhomological) is confronted with the observations of distant type ia supernovae.we found the class of model parameters admissible by the statistical analysisof snia data. we showed that the model with scaling fluid fits well tosupernovae data. we found that $\omega_{\text{m},0} \simeq 0.4$ and $n \simeq-1$ ($\beta = -3n$), which can correspond to (hyper) phantom fluid, and to ahigh density universe. however if we assume prior that$\omega_{\text{m},0}=0.3$ then the favoured model is close to concordance$\lambda$cdm model. our results predict that in the considered model withscaling fluids distant type ia supernovae should be brighter than in$\lambda$cdm model, while intermediate distant snia should be fainter than in$\lambda$cdm model. we also investigate whether the model with scaling fluid isactually preferred by data over $\lambda$cdm model. as a result we find fromthe akaike model selection criterion prefers the model with noninteractingscaling fluid.

astro-ph;0509415	which cosmological models -- with dark energy or modified frw dynamics?	recent measurements of distant type ia supernovae (snia) as well as otherobservations indicate that our universe is in accelerating phase of expansion.in principle there are two alternative explanation for such an acceleration.while in the first approach an unknown form of energy violating the strongenergy condition is postulated, in second one some modification of frw dynamicsis postulated. the both approaches are in well agreement with present dayobservations which is the manifestation of the degeneracy problem appearing inobservational cosmology. we use the akaike (aic) and bayesian (bic) informationcriteria of model selection to overcome this degeneracy and to determine amodel with such a set of parameters which gives the most preferred fit to thesnia data. we consider five representative evolutional scenarios in each ofgroups. among dark energy proposal the $\lambda$cdm model, cdm model withphantom field, cdm model with topological defect, model with chaplygin gas, andthe model with the linear dynamical equation of state parameter. as analternative prototype scenarios we consider: brane world dvali gabadadzeporrati scenario, brane models in randall-sundrum scenario, cardassian modelswith dust matter and radiation, bouncing model with the cosmological constantand metric-affine gravity (mag) inspired cosmological models. applying themodel selection criteria we show that both aic and bic indicates thatadditional contribution arises from nonstandard frw dynamics are not necessaryto explain snia. adopting the model selection information criteria we show thatthe aic indicates the flat phantom model while bic indicates both flat phantomand flat $\lambda$cdm models.

astro-ph;0511259	can brane dark energy model be probed observationally by distant  supernovae?	the recent astronomical measurements of distant supernovae as well as otherobservations indicate that our universe is presently accelerating. there aredifferent proposals for the explanation of this acceleration, such as thecosmological constant $\lambda$, decaying vacuum energy, an evolving scalarfield (quintessence), phantom energy, etc. most of these proposals require theexistence of exotic matter with negative pressure violating the strong energycondition. on the other hand, there have appeared many models which offerdramatically different mechanisms for the current acceleration, in which darkenergy emerges from the gravity sector rather than from the matter sector. inthis paper, we compare the concordance $\lambda$cdm model with thesahni-shtanov brane-world models of dark energy by using the akaike andbayesian information criteria. we show that new parameters in the brane modelare not statistically significant in terms of the information criteria,although the best fit method gives an improved fit to the snia data, because ofthe additional parameters. this is because the information criteria of modelselection compensate for this advantage by penalizing models having more freeparameters. we conclude that only new future observational data are accurateenough to give an advantage to dark-energy models of the brane origin, i.e., avery high-significance detection is required to justify the presence of newparameters. in our statistical analysis both riess et al.'s and astier et al.'ssnia samples are used. for stringent constraining parameters of the models thebaryon oscillation peak (bop) test is used.

astro-ph;0511650	towards testing interacting cosmology by distant type ia supernovae	we investigate the possibility of testing cosmological models withinteraction between matter and energy sector. we assume the standard frw modelwhile the so called energy conservation condition is interpreted locally interms of energy transfer. we analyze two forms of dark energy sectors: thecosmological constant and phantom field. we find a simple exact solution of themodels in which energy transfer is described by a cardassian like term in therelation of $h^{2}(z)$, where $h$ is hubble's function and $z$ is redshift. theconsidered models have two additional parameters $(\omega_{\text{int}},n)$(apart the parameters of the $\lambda$cdm model) which can be tested using sniadata. in the estimation of the model parameters riess et al.'s sample is used.we also confront the quality of statistical fits for both the $\lambda$cdmmodel and the interacting models with the help of the akaike and bayesianinformative criteria. our conclusion from standard best fit method is that theinteracting models explains the acceleration of the universe better but theygive rise to a universe with high matter density. however, using the tools ofinformation criteria we find that the two new parameters play an insufficientrole in improving the fit to snia data and the standard $\lambda$cdm model isstill preferred. we conclude that high precision detection of high redshiftsupernovae could supply data capable of justifying adoption of new parameters.

astro-ph;0602526	accelerated cosmological models in modified gravity tested by distant  supernovae snia data	recent supernovae of type ia measurements and other astronomical observationssuggest that our universe is in accelerating phase of evolution at the presentepoch. while a dark energy of unknown form is usually proposed as the mostfeasible mechanism for the acceleration, there are appears some alternativeconception that some effects arising from generalization of einstein equationcan mimic dark energy through a modified friedmann equation. in this work weinvestigate some observational constraints on modified friedmann equationobtained from generalized lagrangian ${\cal l} \propto r^n$ in minimal couplingwith matter in palatini formalism. we mainly concentrate on the constraints ofmodel parameters from distant supernovae but other constraint from baryonoscillation prior is also considered. we obtain the confidence levels on twoadditional model parameter ($n$,$\omega_{m,0}$). we conclude that the frw modelof first-order non-linear gravity survives several observational test like sniaobservation and baryon oscillation peaks. we find preferred value of$\omega_{m,0} \simeq 0.3$ from combined analysis of supernovae data and baryonoscillation peak. for deeper statistical analysis we apply akaike and bayesianinformation criteria of model selection for comparison prediction of the modelwith prediction of concordance $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0604327	top ten accelerating cosmological models	recent astronomical observations indicate that the universe is presentlyalmost flat and undergoing a period of accelerated expansion. basing oneinstein's general relativity all these observations can be explained by thehypothesis of a dark energy component in addition to cold dark matter (cdm).because the nature of this dark energy is unknown, it was proposed somealternative scenario to explain the current accelerating universe. the keypoint of this scenario is to modify the standard frw equation instead ofmysterious dark energy component. the standard approach to constrain modelparameters, based on the likelihood method, gives a best-fit model andconfidence ranges for those parameters. we always arbitrary choose the set ofparameters which define a model which we compare with observational data.because in the generic case, the introducing of new parameters improves a fitto the data set, there appears the problem of elimination of model parameterswhich can play an insufficient role. the bayesian information criteria of modelselection (the aic and bic) are dedicated to promotion a set of parameterswhich should be incorporated to the model. we divide class of all acceleratingcosmological models into two groups according to the two types of explanationacceleration of the universe. then the bayesian framework of model selection isused to determine the set of parameters which gives preferred fit to the sniadata. we find a few of flat cosmological models which can be recommend by boththe bayes factor and akaike information criterion.

astro-ph;0610250	cosmological zoo -- accelerating models with dark energy	ecent observations of type ia supernovae indicate that the universe is in anaccelerating phase of expansion. the fundamental quest in theoretical cosmologyis to identify the origin of this phenomenon. in principle there are twopossibilities: 1) the presence of matter which violates the strong energycondition (a substantial form of dark energy), 2) modified friedmann equations(cardassian models -- a non-substantial form of dark matter). we classify allthese models in terms of 2-dimensional dynamical systems of the newtonian type.we search for generic properties of the models. it is achieved with the help ofpeixoto's theorem for dynamical system on the poincar{\'e} sphere. we find thatthe notion of structural stability can be useful to distinguish the genericcases of evolutional paths with acceleration. we find that, while the$\lambda$cdm models and phantom models are typical accelerating models, thecosmological models with bouncing phase are non-generic in the space of allplanar dynamical systems. we derive the universal shape of potential functionwhich gives rise to presently accelerating models. our results show explicitlythe advantages of using a potential function (instead of the equation of state)to probe the origin of the present acceleration. we argue that simplicity andgenericity are the best guide in understanding our universe and itsacceleration.

gr-qc;0612172	paths of friedmann-robertson-walker brane models	dynamics of brane-world models of dark energy is reviewed. we demonstratethat simple dark energy brane models can be represented as 2-dimensionaldynamical systems of a newtonian type. hence a fictitious particle moving in apotential well characterizes the model. we investigate the dynamics of thebrane models using methods of dynamical systems. the simple brane-world modelscan be successfully unified within a single scheme -- an ensemble of brane darkenergy models. we characterize generic models of this ensemble as well asexceptional ones using the notion of structural stability (instability). thendue to the peixoto theorem we can characterize the class of generic branemodels. we show that global dynamics of the generic brane models of dark energyis topologically equivalent to the concordance $\lambda$cdm model. we alsodemonstrate that the bouncing models or models in which acceleration of theuniverse is only transient phenomenon are non-generic (or exceptional cases) inthe ensemble. we argue that the adequate brane model of dark energy should be ageneric case in the ensemble of frw dynamical systems on the plane.

0811.4487	bayesian analysis of the backreaction models	we present the bayesian analysis of four different types of backreationmodels, which are based on the buchert equations. in this approach, oneconsiders a solution to the einstein equations for a general matterdistribution and then an average of various observable quantities is taken.such an approach became of considerable interest when it was shown that itcould lead to agreement with observations without resorting to dark energy. inthis paper we compare the lambdacdm model and the backreation models with snia,bao, and cmb data, and find that the former is favoured. however, the testedmodels were based on some particular assumptions about the relation between theaverage spatial curvature and the backreaction, as well as the relation betweenthe curvature and curvature index. in this paper we modified the latterassumption, leaving the former unchanged. we find that, by varying the relationbetween the curvature and curvature index, we can obtain a better fit.therefore, some further work is still needed -- in particular the relationbetween the backreaction and the curvature should be revisited in order tofully determine the feasibility of the backreaction models to mimic darkenergy.
