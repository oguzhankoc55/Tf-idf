1002.2951	gamma-ray excess from a stacked sample of high- and  intermediate-frequency peaked blazars observed with the magic telescope	between 2004 and 2009 a sample of 28 x-ray selected high- andintermediate-frequency peaked blazars with a x-ray flux larger than 2 ujy at 1kev in the redshift range from 0.018 to 0.361 was observed with the magictelescope at energies above 100 gev. seven among them were detected and theresults of these observations are discussed elsewhere. here we concentrate onthe remaining 21 blazars which were not detected during this observationcampaign and present the 3 sigma (99.7 %) confidence upper limits on theirflux. the individual flux upper limits lie between 1.6 % and 13.6 % of theintegral flux from the crab nebula. applying a stacking method to the sample ofnon-detections with a total of 394.1 hours exposure time, we find evidence foran excess with a cumulative significance of 4.9 standard deviations. it is notdominated by individual objects or flares, but increases linearly with theobservation time as for a constant source with an integral flux level of ~1.5 %of that observed from the crab nebula above 150 gev.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1012.2200	spectral energy distribution of markarian 501: quiescent state vs.  extreme outburst	the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) blazar markarian 501 has awell-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellentlaboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of activegalactic nuclei. however, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies ofmarkarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. ashort-term multiwavelength study of markarian 501 was coordinated in march2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the suzaku x-ray satelliteand including {\gamma}-ray data from veritas, magic, and the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelengthbaseline measurement of markarian 501 in the quiescent state. the results ofthese quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extremeoutburst of april 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of thespectral energy distribution between the two states. the derived broadbandspectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. wefind that the x-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photonenergy between the two flux states while the vhe peak varies little. thelimited shift in the vhe peak can be explained by the transition to theklein-nishina regime. synchrotron self-compton models are matched to the dataand the implied klein-nishina effects are explored.

1101.4645	magic discovery of vhe emission from the fsrq pks 1222+21	very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission from the flat spectrum radio quasar(fsrq) pks 1222+21 (4c 21.35, z=0.432) was detected with the magic cherenkovtelescopes during a short observation (~0.5 hr) performed on 2010 june 17. themagic detection coincides with high energy mev/gev gamma-ray activity measuredby the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi satellite. the vhespectrum measured by magic extends from about 70 gev up to at least 400 gev andcan be well described by a power law dn/de \propto e^-gamma with a photon indexgamma= 3.75+/-0.27stat +/-0.2syst. the averaged integral flux above 100 gev is(4.56+/-0.46)x10^(-10) cm^-2 s^-1 (~1 crab nebula flux). the vhe flux measuredby magic varies significantly within the 30 min exposure implying a fluxdoubling time of about 10 min. the vhe and mev/gev spectra, corrected for theabsorption by the extragalactic background light (ebl), can be described by asingle power law with photon index 2.72+/-0.34 between 3 gev and 400 gev, andis consistent with emission belonging to a single component in the jet. theabsence of a spectral cutoff constrains the gamma-ray emission region outsidethe broad line region, which would otherwise absorb the vhe gamma-rays.together with the detected fast variability, this challenges present emissionmodels from jets in fsrq. moreover, the combined fermi/lat and magic spectraldata yield constraints on the density of the extragalactic background light inthe uv-optical to near-infrared range that are compatible with recent models.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1207.2147	magic observations of the giant radio galaxy m87 in a low-emission state  between 2005 and 2007	we present the results of a long m87 monitoring campaign in very high energy$\gamma$-rays with the magic-i cherenkov telescope. we aim to model thepersistent non-thermal jet emission by monitoring and characterizing the veryhigh energy $\gamma$-ray emission of m87 during a low state. a total of 150\,hof data were taken between 2005 and 2007 with the single magic-i telescope, outof which 128.6\,h survived the data quality selection. we also collected datain the x-ray and \textit{fermi}--lat bands from the literature (partiallycontemporaneous). no flaring activity was found during the campaign. the sourcewas found to be in a persistent low-emission state, which was at a confidencelevel of $7\sigma$. we present the spectrum between 100\,gev and 2\,tev, whichis consistent with a simple power law with a photon index $\gamma=2.21\pm0.21$and a flux normalization at 300\,gev of $(7.7\pm1.3) \times 10^{-8}$ tev$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$. the extrapolation of the magic spectrum into the gev energyrange matches the previously published \textit{fermi}--lat spectrum well,covering a combined energy range of four orders of magnitude with the samespectral index. we model the broad band energy spectrum with a spine layermodel, which can satisfactorily describe our data.

1307.3677	flashcam: a fully digital camera for the cherenkov telescope array	flashcam is a cherenkov camera development project centered around a fullydigital trigger and readout scheme with smart, digital signal processing, and a"horizontal" architecture for the electromechanical implementation. the fullydigital approach, based on commercial fadcs and fpgas as key components,provides the option to easily implement different types of triggers as well asdigitization and readout scenarios using identical hardware, by simply changingthe firmware on the fpgas. at the same time, a large dynamic range and highresolution of low-amplitude signals in a single readout channel per pixel isachieved using compression of high amplitude signals in the preamplifier andsignal processing in the fpga. the readout of the front-end modules into acamera server is ethernet-based using standard ethernet switches. in itscurrent implementation, data transfer and backend processing rates of ~3.8gbytes/sec have been achieved. together with the dead-time-free front end eventbuffering on the fpgas, this permits the cameras to operate at trigger rates ofup to several tens of khz.  in the horizontal architecture of flashcam, the photon detector plane (pdp),consisting of photon detectors, preamplifiers, high voltage-, control-, andmonitoring systems, is a self-contained unit, which is interfaced throughanalogue signal transmission to the digital readout system. the horizontalintegration of flashcam is expected not only to be more cost efficient, it alsoallows pdps with different types of photon detectors to be adapted to theflashcam readout system. this paper describes the flashcam concept, itsverification process, and its implementation for a 12 m class cta telescopewith pmt-based pdp.

1408.5280	discovery of the hard spectrum vhe gamma-ray source hess j1641-463	this letter reports the discovery of a remarkably hard spectrum source, hessj1641-463, by the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) in the very-highenergy (vhe) domain. hess j1641-463 remained unnoticed by the usual analysistechniques due to confusion with the bright nearby source hess j1640-465. itemerged at a significance level of 8.5 standard deviations after restrictingthe analysis to events with energies above 4 tev. it shows a moderate fluxlevel of f(e &gt; 1 tev) = (3.64 +/- 0.44_stat +/- 0.73_sys) x 10^-13 cm^-2s-1,corresponding to 1.8% of the crab nebula flux above the same energy, and a hardspectrum with a photon index of gamma = 2.07 +/- 0.11_stat +/- 0.20_sys. it isa point-like source, although an extension up to gaussian width of sigma = 3arcmin cannot be discounted due to uncertainties in the h.e.s.s. psf. the vhegamma-ray flux of hess j1641-463 is found to be constant over the observedperiod when checking time binnings from year-by-year to the 28 min exposurestimescales. hess j1641-463 is positionally coincident with the radio supernovaremnant snr g338.5+0.1. no x-ray candidate stands out as a clear association,however chandra and xmm-newton data reveal some potential weak counterparts.various vhe gamma-ray production scenarios are discussed. if the emission fromhess j1641-463 is produced by cosmic ray protons colliding with the ambientgas, then their spectrum must extend close to 1 pev. this object may representa source population contributing significantly to the galactic cosmic ray fluxaround the knee.

1409.0253	long-term monitoring of pks 2155$-$304 with atom and h.e.s.s.:  investigation of optical/$\gamma$-ray correlations in different spectral  states	in this paper we report on the analysis of all the available optical and veryhigh-energy $\gamma$-ray ($&gt;$200 gev) data for the bl lac object pks2155$-$304, collected simultaneously with the atom and h.e.s.s. telescopes from2007 until 2009. this study also includes x-ray (rxte, swift) and high-energy$\gamma$-ray (fermi-lat) data. during the period analysed, the source wastransitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and wascharacterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on thetimescales of days and months. a flattening of the optical continuum with anincreasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but onlyoccasionally and only at higher flux levels. we did not find any universalrelation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes onthe timescales from days and weeks up to several years. on the other hand, wenoted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks inthe optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. the obtained results therefore indicate acomplex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of pks2155$-$304, with different correlation patterns holding at different epochs,and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux andcolour rather than a flux alone.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1412.6997	h.e.s.s. reveals a lack of tev emission from the supernova remnant  puppis a	puppis a is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (snr) that showsstrong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.it has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (he,0.1-100 gev) gamma-rays. an analysis of the fermi-lat data has shown anextended he gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 gev spectrum exhibiting nosignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the gev-emitting snrsknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. this makes it a promising targetfor imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) to probe the gamma-rayemission above 100 gev. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt;= 0.1 tev) gamma-ray emissionfrom puppis a is for the first time searched for with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the analysis of the h.e.s.s. data does notreveal any significant emission towards puppis a. the derived upper limits onthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum mustexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. by combining fermi-lat and h.e.s.s.measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are foundto be 450 and 280 gev, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and asub-exponential cutoff, respectively. it is concluded that none of the standardlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle accelerationmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of vhesignal. the scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago isconsidered as an alternative explanation. the he/vhe spectrum of puppis a couldthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several otherinteracting snrs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interactionwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.
