0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0903.1108	a chandra x-ray analysis of abell 1664: cooling, feedback and star  formation in the central cluster galaxy	the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in the abell 1664 cluster is unusuallyblue and is forming stars at a rate of ~ 23 m_{\sun} yr^{-1}. the bcg islocated within 5 kpc of the x-ray peak, where the cooling time of 3.5x10^8 yrand entropy of 10.4 kev cm^2 are consistent with other star-forming bcgs incooling flow clusters. the center of a1664 has an elongated, "bar-like" x-raystructure whose mass is comparable to the mass of molecular hydrogen, ~ 10^{10}m_{\sun} in the bcg. we show that this gas is unlikely to have been strippedfrom interloping galaxies. the cooling rate in this region is roughlyconsistent with the star formation rate, suggesting that the hot gas iscondensing onto the bcg. we use the scaling relations of birzan et al. 2008 toshow that the agn is underpowered compared to the central x-ray coolingluminosity by roughly a factor of three. we suggest that a1664 is experiencingrapid cooling and star formation during a low-state of an agn feedback cyclethat regulates the rates of cooling and star formation. modeling the emissionas a single temperature plasma, we find that the metallicity peaks 100 kpc fromthe x-ray center, resulting in a central metallicity dip. however, amulti-temperature cooling flow model improves the fit to the x-ray emission andis able to recover the expected, centrally-peaked metallicity profile.

0903.2663	the jet-heated x-ray filament in the centaurus a northern middle radio  lobe	we present results from a 40 ks {\em xmm-newton} observation of the x-rayfilament coincident with the southeast edge of the centaurus a northern middleradio lobe (nml). we find that the x-ray filament consists of five spatiallyresolved x-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. the spectrum ofeach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from0.3-0.7 kev and subsolar elemental abundances. in four of the five knots,non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling outsynchrotron or ic/cmb mechanisms for their emission. the internal pressures ofthe knots exceed that of the ambient ism or the equipartition pressure of thenml by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be shortlived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). based on energetic arguments, it is implausiblethat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galacticnucleus of cen a or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation ofthe nml. in our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the x-rayknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a directinteraction with the jet. the lifetimes of the x-ray knots in the nml areroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the sw inner lobe,suggesting they were created in the same agn outburst. the most plausible modelof the nml is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is beingre-energized by the current outburst. we also report the discovery of a largescale (at least 35 kpc radius) gas halo around cen a.

0904.0610	gas sloshing and bubbles in the galaxy group ngc 5098	we present results from chandra observations of the galaxy pair andassociated galaxy group ngc 5098, and find evidence for both gas sloshing andagn heating. the x-ray brightness images show diffuse emission with a spiralstructure, centered on ngc 5098a, and a sharp edge in the diffuse emissionsurrounding much of the galaxy at about 30 kpc. the spiral structure in thex-ray surface brightness and temperature maps, the offset between the peak ofthe cool gas and the central agn, and the structure of the cold front edges allsuggest gas sloshing in the core. the most likely perturber is the nearbygalaxy ngc 5098b, which has been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. detailedimages of the core reveal several x-ray cavities, two of which, just north andsoutheast of the central agn, correlate with radio emission and have brightx-ray rims, similar to buoyant bubbles seen in the icm of other systems. weestimate the pressures in the bubbles and rims and show that they are roughlyequal, consistent with these being young features, as suggested by their closeproximity to the central agn. we assume that the other x-ray cavities in thecore, which show no correlation with existing radio observations, are ghostcavities from previous agn outbursts. an estimate of the mechanical energyrequired to inflate the cavities indicates that it is sufficient to offsetradiative cooling of the gas for 15 myr. therefore, for a typical cycle time of10^7 yrs, the central agn energy output is enough to balance cooling over longtimescales.

0706.4013	a chandra study of the lobe/ism interactions around the inner radio  lobes of centaurus a: constraints on the temperature structure and transport  processes	we present results from deeper {\em chandra} observations of the southwestradio lobe of centaurus a, first described by kraft et al. (2003). we find thatthe sharp x-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around $\sim$75% ofthe periphery of the radio lobe, and detect significant temperature jumps inthe brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. thisdemonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock which is theresult of an overpressure which has built up in the entire lobe over time.additionally, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transferenergy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as thespitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibratedalong the sw boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. thus theproton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than theobserved electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburstcorrespondingly larger as well. we investigate this using a simpleone-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. we findthat for the thermodynamic parameters of the cen a shock the electrontemperature rises rapidly from $\sim$0.29 kev (the temperature of the ambientism) to $\sim$3.5 kev at which point heating from the protons is balanced byadiabatic losses. the proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in atimescale less than the age of the lobe. we note that the measured electrontemperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poorenvironments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of theshock.

0706.4014	the disturbed 17 kev cluster associated with the radio galaxy 3c 438	we present results from a {\em chandra} observation of the cluster gasassociated with the fr ii radio galaxy 3c 438. this radio galaxy is embeddedwithin a massive cluster with gas temperature $\sim$17 kev and bolometricluminosity of 6$\times10^{45}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. it is unclear if this hightemperature represents the gravitational mass of the cluster, or if this is analready high ($\sim$ 11 kev) temperature cluster that has been heatedtransiently. we detect a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas thatextends $\sim$600 kpc through the cluster. the radio galaxy 3c 438 is too small($\sim$110 kpc across) and too weak to have created this large disturbance inthe gas. the discontinuity must be the result of either an extremely powerfulnuclear outburst or the major merger of two massive clusters. if the observedfeatures are the result of a nuclear outburst, it must be from an earlier epochof unusually energetic nuclear activity. however, the energy required($\sim10^{63}$ ergs) to move the gas on the observed spatial scales stronglysupports the merger hypothesis. in either scenario, this is one of the mostextreme events in the local universe.

0909.2252	direct evidence for outflow of metal-enriched gas along the radio jets  of hydra a	using deep chandra observations of the hydra a galaxy cluster, we examine themetallicity structure near the central galaxy and along its powerful radiosource. we show that the metallicity of the intracluster medium is enhanced byup to 0.2 dex along the radio jets and lobes compared to the metallicity of theundisturbed gas. the enhancements extend from a radius of 20 kpc from thecentral galaxy to a distance of ~ 120 kpc. we estimate the total iron mass thathas been transported out of the central galaxy to be between 2 x 10^7 m_sun and7 x 10^7 m_sun which represents 10% - 20% of the iron mass within the centralgalaxy. the energy required to lift this gas is roughly 1% to 5% of the totalenergetic output of the agn. evidently, hydra a's powerful radio source is ableto redistribute metal-enriched, low entropy gas throughout the core of thegalaxy cluster. the short re-enrichment time scale &lt; 10^9 yr implies that themetals lost from the central galaxy will be quickly replenished.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

1002.0395	metal transport by gas sloshing in m87	we present the results of an xmm-newton mosaic covering the central ~200 kpcof the nearby virgo cluster. we focus on a strong surface brightnessdiscontinuity in the outskirts of the brightest cluster galaxy, m87. using bothxmm-newton and suzaku, we derive accurate temperature and metallicity profilesacross this feature and show that it is a cold front probably due to sloshingof the virgo icm. it is also associated with a discontinuity in the chemicalcomposition. the gas in the inner, bright region of the front is ~40% moreabundant in fe than the gas outside the front, suggesting the important role ofsloshing in transporting metals through the icm. for the first time, we providea quantitative estimate of the mass of fe transported by a cold front. thisamounts to ~6% of the total fe mass within the radial range affected bysloshing, significantly more than the amount of metals transported by the agnin the same cluster core. the very low fe abundance of only ~0.2 solarimmediately outside the cold front at a radius of 90 kpc suggests we arewitnessing first-hand the transport of higher metallicity gas into a pristineregion, whose abundance is typical of the cluster outskirts. the mg/fe and o/feabundance ratios remain approximately constant over the entire radial rangebetween the centre of m87 and the faint side of the cold front, which requiresthe presence of a centrally peaked distribution not only for fe but also forcore-collapse type supernova products. this peak may stem from the starformation triggered as the bcg assembled during the protocluster phase.

1003.5334	feedback under the microscope ii: heating, gas uplift, and mixing in the  nearest cluster core	using a combination of deep 574ks chandra data, xmm-newton high-resolutionspectra, and optical halpha+nii images, we study the nature and spatialdistribution of the multiphase plasma in m87. our results provide directobservational evidence of `radio mode' agn feedback in action, stripping thecentral galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation. thislow entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly risingrelativistic plasma, forming long "arms". these arms are likely oriented within15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. the mass of the uplifted gas in the arms iscomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpccore, demonstrating that the agn has a profound effect on its immediatesurroundings. the coolest x-ray emitting gas in m87 has a temperature of ~0.5kev and is spatially coincident with halpha+nii nebulae, forming a multiphasemedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments. weplace strong upper limits of 0.06 msun/yr on the amount of plasma coolingradiatively from 0.5 kev and show that a uniform, volume-averaged heatingmechanism could not be preventing the cool gas from further cooling. all of thebright halpha filaments appear in the downstream region of the &lt;3 myr old shockfront, at smaller radii than ~0.6'. we suggest that shocks induce shearingaround the filaments, thereby promoting mixing of the cold gas with the ambienthot icm via instabilities. by bringing hot thermal particles into contact withthe cool, line-emitting gas, mixing can supply the power and ionizing particlesneeded to explain the observed optical spectra. mixing of the coolest x-rayemitting plasma with the cold optical line emitting filamentary gas promotesefficient conduction between the two phases, allowing non-radiative coolingwhich could explain the lack of x-ray gas with temperatures under 0.5 kev.

0708.0579	jet interactions with the hot halos of clusters and galaxies	x-ray observations of cavities and shock fronts produced by jets streamingthrough hot halos have significantly advanced our understanding of theenergetics and dynamics of extragalactic radio sources. radio sources at thecenters of clusters have dynamical ages between ten and several hundred millionyears. they liberate between 1e58-1e62 erg per outburst, which is enough energyto regulate cooling of hot halos from galaxies to the richest clusters. jetpower scales approximately with the radio synchrotron luminosity to the onehalf power. however, the synchrotron efficiency varies widely from nearly unityto one part in 10,000, such that relatively feeble radio source can havequasar-like mechanical power. the synchrotron ages of cluster radio sources aredecoupled from their dynamical ages, which tend to be factors of several toorders of magnitude older. magnetic fields and particles in the lobes tend tobe out of equipartition. the lobes may be maintained by heavy particles (e.g.,protons), low energy electrons, a hot, diffuse thermal gas, or possiblymagnetic (poynting) stresses. sensitive x-ray images of shock fronts andcavities can be used to study the dynamics of extragalactic radio sources.

1006.4379	shocks and cavities from multiple outbursts in the galaxy group ngc  5813: a window to agn feedback	we present results from new chandra, gmrt, and soar observations of ngc 5813,the dominant central galaxy in a nearby galaxy group. the system shows threepairs of collinear cavities at 1 kpc, 8 kpc, and 20 kpc from the centralsource, from three distinct outbursts of the central agn, which occurred3x10^6, 2x10^7, and 9x10^7 yr ago. the h-alpha and x-ray observations revealfilaments of cool gas that has been uplifted by the x-ray cavities. the innertwo cavity pairs are filled with radio emitting plasma, and each pair isassociated with an elliptical surface brightness edge, which we unambiguouslyidentify as shocks (with measured temperature jumps) with mach numbers of m~1.7and m~1.5 for the inner and outer shocks, respectively. such clear signaturesfrom three distinct agn outbursts in an otherwise dynamically relaxed systemprovide a unique opportunity to study agn feedback and outburst history. themean power of the two most recent outbursts differs by a factor of six, from1.5--10x10^42 erg/s, indicating that the mean jet power changes significantlyover long (~10^7 yr) timescales. the total energy output of the most recentoutburst is also more than an order of magnitude less than the total energy ofthe previous outburst (1.5x10^56 erg versus 4x10^57 erg), which may be a resultof the lower mean power, or may indicate that the most recent outburst isongoing. the outburst interval implied by both the shock and cavity ages (~10^7yr) indicates that, in this system, shock heating alone is sufficient tobalance radiative cooling close to the central agn, which is the relevantregion for regulating feedback between the icm and the central smbh.

(2008)p_jet-p_rad scaling relations are continuous in form and scatter from giantelliptical galaxies (ges) up to brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). we find amean scaling relation of p_jet approximately 5.8x10^43 (p_rad/10^40)^(0.70)erg/s which is continuous over ~6-8 decades in p_jet and p_rad with a scatterof approximately 0.7 dex. our mean scaling relationship is consistent with themodel presented in willott et al. (1999) if the typical fraction of lobe energyin non-radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons is &gt; 100. weidentify several ges whose radio luminosities are unusually large for their jetpowers and have radio sources which extend well beyond the densest parts oftheir x-ray halos. we suggest that these radio sources are unusually luminousbecause they were unable to entrain appreciable amounts of gas.

1007.1227	are radio agn powered by accretion or black hole spin?	we compare accretion and black hole spin as potential energy sources foroutbursts from agn in brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). based on our adoptedspin model, we find that the distribution of agn power estimated from x-raycavities is consistent with a broad range of both spin parameter and accretionrate. sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most bcgs topower their agn by accretion alone. however, we find no correlation between agnpower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. for agiven agn power, the bcg's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as thefraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the agn,both vary by more than two orders of magnitude. most of the molecular gas inbcgs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleusby the agn before it reaches the nuclear black hole. bondi accretion from hotatmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful agn, unless their black holesare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. we identify severalpowerful agn that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating anunusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their agn are powered by anothermechanism. if these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin, ratherthan by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e.,$p_{\rm jet} &gt; \dot mc^2$, or their black hole masses must be substantiallylarger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. we constrain the(model dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficientto radiatively efficient accretion flows to be a few percent of the eddingtonrate, a value that is consistent with other estimates.

1008.2393	model-independent x-ray mass determinations	a new method is introduced for making x-ray mass determinations of sphericalclusters of galaxies. treating the distribution of gravitating matter aspiecewise constant and the cluster atmosphere as piecewise isothermal, x-rayspectra of a hydrostatic atmosphere are determined up to a single overallnormalizing factor. in contrast to more conventional approaches, this methodrelies on the minimum of assumptions, apart from the conditions of hydrostaticequilibrium and spherical symmetry. the method has been implemented as an xspecmixing model called clmass, which was used to determine masses for a sample ofnine relaxed x-ray clusters. compared to conventional mass determinations,clmass provides weak constraints on values of m_500, reflecting the quality ofcurrent x-ray data for cluster regions beyond r_500. at smaller radii, wherethere are high quality x-ray spectra inside and outside the radius of interestto constrain the mass, clmass gives confidence ranges for m_2500 that are onlymoderately less restrictive than those from more familiar mass determinationmethods. the clmass model provides some advantages over other methods andshould prove useful for mass determinations in regions where there are highquality x-ray data.

1008.2921	radio and deep chandra observations of the disturbed cool core cluster  abell 133	we present results based on new chandra and multi-frequency radioobservations of the disturbed cool core cluster abell 133. the diffuse gas hasa complex bird-like morphology, with a plume of emission extending from twosymmetric wing-like features, and capped with a filamentary radio relic. x-rayobservations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas ornon-thermal emission in the region of the relic. we find evidence for a weakelliptical x-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent witha sloshing cold front. the plume is consistent with having formed due to upliftby a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. our resultsare inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the x-ray wings formed dueto the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. we instead conclude thatthe wings are due to x-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radiorelic. the central cd galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that areslightly offset from their optical and uv counterparts, suggestive of agalaxy-galaxy merger event. on larger scales, there is evidence for clustersubstructure in both optical observations and the x-ray temperature map. wesuggest that abell 133 has recently undergone a merger event with aninterloping subgroup, initiating gas sloshing in the core. we show that theadditional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can have a significanteffect on the rise trajectories of buoyant bubbles, although this effect alonecannot fully explain the morphology of abell 133. the radio observations reveala previously unreported background giant radio galaxy at z = 0.293, thenorthern lobe of which overlies the radio relic in the core of abell 133. arough estimate indicates that the contribution of this background lobe to thetotal radio emission in the region of the relic is modest (&lt; 13%).

0709.2152	heating hot atmospheres with active galactic nuclei	high resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the hot gas in galaxy clusters hasshown that the gas is not cooling to low temperatures at the predicted rates ofhundreds to thousands of solar masses per year. x-ray images have revealedgiant cavities and shock fronts in the hot gas that provide a direct andrelatively reliable means of measuring the energy injected into hot atmospheresby active galactic nuclei (agn). average radio jet powers are near thoserequired to offset radiative losses and to suppress cooling in isolated giantelliptical galaxies, and in larger systems up to the richest galaxy clusters.this coincidence suggests that heating and cooling are coupled by feedback,which suppresses star formation and the growth of luminous galaxies. how jetenergy is converted to heat and the degree to which other heating mechanismsare contributing, eg. thermal conduction, are not well understood. outburstenergies require substantial late growth of supermassive black holes. unlessall of the approximately 10e62 erg required to suppress star formation isdeposited in the cooling regions of clusters, agn outbursts must alterlarge-scale properties of the intracluster medium.

1107.2946	average heating rate of hot atmospheres in distant clusters by radio  agn: evidence for continuous agn heating	we examine atmospheric heating by radio active galactic nuclei (agn) indistant x-ray clusters by cross correlating clusters selected from the 400square degree (400sd) x-ray cluster survey with radio sources in the nrao vlasky survey. roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a fluxthreshold of 3 mjy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. the radio emission ispresumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. the mechanical jetpower for each radio source was determined using scaling relations betweenradio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters,groups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing x-ray cavities. theaverage jet power of the central radio agn is approximately $2\times10^{44}$\ergs. we find no significant correlation between radio power, hencemechanical jet power, and the x-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshiftrange 0.1 -- 0.6. this implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle ishigher in lower mass, lower x-ray luminosity clusters. the jet power averagedover the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 kevper particle within r$_{500}$. assuming the current agn heating rate does notevolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particlewould rise by a factor of two. we find that the energy injected from radio agncontribute substantially to the excess entropy in hot atmospheres needed tobreak self-similarity in cluster scaling relations. the detection frequency ofradio agn is inconsistent with the presence of strong cooling flows in 400sdclusters, but does not exclude weak cooling flows. it is unclear whethercentral agn in 400sd clusters are maintained by feedback at the base of acooling flow. atmospheric heating by radio agn may retard the development ofstrong cooling flows at early epochs.

1202.5320	shock fronts, electron-ion equilibration and icm transport processes in  the merging cluster abell 2146	we present a new 400 ks chandra x-ray observation of the merging galaxycluster abell 2146. this deep observation reveals detailed structure associatedwith the major merger event including the mach m=2.3+/-0.2 bow shock ahead ofthe dense, ram pressure stripped subcluster core and the first known example ofan upstream shock in the icm (m=1.6+/-0.1). by measuring the electrontemperature profile behind each shock front, we determine the timescale for theelectron population to thermally equilibrate with the shock-heated ions. wefind that the temperature profile behind the bow shock is consistent with thetimescale for coulomb collisional equilibration and the postshock temperatureis lower than expected for instant shock-heating of the electrons. althoughlike the bullet cluster the electron temperatures behind the upstream shockfront are hotter than expected, favouring the instant heating model, theuncertainty on the temperature values is greater here and there is significantsubstructure complicating the interpretation. we also measured the width ofeach shock front and the contact discontinuity on the leading edge of thesubcluster core to investigate the suppression of transport processes in theicm. the upstream shock is ~440 kpc in length but appears remarkably narrowover this distance with a best-fit width of only 6^{+5}_{-3} kpc compared withthe mean free path of 23+/-5 kpc. the leading edge of the subcluster core isalso narrow with an upper limit on the width of only 2 kpc separating the cool,multiphase gas at 0.5-2 kev from the shock-heated surrounding icm at ~6 kev.the strong suppression of diffusion and conduction across this edge suggests amagnetic draping layer may have formed around the subcluster core.[abridged]

1204.0006	mechanical feedback from active galactic nuclei in galaxies, groups, and  clusters	the radiative cooling timescales at the centers of hot atmospheressurrounding elliptical galaxies, groups, and clusters are much shorter thantheir ages. therefore, hot atmospheres are expected to cool and to form stars.cold gas and star formation are observed in central cluster galaxies but atlevels below those expected from an unimpeded cooling flow. x-ray observationshave shown that wholesale cooling is being offset by mechanical heating fromradio active galactic nuclei. feedback is widely considered to be an importantand perhaps unavoidable consequence of the evolution of galaxies andsupermassive black holes. we show that cooling x-ray atmospheres and theensuing star formation and nuclear activity are probably coupled to aself-regulated feedback loop. while the energetics are now reasonably wellunderstood, other aspects of feedback are not. we highlight the problems ofatmospheric heating and transport processes, accretion, and nuclear activity,and we discuss the potential role of black hole spin. we discuss x-ray imageryshowing that the chemical elements produced by central galaxies are beingdispersed on large scales by outflows launched from the vicinity ofsupermassive black holes. finally, we comment on the growing evidence formechanical heating of distant cluster atmospheres by radio jets and itspotential consequences for the excess entropy in hot halos and a possibledecline in the number of distant cooling flows.

1206.2355	irregular sloshing cold fronts in the nearby merging groups ngc 7618 and  ugc 12491: evidence for kelvin-helmholtz instabilities	we present results from two \sim30 ks chandra observations of the hotatmospheres of the merging galaxy groups centered around ngc 7618 and ugc12491. our images show the presence of arc-like sloshing cold fronts wrappedaround each group center and \sim100 kpc long spiral tails in both groups. mostinterestingly, the cold fronts are highly distorted in both groups, exhibiting'wings' along the fronts. these features resemble the structures predicted fromnon-viscous hydrodynamic simulations of gas sloshing, where kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities (khis) distort the cold fronts. this is in contrast to thestructure seen in many other sloshing and merger cold fronts, which are smoothand featureless at the current observational resolution. both magnetic fieldsand viscosity have been invoked to explain the absence of khis in these smoothcold fronts, but the ngc 7618/ugc 12491 pair are two in a growing number ofboth sloshing and merger cold fronts that appear distorted. magnetic fieldsand/or viscosity may be able to suppress the growth of khis at the cold frontsin some clusters and groups, but clearly not in all. we propose that thepresence or absence of khi-distortions in cold fronts can be used as a measureof the effective viscosity and/or magnetic field strengths in the icm.

1206.7071	radio agn in galaxy clusters: heating hot atmospheres and driving  supermassive black hole growth over cosmic time	we estimate the average radio-agn (mechanical) power deposited into the hotatmospheres of galaxy clusters over more than three quarters of the age of theuniverse. our sample was drawn from eight major x-ray cluster surveys, andincludes 685 clusters in the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 that overlap the areacovered by the nvss. the radio agn mechanical power was estimated from theradio luminosity of central nvss sources, using the relation of cavagnolo etal. 2010 that is based on mechanical powers determined from the enthalpies ofx-ray cavities. we find only a weak correlation between radio luminosity andcluster x-ray luminosity, although the most powerful radio sources resides inluminous clusters. the average agn mechanical power of 3x10^{44} erg/s exceedsthe x-ray luminosity of 44% of the clusters, indicating that the accumulationof radio-agn energy is significant in these clusters. integrating the agnmechanical power to redshift z=2, using simple models for its evolution anddisregarding the hierarchical growth of clusters, we find that the agn energyaccumulated per particle in low luminosity x-ray clusters exceeds 1 kev perparticle. this result represents a conservative lower limit to the accumulatedthermal energy. the estimate is comparable to the level of energy needed to"preheat" clusters, indicating that continual outbursts from radio-agn are asignificant source of gas energy in hot atmospheres. assuming an average massconversion efficiency of $\eta=0.1$, our result implies that the supermassiveblack holes that released this energy did so by accreting an average of ~10^9m_{sun} over time, which is comparable to the level of growth expected duringthe quasar era.

1210.7079	a deep chandra observation of the agn outburst and merger in hickson  compact group 62	we report on an analysis of new chandra data of the galaxy group hcg 62, wellknown for possessing cavities in its intragroup medium (igm) that were inflatedby the radio lobes of its central active galactic nucleus (agn). with the newdata, a factor of three deeper than previous chandra data, we re-examine theenergetics of the cavities and determine new constraints on their contents. weconfirm that the ratio of radiative to mechanical power of the agn outburstthat created the cavities is less than 10^-4, among the lowest of any knowncavity system, implying that the relativistic electrons in the lobes can supplyonly a tiny fraction of the pressure required to support the cavities. thisfinding implies additional pressure support in the lobes from heavy particles(e.g., protons) or thermal gas. using spectral fits to emission in thecavities, we constrain any such volume-filling thermal gas to have atemperature kt &gt; 4.3 kev. for the first time, we detect x-ray emission from thecentral agn, with a luminosity of l(2-10 kev) = (1.1 +/- 0.4) x 10^39 erg s^-1and properties typical of a low-luminosity agn. lastly, we report evidence fora recent merger from the surface brightness, temperature, and metallicitystructure of the igm.

1210.7100	the duty cycle of radio-mode feedback in complete samples of clusters	the chandra x-ray observatory has revealed x-ray bubbles in the intraclustermedium (icm) of many nearby cooling flow clusters. the bubbles trace feedbackthat is thought to couple the central active galactic nucleus (agn) to the icm,helping to stabilize cooling flows and govern the evolution of massivegalaxies. however, the prevalence and duty cycle of such agn outbursts is notwell understood. to this end, we study how cooling is balanced by bubbleheating for complete samples of clusters (the brightest 55 clusters ofgalaxies, hereafter b55, and the highest x-ray flux galaxy cluster sample,hiflugcs). we find that the radio luminosity of the central galaxy only exceeds2.5 x 10^30 erg s^-1 hz^-1 in cooling flow clusters. this result implies aconnection between the central radio source and the icm, as expected if agnfeedback is operating. additionally, we find a duty cycle for radio modefeedback, the fraction of time that a system possesses bubbles inflated by itscentral radio source, of &gt; 69 per cent for b55 and &gt; 63 per cent for hiflugcs.these duty cycles are lower limits since some bubbles are likely missed inexisting images. we used simulations to constrain the bubble power that mightbe present and remain undetected in the cooling flow systems without detectedbubbles. among theses systems, almost all could have significant bubble power.therefore, our results imply that the duty cycle of agn outbursts with thepotential to heat the gas significantly in cooling flow clusters is at least 60per cent and could approach 100 per cent.

1211.4874	kelvin-helmholtz instabilities at the sloshing cold fronts in the virgo  cluster as a measure for the effective icm viscosity	sloshing cold fronts (cfs) arise from minor merger triggered gas sloshing.their detailed structure depends on the properties of the intra-cluster medium(icm): hydrodynamical simulations predict the cfs to be distorted bykelvin-helmholtz instabilities (khis), but aligned magnetic fields, viscosity,or thermal conduction can suppress the khis. thus, observing the detailedstructure of sloshing cfs can be used to constrain these icm properties. bothsmooth and distorted sloshing cfs have been observed, indicating that the khiis suppressed in some clusters, but not in all. consequently, we need toaddress at least some sloshing clusters individually before drawing generalconclusions about the icm properties. we present the first detailed attempt toconstrain the icm properties in a specific cluster from the structure of itssloshing cf. proximity and brightness make the virgo cluster an ideal target.we combine observations and virgo-specific hydrodynamical sloshing simulations.here we focus on a spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity as a mechanismto suppress the khi, but discuss the alternative mechanisms in detail. weidentify the cf at 90 kpc north and north-east of the virgo center as the bestlocation in the cluster to observe a possible khi suppression. for viscosities$\gtrsim$ 10% of the spitzer value khis at this cf are suppressed. we describein detail the observable signatures at low and high viscosities, i.e. in thepresence or absence of khis. we find indications for a low icm viscosity inarchival xmm-newton data and demonstrate the detectability of the predictedfeatures in deep chandra observations.

1211.6722	the nature of filamentary cold gas in the core of the virgo cluster	we present a multi-wavelength study of the emission-line nebulae locatedsoutheast of the nucleus of m87, the central dominant galaxy of the virgocluster. we report the detection of far-infrared (fir) [cii] line emission fromthe nebulae using observations made with herschel pacs. the infrared lineemission is extended and cospatial with optical h{\alpha}+[nii],far-ultraviolet civ lines, and soft x-ray emission. the filamentary nebulaeevidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 k to ~10^7 k. this material has most likelybeen uplifted by the agn from the center of m87. the thermal pressure of the10^4 k phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hotintra-cluster medium (icm) indicating the presence of additional turbulent andmagnetic pressure in the filaments. if the turbulence in the filaments issubsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure ofthe surrounding icm is b~30-70 {\mu}g. the spectral properties of the softx-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasmawith kt~0.5-1 kev, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/orradiatively. charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of softx-rays. both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range oftemperatures. this is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack ofx-ray emitting gas with kt&lt;0.5 kev. however, we show that the missing very softx-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with anintegrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a naturalexplanation for the apparent temperature floor to the x-ray emission at kt~0.5kev. the fir through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarilypowered by the icm particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearinginduced mixing process.

1302.4140	thermodynamics of the coma cluster outskirts	we present results from a large mosaic of suzaku observations of the comacluster, the nearest and x-ray brightest hot, dynamically active, non-cool coresystem, focusing on the thermodynamic properties of the icm on large scales.for azimuths not aligned with an infalling subcluster towards the southwest,our measured temperature and x-ray brightness profiles exhibit broadlyconsistent radial trends, with the temperature decreasing from about 8.5 kev atthe cluster center to about 2 kev at a radius of 2 mpc, which is the edge ofour detection limit. the sw merger significantly boosts the surface brightness,allowing us to detect x-ray emission out to ~2.2 mpc along this direction.apart from the southwestern infalling subcluster, the surface brightnessprofiles show multiple edges around radii of 30-40 arcmin. the azimuthallyaveraged temperature profile, as well as the deprojected density and pressureprofiles, all show a sharp drop consistent with an outward propagating shockfront located at 40 arcmin, corresponding to the outermost edge of the giantradio halo observed at 352 mhz with the wsrt. the shock front may be poweringthis radio emission. a clear entropy excess inside of r_500 reflects theviolent merging events linked with these morphological features. beyond r_500,the entropy profiles of the coma cluster along the relatively relaxeddirections are consistent with the power-law behavior expected from simplemodels of gravitational large-scale structure formation. the pressure is alsoin agreement at these radii with the expected values measured from sz data fromthe planck satellite. however, due to the large uncertainties associated withthe coma cluster measurements, we cannot yet exclude an entropy flattening inthis system consistent with that seen in more relaxed cool core clusters.

1305.0050	a multi-wavelength view of cooling vs. agn heating in the x-ray luminous  cool-core of abell 3581	we report the results of a multi-wavelength study of the nearby galaxy group,abell 3581 (z=0.0218). this system hosts the most luminous cool core of anynearby group and exhibits active radio mode feedback from the super-massiveblack hole in its brightest group galaxy, ic 4374. the brightest galaxy hassuffered multiple active galactic nucleus outbursts, blowing bubbles into thesurrounding hot gas, which have resulted in the uplift of cool ionised gas intothe surrounding hot intragroup medium. high velocities, indicative of anoutflow, are observed close to the nucleus and coincident with the radio jet.thin dusty filaments accompany the uplifted, ionised gas. no extended starformation is observed, however, a young cluster is detected just north of thenucleus. the direction of rise of the bubbles has changed between outbursts.this directional change is likely due to sloshing motions of the intragroupmedium. these sloshing motions also appear to be actively stripping the x-raycool core, as indicated by a spiraling cold front of high metallicity, lowtemperature, low entropy gas.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1307.3592	azimuthally resolved x-ray spectroscopy to the edge of the perseus  cluster	we present the results from extensive, new observations of the perseuscluster of galaxies, obtained as a suzaku key project. the 85 pointingsanalyzed span eight azimuthal directions out to 2 degrees = 2.6 mpc, to andbeyond the virial radius r_200 ~ 1.8 mpc, offering the most detailed x-rayobservation of the intracluster medium (icm) at large radii in any cluster todate. the azimuthally averaged density profile for r&gt;0.4r_200 is relativelyflat, with a best-fit power-law index of 1.69+/-0.13 significantly smaller thanexpected from numerical simulations. the entropy profile in the outskirts liessystematically below the power-law behavior expected from large-scale structureformation models which include only the heating associated with gravitationalcollapse. the pressure profile beyond ~0.6r_200 shows an excess with respect tothe best-fit model describing the sz measurements for a sample of clustersobserved with planck. the inconsistency between the expected and measureddensity, entropy, and pressure profiles can be explained primarily by anoverestimation of the density due to inhomogeneous gas distribution in theoutskirts; there is no evidence for a bias in the temperature measurementswithin the virial radius. we find significant differences in thermodynamicproperties of the icm at large radii along the different arms. along thecluster minor axis, we find a flattening of the entropy profiles outside~0.6r_200, while along the major axis, the entropy rises all the way to theoutskirts. correspondingly, the inferred gas clumping factor is typicallylarger along the minor than along the major axis.

1310.5450	the origin of cold gas in giant elliptical galaxies and its role in  fueling radio-mode agn feedback	we present a multi-wavelength study of the interstellar medium in eightnearby, x-ray and optically bright, giant elliptical galaxies. using herschelpacs, we map the cold gas in the lines of [cii], [oi], and [oib]. additionally,we present ha+[nii] imaging of warm ionized gas with the soar telescope, and astudy of the hot x-ray emitting plasma with chandra. all systems with extendedha emission in our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [cii] lineemission indicating the presence of cold gas. this emission is co-spatial withthe ha+[nii] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy x-ray emitting plasma. theentropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, withthe systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropiesbeyond r~1 kpc than the cold-gas-poor systems. we show that while the hotatmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies are thermally stable outside of theirinnermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems are prone tocooling instabilities. this result indicates that the cold gas is producedchiefly by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. we show that coolinginstabilities may develop more easily in rotating systems and discuss analternative condition for thermal instability for this case. the hotatmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicatingthat the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result invariable power output of the agn jets, potentially triggering sporadic, largeroutbursts. in the two cold-gas-poor, x-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies ofour sample, ngc 1399 and ngc 4472, powerful agn outbursts may have destroyed orremoved most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate anddeposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hotgalactic atmospheres and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.

0803.3595	evidence for non-hydrostatic gas motions in the hot ism of centaurus a	we present preliminary results from a deep (600 ks) {\em chandra} observationof the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a (cena). we find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas $\sim$3.5 kpc fromthe nucleus spanning a 120$^\circ$ arc. the temperature of the gas is0.60$\pm$0.05 and 0.68$\pm$0.10 kev, interior and exterior to thediscontinuity, respectively. the elemental abundance is poorly constrained bythe spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. thiswould imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or mach1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external(internal) to the discontinuity. alternatively, pressure balance could bemaintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in theelemental abundance. we suggest that the observed discontinuity is the resultof non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recentmerger. in this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients areimportant in the visibility of the discontinuity. cen a is in the late stagesof merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in densityand abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the twogalaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after themerger. the pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on thetemporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. the jet could have decollimatedcrossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

1409.6300	stripped elliptical galaxies as probes of icm physics: i. tails, wakes,  and flow patterns in and around stripped ellipticals	elliptical cluster galaxies are progressively stripped of their atmospheresdue to their motion through the intra-cluster medium (icm). deep x-rayobservations reveal the fine-structure of the galaxy's remnant atmosphere andits gas tail and wake. this fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions(galaxy potential, initial gas contents, orbit through the host cluster),orbital stage (early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), and icm plasmaproperties (thermal conductivity, viscosity, magnetic field structure). we aimto disentangle dynamic and plasma effects in order to use stripped ellipticalsas probes of icm plasma properties. this first paper of a series investigatesthe hydrodynamics of progressive gas stripping by means of inviscidhydrodynamical simulations. we distinguish a long-lasting initial relaxationphase and a quasi-steady stripping phase. during quasi-steady stripping, theicm flow around the remnant atmosphere resembles the flow around solid bodies,including a `deadwater' region in the near wake. gas is stripped from theremnant atmosphere predominantly at its sides via kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities. the downstream atmosphere is largely shielded from the icm windand thus shaped into a tail. observationally, both, this `remnant tail' and thestripped gas in the wake can appear as a `tail', but only in the wake cangalactic gas mix with the ambient icm. while the qualitative results aregeneric, the simulations presented here are tailored to the virgo ellipticalgalaxy m89 (ngc 4552) for the most direct comparison to observations. papers iiand iii of this series describe the effect of viscosity and compare to chandraand xmm-newton observations, respectively.

1409.6312	stripped elliptical galaxies as probes of icm physics: ii. stirred, but  mixed? viscous and inviscid gas stripping of the virgo elliptical m89	elliptical galaxies moving through the intra-cluster medium (icm) areprogressively stripped of their gaseous atmospheres. x-ray observations revealthe structure of galactic tails, wakes, and the interface between the galacticgas and the icm. this fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions (galaxypotential, initial gas contents, orbit in the host cluster), orbital stage(early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), as well as on the stillill-constrained icm plasma properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity,magnetic field structure). paper i describes flow patterns and stages ofinviscid gas stripping. here we study the effect of a spitzer-like temperaturedependent viscosity corresponding to reynolds numbers, re, of 50 to 5000 withrespect to the icm flow around the remnant atmosphere. global flow patterns areindependent of viscosity in this reynolds number range. viscosity influencestwo aspects: in inviscid stripping, kelvin-helmholtz instabilities (khis) atthe sides of the remnant atmosphere lead to observable horns or wings.increasing viscosity suppresses khis of increasing length scale, and thusobservable horns and wings. furthermore, in inviscid stripping, strippedgalactic gas can mix with the ambient icm in the galaxy's wake. this mixing issuppressed increasingly with increasing viscosity, such that viscously strippedgalaxies have long x-ray bright, cool wakes. we provide mock x-ray images fordifferent stripping stages and conditions. while these qualitative results aregeneric, we tailor our simulations to the virgo galaxy m89 (ngc 4552), wherere~ 50 corresponds to a viscosity of 10% of the spitzer level. paper iiicompares new deep chandra and archival xmm-newton data to our simulations.

1503.07694	chandra and xmm-newton observations of the merging cluster of galaxies  plck g036.7+14.9	we present chandra and xmm-newton observations of plck g036.7+14.9 from thechandra-planck legacy program. the high resolution x-ray observations revealtwo close subclusters, g036n and g036s, which were not resolved by previousrosat, optical, or recent planck observations. we perform detailed imaging andspectral analyses and use a simplified model to study the kinematics of thissystem. the basic picture is that plck g036.7+14.9 is undergoing a major merger(mass ratio close to unity) between the two massive subclusters, with themerger largely along the line-of-sight and probably at an early stage. g036nhosts a small, moderate cool-core, while g036s has at most a very weakcool-core in the central 40 kpc region. the difference in core cooling times isunlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger disrupting a pre-existing cool-corein g036s. g036n also hosts an unresolved radio source in the center, which maybe heating the gas if the radio source is extended. the planck derived mass ishigher than the x-ray measured mass of either subcluster, but is lower than thex-ray measured mass of the whole cluster, due to the fact that planck does notresolve plck g036.7+14.9 into subclusters and interprets it as a singlecluster. this mass discrepancy could induce significant bias to the massfunction if such previously unresolved systems are common in the planck clustersample. high resolution x-ray observations are necessary to identify thefraction of such systems and correct such a bias for the purpose of precisioncosmological studies.

1503.08205	a very deep chandra observation of the galaxy group ngc 5813: agn  shocks, feedback, and outburst history	we present results from a very deep (650 ks) chandra x-ray observation of thegalaxy group ngc~5813, the deepest chandra observation of a galaxy group todate. earlier observations showed two pairs of cavities distributed roughlycollinearly, with each pair associated with an elliptical shock front. the newobservations confirm a third pair of outer cavities, collinear with the otherpairs, and reveal an associated outer outburst shock at ~30 kpc. this system istherefore unique in exhibiting three cavity pairs, each associated with anunambiguous agn outburst shock front. the implied mean kinetic power is roughlythe same for each outburst, demonstrating that the average agn kineticluminosity can remain stable over long timescales (~50 myr). the two olderoutbursts have larger, roughly equal total energies as compared with theyoungest outburst, implying that the youngest outburst is ongoing. we find thatthe radiative cooling rate and the mean shock heating rate of the gas are wellbalanced at each shock front, suggesting that agn outburst shock heating aloneis sufficient to offset cooling and establish agn/icm feedback within at leastthe central 30 kpc. this heating takes place roughly isotropically and moststrongly at small radii, as is required for feedback to operate. we suggestthat shock heating may play a significant role in agn feedback at smaller radiiin other systems, where weak shocks are more difficult to detect. we findnon-zero shock front widths that are too large to be explained by particlediffusion. instead, all measured widths are consistent with shock broadeningdue to propagation through a turbulent icm with a mean turbulent speed of ~70km/s. finally, we place lower limits on the temperature of any volume-fillingthermal gas within the cavities that would balance the internal cavity pressurewith the external icm.

0806.1929	radiative efficiency and content of extragalactic radio sources: toward  a universal scaling relation between jet power and radio power	we present an analysis of the energetics and particle content of the lobes of24 radio galaxies at the cores of cooling clusters. the radio lobes in thesesystems have created visible cavities in the surrounding hot, x-ray-emittinggas, which allow direct measurement of the mechanical jet power of radiosources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radioproperties themselves. using these measurements, we examine the ratio betweenradio power and total jet power (the radiative efficiency). we find that jet(cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power approximately as p_jet ~(l_radio)^beta, where 0.35 &lt; beta &lt; 0.70 depending on the bandpass ofmeasurement and state of the source. however, the scatter about these relationscaused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than four orders ofmagnitude. after accounting for variations in synchrotron break frequency(age), the scatter is reduced by ~ 50%, yielding the most accurate scalingrelation available between the lobe bolometric radio power and the jet (cavity)power. we place limits on the magnetic field strengths and particle content ofthe radio lobes using a variety of x-ray constraints. we find that the lobemagnetic field strengths vary between a few to several tens of microgaussdepending on the age and dynamical state of the lobes. if the cavities aremaintained in pressure balance with their surroundings and are supported byinternal fields and particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy inelectrons to heavy particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to4000, consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.

astro-ph;0001402	chandra x-ray observations of the hydra a cluster: an interaction  between the radio source and the x-ray-emitting gas	we present chandra x-ray observations of the hydra a cluster of galaxies, andwe report the discovery of structure in the central 80 kpc of the cluster'sx-ray-emitting gas. the most remarkable structures are depressions in the x-raysurface brightness, $\sim 25-35$ kpc diameter, that are coincident with hydraa's radio lobes. the depressions are nearly devoid of x-ray-emitting gas, andthere is no evidence for shock-heated gas surrounding the radio lobes. wesuggest the gas within the surface brightness depressions was displaced as theradio lobes expanded subsonically, leaving cavities in the hot atmosphere. thegas temperature declines from 4 kev at 70 kpc to 3 kev in the inner 20 kpc ofthe brightest cluster galaxy (bcg), and the cooling time of the gas is $\sim600$ myr in the inner 10 kpc. these properties are consistent with the presenceof a $\sim 34 \msunyr$ cooling flow within a 70 kpc radius. bright x-rayemission is present in the bcg surrounding a recently-accreted disk of nebularemission and young stars. the star formation rate is commensurate with thecooling rate of the hot gas within the volume of the disk, although the sinkfor the material cooling at larger radii remains elusive.

astro-ph;0008019	a physical model for the hard x-ray background	we combine a semi-analytic galaxy formation model (nulsen and fabian 1997)with a prescription for the obscured growth of massive black holes (nulsen andfabian 2000; fabian 1999), to reproduce the hard x-ray background (xrb), thelocal 2-10kev agn luminosity function and the source counts, including recentchandra results. the model also complies with constraints on the agncontribution to the far-infrared and sub-mm backgrounds.  the co-moving density of luminous agn [l(2-10kev)&gt;1e44 erg/s, in theunabsorbed rest- frame] in the model declines sharply since z=2, mimicking theobserved evolution of the quasar population. the abundance of lower luminosityagn simultaneously increases, and we identify such objects with the seyfertgalaxies. these features reflect an epoch-dependent rate of bondi accretionfrom the hot, cooling atmosphere: at z&lt;2.5 most agn are fed at much less than10 per cent of the eddington rate, whilst at z&gt;2.5 most accrete at 10-50 percent eddington. unlike other models for quasar and galaxy formation, we do notconsider major mergers between normal galaxies.  the model produces an excess soft xrb below 4kev which can be removed bymodifying the wind expulsion model of fabian (1999) to incorporate anisotropicejection.

astro-ph;0010224	a high resolution study of the hydra a cluster with chandra: comparison  of the core mass distribution with theoretical predictions and evidence for  feedback in the cooling flow	the cooling flow cluster hydra a was observed during the orbital activationand calibration phase of the chandra observatory. while the x-ray image of thecluster exhibits complex structure in the central region as reported inmcnamara $etal$, the large scale x-ray morphology of the cluster is fairlysmooth. a spectroscopic analysis of the acis data shows that the gastemperature in hydra a increases outward, reaches a maximum temperature of 4kev at 200 kpc, and then decreases slightly at larger radii. the distributionof heavy elements is nonuniform, with a factor of two increase in the fe and siabundances within the central 100 kpc. beyond the central 100 kpc the si-to-feabundance ratio is twice solar, while the si-to-fe ratio of the central excessis consistent with the solar value. one of the more surprising results is thelack of spectroscopic evidence for multiphase gas within the bulk of thecooling flow. beyond the central 30 kpc, the acis spectra are adequately fitwith a single temperature model. the addition of a cooling flow component doesnot significantly improve the fit. only within the central 30 kpc (where thecooling time is less than 1~gyr), is there spectroscopic evidence formultiphase gas. however, the spectroscopic mass deposition rate is more than afactor of 10 less than the morphologically derived mass accretion rate at 30kpc. we propose that the cooling flow region is convectively unstable due toheating by the central radio source which significantly reduces the netaccretion rate.

astro-ph;0010509	on the soft x-ray spectrum of cooling flows	strong evidence for cooling flows has been found in low resolution x-rayimaging and spectra of many clusters of galaxies. however high resolution x-rayspectra of several clusters from the reflection grating spectrometer (rgs) onxmm-newton now show a soft x-ray spectrum inconsistent with a simple coolingflow. the main problem is a lack of the emission lines expected from gascooling below 1--2 kev. lines from gas at about 2--3 kev are observed, even ina high temperature cluster such as a 1835, indicating that gas is cooling downto about 2--3 kev, but is not found at lower temperatures. here we discussseveral solutions to the problem; heating, mixing, differential absorption andinhomogeneous metallicity. continuous or sporadic heating creates furtherproblems, including the targetting of the heat at the cooler gas and also thehigh total energy required. so far there is no clear observational evidence forwidespread heating, or shocks, in cluster cores, except in radio lobes whichoccupy only part of the volume. the implied ages of cooling flows are short, atabout 1 gyr. mixing. or absorption, of the cooling gas are other possibilities.alternatively, if the metals in the intracluster medium are not uniformlyspread but are clumped, then little line emission is expected from the gascooling below 1 kev. the low metallicity part cools without line emissionwhereas the strengths of the soft x-ray lines from the metal-rich gas depend onthe mass fraction of that gas and not on the abundance, since soft x-ray lineemission dominates the cooling function below 2 kev.

astro-ph;0110523	interaction of radio lobes with the hot intracluster medium: driving  convective outflow in hydra a	the radio lobes of hydra a lie within cavities surrounded by a rim ofenhanced x-ray emission in the intracluster gas. although the bright rimappears cooler than the surrounding gas, existing chandra data do not excludethe possibility that the rim is produced by a weak shock. a temperature mapshows that cool gas extends out along the radio axis of hydra a. the age of theradio source and equipartition pressure of the radio lobe argue against ashock, and comparison with similar structure in the perseus cluster alsosuggests that the rim is cool. we show that the cool bright rim cannot be theresult of shock induced cooling, or due to the effect of magnetic fields inshocks. the most likely source of low entropy (cool) gas is entrainment by therising cavity. this requires some means of communicating the bouyant force onthe cavity to the surrounding gas. the magnetic field required to produce thefaraday rotation in hydra a has the appropriate properties for this, if thefaraday screen is mainly in this bright rim. in hydra a, the mass outflow dueto the rising cavities could be sufficient to balance cooling driven inflow, sopreventing the build up of low entropy gas in the cluster core.

astro-ph;0402348	a systematic study of radio-induced x-ray cavities in clusters, groups,  and galaxies	we present an analysis of sixteen galaxy clusters, one group and one galaxydrawn from the chandra x-ray observatory's data archive. these systems possessprominent x-ray surface brightness depressions associated with cavities orbubbles that were created by interactions between powerful radio sources andthe surrounding hot gas. the minimum energy associated with the cavities rangesbetween pv~10^55 erg in galaxies, groups, and poor clusters to pv~10^60 erg inrich clusters. we evaluate the hypothesis that cooling in the hot gas can bequenched by energy injected into the surrounding gas by the rising bubbles.nearly half of the systems in this study may have instantaneous mechanicalluminosities large enough to balance cooling, at least for a short period oftime, if the cavities are filled with a relativistic gas. we find a trend orupper envelope in the distribution of central x-ray luminosity versusinstantaneous mechanical luminosity with the sense that the most powerfulcavities are found in the most x-ray luminous systems. such a trend would beexpected if many of these systems produce bubbles at a rate that scales inproportion to the cooling rate of the surrounding gas. finally, we use thex-ray cavities to measure the mechanical power of radio sources over sixdecades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves.we find that the ratio of the instantaneous mechanical (kinetic) luminosity tothe 1.4 ghz synchrotron luminosity ranges from a few to roughly a thousand.this wide range implies that the 1.4 ghz synchrotron luminosity is anunreliable gauge of the mechanical power of radio sources.

astro-ph;0404241	in search of the dark ages -- an experimental challenge	most direct source detections beyond z~7 are likely to arise from wide-fieldnarrowband surveys of ly-a emission in the j band. for this to be true, thely-a emission must somehow escape from compact star-forming regions (csr)presumably associated with massive haloes. since the ly-a escape fraction is&lt;10% from an emitting region of size roughly 1 kpc, these objects will bedifficult to find and hard to detect. for csr sources, existing large-format irarrays are close to ideal in terms of their noise characteristics forconducting "wide-field" narrowband surveys where pixel sizes are 0.1" orlarger. however, we stress that ly-a can also arise from external large-scaleshocks (els) due to starburst winds, powered by csrs, ploughing into gasactively accreting onto the dark halo. the winds effectively carry energy fromthe dense, dusty environment of a starburst into lower density regions, wherethe escape probability for ly-a photons is greater. els emission is expected tobe considerably more clumpy (&lt;100 pc; ~0.01") than csr emission. for a"targetted" observation of an els source, ir arrays will need two orders ofmagnitude improvement in dark current if we wish to detect dispersed clumpyemission within the environment of a massive halo. for either targetted orwide-field surveys, the deepest observations will be those where the pixelsampling is well matched to the size of the emitting regions. we show thatthere are only 3 -- 4 j-band windows [z = 7.72, (8.22), 8.79, 9.37] suitablefor observing the dark ages in ly-a; we summarize their cosmological propertiesin table 1.

astro-ph;0510129	luminosity segregation in three clusters of galaxies (a119, 2443, 2218)	we use deep wide-field v-band imaging obtained with the wide field camera atthe prime focus of the issac newton telescope to study the spatial andluminosity distribution of galaxies in three low redshift (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.2)clusters: abell 119, abell 2443 and abell 2218. the absolute magnitude limitsprobed in these clusters are m_{v} - 5logh_{0.7} = -13.3, -15.4 and -16.7magrespectively. the galaxy population, at all luminosities, along theline-of-sight to the clusters can be described by the linear combination of aking profile and a constant surface density of field galaxies. we find that,for these three clusters, the core radius is invariant with intrinsicluminosity of the cluster population to the above limits and thus there is noevidence for luminosity segregation in these clusters. the exception is thebrightest galaxies in a2218 which exhibit a more compact spatial distribution.we find the total projected luminosity distribution (within 1mpc of the clustercentre) can be well represented by a single schechter function with moderatelyflat faint-end slopes: alpha=-1.22 (a119), alpha=-1.11 (a2443) and alpha=-1.14(a2218). we perform a geometric deprojection of the cluster galaxy populationand confirm that no `statistically significant' evidence of a change in theshape of the luminosity distribution with cluster-centric radius exists. again,the exception being a2218 which exhibits a core region with a flatter faint-endslope.

astro-ph;0601378	the complex x-ray morphology of ngc 7618: a major group-group merger in  the local universe?	we present results from a short {\em chandra}/acis-s observation of ngc 7618,the dominant central galaxy of a nearby ($z$=0.017309, d=74.1 mpc) group. wedetect a sharp surface brightness discontinuity 14.4 kpc n of the nucleussubtending an angle of 130$^\circ$ with an x-ray tail extending $\sim$ 70 kpcin the opposite direction. the temperature of the gas inside and outside thediscontinuity is 0.79$\pm$0.03 and 0.81$\pm$0.07 kev, respectively. there ismarginal evidence for a discontinuous change in the elemental abundance($z_{inner}$=0.65$\pm$0.25,$z_{outer}$=0.17$\pm$0.21 at 90% confidence),suggesting that this may be an `abundance' front. fitting a two-temperaturemodel to the asca/gis spectrum of the ngc 7618/ugc 12491 pair shows thepresence of a second, much hotter ($t$=$\sim$2.3 kev) component. we considerseveral scenarios for the origin of the edge and the tail including a radiolobe/igm interaction, non-hydrostatic `sloshing', equal-mass merger andcollision, and ram-pressure stripping. in the last case, we consider thepossibility that ngc 7618 is falling into ugc 12491, or that both groups arefalling into a gas poor cluster potential. there are significant problems withthe first two models, however, and we conclude that the discontinuity and tailare most likely the result of ram pressure stripping of the ngc 7618 group asit falls into a larger dark matter potential.

astro-ph;0605323	the feedback-regulated growth of black holes and bulges through gas  accretion and starbursts in cluster central dominant galaxies	we present an analysis of the growth of black holes through accretion andbulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at the centers of cooling flows.most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the intracluster medium(icm) inflated by radio jets emanating from their active galactic nuclei (agn).we present a new and extensive analysis of x-ray cavities in these systems. wefind that agn are energetically able to balance radiative losses (cooling) fromthe icm in more than half of our sample. using a subsample of 17 systems, weexamine the relationship between cooling and star formation. we find that thestar formation rates are approaching or are comparable to x-ray and far uvlimits on the rates of gas condensation onto the central galaxy. the remainingradiative losses could be offset by agn feedback. the vast gulf betweenradiative losses and the sink of cooling material, which has been the primaryobjection to cooling flows, has narrowed and, in some cases, is no longer aserious issue. using the cavity (jet) powers, we place strong lower limits onthe rate of growth of supermassive black holes in central galaxies, and we findthat they are growing at an average rate of ~ 0.1 solar masses per year, withsome systems growing as quickly as ~ 1 solar mass per year. we find a trendbetween bulge growth (star formation) and black hole growth that isapproximately in accordance with the slope of the local (magorrian) relationbetween black hole and bulge mass. however, the large scatter in the trendsuggests that bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock step.(abridged)

astro-ph;0612100	x-ray supercavities in the hydra a cluster and the outburst history of  the central galaxy's active nucleus	a 227 ksec chandra observatory x-ray image of the hot plasma in the hydra acluster has revealed an extensive cavity system. the system was created by acontinuous outflow or a series of bursts from the nucleus of the central galaxyover the past 200-500 myr. the cavities have displaced 10% of the plasma withina 300 kpc radius of the central galaxy, creating a swiss-cheese-like topologyin the hot gas. the surface brightness decrements are consistent with emptycavities oriented within 40 degrees of the plane of the sky. the outflow hasdeposited upward of 10^61 erg into the cluster gas, most of which was propelledbeyond the inner ~100 kpc cooling region. the supermassive black hole hasaccreted at a rate of approximately 0.1-0.25 solar masses per year over thistime frame, which is a small fraction of the eddington rate of a ~10^9 solarmass black hole, but is dramatically larger than the bondi rate. given theprevious evidence for a circumnuclear disk of cold gas in hydra a, theseresults are consistent with the agn being powered primarily by infalling coldgas. the cavity system is shadowed perfectly by 330 mhz radio emission. suchlow frequency synchrotron emission may be an excellent proxy for x-ray cavitiesand thus the total energy liberated by the supermassive black hole.

astro-ph;0612258	the growth of black holes and bulges at the cores of cooling flows	central cluster galaxies (cds) in cooling flows are growing rapidly throughgas accretion and star formation. at the same time, agn outbursts fueled byaccretion onto supermassive black holes are generating x-ray cavity systems anddriving outflows that exceed those in powerful quasars. we show that theresulting bulge and black hole growth follows a trend that is roughlyconsistent with the slope of the local (magorrian) relation between bulge andblack hole mass for nearby quiescent ellipticals. however, a large scattersuggests that cd bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock-step. newmeasurements made with xmm, chandra, and fuse of the condensation rates incooling flows are now approaching or are comparable to the star formationrates, alleviating the need for an invisible sink of cold matter. we show thatthe remaining radiation losses can be offset by agn outbursts in more than halfof the systems in our sample, indicating that the level of cooling and starformation is regulated by agn feedback.

astro-ph;9506014	the role of cooling flows in galaxy formation	the present structure of galaxies is governed by the radiative dissipation ofthe gravitational and supernova energy injected during formation. a crucialaspect of this process is whether the gas cools as fast as it falls into thegravitational potential well. if it does then rapid normal star formation isassumed to ensue. if not, and the gas can still cool by the present time, thenthe situation resembles that of a cooling flow, such as commonly found inclusters of galaxies. the cooled matter is assumed to accumulate as very coldclouds and/or low mass stars, i.e. as baryonic dark matter. in this paper weinvestigate the likelihood of a cooling flow phase during the hierarchicalformation of galaxies. we concentrate on the behaviour of the gas, using ahighly simplified treatment of the evolution of the dark matter potentialwithin which the gas evolves. we assume that normal star formation is limitedby how much gas the associated supernovae can unbind and allow the gas profileto flatten as a consequence of supernova energy injection. we find that coolingflows are an important phase in the formation of most galaxies with total (darkplus luminous) masses approxgt 10^12 msun , creating about 20 per cent of thetotal dark halo in a galaxy such as our own and a smaller but comparablefraction of an elliptical galaxy of similar mass. the onset of a cooling flowdetermines the upper mass limit for the formation of a visible spheroid fromgas, setting a characteristic mass scale for normal galaxies. we argue thatdisk formation requires a cooling flow phase and that dissipation in thecooling flow phase is the most important factor in the survival of normalgalaxies during subsequent hierarchical mergers.

0809.2613	chemical enrichment in the cluster of galaxies hydra a	we analyzed global properties, radial profiles and 2d maps of the metalabundances and temperature in the cool core cluster of galaxies hydra a using adeep xmm-newton exposure. the best fit among the available spectral models isprovided by a gaussian distribution of the emission measure (gdem). we canaccurately determine abundances for 7 elements in the cluster core with epicand 3 elements with rgs. the gdem model gives lower fe abundances than a singletemperature model. the abundance profiles for fe, si, s, but also o arecentrally peaked. combining the hydra a results with 5 other clusters for whichdetailed chemical abundance studies are available, we find a significantdecrease of o with radius, while the increase in the o/fe ratio with radius issmall within 0.1 r_200. we compare the observed abundance ratios with themixing of various supernova type ia and core-collapse yield models in differentrelative amounts. producing the estimated o, si and s peaks in hydra a requireseither an amount of metals ejected by stellar winds 3-8 times higher thanpredicted by available models or a remaining peak in the enrichment bycore-collapse supernovae from the protocluster phase. the temperature map showscooler gas extending in arm-like structures towards the north and south. thesestructures appear to be richer in metals than the ambient medium and spatiallycorrelated with the large-scale radio lobes. we estimate the mass of cool gas,which was probably uplifted by buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma producedby the agn, to 1.6-6.1x10^9 m_sun, and the energy associated with this upliftto 3.3-12.5x10^58 ergs. the best estimate of the mass of fe uplifted togetherwith the cool gas is 1.7x10^7 m_sun, 15% of the total mass of fe in the central0.5arcmin region.

astro-ph;9907112	non-gravitational heating in the hierarchical formation of x-ray  clusters	the strong deviation in the properties of x-ray clusters from simple scalinglaws highlights the importance of non-gravitational heating and coolingprocesses in the evolution of proto-cluster gas. we investigate this from twodirections: by finding the amount of `excess energy' required in intra-clustergas in order to reproduce the observed x-ray cluster properties, and bystudying the excess energies obtained from supernovae in a semi-analytic modelof galaxy formation. using the insights obtained from the model, we thencritically discuss possible ways of achieving the high excess specific energiesrequired in clusters. these include heating by supernovae and active galacticnuclei, the role of entropy, and the effect of removing gas through radiativecooling.  our model self-consistently follows the production of excess energy as wellas its effect on star formation in galaxies. excess energy is retained in gasas gravitational, kinetic and/or thermal energy. the gas distribution ofvirialized halos are modelled with a 2-parameter family of gas densityprofiles; gas profiles are then chosen according to the total energy of thegas. we investigate four contrasting ways of modifying gas density profiles inthe presence of excess energy, in order to study the sensitivity of results tothe model. in addition, we estimate the minimum excess specific energy requiredwhen all available gas profiles are considered, using a fiducial cluster with atemperature of around 2 kev. we find that the excess specific energies requiredin clusters lie roughly in the range 1--3 kev/particle.

astro-ph;9908282	fuelling quasars with hot gas	we consider a model for quasar formation in which massive black holes areformed and fuelled largely by the accretion of hot gas during the process ofgalaxy formation. in standard hierarchical collapse models, objects about thesize of normal galaxies and larger form a dense hot atmosphere when theycollapse. we show that if such an atmosphere forms a nearly "maximal" coolingflow, then a central black hole can accrete at close to its eddington limit.this leads to exponential growth of a seed black hole, resulting in a quasar insome cases. in this model, the first quasars form soon after the firstcollapses to produce hot gas. the hot gas is depleted as time progresses,mostly by cooling, so that the accretion rate eventually falls below thethreshold for advection-dominated accretion, at which stage radiativeefficiency plummets and any quasar turns off. a simple implementation of thismodel, incorporated into a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation,over-produces quasars when compared with observed luminosity functions, but isconsistent with models of the x-ray background which indicate that mostaccretion is obscured. it produces few quasars at high redshift due to the lackof time needed to grow massive black holes. quasar fuelling by hot gas providesa minimum level, sufficient to power most quasars at redshifts between one andtwo, to which other sources of fuel can be added. the results are sensitive tofeedback effects, such as might be due to radio jets and other outflows.

astro-ph;9910122	the soft x-ray background: evidence for widespread disruption of the gas  halos of galaxy groups	almost all of the extragalactic x-ray background (xrb) at 0.25 kev can beaccounted for by radio-quiet quasars, allowing us to derive an upper limit of 4\bgunit\ for the remaining background at 0.25 kev. however, the xrb from thegas halos of groups of galaxies, with gas removal due to cooling accounted for,exceeds this upper limit by an order of magnitude if non-gravitational heatingis not included. we calculate this using simulations of halo merger trees andrealistic gas density profiles, which we require to reproduce the observed gasfractions and abundances of x-ray clusters. in addition, we find that theentire mass range of groups, from $\sim 5\times 10^{12}$ to $\sim 10^{14}$\ms,contributes to the 0.25 kev background in this case. in a further study, wereduce the luminosities of groups by maximally heating their gas halos whilemaintaining the same gas fractions. this only reduces the xrb by a factor of 2or less. we thus argue that most of the gas associated with groups must beoutside their virial radii. this conclusion is supported by x-ray studies ofindividual groups. the properties of both groups and x-ray clusters can benaturally explained by a model in which the gas is given excess specificenergies of $\sim 1$ kev/particle by non-gravitational heating. with thisexcess energy, the gas is gravitationally unbound from groups, but recollapseswith the formation of a cluster of temperature $\ga 1$ kev. this is similar toa model proposed by pen, but is contrary to the evolution of baryons describedby cen \&amp; ostriker.

astro-ph;9910188	asca and rosat observations of nearby cluster cooling flows	we present a detailed analysis of the x-ray properties of the cooling flowsin a sample of nearby, x-ray bright clusters of galaxies using high-qualityasca spectra and rosat x-ray images. we demonstrate the need for multiphasemodels to consistently explain the spectral and imaging x-ray data for theclusters. the mass deposition rates of the cooling flows, independentlydetermined from the asca spectra and rosat images, exhibit reasonableagreement. we confirm the presence of intrinsic x-ray absorption in theclusters using a variety of spectral models. we also report detections ofextended $100\mu$m infrared emission, spatially coincident with the coolingflows, in several of the systems studied. the observed infrared fluxes and fluxlimits are in good agreement with the predicted values due to reprocessed x-rayemission from the cooling flows. we present precise measurements of theabundances of iron, magnesium, silicon and sulphur in the central regions ofthe virgo and centaurus clusters. our results firmly favour models in which ahigh mass fraction (70-80 per cent) of the iron in the x-ray gas in theseregions is due to type ia supernovae. finally, we present a series of methodswhich may be used to measure the ages of cooling flows from the x-ray data. theresults for the present sample of clusters indicate ages of between 2.5 and 7gyr. if the ages of cooling flows are primarily set by subcluster mergerevents, then our results suggest that in the largest clusters, mergers withsubclusters with masses of approximately 30 per cent of the final cluster massare likely to disrupt cooling flows.

0810.0271	the large-scale shock in the cluster of galaxies hydra a	we analyzed a deep xmm-newton observation of the cluster of galaxies hydra a,focusing on the large-scale shock discovered as a surface brightnessdiscontinuity in chandra images. the shock front can be seen both in thepressure map and in temperature profiles in several sectors. the mach numbersdetermined from the temperature jumps are in good agreement with the machnumbers derived from epic/pn surface brightness profiles and previously fromchandra data and are consistent with m~1.3. the estimated shock age in thedifferent sectors using a spherically symmetric point explosion model rangesbetween 130 and 230 myr and the outburst energy between 1.5 and 3e61 ergs. theshape of the shock seen in the pressure map can be approximated with an ellipsecentered 70 kpc towards the ne from the cluster center. we aimed to develop abetter model that can explain the offset between the shock center and the agnand give a consistent result on the shock age and energy. to this end, weperformed 3d hydrodynamical simulations in which the shock is produced by asymmetrical pair of agn jets launched in a spherical galaxy cluster. as anexplanation of the observed offset of the shock center, we consider large-scalebulk flows in the intracluster medium. the simulation successfully reproducesthe size, ellipticity, and average mach number of the observed shock front. thepredicted age of the shock is 160 myr and the total input energy 3e61 erg. bothvalues are within the range determined by the spherically symmetric model.matching the observed 70 kpc offset of the shock ellipse from the clustercenter requires large-scale coherent motions with a high velocity of 670 km/s.we discuss the feasibility of this scenario and offer alternative ways toproduce the offset and to further improve the simulation.

0811.3020	an energetic agn outburst powered by a rapidly spinning supermassive  black hole or an accreting ultramassive black hole	powering the 10^62 erg nuclear outburst in the ms0735.6+7421 cluster centralgalaxy by accretion implies that its supermassive black hole (smbh) grew by~6x10^8 solar masses over the past 100 myr. we place upper limits on the amountof cold gas and star formation near the nucleus of &lt;10^9 solar masses and &lt;2solar masses per year, respectively. these limits imply that an implausiblylarge fraction of the preexisting cold gas in the bulge must have been consumedby its smbh at the rate of ~3-5 solar masses per year while leaving no trace ofstar formation. such a high accretion rate would be difficult to maintain bystellar accretion or the bondi mechanism, unless the black hole mass approaches10^11 solar masses. its feeble nuclear luminosities in the uv, i, and x-raybands compared to its enormous mechanical power are inconsistent with rapidaccretion onto a ~5x10^9 solar mass black hole. we suggest instead that the agnoutburst is powered by a rapidly-spinning black hole. a maximally-spinning,10^9 solar mass black hole contains enough rotational energy, ~10^62 erg, toquench a cooling flow over its lifetime and to contribute significantly to theexcess entropy found in the hot atmospheres of groups and clusters. two modesof agn feedback may be quenching star formation in elliptical galaxies centeredin cooling halos at late times. an accretion mode that operates in gas-richsystems, and a spin mode operating at modest accretion rates. the spinconjecture may be avoided in ms0735 by appealing to bondi accretion onto acentral black hole whose mass greatly exceeds 10^10 solar mass. the hostgalaxy's unusually large, 3.8 kpc stellar core radius (light deficit) maywitness the presence of an ultramassive black hole.
