0904.0013	submillimeter observations of the quiescent core - ophiuchus a-n6	we have observed the oph a-n6 prestellar core in the following transitions:n2d+ j=3 to 2, dco+ j=3 to 2 and j=5 to 4, hco+ j=3 to 2, cs j=5 to 4 and j=7to 6, and h13co+ j=3 to 2 and j=4 to 3, using the james clerk maxwelltelescope. we also observed the nh3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitionstowards the oph a-n6 peak with the green bank telescope. we have found that then6 core is composed of shells of different chemical composition due to thefreezing out of chemical species at different densities. the undepleted speciesn2d+ appears to trace the high-density interior of the core, dco+ and h13co+trace an intermediate region, and cs traces the outermost edges of the core. adistinct blue-red spectral asymmetry, indicative of infall motion, is clearlydetected in the hco+ spectra, suggesting that n6 is undergoing gravitationalcollapse. this collapse was possibly initiated by a decrease in turbulentsupport suggested by the fact that the non-thermal contribution to the linewidths is smaller for the molecular species closer to the center of the core.we also present a temperature profile for the core. these observations supportthe claim that the oph a-n6 core is an extremely young prestellar core, whichmay have been recently cut off from mhd support and begun to collapse.

0707.0169	the james clerk maxwell telescope legacy survey of nearby star-forming  regions in the gould belt	this paper describes a james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) legacy surveythat has been awarded roughly 500 hrs of observing time to be carried out from2007 to 2009. in this survey we will map with scuba-2 (submillimetre commonuser bolometer array 2) almost all of the well-known low-mass andintermediate-mass star-forming regions within 0.5 kpc that are accessible fromthe jcmt. most of these locations are associated with the gould belt. fromthese observations we will produce a flux-limited snapshot of star formationnear the sun, providing a legacy of images, as well as point-source andextended-source catalogues, over almost 700 square degrees of sky. theresulting images will yield the first catalogue of prestellar and protostellarsources selected by submillimetre continuum emission, and should increase thenumber of known sources by more than an order of magnitude. we will also obtainco maps with the array receiver harp (heterodyne array receiver programme), inthree co isotopologues, of a large typical sample of prestellar andprotostellar sources. we will then map the brightest hundred sources with thescuba-2 polarimeter (pol-2), producing the first statistically significant setof polarization maps in the submillimetre. the images and source catalogueswill be a powerful reference set for astronomers, providing a detailed legacyarchive for future telescopes, including alma, herschel and jwst.

0911.5648	probing the evolution of molecular cloud structure: from quiescence to  birth	aims: we derive the probability density functions (pdfs) of column densityfor a complete sample of prominent molecular cloud complexes closer than 200pc. methods: we derive near-infrared dust extinction maps for 23 molecularcloud complexes, using the "nicest" colour excess mapping technique and datafrom the 2mass archive. the extinction maps are then used to examine the columndensity pdfs in the clouds. results: the column density pdfs of most molecularclouds are well-fitted by log-normal functions at low column densities (0.5 mag&lt; a_v &lt; 3-5 mag). however, at higher column densities prominent, power-law-likewings are common. in particular, we identify a trend among the pdfs: activestar-forming clouds always have prominent non-log-normal wings. in contrast,clouds without active star formation resemble log-normals over the wholeobserved column density range, or show only low excess of higher columndensities. this trend is also reflected in the cumulative pdfs, showing thatthe fraction of high column density material is significantly larger instar-forming clouds. these observations are in agreement with an evolutionarytrend where turbulent motions are the main cloud-shaping mechanism forquiescent clouds, but the density enhancements induced by them quickly becomedominated by gravity (and other mechanisms) which is strongly reflected by theshape of the column density pdfs. the dominant role of the turbulence isrestricted to the very early stages of molecular cloud evolution, comparable tothe onset of active star formation in the clouds.

1005.1506	mapping the column density and dust temperature structure of irdcs with  herschel	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold and dense reservoirs of gas potentiallyavailable to form stars. many of these clouds are likely to be pristinestructures representing the initial conditions for star formation. the studypresented here aims to construct and analyze accurate column density and dusttemperature maps of irdcs by using the first herschel data from the hi-galgalactic plane survey. these fundamental quantities, are essential forunderstanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of theformation of stars in molecular clouds. we have developed a simplepixel-by-pixel sed fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.by fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatialvariations in both the dust column density and temperature within the irdcs.this method is applied to a sample of 22 irdcs exhibiting a range of angularsizes and peak column densities. our analysis shows that the dust temperaturedecreases significantly within irdcs, from background temperatures of 20-30 kto minimum temperatures of 8-15 k within the clouds, showing that densemolecular clouds are not isothermal. temperature gradients have most likely animportant impact on the fragmentation of irdcs. local temperature minima arestrongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach nh2 =1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellarcores. applying this technique to the full hi-gal data set will provideimportant constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of irdcs, andhelp identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.

1005.1671	strong absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride: herschel/hifi  observations of the sight-line to g10.6-0.4 (w31c)	we report the detection of strong absorption by interstellar hydrogenfluoride along the sight-line to the submillimeter continuum source g10.6-0.4(w31c). we have used herschel's hifi instrument, in dual beam switch mode, toobserve the 1232.4763 ghz j=1-0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band5a receiver. the resultant spectrum shows weak hf emission from g10.6-0.4 atlsr velocities in the range -10 to -3 km/s, accompanied by strong absorption byforeground material at lsr velocities in the range 15 to 50 km/s. the spectrumis similar to that of the 1113.3430 ghz 1(11)-0(00) transition of para-water,although at some frequencies the hf (hydrogen fluoride) optical depth clearlyexceeds that of para-h2o. the optically-thick hf absorption that we haveobserved places a conservative lower limit of 1.6e+14 cm-2 on the hf columndensity along the sight-line to g10.6-0.4. our lower limit on the hf abundance,6e-9 relative to hydrogen nuclei, implies that hydrogen fluoride accounts forbetween ~ 30 and 100% of the fluorine nuclei in the gas phase along thissight-line. this observation corroborates theoretical predictions that -because the unique thermochemistry of fluorine permits the exothermic reactionof f atoms with molecular hydrogen - hf will be the dominant reservoir ofinterstellar fluorine under a wide range of conditions.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.2148	detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds  with herschel/hifi: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas	we discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (hf)along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources w49n and w51. wehave used herschel's hifi instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the1232.4762 ghz j = 1 - 0 hf transition in the upper sideband of the band 5areceiver. we detected foreground absorption by hf toward both sources over awide range of velocities. optically thin absorption components were detected onboth sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limiton - the column density of hf for the first time. as in previous observationsof hf toward the source g10.6-0.4, the derived hf column density is typicallycomparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance ofoxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. we usedthe rather uncertain n(ch)-n(h2) relationship derived previously toward diffusemolecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the cloudsexhibiting hf absorption. within the uncertainties, we find that the abundanceof hf with respect to h2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that hfis the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. thus, hydrogenfluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small h2 column density. indeed,the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of alow column density diffuse molecular cloud along the w51 sight line, at an lsrvelocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorptionline studies prior to the launch of herschel.

1007.4370	variations in h2o+/h2o ratios toward massive star-forming regions	early results from the herschel space observatory revealed the water cationh2o+ to be an abundant ingredient of the interstellar medium. here we presentnew observations of the h2o and h2o+ lines at 1113.3 and 1115.2 ghz using theherschel space observatory toward a sample of high-mass star-forming regions toobservationally study the relation between h2o and h2o+ . nine out of tensources show absorption from h2o+ in a range of environments: the molecularclumps surrounding the forming and newly formed massive stars, brighthigh-velocity outflows associated with the massive protostars, and unrelatedlow-density clouds along the line of sight. column densities per velocitycomponent of h2 o+ are found in the range of 10^12 to a few 10^13 cm-2 . thehighest n(h2o+) column densities are found in the outflows of the sources. theratios of h2o+/h2o are determined in a range from 0.01 to a few and are foundto differ strongly between the observed environments with much lower ratios inthe massive (proto)cluster envelopes (0.01-0.1) than in outflows and diffuseclouds. remarkably, even for source components detected in h2o in emission,h2o+ is still seen in absorption.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.1254	herschel-hifi spectroscopy of the intermediate mass protostar ngc7129  firs 2	herschel-hifi observations of water from the intermediate mass protostarngc7129 firs 2 provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in thisstar formation environment. six spectral settings, covering four h216o and twoh218o lines, were observed and all but one h218o line were detected. the fourh2 16 o lines discussed here share a similar morphology: a narrower, \approx 6km/s, component centered slightly redward of the systemic velocity of ngc7129firs 2 and a much broader, \approx 25 km/s component centered blueward andlikely associated with powerful outflows. the narrower components areconsistent with emission from water arising in the envelope around theintermediate mass protostar, and the abundance of h2o is constrained to \approx10-7 for the outer envelope. additionally, the presence of a narrowself-absorption component for the lowest energy lines is likely due toself-absorption from colder water in the outer envelope. the broader component,where the h2o/co relative abundance is found to be \approx 0.2, appears to betracing the same energetic region that produces strong co emission at high j.

1101.3154	the initial conditions of high-mass star formation: radiative transfer  models of irdcs seen in the herschel hi-gal survey	the densest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) may represent the earliestobservable stage of high-mass star formation. these clouds are very cold, hencethey emit mainly at far-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. for the first time,herschel has provided multi-wavelength, spatially resolved observations ofcores within irdcs, which, when combined with radiative transfer modelling, canconstrain their properties, such as mass, density profile and dust temperature.we use a 3d, multi-wavelength monte carlo radiative transfer code to model indetail the emission from six cores in three typical irdcs seen in the hi-galsurvey (g030.50+00.95, g031.03+00.26 and g031.03+00.76), and thereby todetermine the properties of these cores and compare them with their low-massequivalents. we found masses ranging from 90 to 290 solar masses withtemperatures from 8 to 11k at the centre of each core and 18 to 28k at thesurface. the maximum luminosity of an embedded star within each core wascalculated, and we rule out the possibility of significant high mass starformation having yet occurred in three of our cores.

1101.5529	the jcmt spectral legacy survey: physical structure of the molecular  envelope of the high-mass protostar afgl2591	the understanding of the formation process of massive stars (&gt;8 msun) islimited, due to theoretical complications and observational challenges.  we investigate the physical structure of the large-scale (~10^4-10^5 au)molecular envelope of the high-mass protostar afgl2591 using spectral imagingin the 330-373 ghz regime from the jcmt spectral legacy survey. out of ~160spectral features, this paper uses the 35 that are spatially resolved.  the observed spatial distributions of a selection of six species are comparedwith radiative transfer models based on a static spherically symmetricstructure, a dynamic spherical structure, and a static flattened structure. themaps of co and its isotopic variations exhibit elongated geometries on scalesof ~100", and smaller scale substructure is found in maps of n2h+, o-h2co, cs,so2, cch, and methanol lines. a velocity gradient is apparent in maps of allmolecular lines presented here, except so, so2, and h2co. we find two emissionpeaks in warm (eup~200k) methanol separated by 12", indicative of a secondaryheating source in the envelope.  the spherical models are able to explain the distribution of emission for theoptically thin h13co+ and c34s, but not for the optically thick hcn, hco+, andcs, nor for the optically thin c17o. the introduction of velocity structuremitigates the optical depth effects, but does not fully explain theobservations, especially in the spectral dimension. a static flattened envelopeviewed at a small inclination angle does slightly better.  we conclude that a geometry of the envelope other than an isotropic staticsphere is needed to circumvent line optical depth effects. we propose that thiscould be achieved in envelope models with an outflow cavity and/orinhomogeneous structure at scales smaller than ~10^4 au. the picture ofinhomogeneity is supported by observed substructure in at least six species.

1107.2298	the coalsack near and far	context: the large coalsack dark cloud is one of the rare molecular cloudswithout clear signs of star formation. aims: we investigate the dynamicalproperties of the gas within the coalsack. methods: the two highest extinctionregions were mapped with the apex telescope in 13co(2-1) comprising a region of~1 square degree. results: in addition to the well-known, nearby gas componentaround -4km/s, we identified additional molecular gas components - inparticular a second extended molecular cloud at a velocity of ~-30km/s and anestimated distance of ~3.1kpc - that dominate the column density and visualextinction distributions in the northeastern part of the coalsack. althoughcomprising ~2600msun, the mass of this distant cloud is distributed over anextent of ~73pc, much larger than typical high-mass infrared dark clouds. itsfilamentary structure is consistent with a compressible gaseousself-gravitating cylinder, and its low mass per length indicates that it may bestable against gravitational collapse. we find barely any mid-infrared emissionin archival msx data, which is indicative of almost no star-formation activityin the near and far cloud complexes. the nearby clouds have narrow, almostthermal velocity dispersions with median values between 0.2 and 0.4km/s, whichis also consistent with low star-formation activity. only tapia's globule 2exhibits a velocity dispersion increase toward the extinction peak andpeak-velocity gradients over the core, which is indicative of a state ofelevated dynamical properties. conclusions: the coalsack is not one singlecoherent structure, but consists of several cloud complexes nearby as well asat several kpc distance. all studied clouds appear as starless low-turbulenceregions that may not even collapse in the future. only one globule exhibitsmore dynamical signatures and is a good candidate for present/future starformation.

1202.0395	cores in infra-red dark clouds (irdcs) seen in the hi-gal survey between  l = 300{\deg} and l = 330{\deg}	we have used data taken as part of the herschel infrared galactic planesurvey (hi-gal) to study 3171 infrared-dark cloud (irdc) candidates that wereidentified in the mid-infrared (8 {\mu}m) by spitzer (we refer to these as'spitzer-dark' regions). they all lie in the range l=300 - 330 \circ and |b| 61 \circ. of these, only 1205 were seen in emission in the far-infrared (250-500{\mu}m) by herschel (we call these 'herschel-bright' clouds). it is predictedthat a dense cloud will not only be seen in absorption in the mid-infrared, butwill also be seen in emission in the far-infrared at the longest herschelwavebands (250-500 {\mu}m). if a region is dark at all wavelengths throughoutthe mid-infrared and far-infrared, then it is most likely to be simply a regionof lower background infrared emission (a 'hole in the sky'). hence, it appearsthat previous surveys, based on spitzer and other mid-infrared data alone, mayhave over-estimated the total irdc population by a factor of 2. this hasimplications for estimates of the star formation rate in irdcs in the galaxy.westudied the 1205 herschel-bright irdcs at 250 {\mu}m, and found that 972 ofthem had at least one clearly defined 250-{\mu}m peak, indicating that theycontained one or more dense cores. of these, 653 (67 per cent) contained an8-{\mu}m point source somewhere within the cloud, 149 (15 per cent) contained a24-{\mu}m point source but no 8-{\mu}m source, and 170 (18 per cent) containedno 24-{\mu}m or 8-{\mu}m point sources. we use these statistics to makeinferences about the lifetimes of the various evolutionary stages of irdcs.

1204.0390	extended warm and dense gas towards w49a: starburst conditions in our  galaxy?	the star formation rates in starburst galaxies are orders of magnitude higherthan in local star-forming regions, and the origin of this difference is notwell understood. we use sub-mm spectral line maps to characterize the physicalconditions of the molecular gas in the luminous galactic star-forming regionw49a and compare them with the conditions in starburst galaxies. we probe thetemperature and density structure of w49a using h_2co and hcn line ratios overa 2'x2' (6.6x6.6 pc) field with an angular resolution of 15" (~0.8 pc) providedby the jcmt spectral legacy survey. we analyze the rotation diagrams of lineswith multiple transitions with corrections for optical depth and beam dilution,and estimate excitation temperatures and column densities. comparing theobserved line intensity ratios with non-lte radiative transfer models, ourresults reveal an extended region (about 1'x1', equivalent to ~3x3 pc at thedistance of w49a) of warm (&gt; 100 k) and dense (&gt;10^5 cm^-3) molecular gas, witha mass of 2x10^4 - 2x10^5 m_sun (by applying abundances derived for otherregions of massive star-formation). these temperatures and densities in w49aare comparable to those found in clouds near the center of the milky way and instarburst galaxies. the highly excited gas is likely to be heated via shocksfrom the stellar winds of embedded, o-type stars or alternatively due to uvirradiation, or possibly a combination of these two processes. cosmic rays,x-ray irradiation and gas-grain collisional heating are less likely to be thesource of the heating in the case of w49a.

1406.4443	the identification of filaments on far infrared and submillimiter  images. morphology, physical conditions and relation with star formation of  filamentary structure	observations of molecular clouds reveal a complex structure, with gas anddust often arranged in filamentary rather than spherical geometries. theassociations of pre- and proto- stellar cores with the filaments suggest adirect link with the process of star formation. any study of the properties ofsuch filaments requires a representative samples from different enviroments andso an unbiased detection method. we developed such an approach using thehessian matrix of a surface-brightness distribution to identify filaments anddetermine their physical and morphological properties. after testing the methodon simulated, but realistic filaments, we apply the algorithms tocolumn-density maps computed from herschel observations of the galactic planeobtained by the hi-gal project. we identified ~500 filaments, in the longituderange of l=216.5 to l=225.5, with lengths from ~1 pc up to ~30 pc and widthsbetween 0.1 pc and 2.5 pc. average column densities are between 10^20 cm^-2 and10^22 cm^-2. filaments include the majority of dense material with n_h_2 &gt;6x10^21cm^-2. we find that the pre- and proto-stellar compact sources alreadyidentified in the same region are mostly associated with filaments. however,surface densities in excess of the expected critical values for high-mass starformation are only found on the filaments, indicating that these structures arenecessary to channel material into the clumps. furthermore, we analyze thegravitational stability of filaments and discuss their relationship with starformation.

1509.00318	the jcmt plane survey: early results from the l = 30 degree field	we present early results from the jcmt plane survey (jps), which has surveyedthe northern inner galactic plane between longitudes l=7 and l=63 degrees inthe 850-{\mu}m continuum with scuba-2, as part of the james clerk maxwelltelescope legacy survey programme. data from the l=30 degree survey region,which contains the massive star-forming regions w43 and g29.96, are analysedafter approximately 40% of the observations had been completed. thepixel-to-pixel noise is found to be 19 mjy/beam, after a smooth over the beamarea, and the projected equivalent noise levels in the final survey areexpected to be around 10 mjy/beam. an initial extraction of compact sources wasperformed using the fellwalker method resulting in the detection of 1029sources above a 5-{\sigma} surface-brightness threshold. the completenesslimits in these data are estimated to be around 0.2 jy/beam (peak flux density)and 0.8 jy (integrated flux density) and are therefore probably alreadydominated by source confusion in this relatively crowded section of the survey.the flux densities of extracted compact sources are consistent with those ofmatching detections in the shallower atlasgal survey. we analyse the virial andevolutionary state of the detected clumps in the w43 star-forming complex andfind that they appear younger than the galactic-plane average.

1512.08235	chimps: the $^{13}$co/c$^{18}$o (j=3-2) heterodyne inner milky way plane  survey	we present the $^{13}$co/c$^{18}$o (j=3-2) heterodyne inner milky way planesurvey (chimps) which has been carried out using the heterodyne array receiverprogram on the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) in hawaii. thehigh-resolution spectral survey currently covers |b| &lt; 0.5 deg and 28 &lt; l &lt; 46deg, with an angular resolution of 15 arcsec in 0.5 km/s velocity channels. thespectra have a median rms of $\sim$ 0.6 k at this resolution, and for opticallythin gas at an excitation temperature of 10 k, this sensitivity corresponds tocolumn densities of $n_{\mathrm{h}_{2}} \sim 3 \times 10^{20}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and$n_{\mathrm{h}_{2}} \sim 4 \times 10^{21}\,$cm$^{-2}$ for $^{13}$co andc$^{18}$o, respectively. the molecular gas that chimps traces is at highercolumn densities and is also more optically thin than in other publiclyavailable co surveys due to its rarer isotopologues, and thus morerepresentative of the three-dimensional structure of the clouds. the criticaldensity of the j=3-2 transition of co is $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ attemperatures of $\leq 20$ k, and so the higher density gas associated with starformation is well traced. these data complement other existing galactic planesurveys, especially the jcmt galactic plane survey which has similar spatialresolution and column density sensitivity, and the herschel infrared galacticplane survey. in this paper, we discuss the observations, data reduction andcharacteristics of the survey, presenting integrated emission maps for theregion covered. position-velocity diagrams allow comparison with galacticstructure models of the milky way, and while we find good agreement with aparticular four arm model, there are some significant deviations.

astro-ph;0010392	the distribution of water emission in m17sw	we present a 17-point map of the m17sw cloud core in the 1_{10}-1_{01}transition of ortho-water at 557 ghz obtained with the submillimeter waveastronomy satellite. water emission was detected in 11 of the 17 observedpositions. the line widths of the water emission vary between 4 and 9 kms^{-1}, and are similar to other emission lines that arise in the m17sw core. adirect comparison is made between the spatial extent of the water emission andthe ^{13}co j = 5\to4 emission; the good agreement suggests that the wateremission arises in the same warm, dense gas as the ^{13}co emission. a spectrumof the h_2^{18}o line was also obtained at the center position of the cloudcore, but no emission was detected. we estimate that the average abundance ofortho-water relative to h_2 within the m17 dense core is approximately1x10^{-9}, 30 times smaller than the average for the orion core. toward the hii region/molecular cloud interface in m17sw the ortho-water abundance may beabout 5 times larger than in the dense core.

astro-ph;0010393	water abundance in molecular cloud cores	we present submillimeter wave astronomy satellite (swas) observations of the1_{10}-1_{01} transition of ortho-water at 557 ghz toward 12 molecular cloudcores. the water emission was detected in ngc 7538, rho oph a, ngc 2024, crl2591, w3, w3(oh), mon r2, and w33, and was not detected in tmc-1, l134n, andb335. we also present a small map of the water emission in s140. observationsof the h_2^{18}o line were obtained toward s140 and ngc 7538, but no emissionwas detected. the abundance of ortho-water relative to h_2 in the giantmolecular cloud cores was found to vary between 6x10^{-10} and 1x10^{-8}. fiveof the cloud cores in our sample have previous water detections; however, inall cases the emission is thought to arise from hot cores with small angularextents. the water abundance estimated for the hot core gas is at least 100times larger than in the gas probed by swas. the most stringent upper limit onthe ortho-water abundance in dark clouds is provided in tmc-1, where the3-sigma upper limit on the ortho-water fractional abundance is 7x10^{-8}.

astro-ph;0010394	extended [c i] and ^{13}co(5-4) emission in m17sw	we mapped a 13 by 22 pc region in emission from 492 ghz [c i] and, for thefirst time, 551 ghz ^{13}co(5-4) in the giant molecular cloud m17sw, using thesubmillimeter wave astronomy satellite. the morphologies of the [c i] and^{13}co emission are strikingly similar. the extent and intensity of the [c i]and ^{13}co(5-4) emission is explained as arising from photodissociationregions on the surfaces of embedded molecular clumps. modeling of the^{13}co(5-4) emission in comparison to ^{13}co(1-0) indicates a temperaturegradient across the cloud, peaking to at least 63 k near the m17 ionizationfront and decreasing to at least 20 k at the western edge of the cloud. we seeno correlation between gas density and column density. the beam-averaged columndensity of c i in the core is 1x10^{18} cm^-2, and the mean column densityratio n(c i)/n(co) is about 0.4. the variations of n(c i)/n(co) with positionin m17sw indicate a similar clump size distribution throughout the cloud.

astro-ph;0303139	submillimeter emission from water in the w3 region	we have mapped the submillimeter emission from the 1(10)-1(01) transition ofortho-water in the w3 star-forming region. a 5'x5' map of the w3 irs4 and w3irs5 region reveals strong water lines at half the positions in the map. therelative strength of the odin lines compared to previous observations by swassuggests that we are seeing water emission from an extended region. across muchof the map the lines are double-peaked, with an absorption feature at -39 km/s;however, some positions in the map show a single strong line at -43 km/s. weinterpret the double-peaked lines as arising from optically thick,self-absorbed water emission near the w3 irs5, while the narrower blue-shiftedlines originate in emission near w3 irs4. in this model, the unusual appearanceof the spectral lines across the map results from a coincidental agreement invelocity between the emission near w3 irs4 and the blue peak of the morecomplex lines near w3 irs5. the strength of the water lines near w3 irs4suggests we may be seeing water emission enhanced in a photon-dominated region.

astro-ph;0506664	co in hi self-absorbed clouds in perseus	we have observed 12co j = 2-1 and j = 1-0, and 13co j = 1-0 emission in tworegions of hi self-absorption (hisa) in perseus: a small, isolated hisa featurecalled the globule and a more extended hisa cloud called the complex. usingboth large velocity gradient and monte carlo radiative transfer codes we foundthat, in the globule, n(12co) &lt; 6.0x10^15 cm-2 which, using pdr models, impliesthat n(h_2) &lt; 9.9x10^20 cm-2. in the complex we found that the h_2 columndensities ranged from 1.2 - 2.2 x 10^21 cm-2. by comparing the hisa and coobservations we are able to constrain the physical conditions and atomic gasfraction (f). in the globule, 8 k &lt; t_spin &lt; 22 k and 0.02 &lt; f &lt; 0.2 dependingon whether the (unknown) gas density is 10^2, 10^3, or 10^4 cm-3. in thecomplex, 12 k &lt; t_spin &lt; 24 k, 0.02 &lt; f &lt; 0.05, and we were also able toconstrain the gas density (100 &lt; n &lt; 1200 cm-3). these results imply that thegas in the hisa clouds is colder and denser than that usually associated withthe atomic ism and, indeed, is similar to that seen in molecular clouds. thesmall atomic gas fractions also imply that there is a significant molecularcomponent in these hisa clouds, even when little or no 12co is detected. thelevel of 12co detected and the visual extinction due to dust is consistent withthe idea that these hisa clouds are undergoing a transition from the atomic tomolecular phase.

astro-ph;0611907	the jcmt spectral legacy survey	stars form in the densest, coldest, most quiescent regions of molecularclouds. molecules provide the only probes which can reveal the dynamics,physics, chemistry and evolution of these regions, but our understanding of themolecular inventory of sources and how this is related to their physical stateand evolution is rudimentary and incomplete. the spectral legacy survey (sls)is one of seven surveys recently approved by the jcmt board. starting in 2007,the sls will produce a spectral imaging survey of the content and distributionof all the molecules detected in the 345 ghz atmospheric window (between 332ghz and 373 ghz) towards a sample of 5 sources. our intended targets are: a lowmass core (ngc1333 iras4), 3 high mass cores spanning a range of star formingenvironments and evolutionary states (w49, afgl2591, and iras20126), and a pdr(the orion bar). the sls will use the unique spectral imaging capabilities ofharp-b/acsis to study the molecular inventory and the physical structure ofthese objects, which span different evolutionary stages and physicalenvironments, to probe their evolution during the star formation process. asits name suggests, the sls will provide a lasting data legacy from the jcmtthat is intended to benefit the entire astronomical community. as such, theentire data set (including calibrated spectral datacubes, maps of molecularemission, line identifications, and calculations of the gas temperature andcolumn density) will be publicly available.

astro-ph;0702474	molecular oxygen in the rho ophiuchi cloud	molecular oxygen, o2 has been expected historically to be an abundantcomponent of the chemical species in molecular clouds and, as such, animportant coolant of the dense interstellar medium. however, a number ofattempts from both ground and from space have failed to detect o2 emission. thework described here uses heterodyne spectroscopy from space to search formolecular oxygen in the interstellar medium. the odin satellite carries a 1.1 msub-millimeter dish and a dedicated 119 ghz receiver for the ground state lineof o2. starting in 2002, the star forming molecular cloud core rho oph a wasobserved with odin for 34 days during several observing runs. we detect aspectral line at v(lsr) = 3.5 km/s with dv(fwhm) = 1.5 km/s, parameters whichare also common to other species associated with rho ohp a. this feature isidentified as the o2 (n_j = 1_1 - 1_0) transition at 118 750.343 mhz. theabundance of molecular oxygen, relative to h2,, is 5e-8 averaged over the odinbeam. this abundance is consistently lower than previously reported upperlimits.

astro-ph;9906284	atomic carbon is a temperature probe in dark clouds	we have mapped the c i 3p1-3p0 line at 492 ghzin three molecular cloudsimmersed in weak ultraviolet radiation fields, tmc-1, l134n, and ic 5146. inall three clouds, the ci peak ta* ~ 1 k, with very small dispersion. thespatial c i distribution is extended and rather smooth. the j = 2-1 transitionsof co isotopomers were observed at the same angular resolution as c i. the c ipeak ta* is typically a third of the peak ta* of 13co j = 2-1, and the c iemission is usually more extended than emission in 13co or c18o j=2-1. the c ilinewidth is close to the 13co j = 2-1 linewidth, larger than the c18o j = 2-1line width, and smaller than the 12co j = 2-1 linewidth. the uniformity of thec i peak ta* is remarkable for a line in the wien portion of the planckfunction and indicates a very uniform excitation temperature. this uniformityis best explained if the line if opaque and thermalized. if so, the ci lineprobes kinetic temperature in clouds exposed to low ultraviolet fluxes. thisconclusion has significant implications for the thermal balance in such clouds.at av ~ 2, these clouds have a remarkably constant temperature from place toplace and from cloud to cloud (7.9+/-0.8 k). photodissociation region models ofclouds immersed in the mean interstellar radiation field tend to predictstronger lines than we see, but this may be an artifact of assumptions aboutthe temperature.
