0706.2962	variable stars in the open cluster ngc 6791 and its surrounding field	aims: this work presents a high--precision variability survey in the field ofthe old, super metal-rich open cluster ngc 6791.  methods: the data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision ccd timeseries measurements in the v band obtained mainly at the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, with additional data from s. pedro martir and loiano observatories,over a time span of ten nights. the field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.  results: we have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods andamplitudes of 70 known variable stars. by means of a photometric evaluation ofthe membership in ngc 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the propermotions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster andsurrounding field in the range 16&lt;v&lt;23.5. accurate periods can be given for thevariables with p&lt;4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limitedtime-baseline hampered precise determinations. we categorized the entire sampleas follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variablesand 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables forwhich we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longerthan our time baseline.  conclusions: on the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positionsof the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 newvariable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membershipis doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. we also detected an outburst ofabout 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to thecluster and we suggest that this star could be a new u gem (dwarf nova)cataclysmic variable.

0905.4058	a double stellar generation in the globular cluster ngc6656 (m 22). two  stellar groups with different iron and s-process element abundance	aims. in this paper we present the chemical abundance analysis from highresolution uves spectra of seventeen bright giant stars of the globular clusterm~22. results. we obtained an average iron abundance of [fe/h]=-1.76\pm0.02(internal errors only) and an \alpha enhancement of 0.36\pm0.04 (internalerrors only). na and o, and al and o follow the well known anti-correlationfound in many other gcs. we identified two groups of stars with significantlydifferent abundances of the s-process elements y, zr and ba. the relativenumbers of the two group members are very similar to the ratio of the stars inthe two sgbs of m22 recently found by piotto (2009). y and ba abundances do notcorrelate with na, o and al. the s-element rich stars are also richer in ironand have higher ca abundances. the results from high resolution spectra havebeen further confirmed by lower resolution giraffe spectra of fourteenadditional m22 stars. giraffe spectra show also that the eu -- a pure r-processelement -- abundance is not related to the iron content. we discuss thechemical abundance pattern of m22 stars in the context of the multiple stellarpopulations in gc scenario.

0909.4785	radial distribution of the multiple stellar populations in omega  centauri	we present a detailed study of the radial distribution of the multiplepopulations identified in the galactic globular cluster omega cen. we used bothspace-based images (acs/wfc and wfpc2) and ground-based images (fors1@vlt andwfi@2.2m eso telescopes) to map the cluster from the inner core to theoutskirts (~20 arcmin). these data sets have been used to extract high-accuracyphotometry for the construction of color-magnitude diagrams and astrometricpositions of ~900 000 stars. we find that in the inner ~2 core radii the bluemain sequence (bms) stars slightly dominate the red main sequence (rms) innumber. at greater distances from the cluster center, the relative numbers ofbms stars with respect to rms drop steeply, out to ~8 arcmin, and then remainconstant out to the limit of our observations. we also find that the dispersionof the gaussian that best fits the color distribution within the bms issignificantly greater than the dispersion of the gaussian that best fits thecolor distribution within the rms. in addition, the relative number ofintermediate-metallicity red-giant-branch stars which includes the progeny ofthe bms) with respect to the metal-poor component (the progeny of the rms)follows a trend similar to that of the main-sequence star-count ration_bms/n_rms. the most metal-rich component of the red-giant branch follows thesame distribution as the intermediate-metallicity component. we briefly discussthe possible implications of the observed radial distribution of the differentstellar components in omega cen.

0912.1056	vista variables in the via lactea (vvv): the public eso near-ir  variability survey of the milky way	we describe the public eso near-ir variability survey (vvv) scanning themilky way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formationactivity is high. the survey will take 1929 hours of observations with the4-metre vista telescope during five years (2010-2014), covering ~10^9 pointsources across an area of 520 deg^2, including 33 known globular clusters and~350 open clusters. the final product will be a deep near-ir atlas in fivepassbands (0.9-2.5 microns) and a catalogue of more than 10^6 variable pointsources. unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-dmaps, the vvv variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-d map ofthe surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as rr lyraestars, and cepheids. it will yield important information on the ages of thepopulations. the observations will be combined with data from macho, ogle,eros, vst, spitzer, hst, chandra, integral, wise, fermi lat, xmm-newton, gaiaand alma for a complete understanding of the variable sources in the innermilky way. this public survey will provide data available to the wholecommunity and therefore will enable further studies of the history of the milkyway, its globular cluster evolution, and the population census of the galacticbulge and center, as well as the investigations of the star forming regions inthe disk. the combined variable star catalogues will have importantimplications for theoretical investigations of pulsation properties of stars.

1007.5299	x-shooter observations of main sequence stars in the globular cluster  ngc 2808: first chemical tagging of a he-normal and a he-rich dwarf	we present the first chemical composition study of two unevolved stars in theglobular cluster ngc 2808, obtained with the spectrograph x-shooter@vlt. ngc2808 shows three discrete, well separated main sequences. the most acceptedexplanation for this phenomenon is that their stars have different heliumcontents. we observed one star on the bluest main sequence, (bms, claimed tohave high helium content, y~0.4), and one on the reddest main sequence (rms,consistent with a canonical helium content, y=0.245). we analyzed features ofnh, ch, na, mg, al, and fe. while fe, ca, and other elements have the sameabundances in the two stars, the bms star shows a huge enhancement of n, adepletion of c, an enhancement of na and al, and small depletion of mg withrespect to the rms star. this is exactly what is expected if stars on the bmsformed from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar generation in thecomplete cno and mgal cycles whose main product is helium. the elementalabundance pattern differences in these two stars are consistent with thedifferences in helium content suggested by the color-magnitude diagrampositions of the stars.

1009.5537	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. i. measurements, methods, and first results	earlier measurements of the masses and radii of the detached eclipsing binaryv20 in the open cluster ngc 6791 were accurate enough to demonstrate that thereare significant differences between current stellar models. here we improve onthose results and add measurements of two additional detached eclipsingbinaries, the cluster members v18 and v80. the enlarged sample sets muchtighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has hitherto beenpossible, thereby improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age.we employed (i) high-resolution uves spectroscopy of v18, v20 and v80 todetermine their spectroscopic effective temperatures, [fe/h] values, andspectroscopic orbital elements, and (ii) time-series photometry from the nordicoptical telescope to obtain the photometric elements. the masses and radii ofthe v18 and v20 components are found to high accuracy, with errors on themasses in the range 0.27-0.36% and errors on the radii in the range 0.61-0.92%.v80 is found to be magnetically active, and more observations are needed todetermine its parameters accurately. the metallicity of ngc 6791 is measuredfrom disentangled spectra of the binaries and a few single stars to be [fe/h]=+0.29 \pm 0.03 (random) \pm 0.07 (systematic). the cluster reddening andapparent distance modulus are found to be e(b - v) = 0.160 \pm 0.025 and (m -m)v = 13.51 \pm 0.06 . a first model comparison shows that we can constrain thehelium content of the ngc 6791 stars, and thus reach a more accurate age thanpreviously possible. it may be possible to constrain additional parameters, inparticular the c, n, and o abundances. this will be investigated in paper ii.

1106.3471	iras12556-7731: a "chamaeleonic" lithium-rich m-giant	in this letter we characterise iras12556-7731 as the first lithium-richm-type giant. based on its late spectral type and high lithium content, andbecause of its proximity in angular distance to the chamaeleonii star-formingregion, the star was misclassified as a young low-mass star in a previous work.based on harps data, synthetic spectral modelling, and proper motions, wederive the astrophysical parameters and kinematics of the star and discuss itsevolutionary status. this solar-mass red giant (teff=3460+/-60k andlog(g)=0.6+/-0.2) is characterised by a relatively fast rotation (vsin(i)~8km/s), slightly subsolar metallicity and a high-lithium abundance,a(li)=2.4+/-0.2dex. we discuss iras12556-7731 within the context of other knownlithium-rich k-type giants. because it is close to the tip of the red giantbranch, iras12556-7731 is the coolest lithium-rich giant known so far, and itis among the least massive and most luminous giants where enhancement oflithium has been detected. among several possible explanations, we cannotpreclude the possibility that the lithium enhancement and rapid rotation of thestar were triggered by the engulfment of a brown dwarf or a planet.

1108.2391	luminosity and mass functions of the three main sequences of the  globular cluster ngc 2808	high-precision hst photometry has recently revealed that the globular cluster(gc) ngc 2808 hosts a triple main sequence (ms) corresponding to three stellarpopulations with different helium abundances. we carried out photometry onacs/wfc hst images of ngc 2808 with the main purpose of measuring theluminosity function (lf) of stars in the three different mss, and the binaryfraction in the cluster. we used isochrones to transform the observed lfs intomass functions (mfs). we estimated that the fraction of binary systems in ngc2808 is f_bin ~0.05, and find that the three mss have very similar lfs. theslopes of the corresponding mfs are alpha=-1.2+/-0.3 for the red ms, alpha=-0.9+/-0.3 for the middle ms, and alpha = -0.9+/-0.4 for the blue one, thesame, to within the errors. there is marginal evidence of a mf flattening formasses m&lt;~0.6 m_sun for the the reddest (primordial) ms. these resultsrepresent the first direct measurement of the present day mf and lf in distinctstellar populations of a gc, and provide constraints on models of the formationand evolution of multiple generations of stars in these objects.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1111.0552	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. xii. photometric binaries  along the main-sequence	the fraction of binary stars is an important ingredient to interpret globularcluster dynamical evolution and their stellar population. we investigate theproperties of main-sequence binaries measured in a uniform photometric sampleof 59 galactic globular clusters that were observed by hst wfc/acs as a part ofthe globular cluster treasury project. we measured the fraction of binaries andthe distribution of mass-ratio as a function of radial location within thecluster, from the central core to beyond the half-mass radius. we studied theradial distribution of binary stars, and the distribution of stellar massratios. we investigated monovariate relations between the fraction of binariesand the main parameters of their host clusters. we found that in nearly all theclusters, the total fraction of binaries is significantly smaller than thefraction of binaries in the field, with a few exceptions only. binary stars aresignificantly more centrally concentrated than single ms stars in most of theclusters studied in this paper. the distribution of the mass ratio is generallyflat (for mass-ratio parameter q&gt;0.5). we found a significant anti-correlationbetween the binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity (mass).some, less significant correlation with the collisional parameter, the centralstellar density, and the central velocity dispersion are present. there is nostatistically significant relation between the binary fraction and othercluster parameters. we confirm the correlation between the binary fraction andthe fraction of blue stragglers in the cluster.

1202.5112	an hst search for planets in the lower main sequence of the globular  cluster ngc 6397	searches for planetary transits carried out in open and globular clustershave yielded to date only a handful of weak, unconfirmed candidates. theseresults have been interpreted either as being insignificant, or as evidencethat the cluster chemical or dynamical environment inhibits the planetaryformation or survival. most campaigns were limited by small sample statisticsor systematics from ground-based photometry. in this work we performed a searchfor transiting planets and variables in a deep stellar field of ngc 6397 imagedby hst-acs for 126 orbits. we analyzed 5,078 light curves, including a puresample of 2,215 cluster-member m0-m9 dwarfs. the light curves have beencorrected for systematic trends and inspected with several tools. nohigh-significance planetary candidate is detected. we compared this nulldetection with the most recent results from kepler, showing that no conclusiveevidence of lower planet incidence can be drawn. however, a very smallphotometric jitter is measured for early-m cluster members (&lt;~2 mmag on 98% ofthem), which may be worth targeting in the near future with more optimizedcampaigns. twelve variable stars are reported for the first time.

1205.3760	hubble space telescope observations of an outer field in omega centauri:  a definitive helium abundance	we revisit the problem of the split main sequence (ms) of the globularcluster omega centauri, and report the results of two-epoch hubble spacetelescope observations of an outer field, for which proper motions give us apure sample of cluster members, and an improved separation of the two branchesof the main sequence. using a new set of stellar models covering a grid ofvalues of helium and metallicity, we find that the best possible estimate ofthe helium abundance of the bluer branch of the ms is y = 0.39 +/- 0.02. forthe cluster center we apply new techniques to old observations: we use indicesof photometric quality to select a high-quality sample of stars, which we alsocorrect for differential reddening. we then superpose the color-magnitudediagram of the outer field on that of the cluster center, and suggest aconnection of the bluer branch of the ms with one of the more prominent amongthe many sequences in the subgiant region. we also report a group of undoubtedcluster members that are well to the red of the lower ms.

1205.4071	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. ii. age dependencies and new insights	models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuringaccurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. multiplebinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these oldstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. in the firstpaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsingbinaries in the old open cluster ngc6791 sets tighter constraints on theproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, therebypotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. herewe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison todetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employingas many observational constraints as possible. we improve our photometry andcorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. we then perform anextensive comparison of the cmds and eclipsing binary measurements to victoriaand dsep isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. we also reanalyse aspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [fe/h] constraints. we find a bestestimate of the age of ~8.3 gyr while demonstrating that remaining ageuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the cno abundances. the heliummass fraction is well constrained at y = 0.30 \pm 0.01 resulting in dy/dz ~ 1.4assuming that such a relation exists. during the analysis we firmly identifyblue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for thepresence of their evolved counterparts. our analysis supports the rgb mass-lossfound from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass ofstars on the lower rgb, 1.15\pm0.02msun. this will be an important consistencycheck for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.

1206.5529	the infrared eye of the wide-field camera 3 on the hubble space  telescope reveals multiple main sequences of very low-mass stars in ngc 2808	we use images taken with the infrared channel of the wide field camera 3 onthe hubble space telescope (hst) to study the multiple main sequences (mss) ofngc 2808. below the turn off, the red, the middle, and the blue ms, previouslydetected from visual-band photometry, are visible over an interval of about 3.5f160w magnitudes. the three mss merge together at the level of the ms bend. atfainter magnitudes, the ms again splits into two components containing ~65% and~35% of stars, with the most-populated ms being the bluest one. theoreticalisochrones suggest that the latter is connected to the red ms discovered in theoptical color-magnitude diagram (cmd), and hence corresponds to the firststellar generation, having primordial helium and enhanced carbon and oxygenabundances. the less-populated ms in the faint part of the near-ir cmd ishelium-rich and poor in carbon and oxygen, and it can be associated with themiddle and the blue ms of the optical cmd. the finding that the photometricsignature of abundance anticorrelation are also present in fully convective msstars reinforces the inference that they have a primordial origin.

1206.5820	search for giant planets in m67 i. overview	precise stellar radial velocities are used to search for massive (jupitermasses or higher) exoplanets around the stars of the open cluster m67. we aimto obtain a census of massive exoplanets in a cluster of solar metallicity andage in order to study the dependence of planet formation on stellar mass and tocompare in detail the chemical composition of stars with and without planets.this first work presents the sample and the observations, discusses the clustercharacteristics and the radial velocity (rv) distribution of the stars, andindividuates the most likely planetary host candidates. we observed a total of88 main-sequence stars, subgiants, and giants all highly probable members ofm67, using four telescopes and instrument combinations. we investigate whetherexoplanets are present by obtaining radial velocities with precisions as goodas 10 m/s. to date, we have performed 680 single observations (dec. 2011) and apreliminary analysis of data, spanning a period of up to eight years. althoughthe sample was pre-selected to avoid the inclusion of binaries, we identify 11previously unknown binary candidates. eleven stars clearly displayed larger rvvariability and these are candidates to host long-term substellar companions.the average rv is also independent of the stellar magnitude and evolutionarystatus, confirming that the difference in gravitational redshift between giantsand dwarfs is almost cancelled by the atmospheric motions. we use the subsampleof solar-type stars to derive a precise true rv for this cluster. we finallycreate a catalog of binaries and use it to clean the color magnitude diagram(cmd). as conclusion, by pushing the search for planets to the faintestpossible magnitudes, it is possible to observe solar analogues in openclusters, and we propose 11 candidates to host substellar companions.

1208.1873	hubble space telescope reveals multiple sub-giant branch in eight  globular clusters	in the last few years many globular clusters (gcs) have revealed complexcolor-magnitude diagrams, with the presence of multiple main sequences (mss),broaden or multiple sub-giant branches (sgbs) and ms turn offs, and broad orsplit red giant branches (rgbs). after a careful correction for differentialreddening, high accuracy photometry with the hubble space telescope presentedin this paper reveals a broadened or even split sgb in five additional milkyway gcs: ngc 362, ngc 5286, ngc 6656, ngc 6715, and ngc 7089. in addition, weconfirm (with new and archival hst data) the presence of a split sgb in 47tuc,ngc 1851, and ngc 6388. the fraction of faint sgb stars with respect to theentire sgb population varies from one cluster to another and ranges from$\sim$0.03 for ngc 362 to ~0.50 for ngc 6715. the average magnitude differencebetween the bright sgb and the faint sgb is almost the same at differentwavelengths. this peculiarity is consistent with the presence of two groups ofstars with either an age difference of about 1-2 gyrs, or a significantdifference in their overall c+n+o content.

1301.2822	the intriguing stellar populations in the globular clusters ngc 6388 and  ngc 6441	ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 are two massive galactic bulge globular clusters whichshare many properties, including the presence of an extended horizontal branch(hb), quite unexpected because of their high metal content. in this paper weuse hst's wfpc2, acs, and wfc3 images and present a broad multicolor study oftheir stellar content, covering all main evolutionary branches. thecolor-magnitude diagrams (cmds) give compelling evidence that both clustershost at least two stellar populations, which manifest themselves in differentways. ngc 6388 has a broadened main sequence (ms), a split sub-giant branch(sgb), and a split red giant branch (rgb) that becomes evident above the hb inour data set; its red hb is also split into two branches. ngc 6441 has a splitms, but only an indication of two sgb populations, while the rgb clearly splitsin two from the sgb level upward, and no red hb structure. the multicoloranalysis of the cmds confirms that the he difference between the two mainstellar populations in the two clusters must be similar. this isobservationally supported by the hb morphology, but also confirmed by the colordistribution of the stars in the ms optical band cmds. however, a ms splitbecomes evident in ngc 6441 using uv colors, but not in ngc 6388, indicatingthat the chemical patterns of the different populations are different in thetwo clusters, with c, n, o abundance differences likely playing a major role.we also analyze the radial distribution of the two populations.

1312.4169	global and non-global parameters of horizontal branch morphology of  globular clusters	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is mainlydetermined by metallicity. however, the fact that gcs with almost the samemetallicity exhibit different hb morphologies demonstrates that at least onemore parameter is needed to explain the hb morphology. it has been suggestedthat one of these should be a global parameter that varies from gc to gc, andthe other a non-global parameter that varies within the gc. in this study weprovide empirical evidence corroborating this idea. we used the photometriccatalogs obtained with the advanced camera for surveys (acs) of the hubblespace telescope (hst) and analyse the cmds of 74 gcs. the hb morphology of oursample of gcs has been investigated on the basis of the two new parameters l1and l2 that measure the distance between the rgb and the coolest part of thehb, and the color extension of the hb, respectively. we find that l1 correlateswith both metallicity and age, whereas l2 most strongly correlates with themass of the hosting gc. the range of helium abundance among the stars in a gc,characterised by delta y and associated with the presence of multiple stellarpopulations, has been estimated in a few gcs to date. in these gcs we find aclose relationship among delta y, gc mass, and l2. we conclude that age andmetallicity are the main global parameters while the range of helium abundancewithin a gc is the main non-global parameter defining the hb morphology ofgalactic gcs.

1312.5640	improved hubble space telescope proper motions for tycho-g and other  stars in the remnant of tycho's supernova 1572	with archival and new hubble space telescope observations we have refined thespace-velocity measurements of the stars in the central region of the remnantof tycho's supernova (sn) 1572, one of the historical galactic type iasupernova remnants (snrs). we derived a proper motion for tycho-g of(mu_ra_cos_dec;mu_dec)=(-2.63;-3.98)+/-(0.06;0.04)[formalerrors]+/-(0.18;0.10)[expected errors] mas/yr. we also reconstruct the binaryorbit that tycho-g should have followed if it were the surviving companion ofsn 1572. we redetermine the ni abundance of this star and compare it with newabundance data from stars of the galactic disk, finding that [ni/fe] is about1.7 sigma above the galactic trend. from the high velocity (v_b = -50+/-14km/s) of tycho-g perpendicular to the galactic plane, its metallicity, and itsni excess, we find the probability of its being a chance interloper to be p &lt;0.00037 at most. the projected rotational velocity of the star should be belowcurrent observational limits. the projected position of tycho-g is, within theuncertainties, consistent with the centroid of the x-ray emission of tycho'ssnr; moreover, its brightness is generally consistent with the post-explosionevolution of the luminosity of a sn companion. among the other 23 stars havingv&lt;22 mag and located within 42 arcsec from the x-ray centroid, only 4 are atdistances compatible with that of the snr, and none of them shows anypeculiarity. therefore, if even tycho-g is not the surviving companion of sn1572, the absence of other viable candidates does favor the merging of twowhite dwarfs as the producer of the sn.

1401.3344	ground-based astrometry with wide field imagers. v. application to  near-infrared detectors: hawk-i@vlt/eso	high-precision astrometry requires accurate point-spread function modelingand accurate geometric-distortion corrections. this paper demonstrates that itis possible to achieve both requirements with data collected at the high acuitywide-field k-band imager (hawk-i), a wide-field imager installed at the nasmythfocus of ut4/vlt eso 8m telescope. our final astrometric precision reaches ~3mas per coordinate for a well-exposed star in a single image with a systematicerror less than 0.1 mas. we constructed calibrated astro-photometric catalogsand atlases of seven fields: the baade's window, ngc 6656, ngc 6121, ngc 6822,ngc 6388, ngc 104, and the james webb space telescope calibration field in thelarge magellanic cloud. we make these catalogs and images electronicallyavailable to the community. furthermore, as a demonstration of the efficacy ofour approach, we combined archival material taken with the optical wide-fieldimager at the mpi/eso 2.2m with hawk-i observations. we showed that we are ableto achieve an excellent separation between cluster members and field objectsfor ngc 6656 and ngc 6121 with a time base-line of about 8 years. using bothhst and hawk-i data, we also study the radial distribution of the sgbpopulations in ngc 6656 and conclude that the radial trend is flat within ouruncertainty. we also provide membership probabilities for most of the stars inngc 6656 and ngc 6121 catalogs and estimate membership for the publishedvariable stars in these two fields.

1401.4905	three planetary companions around m67 stars	for the past six years we have carried out a search for massive planetsaround main sequence and evolved stars in the open cluster (oc) m67, usingradial velocity (rv) measurements obtained with harps at eso (la silla), sophieat ohp and hrs at het. additional rv data come from coralie at the euler swisstelescope. we aim to perform a long-term study on giant planet formation inopen clusters and determine how it depends on stellar mass and chemicalcomposition.  we report the detection of three new extrasolar planets: two in orbit aroundthe two g dwarfs ybp1194 and ybp1514, and one around the evolved star s364. theorbital solution for ybp1194 yields a period of 6.9 days, an eccentricity of0.24, and a minimum mass of 0.34 mj. ybp1514 shows periodic rv variations of5.1 days, a minimum mass of 0.40 mj, and an eccentricity of 0.39. the bestkeplerian solution for s364 yields a period of 121.7 days, an eccentricity of0.35 and a minimum mass of 1.54 mj. an analysis of h_alpha core fluxmeasurements as well as of the line bisectors spans revealed no correlationwith the rv periods, indicating that the rv variations are best explained bythe presence of a planetary companion. remarkably, ybp1194 is one of the bestsolar twins identified so far, and ybp1194b is the first planet found around asolar twin that belongs to a stellar cluster. in contrast with early reportsand in agreement with recent findings, our results show that massive planetsaround stars of open clusters are as frequent as those around field stars.

1406.0944	the halo+cluster system of the galactic globular cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 is surrounded by a stellar component that extends more than ten timesbeyond the tidal radius. although the nature of this stellar structure is notknown, it has been suggested to be a sparse halo of stars or associated with astellar stream. we analyse the nature of this intriguing stellar componentsurrounding ngc1851 by investigating its radial velocities and chemicalcomposition, in particular in comparison with those of the central clusteranalysed in a homogeneous manner. in total we observed 23 stars in the halowith radial velocities consistent with ngc1851, and for 15 of them we infer[fe/h] abundances. our results show that: (i) stars dynamically linked tongc1851 are present at least up to ~2.5 tidal radii, supporting the presence ofa halo of stars surrounding the cluster; (ii) apart from the ngc1851 radialvelocity-like stars, our observed velocity distribution agrees with thatexpected from galactic models, suggesting that no other sub-structure (such asa stream) at different radial velocities is present in our field; (iii) thechemical abundances for the s-process elements sr and ba are consistent withthe s-normal stars observed in ngc1851; (iv) all halo stars have metallicities,and abundances for the other studied elements ca, mg and cr, consistent withthose exhibited by the cluster. the complexity of the whole ngc1851cluster+halo system may agree with the scenario of a tidally-disrupted dwarfgalaxy in which ngc1851 was originally embedded.

1408.5754	on the hi-hole and agb stellar population of the sagittarius dwarf  irregular galaxy	using two hst/acs data-sets that are separated by ~2 years has allowed us toderive the relative proper-motion for the sagittarius dwarf irregular (sagdig)and reduce the heavy foreground galactic contamination. the proper-motiondecontaminated sagdig catalog provides a much clearer view of the youngred-supergiant and intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch populations. wereport the identification of 3 milky way carbon-rich dwarf stars, probablybelonging to the thin disk, and pointing to the high incidence of this class atlow galactic latitudes. a sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts afaint, red extension of the well-defined sagdig carbon-rich sequence. theorigin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting theuncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. sagdig is also a gas-richgalaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (hi-hole), whichis offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. we nonethelessinvestigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motioncleaned stellar populations within the hi-hole with appropriately selectedcomparison regions, having higher hi densities external to the hole. thecomparison shows no significant differences. in particular, the centre of thehi-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400myr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. we concludethat there is no convincing evidence that the sagdig hi-hole is the result ofstellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gasare the most likely mechanism for its formation.

1410.4564	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. i. overview of the project and detection of multiple stellar  populations	in this paper we describe a new uv-initiative hst project (go-13297) thatwill complement the existing f606w and f814w database of the acs globularcluster (gc) treasury by imaging most of its clusters through uv/blue wfc3/uvisfilters f275w, f336w and f438w. this "magic trio" of filters has shown anuncanny ability to disentangle and characterize multiple-population (mp)patterns in gcs in a way that is exquisitely sensitive to c, n, and o abundancevariations. combination of these passbands with those in the optical also givesthe best leverage for measuring helium enrichment. the dozen clusters that hadpreviously been observed in these bands exhibit a bewildering variety of mppatterns, and the new survey will map the full variance of the phenomenon. theubiquity of multiple stellar generations in gcs has made the formation of thesecornerstone objects more intriguing than ever; gc formation and the origin oftheir mps have now become one and the same problem. in the present paper wewill describe the data base and our data reduction strategy, as well as theuses we intend to make of the final photometry, astrometry, and proper motions.we will also present preliminary color-magnitude diagrams from the data so farcollected. these diagrams also draw on data from go-12605 and go-12311, whichserved as a pilot project for the present go-13297.

1501.01424	the gaps programme with harps-n@tng v. a comprehensive analysis of the  xo-2 stellar and planetary systems	xo-2 is the first confirmed wide stellar binary system where the almost twincomponents xo-2n and xo-2s have planets. this stimulated a detailedcharacterization study of the stellar and planetary components based on newobservations. we collected high-resolution spectra with the harps-nspectrograph and multi-band light curves. spectral analysis led to an accuratedetermination of the stellar atmospheric parameters and characterization of thestellar activity. we collected 14 transit light curves of xo-2nb used toimprove the transit parameters. photometry provided accurate magnitudedifferences between the stars and a measure of their rotation periods. the ironabundance of xo-2n was found to be +0.054 dex greater, within more than3-sigma, than that of xo-2s. we confirm a long-term variation in the radialvelocities of xo-2n, and we detected a turn-over with respect to previousmeasurements. we suggest the presence of a second massive companion in an outerorbit or the stellar activity cycle as possible causes of the observedacceleration. the latter explanation seems more plausible with the presentdataset. we obtained an accurate value of the projected spin-orbit angle forthe xo-2n system (lambda=7+/-11 degrees), and estimated the real 3-d spin-orbitangle (psi=27 +12/-27 degrees). we measured the xo-2 rotation periods, andfound a value of p=41.6 days in the case of xo-2n, in excellent agreement withthe predictions. the period of xo-2s appears shorter, with an ambiguity between26 and 34.5 days that we cannot solve with the present dataset alone. xo-2nappears to be more active than the companion, and this could be due to the factthat we sampled different phases of their activity cycle, or to an interactionbetween xo-2n and its hot jupiter that we could not confirm.

1504.03252	multiple stellar populations in magellanic cloud clusters. iii. the  first evidence of an extended main sequence turn-off in a young cluster:  ngc1856	recent studies have shown that the extended main-sequence turn off (emsto) isa common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the magellanic clouds(mcs). the most simple explanation is that these stellar systems harbormultiple generations of stars with an age difference of a few hundred myrs.  however, while an emsto has been detected in a large number of clusters withages between ~1-2 gyrs, several studies of young clusters in both mcs and innearby galaxies do not find any evidence for a prolonged star-formationhistory, i.e. for multiple stellar generations. these results have suggestedalternative interpretation of the emstos observed in intermediate-age starclusters. the emsto could be due to stellar rotation mimicking an age spread orto interacting binaries. in these scenarios, intermediate-age mc clusters wouldbe simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters.  here we provide the first evidence for an emsto in a young stellar cluster.we exploit multi-band hubble space telescope photometry to study the ~300-myrold star cluster ngc1856 in the large magellanic cloud and detected a broadenedmsto that is consistent with a prolonged star-formation which had a duration ofabout 150 myrs. below the turn-off, the ms of ngc1856 is split into a red andblue component, hosting 33+/-5% and 67+/-5% of the total number of ms stars,respectively. we discuss these findings in the context ofmultiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binaryhypotheses.

1509.05048	the m4 core project with hst - iv. internal kinematics from accurate  radial velocities of 2771 cluster members	we present a detailed study of the internal kinematics of the galacticglobular cluster m 4 (ngc 6121), by deriving the radial velocities from 7250spectra for 2771 stars distributed from the upper part of the red giant branchdown to the main sequence. we describe new approaches to determine thewavelength solution from day-time calibrations and to determine the radialvelocity drifts that can occur between calibration and science observationswhen observing with the giraffe spectrograph at vlt. two techniques todetermine the radial velocity are compared, after a qualitative description oftheir advantages with respect to other commonly used algorithm, and a newapproach to remove the sky contribution from the spectra obtained withfibre-fed spectrograph and further improve the radial velocity precision ispresented. the average radial velocity of the cluster is $\langle v \rangle =71.08 \pm 0.08$ km s$^{-1}$ with an average dispersion of $\mu_{v_c} = 3.97$ kms$^{-1}$. using the same dataset and the same statistical approach of previousanalyses, 20 additional binary candidates are found, for a total of 87candidates. a new determination of the internal radial velocity dispersion as afunction of cluster distance is presented, resulting in a dispersion of $4.5$km s$^{-1}$ within 2$^{\prime}$ from the center of cluster and steadilydecreasing outward. we statistically confirm the small amplitude of the clusterrotation, as suggested in the past by several authors. this new analysisrepresents a significant improvement with respect to previous results inliterature and provides a fundamental observational input for the modeling ofthe cluster dynamics.

1510.05086	the binary populations of eight globular clusters in the outer halo of  the milky way	we analyse color-magnitude diagrams of eight globular clusters (gcs) in theouter galactic halo. images were taken with the wide field channel of theadvanced camera for survey and the ultraviolet and visual channel of the widefield camera 3 on board of the hubble space telescope. we have determined thefraction of binary stars along the main sequence and combined results withthose of a recent paper where some of us have performed a similar analysis on59 galactic gcs. in total, binaries have been now studied homogeneously in 67gcs. we studied the radial and luminosity distributions of the binary systems,the distribution of their mass-ratios and investigated univariate relationswith several parameters of the host gcs. we confirm the anti-correlationbetween the binary fraction and the luminosity of the host cluster, and findthat low-luminosity clusters can host a large population in excess of ~40% inthe cluster core. however, our results do not support a significant correlationwith the cluster age as suggested in the literature. in most gcs, binaries aremore centrally concentrated than single stars. if the fraction of binaries isnormalised to the core binary fraction the radial density profiles follow acommon trend. it has a maximum in the center and declines by a factor of two ata distance of about two core radii from the cluster center. after dropping toits minimum at a radial distance of $\sim$5 core radii it stays approximatelyconstant at larger radii. we also find that the mass-ratio and the distributionof binaries as a function of the mass of the primary star is almost flat.

1510.09180	a psf-based approach to kepler/k2 data. i. variability within the k2  campaign 0 star clusters m 35 and ngc 2158	kepler and k2 data analysis reported in the literature is mostly based onaperture photometry. because of kepler's large, undersampled pixels and thepresence of nearby sources, aperture photometry is not always the ideal way toobtain high-precision photometry and, because of this, the data set has notbeen fully exploited so far. we present a new method that builds on ourexperience with undersampled hst images. the method involves a point-spreadfunction (psf) neighbour-subtraction and was specifically developed to exploitthe huge potential offered by the k2 "super-stamps" covering the core of densestar clusters. our test-bed targets were the ngc 2158 and m 35 regions observedduring the k2 campaign 0. we present our psf modeling and demonstrate that, byusing a high-angular-resolution input star list from the asiago schmidttelescope as the basis for psf neighbour subtraction, we are able to reachmagnitudes as faint as kp~24 with a photometric precision of 10% over 6.5hours, even in the densest regions. at the bright end, our photometricprecision reaches ~30 parts-per-million. our method leads to a considerablelevel of improvement at the faint magnitudes (kp&gt;15.5) with respect to theclassical aperture photometry. this improvement is more significant in crowdedregions. we also extracted raw light curves of ~60,000 stars and detrended themfor systematic effects induced by spacecraft motion and other artifacts thatharms k2 photometric precision. we present a list of 2133 variables.

1512.03114	a comparative analysis of the observed white dwarf cooling sequence from  globular clusters	we report our study of features at the observed red end of the white dwarfcooling sequences for three galactic globular clusters: ngc\,6397, 47\,tucanaeand m\,4. we use deep colour-magnitude diagrams constructed from archivalhubble space telescope (acs) to systematically investigate the blue turn atfaint magnitudes and the age determinations for each cluster. we find that theage difference between ngc\,6397 and 47\,tuc is 1.98$^{+0.44}_{-0.26}$\,gyr,consistent with the picture that metal-rich halo clusters were formed laterthan metal-poor halo clusters. we self-consistently include the effect ofmetallicity on the progenitor age and the initial-to-final mass relation. incontrast with previous investigations that invoked a single white dwarf massfor each cluster, the data shows a spread of white dwarf masses that betterreproduce the shape and location of the blue turn. this effect alone, however,does not completely reproduce the observational data - the blue turn retainssome mystery. in this context, we discuss several other potential problems inthe models. these include possible partial mixing of h and he in the atmosphereof white dwarf stars, the lack of a good physical description of thecollision-induced absorption process and uncertainties in the opacities at lowtemperatures. the latter are already known to be significant in the descriptionof the cool main sequence. additionally, we find that the present day localmass function of ngc\,6397 is consistent with a top-heavy type, while 47\,tucpresents a bottom-heavy profile.

0807.1085	true solar analogues in the open cluster m67	the solar analogues are fundamental targets for a better understanding of oursun and solar system. notwithstanding the efforts, this research is usuallylimited to field stars. the open cluster m67 offers a unique opportunity tosearch for solar analogues because its chemical composition and age are verysimilar to those of our star. in this work, we analyze flames@vlt spectra ofabout one hundred of m67 main sequence stars with the aim to identify solaranalogues. we first determine cluster members which are likely not binaries, bycombining both proper motions and radial velocity measurements. then, weconcentrate our analysis on the determination of stellar effective temperature,using the analyzes of line-depth ratios and halpha wings. finally, we alsocompute lithium abundance for all the stars. thanks to the our analysis, wefind ten solar analogues, which allow us to derive a solar color(b-v)=0.649+/-0.016 and a cluster distance modulus of 9.63+/-0.08, very closeto values found by previous authors. among them, five are the best solar twinswith temperature determinations within 60 k from the solar values. our resultslead us to do further spectroscopic investigations because the solar analoguescandidates are suitable for planet search.

astro-ph;0303254	v, j, h and k imaging of the metal rich globular cluster ngc 6528	new near-infrared observations of ngc6528 are presented. the jhk observationscomplement a previous hst/nicmos data set by ortolani et al. (2001), in thatthey sample a larger area, contain a more numerous sample of red giant stars,and include the k band. also, archival hst data sets (separated by 6.093 years)were used to proper-motion decontaminate the near-infrared sample and extract aclean vjhk catalogue. using the present wide colour baseline, we compared thecleaned colour-magnitude diagrams of ngc6528 with those of ngc 6553 and ngc104and derived new estimates of reddening and distance, e(b-v)=0.55 and(m-m)o=14.44 (7.7 kpc). moreover, the morphology and location of the cleanedred giant branch were used to derive a photometric estimate of the clustermetallicity. the average of 10 metallicity indicators yields a mean value of[m/h] ~ 0.0, and [fe/h] ~-0.20 and +0.08 on the zinn &amp; west (1984) and carretta&amp; gratton (1997) revised metallicity scale, respectively. the best isochronefit to the cleaned k,v-k diagram is obtained for a 12.6 gyr and z=0.02isochrone, i.e. the derived metallicity of ngc6528 turns out to be very closeto the mean of stars in the baade's window. five agb variable star candidates,whose membership has to be confirmed spectroscopically, are bolometrically asbright as the known long period variable stars in ngc6553. as discussed inguarnieri et al.

astro-ph;0305461	why hot horizontal branch stars can appear redder than red giants	in this paper we report on a curious feature in the v, (u-b) color-magnitudediagrams of globular clusters. in our database, we find that a considerablefraction of blue horizontal branch stars, hotter than the instability strip andcooler than the grundahl et al. (1999) jump (i.e., 6000 &lt;~ t_eff k &lt;~ 10000),have (u-b) colors redder than their red giant progenitors. this red incursionis not expected on theoretical grounds, as horizontal branch stars (whoseconvective regions are less extended than in red giant structures) should not``appear'' cooler than a red giant. analyzing data from different telescopes weshow that: 1) the horizontal branch red incursion is strongly dependent on theshape of the adopted u filter and to a lesser extent, on the b filter; 2) thephotometry done with u filters which do not encompass the balmer jump, do notshow the blue horizontal branch red incursion; 3) the occurrence of thisfeature is also due to the peculiar dependence of the u and b magnitudes onstars effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity; 4) theoretical trackscan reproduce the observed horizontal branch morphology, provided that theappropriate (i.e. exactly responding to the filters effectively used in theobservations) transmission curve efficiencies are used for deriving color-t_efftransformations; 5) the red incursion extent depends on metallicity.

astro-ph;0405526	probing the canis major stellar over-density as due to the galactic warp	proper-motion, star counts and photometric catalog simulations are used toexplain the detected stellar over-density in the region of canis major (cma),claimed to be the core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy (martin et al. 2004,bellazzini et al. 2003), as due to the galactic warp and flare in the externaldisk. we compare the kinematics of cma m-giant selected sample with surroundinggalactic disk stars in the ucac2 catalog and find no peculiar proper motionsignature: cma stars mimic thick disk kinematics. moreover, when taking intoaccount the galactic warp and flare of the disk, 2mass star count profilesreproduce the cma stellar over-density. this star count analysis is confirmedby direct comparison with synthetic color-magnitude diagrams simulated with thebesancon models (robin et al. 2003) that include the warp and flare of thedisk. the presented evidence casts doubt on the identification of the cmaover-density as the core of a disrupted milky way satellite. this however doesnot make clear the origin of over-densities responsible for the ring structurein the anticenter direction of the galactic halo (newberg et al. 2002; yanny etal. 2003; zaggia et al. 2004, in preparation).

0810.2248	mcao near-ir photometry of the globular cluster ngc 6388: mad  observations in crowded fields	deep photometry of crowded fields, such as galactic globular clusters, isseverely limited by the actual resolution of ground-based telescopes. on theother hand, the hubble space telescope does not provide the near-infrared (nir)filters needed to allow large color baselines. in this work we aim atdemonstrating how ground based observations can reach the required resolutionwhen using multi-conjugated adaptive optic (mcao) devices in the nir, such asthe experimental infrared camera (mad) available on the vlt. this isparticularly important since these corrections are planned to be available onall ground--based telescopes in the near future. we do this by combining theinfrared photometry obtained by mad/vlt with acs/hst optical photometry of ourscientific target, the bulge globular cluster ngc 6388, in which we imaged twofields. in particular, we constructed color-magnitude diagrams with anextremely wide color baseline in order to investigate the presence of multiplestellar populations in this cluster. from the analysis of the external field,observed with better seeing conditions, we derived the deepest optical-nir cmdof ngc 6388 to date. the high-precision photometry reveals that two distinctsub-giant branches are clearly present in this cluster. we also use the cmdfrom the central region to estimate the distance ((m-m)=15.33) and thereddening (e(b-v)=0.38) for this cluster. we estimate the age to be ~11.5+/-1.5 gyr. the large relative-age error reflects the bimodal distribution of thesgb stars. this study clearly demonstrates how mcao correction in the nir bandsimplemented on ground based telescopes can complement the high-resolutionoptical data from hst.
