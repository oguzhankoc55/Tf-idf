0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

1001.3161	gravitational waves and pulsar timing: stochastic background, individual  sources and parameter estimation	massive black holes are key ingredients of the assembly and evolution ofcosmic structures. pulsar timing arrays (ptas) currently provide the only meansto observe gravitational radiation from massive black hole binary systems withmasses &gt;10^7 solar masses. the whole cosmic population produces a signalconsisting of two components: (i) a stochastic background resulting from theincoherent superposition of radiation from the all the sources, and (ii) ahandful of individually resolvable signals that raise above the backgroundlevel and are produced by sources sufficiently close and/or massive.considering a wide range of massive black hole binary assembly scenarios, weinvestigate both the level and shape of the background and the statistics ofresolvable sources. we predict a characteristic background amplitude in theinterval h_c(f = 10^-8 hz)~5*10^-16 - 5*10^-15, within the detection range ofthe complete parkes pta. we also quantify the capability of ptas of measuringthe parameters of individual sources, focusing on monochromatic signalsproduced by binaries in circular orbit. we investigate how the results dependon the number and distribution of pulsars in the array, by computing thevariance-covariance matrix of the parameter measurements. for plausible squarekilometre array (ska) observations (100 pulsars uniformly distributed in thesky), and assuming a coherent signal-to-noise ratio of 10, the sky position ofmassive black hole binaries can be located within a ~40deg^2 error box, openingpromising prospects for detecting a putative electromagnetic counterpart to thegravitational wave emission. the planned ska, can plausibly observe theseunique systems, although the number of detections is likely to be small.(abridged)

1003.2480	predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors	we present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types ofcompact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advancedversions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors ligo and virgo.astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a numberof assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. the mostconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binaryneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars inour galaxy. these yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per myr per milky wayequivalent galaxy (mweg), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 permyr per mweg to 1000 per myr per mweg. we convert coalescence rates intodetection rates based on data from the ligo s5 and virgo vsr2 science runs andprojected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. using the detectorsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02per year for initial ligo-virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between0.0002 and 0.2 per year. the likely binary neutron-star detection rate for theadvanced ligo-virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a rangebetween 0.4 and 400 per year.

1006.1664	gravitational waves from intermediate-mass black holes in young clusters	massive young clusters (ycs) are expected to host intermediate-mass blackholes (imbhs) born via runaway collapse. these imbhs are likely in binaries andcan undergo mergers with other compact objects, such as stellar mass blackholes (bhs) and neutron stars (nss). we derive the frequency of such mergersstarting from information available in the local universe. mergers of imbh-nsand imbh-bh binaries are sources of gravitational waves (gws), which mightallow us to reveal the presence of imbhs. we thus examine their detectabilityby current and future gw observatories, both ground- and space-based. inparticular, as representative of different classes of instruments we considerinitial and advanced ligo, the einstein gravitational-wave telescope (et) andthe laser interferometer space antenna (lisa). we find that imbh mergers areunlikely to be detected with instruments operating at the current sensitivity(initial ligo). lisa detections are disfavored by the mass range of imbh-ns andimbh-bh binaries: less than one event per year is expected to be observed bysuch instrument. advanced ligo is expected to observe a few merger eventsinvolving imbh binaries in a 1-year long observation. advanced ligo isparticularly suited for mergers of relatively light imbhs (~100 msun) withstellar mass bhs. the number of mergers detectable with et is much larger: tens(hundreds) of imbh-ns (imbh-bh) mergers might be observed per year, accordingto the runaway collapse scenario for the formation of imbhs. we note that ourresults are affected by large uncertainties, produced by poor observationalconstraints on many of the physical processes involved in this study, such asthe evolution of the yc density with redshift.[abridged]

1011.4079	search for gravitational wave bursts from six magnetars	soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) and anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) are thought tobe magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. these rareobjects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-raybursts. the burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation ofnon-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (gws). we present theresults of a search for gw bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitiveto neutron star f-modes, thought to be the most efficient gw emittingoscillatory modes in compact stars. one of them, sgr 0501+4516, is likely ~1kpc from earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted inprevious gw searches. a second, axp 1e 1547.0-5408, gave a burst with anestimated isotropic energy &gt;10^{44} erg which is comparable to the giantflares. we find no evidence of gws associated with a sample of 1279electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between november 2006 andjune 2009, in gw data from the ligo, virgo, and geo600 detectors. our lowestmodel-dependent gw emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limitedwhite noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f-mode ringdowns (at1090 hz), are 3.0x10^{44} d_1^2 erg and 1.4x10^{47} d_1^2 erg respectively,where d_1 = d_{0501} / 1 kpc and d_{0501} is the distance to sgr 0501+4516.these limits on gw emission from f-modes are an order of magnitude lower thanany previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in sgrgiant flares for the first time.

1110.0530	towards a generic test of the strong field dynamics of general  relativity using compact binary coalescence	coalescences of binary neutron stars and/or black holes are amongst the mostlikely gravitational-wave signals to be observed in ground basedinterferometric detectors. apart from the astrophysical importance of theirdetection, they will also provide us with our very first empirical access tothe genuinely strong-field dynamics of general relativity (gr). we present anew framework based on bayesian model selection aimed at detecting deviationsfrom gr, subject to the constraints of the advanced virgo and ligo detectors.the method tests the consistency of coefficients appearing in the waveform withthe predictions made by gr, without relying on any specific alternative theoryof gravity. the framework is suitable for low signal-to-noise ratio eventsthrough the construction of multiple subtests, most of which involve only alimited number of coefficients. it also naturally allows for the combination ofinformation from multiple sources to increase one's confidence in gr or aviolation thereof. we expect it to be capable of finding a wide range ofpossible deviations from gr, including ones which in principle cannot beaccommodated by the model waveforms, on condition that the induced change inphase at frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is comparableto the effect of a few percent change in one or more of the low-orderpost-newtonian phase coefficients. in principle the framework can be used withany gr waveform approximant, with arbitrary parameterized deformations, toserve as model waveforms. in order to illustrate the workings of the method, weperform a range of numerical experiments in which simulated gravitational wavesmodeled in the restricted post-newtonian, stationary phase approximation areadded to gaussian and stationary noise that follows the expected advancedligo/virgo noise curves.

1111.4456	turbulent diffusion in the photosphere as derived from photospheric  bright point motion	on the basis of observations of solar granulation obtained with the new solartelescope (nst) of big bear solar observatory, we explored proper motion ofbright points (bps) in a quiet sun area, a coronal hole, and an active regionplage. we automatically detected and traced bright points (bps) and derivedtheir mean-squared displacements as a function of time (starting from theappearance of each bp) for all available time intervals. in all three magneticenvironments, we found the presence of a super-diffusion regime, which is themost pronounced inside the time interval of 10-300 seconds. super-diffusion,measured via the spectral index, $\gamma$, which is the slope of themean-squared displacement spectrum, increases from the plage area($\gamma=1.48$) to the quiet sun area ($\gamma=1.53$) to the coronal hole($\gamma=1.67$). we also found that the coefficient of turbulent diffusionchanges in direct proportion to both temporal and spatial scales. for theminimum spatial scale (22 km) and minimum time scale (10 sec), it is 22 and 19km$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the coronal hole and the quiet sun area, respectively,whereas for the plage area it is about 12 km$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the minimumtime scale of 15 seconds. we applied our bp tracking code to 3d mhd model dataof solar convection (stein et al. 2007) and found the super-diffusion with$\gamma=1.45$. an expression for the turbulent diffusion coefficient as afunction of scales and $\gamma$ is obtained.

1111.5274	towards a generic test of the strong field dynamics of general  relativity using compact binary coalescence: further investigations	in this paper we elaborate on earlier work by the same authors in which anovel bayesian inference framework for testing the strong-field dynamics ofgeneral relativity using coalescing compact binaries was proposed. unlikemethods that were used previously, our technique addresses the question whetherone or more 'testing coefficients' (e.g. in the phase) parameterizingdeviations from gr are non-zero, rather than all of them differing from zero atthe same time. the framework is well-adapted to a scenario where most sourceshave low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from multiple sources as seenin multiple detectors can readily be combined. in our previous work, weconjectured that this framework can detect generic deviations from gr that canin principle not be accomodated by our model waveforms, on condition that thechange in phase near frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive iscomparable to that induced by simple shifts in the lower-order phasecoefficients of more than a few percent ($\sim 5$ radians at 150 hz). tofurther support this claim, we perform additional numerical experiments ingaussian and stationary noise according to the expected advanced ligo/virgonoise curves, and coherently injecting signals into the network whose phasingdiffers structurally from the predictions of gr, but with the magnitude of thedeviation still being small. we find that even then, a violation of gr can beestablished with good confidence.

1201.1195	estimating parameters of coalescing compact binaries with proposed  advanced detector networks	the advanced versions of the ligo and virgo ground-based gravitational-wavedetectors are expected to operate from three sites: hanford, livingston, andcascina. recent proposals have been made to place a fourth site in australia orindia; and there is the possibility of using the large cryogenic gravitationalwave telescope in japan to further extend the network. using bayesianparameter-estimation analyses of simulated gravitational-wave signals from arange of coalescing-binary locations and orientations at fixed distance orsignal-to-noise ratio, we study the improvement in parameter estimation for theproposed networks. we find that a fourth detector site can break degeneraciesin several parameters; in particular, the localization of the source on the skyis improved by a factor of ~ 3--4 for an australian site, or ~ 2.5--3.5 for anindian site, with more modest improvements in distance and binary inclinationestimates. this enhanced ability to localize sources on the sky will be crucialin any search for electromagnetic counterparts to detected gravitational-wavesignals.

1302.6049	studies of waveform requirements for intermediate mass-ratio coalescence  searches with advanced detectors	the coalescence of a stellar-mass compact object into an intermediate-massblack hole (intermediate mass-ratio coalescence; imrac) is an importantastrophysical source for ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers in theso-called advanced configuration. however, the ability to carry out effectivematched-filter based searches for these systems is limited by the lack ofreliable waveforms. here we consider binaries in which the intermediate-massblack hole has mass in the range 24 - 200 solar masses with a stellar-masscompanion having masses in the range 1.4 - 18.5 solar masses. in addition, weconstrain the mass ratios, q, of the binaries to be in the range 1/140 &lt; q &lt;1/10 and we restrict our study to the case of circular binaries withnon-spinning components. we investigate the relative contribution to thesignal-to-noise ratio (snr) of the three different phases of the coalescence:inspiral, merger and ringdown. we show that merger and ringdown contribute to asubstantial fraction of the total snr over a large portion of the massparameter space, although in a limited portion the snr is dominated by theinspiral phase. we further identify three regions in the imrac mass-space inwhich: (i) inspiral-only searches could be performed with losses in detectionrates l in the range 10% &lt; l &lt; 27%, (ii) searches based on inspiral-onlytemplates lead to a loss in detection rates in the range 27% &lt; l &lt; 50%$, and(iii) templates that include merger and ringdown are essential to preventlosses in detection rates greater than 50%. we investigate the effectivenesswith which the inspiral-only portion of the imrac waveform space is covered bycomparing several existing waveform families in this regime. our resultsreinforce the importance of extensive numerical relativity simulations ofimracs and the need for further studies of suitable approximation schemes inthis mass range.

1304.0324	the positron density in the intergalactic medium and the galactic 511  kev line	the 511 kev electron-positron annihilation line, most recently characterizedby the integral/spi experiment, is highly concentrated towards the galacticcentre. its origin remains unknown despite decades of scrutiny. we propose anovel scenario in which known extragalactic positron sources such as radio jetsof active galactic nuclei (agn) fill the intergalactic medium with mev e+e-pairs, which are then accreted into the milky way. we show that interpretingthe diffuse cosmic radio background (crb) as arising from radio sources withcharacteristics similar to the observed cores and radio lobes in powerful agnjets suggests that the intergalactic positron-to-electron ratio could be ashigh as 10^{-5}, although this can be decreased if the crb is not all producedby pairs and if not all positrons escape to the intergalactic medium. assumingan accretion rate of one solar mass per year of matter into the milky way, apositron-to-electron ratio of only 10^{-7} is already enough to account formuch of the 511 kev emission of the galaxy. a simple spherical accretion modelpredicts an emission profile highly peaked in the central bulge, consistentwith integral observations. however, a realistic model of accretion withangular momentum would likely imply a more extended emission over the disk,with uncertainties depending on the magnetic field structure and turbulence inthe galactic halo.

1304.1775	parameter estimation for compact binary coalescence signals with the  first generation gravitational-wave detector network	compact binary systems with neutron stars or black holes are one of the mostpromising sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. gravitationalradiation encodes rich information about source physics; thus parameterestimation and model selection are crucial analysis steps for any detectioncandidate events. detailed models of the anticipated waveforms enable inferenceon several parameters, such as component masses, spins, sky location anddistance that are essential for new astrophysical studies of these sources.however, accurate measurements of these parameters and discrimination of modelsdescribing the underlying physics are complicated by artifacts in the data,uncertainties in the waveform models and in the calibration of the detectors.here we report such measurements on a selection of simulated signals addedeither in hardware or software to the data collected by the two ligoinstruments and the virgo detector during their most recent joint science run,including a "blind injection" where the signal was not initially revealed tothe collaboration. we exemplify the ability to extract information about thesource physics on signals that cover the neutron star and black hole parameterspace over the individual mass range 1 msun - 25 msun and the full range ofspin parameters. the cases reported in this study provide a snap-shot of thestatus of parameter estimation in preparation for the operation of advanceddetectors.

1309.6160	search for long-lived gravitational-wave transients coincident with long  gamma-ray bursts	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been linked to extreme core-collapsesupernovae from massive stars. gravitational waves (gw) offer a probe of thephysics behind long grbs. we investigate models of long-lived (~10-1000s) gwemission associated with the accretion disk of a collapsed star or with itsprotoneutron star remnant. using data from ligo's fifth science run, and grbtriggers from the swift experiment, we perform a search for unmodeledlong-lived gw transients. finding no evidence of gw emission, we place 90%confidence level upper limits on the gw fluence at earth from long grbs forthree waveforms inspired by a model of gws from accretion disk instabilities.these limits range from f&lt;3.5 ergs cm^-2 to $f&lt;1200 ergs cm^-2, depending onthe grb and on the model, allowing us to probe optimistic scenarios of gwproduction out to distances as far as ~33 mpc. advanced detectors are expectedto achieve strain sensitivities 10x better than initial ligo, potentiallyallowing us to probe the engines of the nearest long grbs.

1310.7454	comparison of gravitational wave detector network sky localization  approximations	gravitational waves emitted during compact binary coalescences are apromising source for gravitational-wave detector networks. the accuracy withwhich the location of the source on the sky can be inferred from gravitationalwave data is a limiting factor for several potential scientific goals ofgravitational-wave astronomy, including multi-messenger observations. variousmethods have been used to estimate the ability of a proposed network tolocalize sources. here we compare two techniques for predicting the uncertaintyof sky localization -- timing triangulation and the fisher information matrixapproximations -- with bayesian inference on the full, coherent data set. wefind that timing triangulation alone tends to over-estimate the uncertainty insky localization by a median factor of $4$ for a set of signals fromnon-spinning compact object binaries ranging up to a total mass of $20m_\odot$, and the over-estimation increases with the mass of the system. wefind that average predictions can be brought to better agreement by theinclusion of phase consistency information in timing-triangulation techniques.however, even after corrections, these techniques can yield significantlydifferent results to the full analysis on specific mock signals. thus, whilethe approximate techniques may be useful in providing rapid, large scaleestimates of network localization capability, the fully coherent bayesiananalysis gives more robust results for individual signals, particularly in thepresence of detector noise.

1401.0939	the ninja-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational  waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations	the numerical injection analysis (ninja) project is a collaborative effortbetween members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave astrophysicscommunities. the purpose of ninja is to study the ability to detectgravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and recover theirparameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. we reporthere on the results of the second ninja project, ninja-2, which employs 60complete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portionmodelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-newtonianportion modelling the early inspiral. in a "blind injection challenge" similarto that conducted in recent ligo and virgo science runs, we added 7 hybridwaveforms to two months of data recolored to predictions of advanced ligo andadvanced virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. theresulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection algorithms and 6 ofthe waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in athousand years. parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of thesewaveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angularmomenta and sky position of these waveforms. we also perform a large-scalemonte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybridwaveforms with early advanced ligo and advanced virgo sensitivity curves. ourresults predict that early advanced ligo and advanced virgo will have avolume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300mpc (1gpc) for$10m_{\odot}+10m_{\odot}$ ($50m_{\odot}+50m_{\odot}$) binary black holecoalescences. we demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta inthe waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction insensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.

1403.6639	search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts detected  by the interplanetary network	we present the results of a search for gravitational waves associated with223 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the interplanetary network (ipn) in2005-2010 during ligo's fifth and sixth science runs and virgo's first, secondand third science runs. the ipn satellites provide accurate times of the burstsand sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds ofsquare degrees. we search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal,the favored progenitor model for short grbs, and for generic, unmodeledgravitational wave bursts. both searches use the event time and skylocalization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as comparedto corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. we find no evidence of agravitational-wave signal associated with any of the ipn grbs in the sample,nor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signalsassociated with the grbs. for all ipn-detected grbs, for which a sufficientduration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower boundson the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption ofgravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}m_{\odot}c^2$ at 150 hz, and finda median of 13 mpc. for the 27 short-hard grbs we place 90% confidenceexclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence,with a median distance of 12mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and blackhole, with a median distance of 22 mpc. finally, we combine this search withpreviously published results to provide a population statement for grb searchesin first-generation ligo and virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and aresulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wavedetectors.

1404.2199	search for gravitational radiation from intermediate mass black hole  binaries in data from the second ligo-virgo joint science run	this paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational wavesfrom merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (imbhb). the search wasperformed on data from the second joint science run of the ligo and virgodetectors (july 2009 - october 2010) and was sensitive to imbhbs with a rangeup to $\sim 200$ mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinationsof the binaries with respect to the line of sight. no significant candidate wasfound. upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning imbhbs withtotal masses between 100 and $450 \ \mbox{m}_{\odot}$ and mass ratios between$0.25$ and $1\,$ were placed by combining this analysis with an analogoussearch performed on data from the first ligo-virgo joint science run (november2005 - october 2007). the most stringent limit was set for systems consistingof two $88 \ \mbox{m}_{\odot}$ black holes and is equal to $0.12 \\mbox{mpc}^{-3} \ \mbox{myr}^{-1}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level. this paperalso presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of theimpact on the search range of imbhb spin configurations: the visible volume forimbhbs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population ofimbhbs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum anduniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas ananalogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by$\sim 20\%\,$.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

0804.4144	search for a stochastic gravitational-wave signal in the second round of  the mock lisa data challenges	the analysis method currently proposed to search for isotropic stochasticradiation of primordial or astrophysical origin with the laser interferometerspace antenna (lisa) relies on the combined use of two lisa channels, one ofwhich is insensitive to gravitational waves, such as the symmetrised sagnac.for this method to work, it is essential to know how the instrumental noisepower in the two channels are related to one another; however, no quantitativeestimates of this key information are available to date. the purpose of ourstudy is to assess the performance of the symmetrised sagnac method fordifferent levels of prior information regarding the instrumental noise. wedevelop a general approach in the framework of bayesian inference and anend-to-end analysis algorithm based on markov chain monte carlo methods tocompute the posterior probability density functions of the relevant modelparameters. we apply this method to data released as part of the second roundof the mock lisa data challenges. for the selected (and somewhat idealised)cases considered here, we find that a prior uncertainty of a factor ~2 in theratio between the power of the instrumental noise contributions in the twochannels allows for the detection of isotropic stochastic radiation. moreimportantly, we provide a framework for more realistic studies of lisa'sperformance and development of analysis techniques in the context of searchesfor stochastic signals.

0806.0624	observing white dwarfs orbiting massive black holes in the gravitational  wave and electro-magnetic window	we consider a potentially new class of gravitational wave sources consistingof a white dwarf coalescing into a massive black hole in the mass range~10^4-10^5\msun. these sources are of particular interest because thegravitational wave signal produced during the inspiral phase can be detected bythe laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) and is promptly followed, in anextended portion of the black hole and white dwarf mass parameter space, by anelectro-magnetic signal generated by the tidal disruption of the star,detectable with x-ray, optical and uv telescopes. this class of sources couldtherefore yield a considerable number of scientific payoffs, that includeprecise cosmography at low redshift, demographics of black holes in the massrange ~10^4-10^5\msun, insights into dynamical interactions and populations ofwhite dwarfs in the cores of dwarf galaxies, as well as a new probe into thestructure and equation of state of white dwarfs. by modelling the gravitationaland electromagnetic radiation produced by these events, we find them detectablein both observational windows at a distance ~200 mpc, and possibly beyond forselected regions of the parameter space. we also estimate the detection ratefor a number of model assumptions about black hole and white dwarf massfunctions and dynamical interactions: the rate is (not surprisingly) highlyuncertain, ranging from ~0.01 yr^-1 to ~100 yr^-1. this is due to the currentlimited theoretical understanding and minimal observational constraints forthese objects and processes. however, capture rate scaling arguments favor thehigh end of the above range, making likely the detection of several eventsduring the lisa lifetime.

0807.4966	the solar chromosphere at high resolution with ibis. ii. acoustic shocks  in the quiet internetwork and the role of magnetic fields	(abridged)  aims: we characterize the dynamics of the quiet inter-network chromosphere bystudying the occurrence of acoustic shocks and their relation with theconcomitant photospheric structure and dynamics.  methods: we analyze a comprehensive data set that includes high resolutionchromospheric and photospheric spectra obtained with the ibis imagingspectrometer in two quiet-sun regions. this is complemented by high-resolutionsequences of mdi magnetograms of the same targets. from the chromosphericspectra we identify the spatio-temporal occurrence of the acoustic shocks. wecompare it with the photospheric dynamics by means of both fourier and waveletanalysis, and study the influence of magnetic structures.  results: mid-chromospheric shocks occur as a response to underlying powerfulphotospheric motions at periodicities nearing the acoustic cut-off, consistentwith 1-d hydrodynamical modeling. however, their spatial distribution withinthe supergranular cells is highly dependent on the local magnetic topology,both at the network and internetwork scale. large portions of the internetworkregions undergo very few shocks, as "shadowed" by the horizontal component ofthe magnetic field. the latter is betrayed by the presence of chromosphericfibrils, observed in the core of the caii line as slanted structures withdistinct dynamical properties. the shadow mechanism appears to operate also onthe very small scales of inter-network magnetic elements, and provides for avery pervasive influence of the magnetic field even in the quietest regionanalyzed.

astro-ph;0605227	the lisa verification binaries	the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) guarantees the detection ofgravitational waves by monitoring a handful of known nearby galactic binarysystems, the so-called ``verification binaries''. we consider the most updatedinformation on the source parameters for the thirty more promising verificationbinaries. we investigate which of them are indeed guaranteed sources for lisaand estimate the accuracy of the additional information that can be extractedduring the mission. our analysis considers the two independent michelsonoutputs that can be synthesised from the lisa constellation, and we model thelisa transfer function using the rigid adiabatic approximation. we carry outextensive monte carlo simulations to explore the dependency of our results onunknown or poorly constrained source parameters. we find that four sources --rxj0806.3+1527, v407 vul, es cet and am cvn -- are clearly detectable in oneyear of observation; rxj0806.3+1527 should actually be observable in less thana week. for these sources lisa will also provide information on yet unknownparameters with an error between approximately 1 percent and 10 percent. fouradditional binary systems -- hp lib, 4u 1820-30, wz sge and kpd 1930+2752 --might also be marginally detectable.

astro-ph;0611206	solar atmospheric oscillations and the chromospheric magnetic topology	we investigate the oscillatory properties of the quiet solar chromosphere inrelation to the underlying photosphere, with particular regard to the effectsof the magnetic topology. we perform a fourier analysis on a sequence ofline-of-sight velocities measured simultaneously in a photospheric (fe i 709.0nm) and a chromospheric line (ca ii 854.2 nm). the velocities were obtainedfrom full spectroscopic data acquired at high spatial resolution with theinterferometric bidimensional spectrometer (ibis). the field of viewencompasses a full supergranular cell, allowing us to discriminate betweenareas with different magnetic characteristics. we show that waves withfrequencies above the acoustic cut-off propagate from the photosphere to upperlayers only in restricted areas of the quiet sun. a large fraction of the quietchromosphere is in fact occupied by ``magnetic shadows'', surrounding networkregions, that we identify as originating from fibril-like structures observedin the core intensity of the ca ii line. we show that a large fraction of thechromospheric acoustic power at frequencies below the acoustic cut-off,residing in the proximity of the magnetic network elements, directly propagatesfrom the underlying photosphere. this supports recent results arguing thatnetwork magnetic elements can channel low-frequency photospheric oscillationsinto the chromosphere, thus providing a way to input mechanical energy in theupper layers.

astro-ph;9405051	orbital evolution of a massive black hole pair by dynamical friction	we investigate the evolution of a massive black hole pair under the action ofdynamical friction (df) by a uniform background of light stars with isotropicvelocity distribution. in our scenario, the primary black hole $m_1$ sits, atrest, in the center of the spherical star distribution (with mass $m_c$) andthe secondary less massive companion $m_2$ moves along bound orbits determinedby the background gravitational field; it loses energy $e$ and angular momentum$j$ by df. we investigate mostly analytically the secular evolution of theorbital parameters when the motion of $m_2$ is determined either by the meanfield generated by the uniform stellar distribution or by the gravitationalfield of $m_1$. we find that $j$ and $e$ are lost so as to cause the increaseof the eccentricity $e$ during the orbital decay of $m_2$. when $m_2$ entersthe region where the gravitational field of $m_1$ dominates, the evolutiondepends on the ratio between the black hole velocity $v$ and the stellardispersion velocity $\sigma.$ we explore both cases $v&lt;\sigma$ and $v&gt;\sigma$.only for $v&gt;\sigma$ the rise of $e$ would be severe but this transition occursclose to the cusp radius below which our description becomes invalid. energylosses by gravitational wave emission become comparable to those by dynamicalfriction at a critical distance that depends sensitively on the ratio$m_1/m_c$. the braking index $n$ is calculated in this transition region.

0809.3412	gravitational waves from resolvable massive black hole binary systems  and observations with pulsar timing arrays	massive black holes are key components of the assembly and evolution ofcosmic structures and a number of surveys are currently on-going or planned toprobe the demographics of these objects and to gain insight into the relevantphysical processes. pulsar timing arrays (ptas) currently provide the onlymeans to observe gravitational radiation from massive black hole binary systemswith masses &gt;10^7 solar masses. the whole cosmic population produces astochastic background that could be detectable with upcoming pulsar timingarrays. sources sufficiently close and/or massive generate gravitationalradiation that significantly exceeds the level of the background and could beindividually resolved. we consider a wide range of massive black hole binaryassembly scenarios, we investigate the distribution of the main physicalparameters of the sources, such as masses and redshift, and explore theconsequences for pulsar timing arrays observations. depending on the specificmassive black hole population model, we estimate that on average at least oneresolvable source produces timing residuals in the range ~5-50 ns. pulsartiming arrays, and in particular the future square kilometre array (ska), canplausibly detect these unique systems, although the events are likely to berare. these observations would naturally complement on the high-mass end of themassive black hole distribution function future surveys carried out by thelaser interferometer space antenna (lisa)

0809.4243	evidence of shock-driven turbulence in the solar chromosphere	we study the acoustic properties of the solar chromosphere in thehigh-frequency regime using a time sequence of velocity measurements in thechromospheric ca ii 854.2 nm line taken with the interferometric bidimensionalspectrometer (ibis). we concentrate on quiet-sun behavior, apply fourieranalysis, and characterize the observations in terms of the probability densityfunctions (pdfs) of velocity increments. we confirm the presence of significantoscillatory fluctuation power above the cutoff frequency and find that it obeysa power-law distribution with frequency up to our 25 mhz nyquist limit. thechromospheric pdfs are non-gaussian and asymmetric and they differ amongnetwork, fibril, and internetwork regions. this suggests that the chromospherichigh-frequency power is not simply the result of short-period waves propagatingupward from the photosphere but rather is the signature of turbulence generatedwithin the chromosphere from shock oscillations near the cutoff frequency. thepresence of this pervasive and broad spectrum of motions in the chromosphere islikely to have implications for the excitation of coronal loop oscillations.

gr-qc;0207062	searching for gravitational waves from the inspiral of precessing binary  systems: problems with current waveforms	we consider the problem of searching for gravitational waves emitted duringthe inspiral phase of binary systems when the orbital plane precesses due torelativistic spin-orbit coupling. such effect takes place when the spins of thebinary members are misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum. asa first step we assess the importance of precession specifically for thefirst-generation of ligo detectors. we investigate the extent of thesignal-to-noise ratio reduction and, hence, detection rate that occurs whenprecession effects are not accounted for in the template waveforms. we restrictour analysis to binary systems that undergo the so-called simple precession andhave a total mass close to 10 solar mass. we find that for binary systems withrather high mass ratios (e.g., a 1.4 solar mass neutron star and a 10 solarmass black hole) the detection rate can decrease by almost an order ofmagnitude. current astrophysical estimates of the rate of binary inspiralevents suggest that ligo could detect at most a few events per year, andtherefore the reduction of the detection rate even by a factor of a few iscritical. in the second part of our analysis, we examine whether the effect ofprecession could be included in the templates by capturing the main features ofthe phase modulation through a small number of extra parameters. specificallywe examine and tested for the first time the 3-parameter family suggested byapostolatos. we find that, even though these ``mimic'' templates improve thedetection rate, they are still inadequate in recovering the signal-to-noiseratio at the desired level. we conclude that a more complex template family isneeded in the near future, still maintaining the number of additionalparameters as small as possible in order to reduce the computational costs.

gr-qc;0406039	the effect of the lisa response function on observations of  monochromatic sources	the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) is expected to provide thelargest observational sample of binary systems of faint sub-solar mass compactobjects, in particular white-dwarfs, whose radiation is monochromatic over mostof the lisa observational window. current astrophysical estimates suggest thatthe instrument will be able to resolve about 10000 such systems, with a largefraction of them at frequencies above 3 mhz, where the wavelength ofgravitational waves becomes comparable to or shorter than the lisa arm-length.this affects the structure of the so-called lisa transfer function which cannotbe treated as constant in this frequency range: it introduces characteristicphase and amplitude modulations that depend on the source location in the skyand the emission frequency. here we investigate the effect of the lisa transferfunction on detection and parameter estimation for monochromatic sources. forsignal detection we show that filters constructed by approximating the transferfunction as a constant (long wavelength approximation) introduce a negligibleloss of signal-to-noise ratio -- the fitting factor always exceeds 0.97 -- forf below 10mhz, therefore in a frequency range where one would actually expectthe approximation to fail. for parameter estimation, we conclude that in therange 3mhz to 30mhz the errors associated with parameter measurements differfrom about 5% up to a factor of 10 (depending on the actual source parametersand emission frequency) with respect to those computed using the longwavelength approximation.

gr-qc;0605071	a markov chain monte carlo approach to the study of massive black hole  binary systems with lisa	the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) will produce a data streamcontaining a vast number of overlapping sources: from strong signals generatedby the coalescence of massive black hole binary systems to much weakerradiation form sub-stellar mass compact binaries and extreme-mass ratioinspirals. it has been argued that the observation of weak signals could behampered by the presence of loud ones and that they first need to be removed toallow such observations. here we consider a different approach in which sourcesare studied simultaneously within the framework of bayesian inference. weinvestigate the simplified case in which the lisa data stream containsradiation from a massive black hole binary system superimposed over a (weaker)quasi-monochromatic waveform generated by a white dwarf binary. we derive theposterior probability density function of the model parameters using anautomatic reversible jump markov chain monte carlo algorithm (rjmcmc). we showthat the information about the sources and noise are retrieved at the expectedlevel of accuracy without the need of removing the stronger signal. ouranalysis suggests that this approach is worth pursuing further and should beconsidered for the actual analysis of the lisa data.
