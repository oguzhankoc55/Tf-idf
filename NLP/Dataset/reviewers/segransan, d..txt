0901.4705	discovery and characterization of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass  planet transiting a solar-type star	we report the discovery of wasp-6b, an inflated sub-jupiter mass planettransiting every 3.3610060 +0.0000022-0.0000035 days a mildly metal-poorsolar-type star of magnitude v=11.9. a combined analysis of the waspphotometry, high-precision followup transit photometry and radial velocitiesyield a planetary mass m_p = 0.503 +0.019-0.038 m_jup and radius r_p = 1.224+0.051-0.052 r_jup, resulting in a density rho_p = 0.27 +-0.05 rho_jup. themass and radius for the host star are m_s = 0.88 +0.05-0.08 m_sun and r_s =0.870 +0.025-0.036 r_sun. the non-zero orbital eccentricity e = 0.054+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests that the planet underwent a massive tidalheating ~1 gyr ago that could have contributed to its inflated radius.high-precision radial velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measurea sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis beta = 11+14-18 deg. in addition to similar published measurements, this result favors adominant migration mechanism based on tidal interactions with a protoplanetarydisk.

0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0707.0679	refined parameters and spectroscopic transit of the super-massive planet  hd147506b	in this paper, we report a refined determination of the orbital parametersand the detection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of the recently discoveredtransiting exoplanet hd147506b (hat-p-2b). the large orbital eccentricity atthe short orbital period of this exoplanet is unexpected and is distinguishingfrom other known transiting exoplanets. we performed high-precision radialvelocity spectroscopic observations of hd147506 (hat-p-2) with the newspectrograph sophie, mounted on the 1.93 m telescope at the haute-provenceobservatory (ohp). we obtained 63 new measurements, including 35 on may 14 and20 on june 11, when the planet was transiting its parent star. the radialvelocity (rv) anomaly observed illustrates that hat-p-2b orbital motion is setin the same direction as its parent star spin. the sky-projected angle betweenthe normal of the orbital plane and the stellar spin axis, \lambda = 0.2 +12.2-12.5 deg, is consistent with zero. the planetary and stellar radii werere-determined, yielding r_p = 0.951 +0.039 -0.053 r_jup, r_s = 1.416 +0.040-0.062 r_sun. the mass m_p = 8.62 +0.39 -0.55 m_jup and radius of hat-p-2bindicate a density of 12.5 +2.6 -3.6 g cm^{-3}, suggesting an object in betweenthe known close-in planets with typical density of the order of 1 g cm^{-3},and the very low-mass stars, with density greater than 50 g cm^{-3}.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

0912.3202	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets. xx. planets around  the active star bd-08:2823	we report the detection of a planetary system around bd-08:2823, thatincludes at least one uranus-mass planet and one saturn-mass planet. thisdiscovery serendipitously originates from a search for planetary transits inthe hipparcos photometry database. this program preferentially selected activestars and did not allow the detection of new transiting planets. it allowedhowever the identification of the k3v star bd-08:2823 as a target harboring amultiplanet system, that we secured and characterized thanks to an intensivemonitoring with the harps spectrograph at the 3.6-m eso telescope in la silla.the stellar activity level of bd-08:2823 complicates the analysis but does notprohibit the detection of two planets around this star. bd-08:2823b has aminimum mass of 14.4+/-2.1 m_earth and an orbital period of 5.60 days, whereasbd-08:2823c has a minimum mass of 0.33+/-0.03 m_jup and an orbital period of237.6 days. this new system strengthens the fact that low-mass planets arepreferentially found in multiplanetary systems, but not around high-metallicitystars as this is the case for massive planets. it also supports the belief thatactive stars should not be neglected in exoplanet searches, even when searchingfor low-mass planets.

1001.0403	wasp-19b: the shortest period transiting exoplanet yet discovered	we report on the discovery of a new extremely short period transitingextrasolar planet, wasp-19b. the planet has mass mpl = 1.15 \pm 0.08 mj, radiusrpl = 1.31 \pm 0.06 rj, and orbital period p = 0.7888399 \pm 0.0000008 days.through spectroscopic analysis, we determine the host star to be a slightlysuper-solar metallicity ([m/h] = 0.1 \pm 0.1 dex) g-dwarf with teff = 5500 \pm100 k. in addition, we detect periodic, sinusoidal flux variations in the lightcurve which are used to derive a rotation period for the star of prot = 10.5\pm 0.2 days. the relatively short stellar rotation period suggests that eitherwasp-19 is somewhat young (~ 600 myr old) or tidal interactions between the twobodies have caused the planet to spiral inward over its lifetime resulting inthe spin-up of the star. due to the detection of the rotation period, thissystem has the potential to place strong constraints on the stellar tidalquality factor, q's, if a more precise age is determined.

1003.3678	evidence against the young hot-jupiter around bd +20 1790	context. the young active star bd +20 1790 is believed to host a substellarcompanion, revealed by radial-velocity measurements that detected the reflexmotion induced on the parent star.  aims. a complete characterisation of the radial-velocity signal is necessaryin order to assess its nature.  methods. we used coralie spectrograph to obtain precise (~10 m/s) velocitymeasurements on this active star, while characterizing the bisector spanvariations. particular attention was given to correctly sample both theproposed planetary orbital period, of 7.8 days, and the stellar rotationperiod, of 2.4 days.  results. a smaller radial-velocity signal (with peak-to-peak variations &lt;500m/s) than had been reported previously was detected, with different amplitudeon two different campaigns. a periodicity similar to the rotational period isfound on the data, as well as a clear correlation between radial-velocities andbisector span. this evidence points towards a stellar origin of theradial-velocity variations of the star instead of a barycentric movement of thestar, and repudiates the reported detection of a hot-jupiter.

1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1004.1514	wasp-22 b: a transiting "hot jupiter" planet in a hierarchical triple  system	we report the discovery of a transiting planet orbiting the star tyc6446-326-1. the star, wasp-22, is a moderately bright (v=12.0) solar-type star(teff = 6000 +/- 100 k, [fe/h] = -0.05 +/- 0.08). the lightcurve of the starobtained with the wasp-south instrument shows periodic transit-like featureswith a depth of about 1 and a duration of 0.14 days. the presence of atransit-like feature in the lightcurve is confirmed using z-band photometryobtained with faulkes telescope south. high resolution spectroscopy obtainedwith the coralie and harps spectrographs confirm the presence of a planetarymass companion with an orbital period of 3.533 days in a near-circular orbit.from a combined analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data assumingthat the star is a typical main-sequence star we estimate that the planet has amass m_p = 0.56 +/- 0.02 m_jup and a radius r_p = 1.12 +/- 0.04 r_jup. inaddition, there is a linear trend of 40 m/s/yr in the radial velocitiesmeasured over 16 months, from which we infer the presence of a third body witha long period orbit in this system. the companion may be a low mass m-dwarf, awhite dwarf or a second planet.

1304.4130	astrophysical false positives in direct imaging for exoplanets: a white  dwarf close to a rejuvenated star	as is the case for all techniques involved in the research for exoplanets,direct imaging has to take into account the probability of so-calledastrophysical false positives, which are phenomena that mimic the signature ofobjects we are seeking. in this work we aim to present a case of a falsepositive found during a direct imaging survey conducted with vlt/naco. apromising exoplanet candidate was detected around the k2-type star hd\,8049 injuly 2010.its contrast of $\delta h$=7.05 at 1.57 arcsec allowed us to guessthe presence of a 35 \mjup companion at 50 projected au, for the nominal systemage and heliocentric distance.to check whether it was gravitationally bound tothe host star, as opposed to an unrelated background object, we re-observed thesystem one year later and concluded a high probability of a bound system. wealso used radial velocity measurements of the host star, spanning a time rangeof $\sim$ 30 yr, to constrain the companion's mass and orbital properties, aswell as to probe the host star's spectral age indicators and general spectralenergy distribution. we also obtained for the companion $u$-band imaging withefosc and $nir$ spectroscopy. combining all these information we conclude thatthe companion of hd\,8049 is a white dwarf (wd), with temperature$t_{eff}=18800 \pm 2100$ k and mass $m_{wd}=0.56 \pm 0.08 m_{\odot}$. thesignificant radial velocity trend coupled with the imaging data indicate thatthe most probable orbit has a semimajor axis of about 50 au.the discrepancybetween the age indicators suggested against a bona-fide young star. themoderately large level of chromospheric activity and fast rotation, mimickingthe properties of a young star, might be induced by the exchange of mass withthe progenitor of the wd. this example demonstrates some of the challenges indetermining accurate age estimates and identifications of faint companions.

1306.3225	astrometric orbit of a low-mass companion to an ultracool dwarf	little is known about the existence of extrasolar planets around ultracooldwarfs. furthermore, binary stars with sun-like primaries and very low-massbinaries composed of ultracool dwarfs show differences in the distributions ofmass ratio and orbital separation that can be indicative of distinct formationmechanisms. using fors2/vlt optical imaging for high precision astrometry weare searching for planets and substellar objects around ultracool dwarfs toinvestigate their multiplicity properties for very low companion masses. herewe report astrometric measurements with an accuracy of two tenths of amilli-arcsecond over two years that reveal orbital motion of the nearby l1.5dwarf denis-p j082303.1-491201 located at 20.77 +/- 0.08 pc caused by an unseencompanion that revolves about its host on an eccentric orbit in 246.4 +/- 1.4days. we estimate the l1.5 dwarf to have 7.5 +/- 0.7 % of the sun's mass thatimplies a companion mass of 28 +/- 2 jupiter masses. this new system has thesmallest mass ratio (0.36 +/- 0.02) of known very low-mass binaries withcharacterised orbits. with this discovery we demonstrate 200 micro-arcsecondastrometry over an arc-minute field and over several years that is sufficientto discover sub-jupiter mass planets around ultracool dwarfs. we also show thatthe achieved parallax accuracy of &lt; 0.4 % makes it possible to remove distanceas a dominant source of uncertainty in the modelling of ultracool dwarfs.

1403.4619	astrometric planet search around southern ultracool dwarfs ii:  astrometric reduction methods and a deep astrometric catalogue	we describe the astrometric reduction of images obtained with the fors2/vltcamera in the framework of an astrometric planet search around 20m/l-transition dwarfs. we present the correction of systematic errors, theachieved astrometric performance, and a new astrometric catalogue containingthe faint reference stars in 20 fields located close to the galactic plane. wedetected three types of systematic errors in the fors2 astrometry: the relativemotion of the camera's two ccd chips, errors that are correlated in space, andan error contribution of yet unexplained origin. the relative ccd motion hasprobably a thermal origin and usually is 0.001-0.010 px (~0.1-1 mas), butsometimes amounts to 0.02-0.05 px (3-6 mas). this instability andspace-correlated errors are detected and mitigated using reference stars. thethird component of unknown origin has an amplitude of 0.03-0.14 mas and isindependent of the observing conditions. we find that a consecutive sequence of32 images of a well-exposed star over 40 min at 0.6" seeing results in a medianr.m.s. of the epoch residuals of 0.126 mas. overall, the epoch residuals aredistributed according to a normal law with a chi2~1. we compiled a catalogue of12000 stars with i-band magnitudes of 16-22 located in 20 fields, each covering~2x2'. it contains i-band magnitudes, icrf positions with 40-70 mas precision,and relative proper motions and absolute trigonometric parallaxes with aprecision of 0.1 mas/yr and 0.1 mas at the bright end, respectively.

1405.1559	the vlt/naco large program to probe the occurrence of exoplanets and  brown dwarfs in wide orbits: i- sample definition and characterization	young, nearby stars are ideal targets to search for planets using the directimaging technique. the determination of stellar parameters is crucial for theinterpretation of imaging survey results particularly since the luminosity ofsubstellar objects has a strong dependence on system age. we have conducted alarge program with naco at the vlt in order to search for planets and browndwarfs in wide orbits around 86 stars. a large fraction of the targets observedwith naco were poorly investigated in the literature. we performed a study tocharacterize the fundamental properties (age, distance, mass) of the stars inour sample. to improve target age determinations, we compiled and analyzed acomplete set of age diagnostics. we measured spectroscopic parameters and agediagnostics using dedicated observations acquired with feros and coraliespectrographs at la silla observatory. we also made extensive use of archivalspectroscopic data and results available in the literature. additionally, weexploited photometric time-series, available in asas and super-wasp archives,to derive rotation period for a large fraction of our program stars. weprovided updated characterization of all the targets observed in the vlt nacolarge program, a survey designed to probe the occurrence of exoplanets andbrown dwarfs in wide orbits. the median distance and age of our program starsare 64 pc and 100 myr, respectively. nearly all the stars have masses between0.70 and 1.50sun, with a median value of 1.01 msun. the typical metallicity isclose to solar, with a dispersion that is smaller than that of samples usuallyobserved in radial velocity surveys. several stars are confirmed or proposedhere to be members of nearby young moving groups. eight spectroscopic binariesare identified.

1407.0470	improving the astrometric performance of vlti-prima	in the summer of 2011, the first on-sky astrometric commissioning ofprima-astrometry delivered a performance of 3 m'' for a 10 '' separation onbright objects, orders of magnitude away from its exoplanet requirement of 50{\mu}'' ~ 20 {\mu}'' on objects as faint as 11 mag ~ 13 mag in k band. thiscontribution focuses on upgrades and characterizations carried out since then.  the astrometric metrology was extended from the coud\'e focus of theauxillary telescopes to their secondary mirror, in order to reduce the baselineinstabilities and improve the astrometric performance. while carrying out thisextension, it was realized that the polarization retardance of the starseparator derotator had a major impact on both the astrometric metrology andthe fringe sensors. a local compensation of this retardance and the operationon a symmetric baseline allowed a new astrometric commissioning. in october2013, an improved astrometric performance of 160 {\mu}'' was demonstrated,still short of the requirements. instabilities in the astrometric baselinestill appear to be the dominating factor.  in preparation to a review held in january 2014, a plan was developed tofurther improve the astrometric and faint target performance of primaastrometry. on the astrometric aspect, it involved the extension of theinternal longitudinal metrology to primary space, the design and implementationof an external baseline metrology, and the development of an astrometricinternal fringes mode. on the faint target aspect, investigations of theperformance of the fringe sensor units and the development of an ao system(naomi) were in the plan. following this review, eso decided to take a proposalto the april 2014 stc that prima be cancelled, and that eso resources beconcentrated on ensuring that gravity and matisse are a success. this proposalwas recommended by the stc in may 2014, and endorsed by eso.

1407.1044	planets and stellar activity: hide and seek in the corot-7 system	since the discovery of the transiting super-earth corot-7b, severalinvestigations have yielded different results for the number and masses ofplanets present in the system, mainly owing to the star's high level ofactivity. we re-observed corot-7 in january 2012 with both harps and corot, sothat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometricdata. this allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's lightcurve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression ofconvective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. to account foractivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have aphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in theradial-velocity model, which we treat as a gaussian process with the samecovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the lightcurve. our model was incorporated into a monte carlo markov chain in order tomake a precise determination of the orbits of corot-7b and corot-7c. we measurethe masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08mearth, respectively. the density of corot-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(rp/1.58rearth)^(-3) g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. we searchfor evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with aperiod close to 9 days. we are not able to confirm the existence of a planetwith this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellarrotation at around 7.9 days. using bayesian model selection we find that amodel with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.

1507.08532	the harps-n rocky planet search i. hd219134b: a transiting rocky planet  in a multi-planet system at 6.5 pc from the sun	we present here the detection of a system of four low-mass planets around thebright (v=5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star hd219134. this is the first result ofthe rocky planet search program with harps-n on the tng in la palma. the innerplanet orbits the star in 3.0937 +/-0.0004 days, on a quasi-circular orbit witha semi-major axis of 0.0382 +/- 0.0003 au. spitzer observations allowed us todetect the transit of the planet in front of the star making hd219134b thenearest known transiting planet to date. from the amplitude of theradial-velocity variation (2.33 +/- 0.24 m/s) and observed depth of the transit(359 +/- 38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.46 +/- 0.47m_{\oplus} and 1.606 +/- 0.086 r_{\oplus} leading to a mean density of 5.89 +/-1.17 g/cc, suggesting a rocky composition. one additional planet with minimummass of 2.67 +/- 0.59 m_{\oplus} moves on a close-in, quasi-circular orbit witha period of 6.765 +/- 0.005 days. the third planet in the system has a periodof 46.78 +/- 0.16 days and a minimum mass of 8.7 +/- 1.1 m{\oplus}, at 0.234+/- 0.002 au from the star. its eccentricity is 0.32 +/- 0.14. the period ofthis planet is close to the rotational period of the star estimated fromvariations of activity indicators (42.3 +/- 0.1 days). the planetary origin ofthe signal is, however, the preferred solution as no indication of variation atthe corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive parameters.finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of 62 +/- 6m_{\oplus} orbits the star in 1190 days, on an eccentric orbit (e=0.27 +/-0.11) at a distance of 2.14 +/- 0.27 au.

0806.0719	misaligned spin-orbit in the xo-3 planetary system?	the transiting extrasolar planet xo-3b is remarkable, with a high mass andeccentric orbit. the unusual characteristics make it interesting to testwhether its orbital plane is parallel to the equator of its host star, as it isobserved for other transiting planets. we performed radial velocitymeasurements of xo-3 with the sophie spectrograph at the 1.93-m telescope ofhaute-provence observatory during a planetary transit, and at other orbitalphases. this allowed us to observe the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and, togetherwith a new analysis of the transit light curve, to refine the parameters of theplanet. the unusual shape of the radial velocity anomaly during the transitprovides a hint for a nearly transverse rossiter-mclaughlin effect. thesky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotationaxis should be lambda = 70 +/- 15 degrees to be compatible with ourobservations. this suggests that some close-in planets might result fromgravitational interaction between planets and/or stars rather than migrationdue to interaction with the accretion disk. this surprising result requiresconfirmation by additional observations, especially at lower airmass, to fullyexclude the possibility that the signal is due to systematic effects.

0806.4587	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets. xiii. a planetary  system with 3 super-earths (4.2, 6.9, &amp; 9.2 earth masses)	this paper reports on the detection of a planetary system with threesuper-earths orbiting hd40307. hd40307 is a k2v metal-deficient star at adistance of only 13 parsec, part of the harps gto high-precision planet-searchprogramme. the three planets on circular orbits have very low minimum masses ofrespectively 4.2, 6.9 and 9.2 earth masses and periods of 4.3, 9.6 and 20.5days. the planet with the shortest period is the lightest planet detectedto-date orbiting a main sequence star. the detection of the correspondingly lowamplitudes of the induced radial-velocity variations is completely secured bythe 135 very high-quality harps observations illustrated by the radial-velocityresiduals around the 3-keplerian solution of only 0.85 m/s. activity andbisector indicators exclude any significant perturbations of stellar intrinsicorigin, which supports the planetary interpretation. contrary to mostplanet-host stars, hd40307 has a marked sub-solar metallicity ([fe/h]=-0.31),further supporting the already raised possibility that the occurrence of verylight planets might show a different dependence on host star's metallicitycompared to the population of gas giant planets. in addition to the 3 planetsclose to the central star, a small drift of the radial-velocity residualsreveals the presence of another companion in the system the nature of which isstill unknown.

astro-ph;0106277	new neighbours. iii. 21 new companions to nearby dwarfs, discovered with  adaptive optics	we present some results of a cfht adaptive optics search for companions tonearby dwarfs. we identify 21 new components in solar neighbourhood systems, ofwhich 13 were found while surveying a volume-limited sample of m dwarfs within12pc. we are obtaining complete observations for this subsample, to deriveunbiased multiplicity statistics for the very-low-mass disk population.additionally, we resolve for the first time 6 known spectroscopic orastrometric binaries, for a total of 27 newly resolved companions. a fairfraction of the new binaries has favourable parameters for accurate massdeterminations. the newly resolved companion of gl120.1c had an apparentspectroscopic minimum mass in the brown-dwarf range (duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991)and it contributed to the statistical evidence that a few percent of solar typestars might have close-in brown-dwarf companions. we find that gl~120.1cactually is an unrecognised double-lined spectroscopic pair. itsradial-velocity amplitude had therefore been strongly underestimated byduquennoy &amp; mayor, and it does not truly belong to their sample of single-linedsystems with minimum spectroscopic mass below the substellar limit. we alsopresent the first direct detection of gl~494b, an astrometric brown-dwarfcandidate. its luminosity does straddle the substellar limit, and it is a browndwarf if its age is less than 300myr. a few more years of observations willascertain its mass and status from first principles.

astro-ph;0303634	the diameters of alpha centauri a and b - a comparison of the  asteroseismic and vinci/vlti views	we compare the first direct angular diameter measurements obtained on ourclosest stellar neighbour, alpha centauri, to recent model diametersconstrained by asteroseismic observations. using the vinci instrument installedat eso's vlt interferometer (vlti), the angular diameters of the two maincomponents of the system, alpha cen a and b, were measured with a relativeprecision of 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. particular care has been taken in thecalibration of these measurements, considering that vinci is estimating thefringe visibility using a broadband k filter. we obtain uniform disk angulardiameters for alpha cen a and b of ud[a] = 8.314 +/- 0.016 mas and ud[b] =5.856 +/- 0.027 mas, and limb darkened angular diameters of ld[a] = 8.511 +/-0.020 mas and ld[b] = 6.001 +/- 0.034 mas. combining these values with theparallax from soderhjelm (1999), we derive linear diameters of d[a] = 1.224 +/-0.003 dsun and d[b] = 0.863 +/- 0.005 dsun. these values are compatible withthe masses published by thevenin et al.(2002) for both stars.

astro-ph;0309784	vinci / vlti observations of main sequence stars	main sequence (ms) stars are by far the most numerous class in the universe.they are often somewhat neglected as they are relatively quiet objects (butexceptions exist), though they bear testimony of the past and future of oursun. an important characteristic of the ms stars, particularly the solar-typeones, is that they host the large majority of the known extrasolar planets.moreover, at the bottom of the ms, the red m dwarfs pave the way tounderstanding the physics of brown dwarfs and giant planets. we have measuredvery precise angular diameters from recent vinci/vlti interferometricobservations of a number of ms stars in the k band, with spectral types betweena1v and m5.5v. they already cover a wide range of effective temperatures andradii. combined with precise hipparcos parallaxes, photometry, spectroscopy aswell as the asteroseismic information available for some of these stars, theangular diameters put strong constraints on the detailed models of these stars,and therefore on the physical processes at play.

astro-ph;0312068	modeling of alpha cen and procyon using vlti observations	we present a novel approach to model the nearby stars alpha cen a &amp; b andprocyon a using asteroseismic and interferometric constraints. using the vinciinstrument installed at the vlt interferometer (vlti), the angular diameters ofthe alpha centauri system were measured with a relative precision of 0.2% and0.6%, respectively. from these values, we derive linear radii of r[a] = 1.224+/- 0.003 r_sun and r[b] = 0.863 +/- 0.005 r_sun. these radii are in excellentagreement with the models of thevenin et al. (2002), that use asteroseismicfrequencies as constraints (bouchy &amp; carrier 2001; bouchy &amp; carrier 2002). withthe same instrument, we also measured the angular diameter of procyon a. usingthe hipparcos parallax, we obtain a linear radius of 2.048 +/- 0.025 r_sun. weuse this result together with spectroscopic and photometric constraints tomodel this star with the cesam code. we also computed the adiabatic oscillationspectrum of our model of procyon a, giving a mean large frequency separation ofdelta nu_0 = 54.8 uhz, in agreement with the seismic observations by martic etal. (2001). our model favours a mass around 1.4 m_sun for procyon a.
