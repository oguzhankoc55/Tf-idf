0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

0908.3848	intracluster light in the virgo cluster: large scale distribution	the intracluster light (icl) is a faint diffuse stellar component in clustersmade of stars not bound to individual galaxies. we have carried out a largescale study of this component in the nearby virgo cluster. the diffuse light istraced using planetary nebulae (pne). the pne are detected in the on-band imagedue to their strong emission in the [oiii] 5007 line, but disappear in theoff-band image. the contribution of ly-alpha emitters at z=3.14 are correctedstatistically using blank field surveys. we have surveyed a total area of 3.3square degrees in the virgo cluster with eleven fields located at differentradial distances. those fields located at smaller radii than 80 arcmin from thecluster center contain most of the detected diffuse light. in this centralregion of the cluster, the icl has a surface brightness in the range 28.8 - 30mag per sqarsec in the b band, it is not uniformly distributed, and representsabout 7% of the total galaxy light in this area. at distances larger than 80arcmin the icl is confined to single fields and individual sub-structures, e.g.in the virgo sub-clump b, the m60/m59 group. for several fields at 2 and 3degrees from the virgo cluster center we set only upper limits. these resultsindicate that the icl is not homogeneously distributed in the virgo core, andit is concentrated in the high density regions of the virgo cluster, e.g. thecluster core and other sub-structures. outside these regions, the icl isconfined within areas of 100 kpc in size, where tidal effects may be at work.these observational results link the formation of the icl with the formationhistory of the most luminous cluster galaxies.

0911.2530	high star formation activity in the central region of a distant cluster  at z=1.46	we present an unbiased deep [oii] emission survey of a cluster xmmxcsj2215.9-1738 at z=1.46, the most distant cluster to date with a detection ofextended x-ray emission. with wide-field optical and near-infrared cameras(suprime-cam and moircs, respectively) on subaru telescope, we performed deepimaging with a narrow-band filter nb912 (lambda_c=9139a, delta_lambda=134a) aswell as broad-band filters (b, z', j and ks). from the photometric catalogues,we have identified 44 [oii] emitters in the cluster central region of 6'x6'down to a dust-free star formation rate of 2.6 msun/yr (3 sigma).interestingly, it is found that there are many [oii] emitters even in thecentral high density region. in fact, the fraction of [oii] emitters to thecluster members as well as their star formation rates and equivalent widthsstay almost constant with decreasing cluster-centric distance up to the clustercore. unlike clusters at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) where star formation activity ismostly quenched in their central regions, this higher redshift 2215 clustershows its high star formation activity even at its centre, suggesting that weare beginning to enter the formation epoch of some galaxies in the cluster coreeventually. moreover, we find a deficit of galaxies on the red sequence atmagnitudes fainter than ~m*+0.5 on the colour-magnitude diagram. this breakmagnitude is brighter than that of lower redshift clusters, and it is likelythat we are seeing the formation phase of more massive red galaxies in thecluster core at z~1. these results may indicate inside-out and down-sizingpropagation of star formation activity in the course of cluster evolution.

0911.2544	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z = 3 - 4 based on deep  large area surveys in the subaru-sxds/ukidss-uds field	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=3.1 and 3.7 in 0.65 deg^2 of the subaru/xmm-newton deep field, based onrest-frame uv-to-optical photometry obtained from the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey, the ukidss/ultra deep survey, and the spitzer legacy survey of theukidss/uds. among a total of 302 laes (224 for z=3.1 and 78 for z=3.7), only 11are detected in the k band, i.e., brighter than k(3sigma)=24.1 mag. eight ofthe 11 k-detected laes are spectroscopically confirmed. we find that thek-undetected objects, which should closely represent the lae population as awhole, have low stellar masses of ~ 10^8 - 10^8.5 msun, modest sfrs of 1 - 100msun yr^-1, and modest dust extinction of e(b-v) &lt; 0.2. the k-detected objectsare massive, mstar ~ 10^9 - 10^10.5 msun, and have significant dust extinctionwith a median of e(b-v) ~= 0.3. four k-detected objects with the reddestspectral energy distributions, two of which are spectroscopically confirmed,are heavily obscured with e(b-v) ~ 0.65, and their continua resemble those ofsome local ulirgs. interestingly, they have large lyman alpha equivalent widths~= 70 - 250 a. if these four are excluded, our sample has a weakanti-correlation between ew(lya) and mstar. we compare the stellar masses andthe specific star formation rates (ssfr) of laes with those of lyman-breakgalaxies, distant red galaxies, submillimetre galaxies, and i- or k-selectedgalaxies with z_phot ~ 3. we find that the lae population is the least massiveamong all the galaxy populations in question, but with relatively high ssfrs,while nir-detected laes have mstar and ssfr similar to lbgs. our reddest fourlaes have very high ssfrs in spite of large mstar, thus occupying a uniqueregion in the mstar versus ssfr space.

0912.2786	panoramic h-alpha and mid-infrared mapping of star formation in a z=0.8  cluster	we present the first wide-field h-alpha imaging survey around the distantcluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 with a narrow-band filter on moircs/subaru,down to sfr(ha)~1msun/yr. combining with a wide-field mir imaging survey withakari, we compare the unobscured and obscured star formation activities in thecluster. we find that both h-alpha emitters and mir galaxies avoid the clustercentre and their spatial distribution is quite similar. most of the h-alphaemitters show blue colours, but we find some h-alpha emitters on the redsequence. the mir galaxies tend to be systematically redder than the h-alphaemitters probably due to heavy dust extinction. interestingly, the red h-alphaemitters and the red mir galaxies (i.e. dusty red galaxies) are most commonlyseen in the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups andfilaments, where optical colours of galaxies change. we also find that a(ha)exceeds ~3 in extreme cases and that such very dusty galaxies are also locatedin the medium-density environment. these findings suggest that dusty starformation is triggered in the in-fall region of the cluster, implying aprobable link between galaxy transition and dusty star formation. we finallycalculate the cluster total sfr and find that the cluster total sfr based onh-alpha alone can be underestimated more than factor ~2 even after 1 magextinction correction. we suggest that the mass-normalized cluster sfr rapidlydeclines since z~1 following ~(1+z)^6, although the uncertainty is still large.

0707.3161	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). iv. evolution of lya emitters  from z=3.1 to 5.7 in the 1 deg^2 field: luminosity functions and agn	we present luminosity functions (lfs) and various properties of lya emitters(laes) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) field. we obtain a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates basedon deep subaru/suprime-cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84confirmed laes from subaru/focas and vlt/vimos spectroscopy in a survey volumeof ~10^6 mpc^3 with a limiting lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. we derive thelfs of lya and uv-continuum (~1500 \aa) for each redshift, taking into accountthe statistical error and the field-to-field variation. we find that theapparent lya lf shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 withinfactors of 1.8 and 2.7 in l* and phi*, respectively. on the other hand, the uvlf of laes increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with lyaemission are more common at earlier epochs. we identify six laes with agnactivities from our spectra combined with vla, spitzer, and xmm-newton data.among the photometrically selected laes at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show agnactivities, while the brightest laes with logl(lya) &gt;~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appearto always host agns. our laes are bluer in uv-continuum color than dropoutgalaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. ourstacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and thef(heii)/f(lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation(+low-luminosity agn) and the primordial population in laes.

1004.0963	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z~6-7: constraints on the  escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxy building blocks	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=5.7 and 6.6 in a 0.65 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds)field, using deep images taken with subaru/suprime-cam, ukirt/wfcam, andspitzer/irac. we produce stacked multiband images at each redshift from 165(z=5.7) and 91 (z=6.6) irac-undetected objects, to derive typical spectralenergy distributions (seds) of z~6-7 laes for the first time. the stacked laeshave as blue uv continua as the hst/wfc3 z-dropout galaxies of similar muv,with a spectral slope beta ~ -3, but at the same time they have reduv-to-optical colors with detection in the 3.6um band. using sed fitting wefind that the stacked laes have low stellar masses of ~(3-10)*10^7 msun, veryyoung ages of ~1-3 myr, negligible dust extinction, and strong nebular emissionfrom the ionized interstellar medium, although the z=6.6 object is fittedsimilarly well with high-mass models without nebular emission; inclusion ofnebular emission reproduces the red uv-to-optical color while keeping the uvcolor sufficiently blue. we infer that typical laes at z~6-7 are buildingblocks of galaxies seen at lower redshifts. we find a tentative decrease in thelyman alpha escape fraction from z=5.7 to 6.6, which may imply an increase inthe intergalactic medium neutral fraction. from the minimum contribution ofnebular emission required to fit the observed seds, we place an upper limit onthe escape fraction of ionizing photons to be f_esc^ion~0.6 at z=5.7 and ~0.9at z=6.6. we also compare the stellar populations of our laes with that ofstacked hst/wfc3 z-dropout galaxies.

1005.3300	the hst/acs coma cluster survey. ii. data description and source  catalogs	the coma cluster was the target of a hst-acs treasury program designed fordeep imaging in the f475w and f814w passbands. although our survey wasinterrupted by the acs instrument failure in 2007, the partially completedsurvey still covers ~50% of the core high-density region in coma. observationswere performed for 25 fields that extend over a wide range of cluster-centricradii (~1.75 mpc) with a total coverage area of 274 arcmin^2. the majority ofthe fields are located near the core region of coma (19/25 pointings) with sixadditional fields in the south-west region of the cluster. in this paper wepresent reprocessed images and sextractor source catalogs for our surveyfields, including a detailed description of the methodology used for objectdetection and photometry, the subtraction of bright galaxies to measure faintunderlying objects, and the use of simulations to assess the photometricaccuracy and completeness of our catalogs. we also use simulations to performaperture corrections for the sextractor kron magnitudes based only on themeasured source flux and half-light radius. we have performed photometry for~73,000 unique objects; one-half of our detections are brighter than the10-sigma point-source detection limit at f814w=25.8 mag (ab). the slightmajority of objects (60%) are unresolved or only marginally resolved by acs. weestimate that coma members are 5-10% of all source detections, which consist ofa large population of unresolved objects (primarily gcs but also ucds) and awide variety of extended galaxies from a cd galaxy to dwarf lsb galaxies. thered sequence of coma member galaxies has a constant slope and dispersion across9 magnitudes (-21&lt;m_f814w&lt;-13). the initial data release for the hst-acs comatreasury program was made available to the public in 2008 august. the imagesand catalogs described in this study relate to our second data release.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1103.2180	red star forming galaxies and their environment at z=0.4 revealed by  panoramic h-alpha imaging	we present a wide-field h-alpha imaging survey of the rich clustercl0939+4713 (abell 851) at z=0.41 with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope,using the narrow-band filter nb921. the survey is sensitive to active galaxieswith star formation rates down to ~0.3msun/yr throughout the 27'x27' field, andwe identified 445 h-alpha emitters along the large-scale structures around thecluster. using this sample, we find that (1) the fraction of h-alpha emittersis a strong function of environment and shows a clear decline toward thecluster central region. we also find that (2) the color of h-alpha emitters isclearly dependent on environment. the majority of the h-alpha emitters haveblue colors with b-i&lt;2, but we find h-alpha emitters with red colors as well.such red emitters are very rare in the cluster center or its immediatesurrounding regions, while they are most frequently found in groups located faraway from the cluster center. these groups coincide with the environment wherea sharp transition in galaxy color distribution is seen. this may suggest thatdusty star formation activity tends to be involved in galaxy truncationprocesses that are effective in groups, and it is probably related to the"pre-processing" that generates present-day cluster s0 galaxies. finally, weconfirm that (3) the mass-normalized integrated star formation rate in clusters(i.e. the total star formation rate within 0.5xr200 from the cluster centerdivided by the cluster dynamical mass) rapidly increases with look-back timefollowing approximately ~(1+z)^6, and it is also correlated with the clustermass.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1105.2824	average metallicity and star formation rate of lya emitters probed by a  triple narrow-band survey	we present the average metallicity and star-formation rate of lya emitters(laes) measured from our large-area survey with three narrow-band (nb) filterscovering the lya, [oii]3727, and ha+[nii] lines of laes at z=2.2. we select 919z=2.2 laes from subaru/suprime-cam nb data in conjunction with magellan/imacsspectroscopy. of these laes, 561 and 105 are observed with kpno/newfirmnear-infrared nb filters whose central wavelengths are matched to redshifted[oii] and ha nebular lines, respectively. by stacking the near-infrared imagesof the laes, we successfully obtain average nebular-line fluxes of laes, themajority of which are too faint to be identified individually by narrow-bandimaging or deep spectroscopy. the stacked object has an ha luminosity of1.7x10^{42} erg s^{-1} corresponding to a star formation rate (sfr) of 14m_{sun} yr^{-1}. we place, for the first time, a firm lower limit to theaverage metallicity of laes of z&gt;~0.09 z_{sun} (2sigma) based on the[oii]/(ha+[nii]) index together with photo-ionization models and empiricalrelations. this lower limit of metallicity rules out the hypothesis that laes,so far observed at z~2, are extremely metal poor (z&lt;2x10^{-2} z_{sun}) younggalaxies at the 4sigma level. this limit is higher than a simple extrapolationof the observed mass-metallicity relation of z~2 uv-selected galaxies towardlower masses (5x10^{8} m_{sun}), but roughly consistent with a recentlyproposed fundamental mass-metallicity relation when the laes' relatively lowsfr is taken into account. the ha and lya luminosities of our nb-selected laesindicate that the escape fraction of lya photons is ~12-30 %, much higher thanthe values derived for other galaxy populations at z~2.

0710.0632	dependence of the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation on cluster  richness at z ~ 0.8	we present environmental dependence of the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation (cmr) at z ~ 0.8. it is well established that massive early-typegalaxies exhibit a tight cmr in clusters up to at least z ~ 1. the faint end ofthe relation, however, has been much less explored especially at high redshiftsprimarily due to limited depths of the data. some recent papers have reported adeficit of the faint red galaxies on the cmr at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1, but this has notbeen well confirmed yet and is still controversial. using a deep, multi-colour,panoramic imaging data set of the distant cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81,newly taken with the prime focus camera (suprime-cam) on the subaru telescope,we carry out an analysis of faint red galaxies with a care for incompleteness.we find that there is a sharp decline in the number of red galaxies toward thefaint end of the cmr below m*+2. we compare our result with those for otherclusters at z ~ 0.8 taken from the literature, which show or do not show thedeficit. we suggest that the "deficit" of faint red galaxies is dependent onthe richness or mass of the clusters, in the sense that poorer systems showstronger deficits. this indicates that the evolutionary stage of less massivegalaxies depends critically on environment.

1202.1044	kinematics and excitation of the ram pressure stripped ionized gas  filaments in the coma cluster of galaxies	we present the results of deep imaging and spectroscopic observations of veryextended ionized gas (eig) around four member galaxies of the coma cluster ofgalaxies: rb199, ic4040, gmp2923 and gmp3071. the eigs were serendipitouslyfound in an h-alpha narrow band imaging survey of the central region of thecoma cluster. the relative radial velocities of the eigs with respect to thesystemic velocities of the parent galaxies from which they emanate increasealmost monotonically with the distance from the nucleus of the respectivegalaxies, reaching -400 - -800 km/s at around 40 - 80 kpc from the galaxies.the one-sided morphologies and the velocity fields of the eigs are consistentwith the predictions of numerical simulations of ram pressure stripping. wefound a very low-velocity filament (v_rel = -1300 km/s) at the southeasternedge of the disk of ic4040. some bright compact knots in the eigs of rb199 andic4040 exhibit blue continuum and strong h-alpha emission. the equivalentwidths of the h-alpha emission exceed 200 a, and are greater than 1000 a forsome knots. the emission line intensity ratios of the knots are basicallyconsistent with those of sub-solar abundance hii regions. these facts indicatethat intensive star formation occurs in the knots. some filaments, includingthe low velocity filament of the ic4040 eig, exhibit shock-like emission linespectra, suggesting that shock heating plays an important role in ionizationand excitation of the eigs.

1206.2316	gas motion study of lya emitters at z~2 using uv and optical spectral  lines	we present the results of magellan/mmirs and keck/nirspec spectroscopy forfive lya emitters (laes) at z=2.2 for which high-resolution fuv spectra frommagellan/mage are available. we detect nebular emission lines including ha onthe individual basis and low-ionization interstellar (lis) absorption lines ina stacked fuv spectrum, and measure average offset velocities of the lya line,delta_v_lya, and lis absorption lines, delta_v_abs, with respect to thesystemic velocity defined by the nebular lines. for a sample of eight z~2-3laes without agn from our study and the literature, we obtain delta_v_lya =175+/-35 km s^{-1}, which is significantly smaller than that of lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs), delta_v_lya=400 km s^{-1}. the stacked fuv spectrum givesdelta_v_abs = -179 +/- 73 km s^{-1}, comparable to that of lbgs. these positivedelta_v_lya and negative delta_v_abs suggest that laes also have outflows. incontrast to lbgs, however, the laes' delta_v_lya is as small as |delta_v_abs|,suggesting low neutral hydrogen column densities. such a low column densitywith a small number of resonant scattering may cause the observed strong lyaemission of laes. we find an anti-correlation between lya equivalent width (ew)and delta_v_lya in a compilation of lae and lbg samples. although its physicalorigin is not clear, this anti-correlation result appears to challenge thehypothesis that a strong outflow, by means of a reduced number of resonantscattering, produces a large ew. if laes at z&gt;6 have similarly smalldelta_v_lya values, constraints on the reionization history derived from thelya transmissivity may need to be revised.

0705.2901	wide-field survey around local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo ii:  spatial distribution of stellar content	we carried out a wide-field v, i imaging survey of the local group dwarfspheroidal galaxy leo ii using the subaru prime focus camera on the 8.2-msubaru telescope. the survey covered an area of 26.67 x 26.67 arcmin^2, farbeyond the tidal radius of leo ii (8.63 arcmin), down to the limiting magnitudeof v ~26, which is roughly 1 mag deeper than the turn-off point of the mainsequence stars of leo ii. radial number density profiles of bright and faintred giant branch (rgb) stars were found to change their slopes at around thetidal radius, and extend beyond the tidal radius with shallower slopes. asmoothed surface brightness map of leo ii suggests the existence of a smallsubstructure of globular cluster luminosity beyond the tidal radius. weinvestigated the properties of the stellar population by means of thecolor-magnitude diagram. the horizontal branch (hb) morphology index shows aradial gradient in which red hb stars are more concentrated than blue hb stars,which is common to many local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the colordistribution of rgb stars around the mean rgb sequence shows a largerdispersion at the center than in the outskirts, indicating a mixture of stellarpopulations at the center and a more homogeneous population in the outskirts.based on the age estimation using subgiant branch (sgb) stars, we found thatalthough the major star formation took place ~8 gyr ago, a considerable stellarpopulation younger than 8 gyr is found at the center; such a younger populationis insignificant in the outskirts.

1512.09208	giant h$\alpha$ nebula surrounding the starburst merger ngc 6240	we revealed the detailed structure of a vastly extended h$\alpha$-emittingnebula ("h$\alpha$ nebula") surrounding the starburst/merging galaxy ngc 6240by deep narrow-band imaging observations with the subaru suprime-cam. theextent of the nebula is $\sim$90 kpc in diameter and the total h$\alpha$luminosity amounts to $\approx 1.6 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the volumefilling factor and the mass of the warm ionized gas are$\sim$10$^{-4}$--10$^{-5}$ and $\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ $m_\odot$, respectively.the nebula has a complicated structure, which includes numerous filaments,loops, bubbles, and knots. we found that there is a tight spatial correlationbetween the h$\alpha$ nebula and the extended soft x-ray-emitting gas, both inlarge and small scales. the overall morphology of the nebula is dominated byfilamentary structures radially extending from the center of the galaxy. alarge-scale bi-polar bubble extends along the minor axis of the main stellardisk. the morphology strongly suggests that the nebula was formed by intenseoutflows - superwinds - driven by starbursts. we also found three bright knotsembedded in a looped filament of ionized gas that show head-tail morphologiesin both emission-line and continuum, suggesting close interactions between theoutflows and star forming regions. based on the morphology and surfacebrightness distribution of the h$\alpha$ nebula, we propose the scenario thatthree major episodes of starburst/superwind activities which were initiated$\sim$10$^2$ myr ago formed the extended ionized gas nebula of ngc 6240.

astro-ph;0301303	the environment of passive spiral galaxies in the sdss	in previous work on galaxy clusters, several authors reported a discovery ofan unusual population of galaxies, which have spiral morphologies, but do notshow any star formation activity. these galaxies are called ``passivespirals'', and have been interesting since it has been difficult to understandthe existence of such galaxies. using a volume limited sample (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1 andmr&lt;-20.5; 25813 galaxies) of the sloan digital sky survey data, we have found73 (0.28$\pm$0.03%) passive spiral galaxies and studied their environments. itis found that passive spiral galaxies live in local galaxy density 1-2mpc$^{-2}$ and 1-10 cluster-centric virial radius. thus the origins of passivespiral galaxies are likely to be cluster related. these characteristicenvironments coincide with the previously reported environment where galaxystar formation rate suddenly declines and the so-called morphology-densityrelation turns. it is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsiblefor all of these observational results. the existence of passive spiralgalaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that works calmly is preferred todynamical origins such as major merger/interaction since such a mechanism candestroy spiral arm structures. compared with observed cluster galaxy evolutionsuch as the butcher-oemler effect and the morphological butcher-oemler effect,passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a galaxy population in transitionbetween red, elliptical/s0 galaxies in low redshift clusters and blue, spiralgalaxies more numerous in higher redshift clusters.

astro-ph;0312040	evolution of the colour--radius relation and the morphology--radius  relation in the sdss galaxy clusters	we have investigated the redshift evolution of thecolour--cluster-centric-radius relation and themorphology--cluster-centric-radius relation in three redshift bins,  $0.02\leq z\leq 0.14$, $0.14&lt; z\leq 0.20$, and $0.20&lt; z\leq 0.30$ using ahomogeneous sample of 736 galaxy clusters selected from the sloan  digital sky survey. both the relations are well-defined in all the redshiftbins; the fraction of blue/late-type galaxies increases toward outside ofclusters.blue/late-type galaxy fractions are found to decrease with decreasingredshift at any cluster-centric radius. the trend is consistent with thebutcher-oemler effect and the morphological butcher-oemlereffect. in addition,we find that colour (spectral) evolution is almost completed by $z\sim0.2$,whereas morphological evolution continues to the present day. the colour-radiusrelation is smooth inall the redshift bins, while the morphology--radiusrelation has a break only in the highest redshift bin. it is also foundthatfractions of blue-late type galaxies decreases mostly between the highestand the intermediate redshift bins, while fractions of red-late type galaxiescontinuously decreases with decreasing redshift through all the redshift bins.  these results are consistent with the interpretation that the timescale ofthe colour (spectral) evolution is shorter than that of the morphologicalevolution. it is suggested that red-late type galaxies in the middle of thetransformation are observed as passive spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0312043	the morphology-density relation in the sloan digital sky survey	we have studied the morphology-density relation andmorphology--cluster-centric-radius relation using a volume limited sample(0.05$&lt;z&lt;$0.1, $mr^*&lt;-$20.5) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data.  we found there are two characteristic changes in both the morphology-densityand the morphology-radius relations, suggesting two different mechanisms areresponsible for the relations.  in the sparsest regions (below 1 mpc$^{-2}$ or outside of 1 virial radius),both relations become less noticeable, suggesting the responsible physicalmechanisms for galaxy morphological change require denser environment.  in the intermediate density regions (density between 1 and 6 mpc$^{-2}$ orvirial radius between 0.3 and 1), intermediate-type fractions increase towarddenser regions, whereas late-disc fractions decrease.  in the densest regions (above 6 mpc$^{-2}$ or inside of 0.3 virial radius),intermediate-type fractions decrease radically and early-type fractionsincrease in turn. this is a contrasting result to that in intermediate regionsand it suggests that yet another mechanism is more responsible for themorphological change in these regions.  we also compared the morphology-density relation from the sdss(0.01$&lt;z&lt;$0.054) with that of the morphs data ($z\sim$0.5). two relations lieon top of each other, suggesting that the morphology-density relation wasalready established at $z\sim$0.5 as is in the present universe.

astro-ph;0407061	distributions of galaxy spectral types in the sloan digital sky survey	we perform an objective classification of 170,000 galaxy spectra in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) using the karhunen-lo\`eve (kl) transform. with aboutone-sixth of the total set of galaxy spectra which will be obtained by thesurvey, we are able to carry out the most extensive analysis of its kind todate. the formalism proposed by connolly and szalay is adopted to correct forgappy regions in the spectra, and to derive eigenspectra and eigencoefficients.  from this analysis, we show that this gap-correction formalism leads to aconverging set of eigenspectra and kl-repaired spectra. furthermore, kleigenspectra of galaxies are found to be convergent not only as a function ofiteration, but also as a function of the number of randomly selected galaxyspectra used in the analysis. from these data a set of ten eigenspectra ofgalaxy spectra are constructed, with rest-wavelength coverage 3450-8350angstrom. the eigencoefficients describing these galaxies naturally place thespectra into several classes defined by the plane formed by the first threeeigencoefficients of each spectrum. spectral types, corresponding to differenthubble-types and galaxies with extreme emission lines, are identified for the170,000 spectra and are shown to be complementary to existing spectralclassifications. from a non-parametric classification technique, we find thatthe population of galaxies can be divided into three classes which correspondto early late- through to intermediate late-types galaxies.

astro-ph;0411132	the environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the local universe:  dependence on luminosity, local density, and system richness	we investigate the environmental dependence of star formation and themorphology of galaxies in the local universe based on a volume-limited sample(0.030&lt;z&lt;0.065 and m_r&lt;m_r^*+2) constructed from the data of the sloan digitalsky survey. first, we focus on how galaxy properties change with local density.the star formation and morphology show a 'break' at the critical local densityof log sigma_crit~0.4 galaxies h_75^2 mpc^-2, which is in agreement withprevious studies. however, the break can be seen only for faint galaxies(m^*_r+1 &lt; m_r &lt; m^*_r+2), and bright galaxies (m_r &lt; m^*_r+1) show no break.thus, galaxies of different luminosities are found to show differentenvironmental dependencies. next, we examine dependencies on richness of galaxysystems. star formation activities of galaxies are different from those offield galaxies even in systems as poor as sigma~100 km/s. this result suggeststhat environmental mechanisms that are effective only in rich systems, such asram-pressure stripping of cold gas and harassment, have not played a major rolein transforming galaxies into red early-type galaxies. strangulation andinteractions between galaxies, however, remain candidates of the driver of theenvironmental dependence. in the dense environments in the local universe, theslow transformation of faint galaxies occurs to some extent, but thetransformation of bright galaxies is not clearly visible. we suggest that theevolution of bright galaxies is not strongly related to galaxy system, such asgroups and clusters, while the evolution of faint galaxies is likely to beclosely connected to galaxy system.

astro-ph;0501630	detection of intracluster planetary nebulae in the coma cluster	[oiii] lambda 5007aa emission lines of 16 intracluster planetary nebulaecandidates in the coma cluster were detected with a multi-slit imagingspectroscopy (msis) technique using focas on the subaru telescope. theidentification of these faint emission sources as pne is supported by (i) theirpoint-like flux distribution in both space and wavelength, with tight limits onthe continuum flux; (ii) the identification of the second [oiii] lambda 4959line in the only object at high enough velocity that this line too falls intothe filter bandpass; (iii) emission line fluxes consistent with pne at 100 mpcdistance, in the range 2.8 x 10^{-19} - 1.7 x 10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2; and (iv) anarrow velocity distribution approximately centered on the systemic velocity ofthe coma cluster. comparing with the velocities of galaxies in our field, weconclude that the great majority of these candidates would be intracluster pne,free floating in the coma cluster core. their velocity dispersion is ~760 km/s,and their mean velocity is lower than that of the galaxies. the velocitydistribution suggests that the intracluster stellar population has differentdynamics from the galaxies in the coma cluster core.

astro-ph;0506713	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation as a function of  environment	we discuss the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution based on deeppanoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with suprime-cam as part of thepisces project. by combining with the sdss data as a local counterpart forcomparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges inenvironment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). we find that colours ofgalaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($m_v&gt;m_v^*+1$), change from blueto red at a break density as we go to denser regions. based on local and globaldensities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, andclusters. we show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already builtat $z=0.83$. in contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnituderelation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and thebuild-up at the faint-end has not started yet. a possible interpretation ofthese results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. that is,massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of starformation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. this trend islikely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation is delayed in lower-density environments. therefore, we may suggestthat the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and inhigh density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lowerdensity regions.

(2000) in spite of our much larger survey volume. thissuggests that large and luminous extended ly-alpha objects like the two labsare very rare and are clustered in overdense regions.

astro-ph;0605589	deep extragalactic surveys around the ecliptic poles with akari  (astro-f)	akari (formerly astro-f) is an infrared space telescope designed for anall-sky survey at 10-180 (mu)m, and deep pointed surveys of selected areas at2-180 (mu)m. the deep pointed surveys with akari will significantly advance ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution, the structure formation of the universe, thenature of the buried agns, and the cosmic infrared background. here we describethe important characteristics of the akari mission: the orbit, and the attitudecontrol system, and investigate the optimum survey area based on the updatedpre-flight sensitivities of akari, taking into account the cirrus confusionnoise as well as the surface density of bright stars. the north ecliptic pole(nep) is concluded to be the best area for 2-26 (mu)m deep surveys, while thelow-cirrus noise regions around the south ecliptic pole (sep) are worthconsidering for 50-180 (mu)m pointed surveys to high sensitivities limited bythe galaxy confusion noise. current observational plans of these pointedsurveys are described in detail. comparing these surveys with the deep surveyswith the spitzer space telescope, the akari deep surveys are particularlyunique in respect of their continuous wavelength coverage over the 2-26 (mu)mrange in broad-band deep imaging, and their slitless spectroscopy mode over thesame wavelength range.

astro-ph;0608512	luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies at z~4 and 5 in the subaru  deep field	we investigate the luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z~4and 5 based on the optical imaging data obtained in the subaru deep fieldproject. three samples of lbgs in a contiguous 875 arcmin^2 area areconstructed. one consists of 3,808 lbgs at z~4 down to i'=26.85 selected withthe b-r vs r-i' diagram. the other two consist of 539 and 240 lbgs at z~5 downto z'=26.05 selected with two kinds of two-color diagrams: v-i' vs i'-z' andr-i' vs i'-z'. the adopted selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliableby spectroscopic observation. we derive the luminosity functions of the lbgs atrest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths down to m_{uv}=-19.2 at z~4 and m_{uv}=-20.3at z~5. we find clear evolution of the luminosity function over the redshiftrange of 0&lt;z&lt;6, which is accounted for by a sole change in the characteristicmagnitude, m^*. the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) density at z~4 and z~5 ismeasured from the luminosity functions. we examine the evolution of the cosmicsfr density and its luminosity dependence over 0&lt;z&lt;6. the sfr densitycontributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more drastically withcosmic time. the contribution from brighter galaxies has a sharp peak aroundz=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves relatively mildly with a broadpeak at earlier epoch. combining the observed sfr density with the standardcold dark matter model, we compute the cosmic sfr per unit baryon mass in darkhaloes, i.e., the specific sfr. the specific sfr is found to scale withredshift as (1+z)^3 up to z~4, implying that the efficiency of star formationis on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the cooling ratewithin dark haloes, while this is not simply the case at z&gt;4.

astro-ph;0701637	luminosity dependent clustering of star-forming bzk galaxies at redshift  2	we use the bzk color selection proposed by daddi et al. (2004) to obtain asample of 1092 faint star-forming galaxies (hereafter sbzks) from 180 arcmin^2in the subaru deep field. this sample represents star-forming galaxies at 1.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.5 down to k(ab)=23.2, which roughly corresponds to a stellar-mass limitof ~ 1 x 10^{10} msun. we measure the angular correlation function (acf) ofthese sbzks to be w(theta) = (0.58 +- 0.13) x theta["]^{-0.8} and translate theamplitude into the correlation length assuming a reasonable redshiftdistribution. the resulting value, r0 = 3.2^{+0.6}_{-0.7} h^{-1} mpc, suggeststhat our sbzks reside in haloes with a typical mass of 2.8 x 10^{11} msun.combining this halo mass estimate with those for brighter samples of kong etal. (2006), we find that the mass of dark haloes largely increases with kbrightness, a measure of the stellar mass. comparison with other galaxypopulations suggests that faint sbzks (k(ab)&lt;23.2) and lyman break galaxies atz ~ 2 are similar populations hosted by relatively low-mass haloes, whilebright sbzks (k(ab)&lt;21) reside in haloes comparable to or more massive thanthose of distant red galaxies and extremely red objects. using the extendedpress-schechter formalism, we predict that present-day descendants of haloeshosting sbzks span a wide mass range depending on k brightness, from lower thanthat of the milky way up to those of richest clusters.

astro-ph;0701668	the hi content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24	we use observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) tomeasure the atomic hydrogen gas content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24(i.e. a look-backtime of ~3 gyr). the sample of galaxies studied were selectedfrom halpha-emitting field galaxies detected in a narrow-band imaging surveywith the subaru telescope. the anglo-australian telescope was used to obtainprecise optical redshifts for these galaxies. we then coadded the hi 21 cmemission signal for all the galaxies within the gmrt spectral line data cube.  from the coadded signal of 121 galaxies, we measure an average atomichydrogen gas mass of (2.26 +- 0.90)*10^9 solar masses. we translate this hisignal into a cosmic density of neutral gas at z = 0.24 of omega_gas = (0.91 +-0.42)*10^-3. this is the current highest redshift at which omega_gas has beenconstrained from 21 cm emission and our value is consistent with that estimatedfrom damped lyman-alpha systems around this redshift. we also find that thecorrelations between the halpha luminosity and the radio continuum luminosityand between the star formation rate and the hi gas content in star-forminggalaxies at z = 0.24 are consistent with the correlations found at z = 0. thesetwo results suggest that the star formation mechanisms in field galaxies ~3 gyrago were not substantially different from the present, even though the starformation rate is 3 times higher.

astro-ph;0703606	kinematic substructures in the coma cluster core as traced by  intracluster planetary nebulae	the coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yetthere is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. a sensitiveprobe of this evolution is the dynamics of intracluster stars, which areunbound from galaxies while the cluster forms, according to cosmologicalsimulations. with a new multi-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered atthe 8.2 m subaru telescope and focas, we can now detect and measure theline-of-sight velocities of the intracluster planetary nebulae which areassociated with the diffuse stellar population of stars, at 100 mpc distance.we detect significant velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field,centred on the coma x-ray cluster emission. one substructure ispresent at ~5000km/s, probably from infall of a galaxy group, while the main intraclusterstellar component moves at ~ 6500 km/s. hence the icpns associated with thediffuse light at the position of the msis field are not bound to the nearby cdgalaxy ngc 4874, whose radial velocity is ~ 700 km/s greater.

astro-ph;0703770	the kinematics of intracluster planetary nebulae and the on-going  subcluster merger in the coma cluster core	the coma cluster is the richest and most compact of the nearby clusters, yetthere is growing evidence that its formation is still on-going. with a newmulti-slit imaging spectroscopy technique pioneered at the 8.2 m subarutelescope and focas, we have detected and measured the line-of-sight velocitiesof 37 intracluster planetary nebulae associated with the diffuse stellarpopulation of stars in the coma cluster core, at 100 mpc distance. we detectclear velocity substructures within a 6 arcmin diameter field. a substructureis present at ~5000 km/s, probably from in-fall of a galaxy group, while themain intracluster stellar component is centered around ~6500 km/s, ~700 km/soffset from the nearby cd galaxy ngc 4874. the kinematics and morphology of theintracluster stars show that the cluster core is in a highly dynamicallyevolving state. in combination with galaxy redshift and x-ray data this arguesstrongly that the cluster is currently in the midst of a subcluster merger,where the ngc 4874 subcluster core may still be self-bound, while the ngc 4889subcluster core has probably dissolved. the ngc 4889 subcluster is likely tohave fallen into coma from the eastern a2199 filament, in a direction nearly inthe plane of the sky, meeting the ngc 4874 subcluster arriving from the west.the two inner subcluster cores are presently beyond their first and secondclose passage, during which the elongated distribution of diffuse light hasbeen created. we predict the kinematic signature expected in this scenario, andargue that the extended western x-ray arc recently discovered traces the arcshock generated by the collision between the two subcluster gas halos. anypreexisting cooling core region would have been heated by the subclustercollision.

0809.2795	mapping dusty star formation in and around a cluster at z=0.81 by  wide-field imaging with akari	we present environmental dependence of dusty star forming activity in andaround the cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 based on wide-field andmulti-wavelength observations with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope and irconboard the akari satellite. our optical data shows that the optical colourdistribution of galaxies starts to dramatically change from blue to red at themedium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments. bycombining with infrared data, we find that 15 micron galaxies tend to haveoptical colours between the red sequence and the blue cloud with a tail intothe red sequence.  the spatial distribution of the 15 micron galaxies over ~200 arcmin^2 aroundthe cluster reveals that few 15 micron galaxies are detected in the clustercentral region. this is probably due to the low star forming activity in thecluster core. however, interestingly, the fraction of 15 micron galaxies in themedium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, despite thefact that the optical colours start to change in the medium-densityenvironments. furthermore, we find that 15 micron galaxies which have opticallyred colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specificstar formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment.these results imply that the star forming activity in galaxies in groups andfilaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to themedium-density environment, and such a phenomenon is probably directlyconnected to the truncation of star forming activity in galaxies seen as thedramatic change in optical colours in such environments.

astro-ph;9705112	an objective and automatic cluster finder: an improvement of the  matched-filter method	we describe an objective and automated method for detecting clusters ofgalaxies from optical imaging data. this method is a variant of the so-called`matched-filter' technique pioneered by postman et al. (1996). withsimultaneous use of positions and apparent magnitudes of galaxies, this methodcan, not only find cluster candidates, but also estimate their redshifts andrichnesses as byproducts of detection. we examine errors in the estimation ofcluster's position, redshift, and richness with a number of monte carlosimulations. no systematic discrepancies between the true and estimated valuesare seen for either redshift or richness. spurious detection rate of the methodis about less than 10% of those of conventional ones which use only surfacedensity of galaxies. a cluster survey in the north galactic pole is executed toverify the performance characteristics of the method with real data. two knownreal clusters are successfully detected. we expect these methods based on`matched-filter' technique to be essential tools for compiling large andhomogeneous optically-selected cluster catalogs.
