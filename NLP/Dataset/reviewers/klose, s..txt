0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0902.1772	physical properties of southern infrared dark clouds	it is commonly assumed that cold and dense infrared dark clouds (irdcs)likely represent the birth sites massive stars. therefore, this class ofobjects gets increasing attention. to enlarge the sample of well-characterisedirdcs in the southern hemisphere, we have set up a program to study the gas anddust of southern irdcs. the present paper aims at characterizing the continuuumproperties of this sample of objects. we cross-correlated 1.2 mm continuum datafrom simba@sest with spitzer/glimpse images to establish the connection betweenemission sources at millimeter wavelengths and the irdcs we see at 8 $\mu$m inabsorption against the bright pah background. analysing the dust emission andextinction leads to a determination of masses and column densities, which areimportant quantities in characterizing the initial conditions of massive starformation. the total masses of the irdcs were found to range from 150 to 1150$\rm m_\odot$ (emission data) and from 300 to 1750 $\rm m_\odot$ (extinctiondata). we derived peak column densities between 0.9 and 4.6 $\times 10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$ (emission data) and 2.1 and 5.4 $\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$(extinction data). we demonstrate that the extinction method fails for veryhigh extinction values (and column densities) beyond a$_{\rm v}$ values ofroughly 75 mag according to the weingartner &amp; draine (2001) extinction relation$r_{\rm v} = 5.5$ model b. the derived column densities, taking into accountthe spatial resolution effects, are beyond the column density threshold of 3.0$\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ required by theoretical considerations for massivestar formation. we conclude that the values for column densities derived forthe selected irdc sample make these objects excellent candidates for objects inthe earliest stages of massive star formation.

0903.1184	correlated optical and x-ray flares in the afterglow of xrf 071031	we present a densely sampled early light curve of the optical/near-infrared(nir) afterglow of the x-ray flash (xrf) 071031 at z=2.692. simultaneous andcontinuous observations in seven photometric bands from g' to k with grond atthe 2.2 m mpi/eso telescope on lasilla were performed between 4 minutes and 7hours after the burst. the light curve consists of 547 individual points whichallows us to study the early evolution of the optical transient associated withxrf 071031 in great detail. the optical/nir light curve is dominated by anearly increase in brightness which can be attributed to the apparent onset ofthe forward shock emission. there are several bumps which are superimposed ontothe overall rise and decay. significant flaring is also visible in the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) light curve from early to late times. the availability ofhigh quality, broadband data enables detailed studies of the connection betweenthe x-ray and optical/nir afterglow and its colour evolution during the firstnight post burst. we find evidence of spectral hardening in the optical bandscontemporaneous with the emergence of the bumps from an underlying afterglowcomponent. the bumps in the optical/nir light curve can be associated withflares in the x-ray regime suggesting late central engine activity as thecommon origin.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.0087	a multiwavelength study of swift grb 060111b constraining the origin of  its prompt optical emission	in this work, we present the results obtained from a multi-wavelengthcampaign, as well as from the public swift/bat, xrt, and uvot data of grb060111b for which a bright optical emission was measured with good temporalresolution during the prompt phase. we identified the host galaxy at r~25 mag;its featureless spectral continuum and brightness, as well as the non-detectionof any associated supernova 16 days after the trigger and other independentredshift estimates, converge to z~1-2. from the analysis of the early afterglowsed, we find that non-negligible host galaxy dust extinction, in addition tothe galactic one, affects the observed flux in the optical regime. theextinction-corrected optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distribution duringthe prompt emission shows a flux density ratio $f_{\gamma}/f_{opt}$=0.01-0.0001with spectral index $\beta_{\gamma,opt}&gt; \beta_{\gamma}$, strongly suggesting aseparate origin of the optical and gamma-ray components. this result issupported by the lack of correlated behavior in the prompt emission lightcurves observed in the two energy domains. the properties of the prompt opticalemission observed during grb 060111b favor interpretation of this optical lightas radiation from the reverse shock in a thick shell limit and in the slowcooling regime. the expected peak flux is consistent with the observed onecorrected for the host extinction, likely indicating that the starting time ofthe tarot observations is very near to or coincident with the peak time. theestimated fireball initial lorentz factor is &gt;260-360 at z=1-2, similar to thelorentz factors obtained from other grbs. grb 060111b is a rare, good test caseof the reverse shock emission mechanism in both the x-ray and optical energyranges.

1004.1131	grb 021004: tomography of a gamma-ray burst progenitor and its host  galaxy	we analyse the distribution of matter around the progenitor star of gamma-rayburst grb 021004 as well as the properties of its host galaxy withhigh-resolution echelle as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. observationswere taken by the 8.2m very large telescope with the ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (uves) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera(isaac) between 10 and 14 hours after the onset of the event. we report thefirst detection of emission lines from a grb host galaxy in the near-infrared,detecting h-alpha and the [o iii] doublet. these allow an independentmeasurement of the systemic redshift (z = 2.3304 +/- 0.0005) which is notcontaminated by absorption as the ly-alpha line is, and the deduction ofproperties of the host galaxy. from the visual echelle spectroscopy, we findseveral absorption line groups spanning a range of about 3,000 km/s in velocityrelative to the redshift of the host galaxy. the absorption profiles are verycomplex with both velocity-broadened components extending over several 100 km/sand narrow lines with velocity widths of only 20 km/s. by analogy with qsoabsorption line studies, the relative velocities,widths, and degrees ofionization of the lines ("line-locking", "ionization--velocity correlation")show that the progenitor had both an extremely strong radiation field andseveral distinct mass loss phases (winds). these results are consistent withgrb progenitors being massive stars, such as luminous blue variables (lbvs) orwolf--rayet stars, providing a detailed picture of the spatial and velocitystructure of the grb progenitor star at the time of explosion. the host galaxyis a prolific star-forming galaxy with a sfr of about 40 solar masses per year.

1004.3261	a very metal poor damped lyman-alpha system revealed through the most  energetic grb 090926a	we present vlt/fors2 spectroscopy and grond optical/near-ir photometry of theafterglow of the bright fermi/lat grb 090926a. the spectrum shows prominentlyman-alpha absorption with n_hi = 10^(21.73 +/- 0.07) cm^-2 and a multitude ofmetal lines at a common redshift of z=2.1062 +/- 0.0004, which we associatewith the redshift of the grb. the metallicity derived from sii is log(z/z_sun)~ -1.9, one of the lowest values ever found in a grb damped lyman-alpha (dla)system. this confirms that the spread of metallicity in grb-dlas at z~2 is atleast two orders of magnitude. we argue that this spread in metallicity doesnot require a similar range in abundances of the grb progenitors, since theneutral interstellar medium probed by the dla is expected to be at asignificant distance from the explosion site. the hydrogen column densityderived from swift/xrt afterglow spectrum (assuming log(z/z_sun) ~ -1.9) isapprox. 100 times higher than the n_hi obtained from the lyman-alphaabsorptions. this suggests either a large column density of ionized gas or ahigher metallicity of the circum-burst medium compared to the gas traced by thedla. we also discuss the afterglow light curve evolution and energetics. theabsence of a clear jet-break like steeping until at least 21 days post-burstsuggests a beaming corrected energy release of e_gamma&gt;3.5x10^52erg, indicatingthat grb090926a may have been one of the most energetic bursts ever detected.

1007.0383	the swift/fermi grb 080928 from 1 ev to 150 kev	we present the results of a comprehensive study of the gamma-ray burst 080928and of its afterglow. grb 080928 was a long burst detected by swift/bat andfermi/gbm. it is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission hadalready been detected when the grb itself was still radiating in the gamma-rayband. for nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, x-ray and gamma-ray dataprovide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient sourcefrom about 1 ev to 150 kev. in particular, we show that the sed during the mainprompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. we constructed theoptical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based onswift/uvot, rotse-iiia (australia), and grond (la silla) data and compared itto the x-ray light curve retrieved from the swift/xrt repository. we show thatits bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forwardshock.furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolutionof the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early x-ray lightcurve can be explained by large-angle emission (lae). we find that anonstandard lae model is required to explain the observations. finally, wereport on the results of our search for the grb host galaxy, for which only adeep upper limit can be provided.

1010.4057	the circumburst density profile around grb progenitors: a statistical  study	according to our present understanding, long grbs originate from the collapseof massive stars while short bursts are due to the coalescence of compactstellar objects. since the afterglow evolution is determined by the circumburstdensity profile, n(r), traversed by the fireball, it can be used to distinguishbetween a so-called ism profile, n(r) = const., and a free stellar wind, $n(r)\propto r^{-2}$. our goal is to derive the most probable circumburst densityprofile for a large number of swift-detected bursts using well-sampledafterglow light curves in the optical and x-ray bands. we combined all publiclyavailable optical and swift/x-ray afterglow data from june 2005 to september2009 to find the best-sampled late-time afterglow light curves. after applyingseveral selection criteria, our final sample consists of 27 bursts, includingone short burst. the afterglow evolution was then studied within the frameworkof the fireball model. we find that the majority (18) of the 27 afterglow lightcurves are compatible with a constant density medium (ism case). only 6 of the27 afterglows show evidence for a wind profile at late times. in particular, weset upper limits on the wind termination-shock radius, $r_t$, for grb fireballswhich are propagating into an ism profile and lower limits on $r_t$ for thosewhich were found to propagate through a wind medium. observational evidence forism profiles dominates in grb afterglow studies, implying that most grbprogenitors might have relatively small wind termination-shock radii. a smallergroup of progenitors, however, seems to be characterised by notably moreextended wind regions.

1011.0618	the nature of "dark" gamma-ray bursts	context: thirteen years after the discovery of the first afterglows, thenature of dark gamma-ray bursts (grb) still eludes explanation: while eachng-duration grb typically has an x-ray afterglow, optical/nir emission is onlyseen for 40-60% of them. aim: here we use the afterglow detection statistics ofthe systematic follow-up observations performed with grond since mid-2007 inorder to derive the fraction of "dark bursts" according to different methods,and to distinguish between various scenarios for "dark bursts". method:observations were performed with the 7-channel "gamma-ray optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpi/eso telescope. we used theafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between grb and thefirst grond exposure. results: for long-duration swift bursts with a detectedx-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/nirafterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240\,min afterthe burst. complementing our grond data with swift/xrt spectra we constructbroad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. edetect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. the faintoptical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination oftwo contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderateredshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift $&gt;$5.

1011.1205	photometric redshifts for grb afterglows from grond and swift/uvot	we present a framework to obtain photometric redshifts (photo-zs) forgamma-ray burst afterglows. using multi-band photometry from grond andswift/uvot, photo-zs are derived for five grbs for which spectroscopicredshifts are not available. we use uv/optical/nir data and syntheticphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometricredshifts of grbs and their accuracy. taking into account the afterglowsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometryto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. themeasurement of photo-zs for grb afterglows provides a quick, robust andreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly inthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/nir range cannot beobtained. given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, therelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and betterthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. we detail the approach on 5 sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts observed with uvot on-board swift and/or grond. thedistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for grb 080825b, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for grb080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for grb 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ forgrb 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for grb 090530. combining the responsefrom uvot with ground-based observatories and in particular grond operating inthe optical/nir wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorablecases, provided that these grbs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficientlybright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.

1105.1312	grb 090426: discovery of a jet break in a short burst afterglow	context: the link between the duration of grbs and the nature of theirprogenitors remains disputed. short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, andexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. aims: it is of critical importance toestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different grbpopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. the swift grb090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. its duration(t_90=1.28 s) places grb 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while thehigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectralcharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration grbs. methods: onthe basis of data obtained with the tautenburg 2m telescope (germany) and the7-channel imager grond (la silla, chile), we compiled the most finely sampledlight curve available for a short burst optical/nir afterglow. the light curvewas then analysed in a standard fashion. grond and xrt data were used todetermine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow acrossmore than three orders of magnitude. results: our data show that a light curvebreak exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. this light curvedecay is achromatic in the optical/nir bands, and interpreted as a post-jetbreak phase. the x-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.conclusions: the half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as theluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that grb 090426is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger oftwo compact objects.

1108.0674	the seds and host galaxies of the dustiest grb afterglows	(abridged) until recently the information inferred from gamma-ray burstfollow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows,biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amountsof dust. here, we present grb afterglow and host observations for a sample ofbursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visualextinction along the sight-line. this facilitates an investigation of theproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of thesepoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts fromoptically-selected samples. the hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse intheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than thehosts of optically-bright events. we hence probe a different galaxy population,suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,chemically-evolved and metal-rich members. this also indicates that the dustalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probablylocated in the diffuse ism or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate grbenvironment. some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of smallstellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxiespossess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. the presentedobservations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondinglychemically-evolved grb hosts. this suggests that grbs trace the globalstar-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected hostsamples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass hostgalaxies was at least partially a selection effect.

1201.3885	the late-time afterglow of the extremely energetic short burst grb  090510 revisited	the discovery of the short grb 090510 has raised considerable attentionmainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it is among the mostenergetic events detected so far within the entire grb population. theafterglow was observed with swift/uvot and swift/xrt and evidence of a jetbreak around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature,implying that after this break the optical and x-ray light curve should fadewith the same decay slope. as noted by several authors, the post-break decayslope seen in the uvot data is much shallower than the steep decay in the x-rayband, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. we reduced andanalyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imagergrond. based on the densely sampled data set obtained with grond, we find thatthe optical afterglow of grb 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phasestarting around 22 ks after the burst. during this time the grond optical lightcurve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the x-ray data.in combination with the uvot data this implies that a second break must haveoccurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however,has no obvious counterpart in the x-ray band, contradicting the interpretationthat this could be another jet break. the grond data provide the missing pieceof evidence that the optical afterglow of grb 090510 did follow a post-jetbreak evolution at late times.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1205.7075	the afterglow and environment of the short grb111117a	we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of the shortgrb111117a, and follow-up observations of its host galaxy. from rapid opticaland radio observations we place limits of r \gtrsim 25.5 mag at \deltat \approx0.55 d and f_nu(5.8 ghz) &lt; 18 \mujy at \deltat \approx 0.50 d, respectively.however, using a chandra observation at t~3.0 d we locate the absolute positionof the x-ray afterglow to an accuracy of 0.22" (1 sigma), a factor of about 6times better than the swift-xrt position. this allows us to robustly identifythe host galaxy and to locate the burst at a projected offset of 1.25 +/- 0.20"from the host centroid. using optical and near-ir observations of the hostgalaxy we determine a photometric redshift of z=1.3 (+0.3,-0.2), one of thehighest for any short grb, and leading to a projected physical offset for theburst of 10.5 +/- 1.7 kpc, typical of previous short grbs. at this redshift,the isotropic gamma-ray energy is e_{gamma,iso} \approx 3\times10^51 erg(rest-frame 23-2300 kev) with a peak energy of e_{pk} \approx 850-2300 kev(rest-frame). in conjunction with the isotropic x-ray energy, grb111117aappears to follow our recently-reported e_x,iso-e_gamma,iso-e_pk universalscaling. using the x-ray data along with the optical and radio non-detectionswe find that for a blastwave kinetic energy of e_{k,iso} \approx e_{gamma,iso},the circumburst density is n_0 \sim 3x10^(-4)-1 cm^-3 (for a range ofepsilon_b=0.001-0.1). similarly, from the non-detection of a break in the x-raylight curve at t&lt;3 d, we infer a minimum opening angle for the outflow oftheta_j&gt; 3-10 degrees (depending on the circumburst density). we conclude thatchandra observations of short grbs are effective at determining precisepositions and robust host galaxy associations in the absence of optical andradio detections.

1312.4547	prompt emission of grb 121217a from gamma-rays to the nir	the mechanism that causes the prompt-emission episode of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) is still widely debated despite there being thousands of promptdetections. the favoured internal shock model relates this emission tosynchrotron radiation. however, it does not always explain the spectral indicesof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.multi-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate thepossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. we present grb121217a, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (nir) emissionduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the gamma-ray burst opticalnear-infrared detector (grond) in combination with the swift and fermisatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 kev to 100 kev. we determine aphotometric redshift of z=3.1+/-0.1 with a line-of-sight extinction of a_v~0mag, utilising the optical/nir sed. from the afterglow, we determine a bulklorentz factor of gamma~250 and an emission radius of r&lt;10^18 cm. theprompt-emission broadband spectral energy distribution is well fit with abroken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break ate=6.6+/-0.9 kev, which can be interpreted as the maximum injection frequency.self-absorption by the electron population below energies of e_a&lt;6 kev suggesta magnetic field strength of b~10^5 g. however, all the best fit modelsunderpredict the flux observed in the nir wavelengths, which also onlyrebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, instark contrast to the x-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. we present grb121217a one of the few grbs for which there are multi-wavelength observationsof the prompt-emission period and show that it can be understood with asynchrotron radiation model.

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

0804.1959	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts ii.: type i grb versus type  ii grb optical afterglows	we use a large sample of grb afterglow and prompt-emission data (addingfurther grb afterglow observations in this work) to compare the opticalafterglows (or the lack thereof) of type i grbs with those of type ii grbs. incomparison to the afterglows of type ii grbs, we find that those of type i grbshave a lower average luminosity and show an intrinsic spread of luminosities atleast as wide. from late and deep upper limits on the optical transients, weestablish limits on the maximum optical luminosity of any associated supernova,confirming older works and adding new results. we use deep upper limits on typei grb optical afterglows to constrain the parameter space of possible mini-snemission associated with a compact-object merger. using the prompt emissiondata, we search for correlations between the parameters of the prompt emissionand the late optical afterglow luminosities. we find tentative correlationsbetween the bolometric isotropic energy release and the optical afterglowluminosity at a fixed time after trigger (positive), and between the hostoffset and the luminosity (negative), but no significant correlation betweenthe isotropic energy release and the duration of the grbs. we also discussthree anomalous grbs, grb 060505, grb 060614, and grb 060121, in the light oftheir optical afterglow luminosities.

1505.04415	super-solar metallicity at the position of the ultra-long grb130925a	over the last decade there has been immense progress in the follow-up ofshort and long grbs, resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate ofx-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of grb redshifts, and of theidentification of the underlying host galaxies. nevertheless, our theoreticalunderstanding on the progenitors and central engines powering these vastexplosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of `ultra-long' grbshas fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of grb formation. inthis paper we present high signal-to-noise x-shooter observations of the hostgalaxy of grb130925a, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-longgrb, with prompt gamma-ray emission detected for ~20ks. the grb line of sightwas close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations coverboth this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy, in addition to a brightstar-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. from our broadwavelength coverage we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinctionmeasurements at both the galaxy nucleus, and an outer star-forming region, andmeasure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy withinthe 10-20% most metal-rich grb host galaxies. such a high metal enrichment hasimplications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long grbs,although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to ruleout a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. the spatiallyresolved spectroscopic data presented in this paper offer important insightinto variations in the metal and dust abundance within grb host galaxies. theyalso illustrate the need for ifu observations on a larger sample of grb hostgalaxies at varies metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on therelation between the grb circumburst and the galaxy-whole properties.

1505.06743	grb hosts through cosmic time - vlt/x-shooter emission-line spectroscopy  of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.6	[abridged] we present data and initial results from vlt/x-shooteremission-line spectroscopy of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.6, thelargest sample of grb host spectroscopy available to date. most of our grbswere detected by swift and 76% are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 with a median z~1.6. based onbalmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measuresystemic redshifts, star formation rates (sfrs), visual attenuations, oxygenabundances (12+log(o/h)), and emission-line widths. we find a strong change ofthe typical physical properties of grb hosts with redshift. the median sfr, forexample, increases from ~0.6 m_sun/yr at z~0.6 up to ~15 m_sun/yr at z~2. ahigher ratio of [oiii]/[oii] at higher redshifts leads to an increasingdistance of grb-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the bptdiagram. oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between12+log(o/h)=7.9 and 12+log(o/h)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(o/h)~8.5. thefraction of grb-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20%at z&lt;1 in the adopted metallicity scale. this is significantly less than thefraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that grbs arescarce in high-metallicity environments. at z~3, sensitivity limits us toprobing only the most luminous grb hosts for which we derive metallicities of z~&lt; 0.5 z_sun. together with a high incidence of galaxies with similarmetallicity in our sample at z~1.5, this indicates that the metallicitydependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z~3.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

1510.07807	the optical identifcation of events with poorly defined locations: the  case of the fermi gbm grb140801a	we report the early discovery of the optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 140801a in the 137 deg$^2$ 3-$\sigma$ error-box of the fermi gamma-rayburst monitor (gbm). master is the only observatory that automatically react toall fermi alerts. grb 140801a is one of the few grbs whose optical counterpartwas discovered solely from its gbm localization. the optical afterglow of grb140801a was found by master global robotic net 53 sec after receiving thealert, making it the fastest optical detection of a grb from a gbm error-box.spectroscopy obtained with the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias and the 6-m btaof sao ras reveals a redshift of $z=1.32$. we performed optical andnear-infrared photometry of grb 140801a using different telescopes withapertures ranging from 0.4-m to 10.4-m. grb 140801a is a typical burst in manyways. the rest-frame bolometric isotropic energy release and peak energy of theburst is $e_\mathrm{iso} = 5.54_{-0.24}^{+0.26} \times 10^{52}$ erg and$e_\mathrm{p, rest}\simeq280$ kev, respectively, which is consistent with theamati relation. the absence of a jet break in the optical light curve providesa lower limit on the half-opening angle of the jet $\theta=6.1$ deg. theobserved $e_\mathrm{peak}$ is consistent with the limit derived from theghirlanda relation. the joint fermi gbm and konus-wind analysis shows that grb140801a could belong to the class of intermediate duration. the rapid detectionof the optical counterpart of grb 140801a is especially important regarding theupcoming experiments with large coordinate error-box areas.

astro-ph;0007201	the very red afterglow of grb 000418 - further evidence for dust  extinction in a grb host galaxy	we report near-infrared and optical follow-up observations of the afterglowof the gamma-ray burst 000418 starting 2.5 days after the occurrence of theburst and extending over nearly seven weeks. grb 000418 represents the secondcase for which the afterglow was initially identified by observations in thenear-infrared. during the first 10 days its r-band afterglow was wellcharacterized by a single power-law decay with a slope of 0.86. however, atlater times the temporal evolution of the afterglow flattens with respect to asimple power-law decay. attributing this to an underlying host galaxy we findits magnitude to be r=23.9 and an intrinsic afterglow decay slope of 1.22. theafterglow was very red with r-k=4 mag. the observations can be explained by anadiabatic, spherical fireball solution and a heavy reddening due to dustextinction in the host galaxy. this supports the picture that (long) bursts areassociated with events in star-forming regions.

astro-ph;0102177	the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow of grb 991208 and its host  galaxy	observations of the extraordinarily bright optical afterglow (oa) of grb991208 started 2.1 d after the event. the flux decay constant of the oa in ther-band is -2.30 +/- 0.07 up to 5 d, which is very likely due to the jet effect,and after that it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 +/-0.2, the fastest one ever seen in a grb oa. a negative detection in severalall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previousadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the grb (as expected fromthe jet effect). the existence of a second break might indicate a steepening inthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. once the afterglowemission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying sn is found, but thelight curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echoexplanation. our determination of z = 0.706 indicates that grb 991208 is at 3.7gpc, implying an isotropic energy release of 1.15 x 10e53 erg which may berelaxed by beaming by a factor &gt; 100. precise astrometry indicates that the grbcoincides within 0.2" with the host galaxy, thus given support to a massivestar origin. the absolute magnitude is m_b = -18.2, well below the knee of thegalaxy luminosity function and we derive a star-forming rate of 11.5 +/- 7.1mo/yr. the quasi-simultaneous broad-band photometric spectral energydistribution of the afterglow is determined 3.5 day after the burst (dec 12.0)implying a cooling frequency below the optical band, i.e. supporting a jetmodel with p = -2.30 as the index of the power-law electron distribution.

(2002) based on a single emission line. furthermore, wehave determined the photometric redshift of all the galaxies in an area of6'x6' around the host galaxy, in order to check for their overdensity in theenvironment of the host. we find that the grb 000210 host galaxy is asubluminous galaxy (l ~ 0.5+/-0.2 l*), with no companions above our detectionthreshold of 0.18+/-0.06 l*. based on the restframe ultraviolet flux a starformation rate of 2.1+/-0.2 solar masses per year is estimated. the best fit tothe sed is obtained for a starburst template with an age of 0.181^+0.037_-0.026gyr and a very low extinction (av~0). we discuss the implications of theinferred low value of av and the age of the dominant stellar population for thenon detection of the grb 000210 optical afterglow.

astro-ph;0408210	discovery of the near-ir afterglow and of the host of grb 030528	the rapid dissemination of an arcmin-sized hete-2 localization of thelong-duration x-ray flash grb 030528 led to a ground-based multi-observatoryfollow-up campaign. we report the discovery of the near-ir afterglow, and alsodescribe the detection of the underlying host galaxy in the optical and near-irbands. the afterglow is classified as "optically dark" as it was not detectedin the optical band. the k-band photometry presented here suggests that thelack of optical detection was simply the result of observational limitations(lack of rapid and deep observations plus high foreground extinction). simplepower law fits to the afterglow in the k-band suggest a typically decay with aslope of alpha=1.2. the properties of the host are consistent with the ideathat grb hosts are star forming blue galaxies. the redshift of grb 030528 cannot be determined accurately, but the data favour redshifts less than unity. inaddition, we present an optical and near-ir analysis of the x-ray source cxouj170354.0--223654 from the vicinity of grb 030528.

astro-ph;0503311	evidence for supernova light in all gamma-ray burst afterglows	we present an update of our systematic analysis of all gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglow data, now published through the end of 2004, in an attempt to detectthe predicted supernova light component. we fit the observed photometric lightcurves as the sum of an afterglow, an underlying host galaxy, and a supernovacomponent. the latter is modeled using published ubvri light curves of sn1998bw as a template. the total sample of afterglows with established redshiftscontains now 29 bursts (grb 970228 - grb 041006). for 13 of them a weaksupernova excess (scaled to sn 1998bw) was found. in agreement with our earlierresult (zeh et al. 2004) we find that also in the updated sample all burstswith redshift &lt; 0.7 show a supernova excess in their afterglow light curves.the general lack of a detection of a supernova component at larger redshiftscan be explained with selection effects. these results strongly support ourprevious conclusion based on all afterglow data of the years 1997 to 2002 thatin fact all afterglows of long-duration grbs contain light from an associatedsupernova.

astro-ph;0504592	late-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the grb000911  afterglow and its host galaxy	we present the results of an optical and near-infrared (nir) monitoringcampaign of the counterpart of gamma-ray burst (grb) 000911, located atredshift z=1.06, from 5 days to more than 13 months after explosion. ourextensive dataset is a factor of 2 larger and spans a time interval about 4times longer than the ones considered previously for this grb afterglow; thisallows a more thorough analysis of its light curve and of the grb host galaxyproperties. the afterglow light curves show a single power-law temporaldecline, modified at late times by light from a host galaxy with moderateintrinsic extinction, and possibly by an emerging supernova (sn). the afterglowevolution is interpreted within the classical "fireball" scenario as a weaklycollimated adiabatic shock propagating in the interstellar medium. the presenceof a sn light curve superimposed on the non-thermal afterglow emission isinvestigated: while in the optical bands no significant contribution to thetotal light is found from a sn, the nir j-band data show an excess which isconsistent with a sn as bright as the known hypernova sn1998bw. if the sninterpretation is true, this would be the farthest grb-associated sn, as wellas the farthest core-collapse sn, discovered to date. however, other possibleexplanations of this nir excess are also investigated. finally, we studied thephotometric properties of the host, and found that it is likely to be aslightly reddened, subluminous, extreme starburst compact galaxy, withluminosity about 0.1 l*, an age of about 0.5 gyr and a specific star formationrate (sfr) of approximately 30 msol yr-1 (l/l*)-1. this is the highest specificsfr value for a grb host inferred from optical/nir data.

astro-ph;0505474	early-time chromatic variations in the wind-swept medium of grb 021211  and the faintness of its afterglow	we present follow-up network for gamma-ray bursts (fun grb) collaborationobservations of the optical afterglow of grb 021211 made between 143 secondsand 102 days after the burst. our unique data set includes the earliestfiltered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre-swiftera. we find that the afterglow is best described by (1) propagation through awind-swept medium, (2) a cooling break that is blueward of the observed opticalfrequencies, and (3) a hard electron energy distribution. however, superimposedon this "standard model" behavior we find significant chromatic variationswithin the first few hours after the burst. we consider possible reasons forthese variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.finally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow andsurrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that grb 021211'safterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction ofenergy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,implying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for theprogenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)moderate source frame extinction. the jet appears to be significantly far fromequipartition and magnetically dominated. more extreme versions of this mightexplain the darkness of many afterglows in the swift era.

astro-ph;0506123	grb 050509b: constraints on short gamma-ray burst models	we have obtained deep optical images with the very large telescope at eso ofthe first well-localized short-duration gamma-ray burst, grb 050509b. from vand r imaging, initiated ~2 days after the grb trigger and lasting up to threeweeks, we detect no variable object inside the small swift/xrt x-ray errorcircle down to 2sigma limits of v = 26.5 and r = 25.1. the x-ray error circleincludes a giant elliptical galaxy at z = 0.225, which has been proposed as thelikely host of this grb. our limits indicate that if the grb originated at z =0.225, any supernova-like event accompanying the grb would have to be over 100times fainter than normal type ia sne or type ic hypernovae, 5 times fainterthan the faintest known ia or ic sne, and fainter than the faintest known typeii sne. moreover, we use the optical limits to constrain the energetics of thegrb outflow. simple models indicate that, unless the intrinsic energy in theoutflow from grb 050509b was &lt;&lt; 10^51 erg, there was very little radioactivematerial with efficient decay timescales for generating a large luminosity.these limits strongly constrain progenitor models for this short grb.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0604093	physics of the grb 030328 afterglow and its environment	we report on the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric, monitoring ofthe optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst (grb) 030328 detected by hete-2.photometry, collected at 7 different telescopes, shows that a smoothly brokenpowerlaw decay, with indices alpha_1 = 0.76 +/- 0.03, alpha_2 = 1.50 +/- 0.07and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 days after the grb, provides the best fit ofthe optical afterglow decline. this shape is interpreted as due to collimatedemission, for which we determine a jet opening angle theta_{jet} of about 3.2degrees. an achromatic bump starting around 0.2 d after the grb is possiblymarginally detected in the optical light curves. optical spectroscopy shows thepresence of two rest-frame ultraviolet metal absorption systems at z = 1.5216+/- 0.0006 and at z = 1.295 +/- 0.001, the former likely associated with thegrb host galaxy. analysis of the absorption lines at z = 1.5216 suggests thatthe host of this grb may be a damped lyman-alpha absorber. the optical v-bandafterglow appears polarized, with p= (2.4 +/- 0.6) % and theta = (170 +/- 7)degrees, suggesting an asymmetric blastwave expansion. an x-ray-to-opticalspectral flux distribution of the grb 030328 afterglow was obtained at 0.78days after the grb and fitted using a broken powerlaw, with an optical spectralslope beta_{opt} = 0.47 +/- 0.15, and an x-ray slope beta_{x} = 1.0 +/- 0.2.the discussion of these results in the context of the "fireball model" showsthat the preferred scenario for this afterglow is collimated structured jetwith fixed opening angle in a homogeneous medium.

astro-ph;0609450	hi column densities of z &gt; 2 swift gamma-ray bursts	context: before the launch of the swift satellite, the majority of thegamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows for which ly-alpha was redshifted into theobservable spectrum showed evidence for a damped ly-alpha absorber. this smallsample indicated that grbs explode either in galaxies, or regions within them,having high neutral hydrogen column densities.  aims: to increase the spectroscopic sample of grbs with z &gt; 2 and henceestablish the n(hi) distribution along grb lines-of-sight.  methods: we have obtained six z &gt; 2 grb afterglow spectra and fitted thely-alpha absorption line in each case to determine n(hi). this has beencomplemented with 12 other swift n(hi) values from the literature.  results: we show that the peak of the grb n(hi) distribution is qualitativelyconsistent with a model where grbs originate in galactic-like molecular clouds.however, a systematic difference, in particular an excess of low column-densitysystems compared to the predictions, indicates that selection effects andconditions within the cloud (e.g. strong ionization) influence the observedn(hi) range. we also report the discovery of ly-alpha emission from the grb060714 host, corresponding to a star-formation rate of approximately 0.8m_sun/year. finally, we present accurate redshifts of the six bursts: z = 3.240+/- 0.001 (grb 050319), z = 2.198 +/- 0.002 (grb 050922c), z = 3.221 +/- 0.001(grb 060526), z = 3.425 +/- 0.002 (grb 060707), z = 2.711 +/- 0.001 (grb060714) and z = 3.686 +/- 0.002 (grb 060906).

astro-ph;0609654	grb 051028: an intrinsically faint grb at high redshift?	we present multiwavelength observations of the gamma-ray burst grb 051028detected by hete-2 in order to derive its afterglow emission parameters and todetermine the reason for its optical faintness when compared to other events.observations were taken in the optical (2.0m himalayan chandra telescope, 1.34mtautenburg, 4.2m william herschel telescope) and in x-rays (swift/xrt) between2.7 hours and 10 days after the onset of the event. the data can be interpretedby collimated emission in a jet with a typical value of $p$ = 2.4 which ismoving in an homogeneous interstellar medium and with a cooling frequencynu_{c} still above the x-rays at 0.5 days after the burst onset. grb 051028 canbe classified as a ``gray'' or ``potentially dark'' grb. on the basis of thecombined optical and swift/xrt data, we conclude that the reason for theoptical dimness is not extra absorption in the host galaxy, but rather the grbtaking place at high-redshift.we also notice the very striking similarity withthe optical lightcurve of grb 050730, a burst with a spectroscopic redshift of3.967, although grb 051028 is about 3 mag fainter. we suggest that the bumpcould be explained by multiple energy injection episodes and that the burst isintrinsically faint when compared to the average afterglows detected since1997. the non-detection of the host galaxy down to r = 25.1 is also consistentwith the burst arising at high redshift, compatible with the published pseudo-zof 3.7 +/- 1.8.

astro-ph;0610157	x-ray flashes or soft gamma-ray bursts? the case of the likely distant  xrf 040912	in this work, we present a multi-wavelength study of xrf 040912, aimed atmeasuring its distance scale and the intrinsic burst properties. we performed adetailed spectral and temporal analysis of both the prompt and the afterglowemission and we estimated the distance scale of the likely host galaxy. we thenused the currently available sample of xrfs with known distance to discuss theconnection between xrfs and classical gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we found thatthe prompt emission properties unambiguously identify this burst as an xrf,with an observed peak energy of e_p=17+/-13 kev and a burst fluence ratios(2-30kev)/s(30-400kev)&gt;1. a non-fading optical source with r~24 mag and withan apparently extended morphology is spatially consistent with the x-rayafterglow, likely the host galaxy. xrf 040912 is a very dark burst since noafterglow optical counterpart is detected down to r&gt;25 mag (3 sigma limitingmagnitude) at 13.6 hours after the burst. the host galaxy spectrum detectedfrom 3800a to 10000a, shows a single emission line at 9552a. the lack of anyother strong emission lines blue-ward of the detected one and the absence ofthe ly alpha cut-off down to 3800a are consistent with the hypothesis of the[oii] line at redshift z=1.563+/-0.001. the intrinsic spectral properties rankthis xrf among the soft grbs in the e_peak-e_iso diagram. similar results wereobtained for most xrfs at known redshift. only xrf 060218 and xrf 020903represent a good example of instrinsic xrf(i-xrf) and are possibly associatedwith a different progenitor population. this scenario may calls for a newdefinition of xrfs.

astro-ph;9907264	evidence for a supernova in reanalyzed optical and near-infrared images  of grb970228	we present b-, v-, r_c-, i_c-, j-, h-, k- and k'-band observations of theoptical transient (ot) associated with grb970228, based on a reanalysis ofpreviously used images and unpublished data. in order to minimize calibrationdifferences we have collected and analyzed most of the photometry andconsistently determined the magnitude of the ot relative to a set of secondaryfield stars. we confirm our earlier finding that the early decay of the lightcurves (before march 6, 1997) was faster than that at intermediate times(between march 6 and april 7, 1997). at late times the light curves resume afast decay (after april 7, 1997). the early-time observations of grb970228 areconsistent with relativistic blast-wave models but the intermediate- andlate-time observations are hard to understand in this framework. theobservations are well explained by an initial power law decay with index -1.73+0.09 -0.12 modified at later times by a type-i_c supernova light curve.together with the evidence for grb980326 and grb980425 this gives furthersupport for the idea that at least some grbs are associated with a possiblyrare type of supernova.

0809.4231	optical and infrared flares from a transient galactic soft gamma-ray  repeater	soft gamma-ray repeaters (sgrs) are a rare type of gamma-ray transientsources that are ocasionally detected as bursts in the high-energy sky. theyare thought to be produced by magnetars, young neutron stars with very strongmagnetic fields of the order of 10^(14-15) g. only three such objects are knownin our galaxy, and a fourth one is associated with the supernova remnant n49 inthe large magellanic cloud. in none of these cases has an optical counterpartto either the gamma-ray flares or the quiescent source been identified. here wepresent multi-wavelength observations of a puzzling source, swiftj195509+261406, for which we detected more than 40 flaring episodes in theoptical band over a time span of 3 days, plus a faint infrared flare 11 dayslater, after which it returned to quiescence. we propose that swiftj195509+261406 is a member of a subgroup of sgrs for which the long-term x-rayemission is transient in nature. furthermore, it is the first sgr for whichbursts have been detected in the optical and near-infrared bands and maybe thelink between the "persistent" sgrs and the dim isolated neutron stars.

0810.4333	simultaneous polarization monitoring of supernovae sn2008d/xt080109 and  sn2007uy: isolating geometry from dust	the possible existence of a continuum encompassing the diversity of explosivestellar deaths,ranging from ordinary sne to relativistic hypernovae associatedwith long duration grbs, is under intense debate. in this context, sn2008dassociated with xt080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it mightexemplify a potential borderline event. the main aim is to infer geometricinformation of sn2008d through the evolution of its linear opticalpolarization. we also report the polarization evolution of sn2007uy, anddiscuss the properties of the host ism towards the xt. the final goal is tocompare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both sne,which shone contemporaneously in ngc2770. this fortunate coincidence brought usthe opportunity to observe both sne simultaneously, and most importantly, withidentical instrumental setups. the observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6days after the xt and are distributed in 11 visits. in addition we performedobservations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. wereport positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for sn2008d ata level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for sn2007uy. sn2007uy shows constant polarization,which could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constanteccentricity expansion on the sky plane. a statistical analysis of thedistribution of the sn2008d stokes parametres suggests that it could show anintrinsic variable polarization component. assuming the sn2007uy polarizationis constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic sn2008d polarizationcould be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variableeccentricity. we come to the same result even if we make no assumption onsn2007uy, although at a lower significance level. we suggest that at least theprojected, if not the intrinsic, geometries of both sne could differ.
