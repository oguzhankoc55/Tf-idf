0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0906.2003	a faint type of supernova from a white dwarf with a helium-rich  companion	supernovae (sne) are thought to arise from two different physical processes.the cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse andtypically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. these are thought toappear as as type ib/c and ii sne, and are associated with young stellarpopulations. a type ia sn is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonationof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose massapproaches the chandrasekhar limit. such sne are observed in both young and oldstellar environments. here we report our discovery of the faint type ib sn2005e in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, ngc 1032.  the lack of any trace of recent star formation near the sn location (fig. 1),and the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 m_sun), argue strongly against acore-collapse origin for this event. spectroscopic observations and the derivednucleosynthetic output show that the sn ejecta have high velocities and aredominated by helium-burning products, indicating that sn 2005e was neither asubluminous nor a regular sn ia (fig. 2). we have therefore found a new type ofstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likelyinvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. thesn ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of sn and likelyadditional large amounts of radioactive 44ti. such sne may thus help resolvefundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitivesolar system and that of the oldest stars, to the galactic production ofpositrons.

0906.5350	the palomar transient factory: system overview, performance and first  results	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a fully-automated, wide-field surveyaimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. the transientsurvey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the48-inch samuel oschin telescope at palomar observatory; colors and light curvesfor detected transients are obtained with the automated palomar 60-inchtelescope. ptf uses eighty percent of the 1.2-m and fifty percent of the 1.5-mtelescope time. with an exposure of 60-s the survey reaches a depth ofapproximately 21.3 in g' and 20.6 in r (5 sigma, median seeing). four majorexperiments are planned for the five-year project: 1) a 5-day cadence supernovasearch; 2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 seconds and 1 day;3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in orion; and 4) a3-pi sr deep h-alpha survey. ptf provides automatic, realtime transientclassification and follow up, as well as a database including every sourcedetected in each frame. this paper summarizes the ptf project, includingseveral months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, theobserving plans and the data reduction strategy. we conclude by detailing thefirst 51 ptf optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.

0910.0059	hydrogen-poor superluminous stellar explosions	supernovae (sne) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational orthermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeksor more. in all known sne, this radiation comes from internal energy depositedin the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesizedelements (typically 56ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in theenvelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the sn debris andslowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. here we report on a newclass of luminous sne whose observed properties cannot be explained by any ofthese known processes. these include four new sne we have discovered, and twopreviously unexplained events (sn 2005ap; scp 06f6) that we can now identify asmembers. these sne are all ~10 times brighter than sne ia, do not show anytrace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (uv) flux for extended periodsof time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent withradioactivity. our data require that the observed radiation is emitted byhydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) andexpanding at high velocities (&gt;10^4 km s^-1). these long-lived, uv-luminousevents can be observed out to redshifts z&gt;4 and offer an excellent opportunityto study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distantgalaxies.

0910.3676	long duration radio transients lacking optical counterparts are possibly  galactic neutron stars	(abridged) recently, a new class of radio transients in the 5-ghz band wasdetected by bower et al. we present new deep near-infrared (ir) observations ofthe field containing these transients, and find no counterparts down to alimiting magnitude of k=20.4 mag. we argue that the bright (&gt;1 jy) radiotransients recently reported by kida et al. are consistent with beingadditional examples of the bower et al. transients. we refer to these groups ofevents as "long-duration radio transients". the main characteristics of thispopulation are: time scales longer than 30 minute but shorter than severaldays; rate, ~10^3 deg^-2 yr^-1; progenitors sky surface density of &gt;60 deg^-2(95% c.l.) at galactic latitude ~40 deg; 1.4-5 ghz spectral slopes, f_\nu ~\nu^alpha, with alpha&gt;0; and most notably the lack of any counterparts inquiescence in any wavelength. we rule out an association with many types ofobjects. galactic brown-dwarfs or some sort of exotic explosions remainplausible options. we argue that an attractive progenitor candidate for theseradio transients is the class of galactic isolated old neutron stars (ns). weconfront this hypothesis with monte-carlo simulations of the space distributionof old nss, and find satisfactory agreement for the large areal density.furthermore, the lack of quiescent counterparts is explained quite naturally.in this framework we find: the mean distance to events in the bower et al.sample is of order kpc; the typical distance to the kida et al. transients areconstrained to be between 30 pc and 900 pc (95% c.l.); these events shouldrepeat with a time scale of order several months; and sub-mjy level burstsshould exhibit galactic latitude dependence. we discuss possible mechanismsgiving rise to the observed radio emission.

0910.3684	space and velocity distributions of galactic isolated old neutron stars	i present the results of monte-carlo orbital simulations of galactic neutronstars (nss). the simulations take into account the up-to-date observed ns spaceand velocity distributions at birth, and account for their formation rate. isimulate two populations of nss. objects in the first population were born inthe galactic disk at a constant rate, in the past 12 gyr. those in the secondpopulation were formed simultaneously 12 gyr ago in the galactic bulge. iassume that the nss born in the galactic disk comprise 40% of the total nspopulation. since the initial velocity distribution of nss is not well known, irun two sets of simulations, each containing 3x10^6 simulated nss. one setutilizes a bimodal initial velocity distribution and the other a unimodalinitial velocity distribution, both are advocated based on pulsarsobservations. in light of recent observational results, i discuss the effect ofdynamical heating by galactic structure on ns space and velocity distributionsand show it can be neglected. i present catalogue of simulated ns space andvelocity vectors in the current epoch, and catalogue of positions, distancesand proper motions of simulated nss, relative to the sun. assuming there are10^9 nss in the galaxy, i find that in the solar neighborhood the density ofnss is about 2-4x10^-4 pc^-3 and their scale height is about 0.3-0.6 kpc(depending on the adopted initial velocity distribution). these catalogue canbe used to test the hypothesis that some radio transients are related to theseobjects.

0911.3150	unveiling the origin of grb 090709a: lack of periodicity in a reddened  cosmological long-duration gamma-ray burst	we present broadband (gamma-ray, x-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)observations of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 090709a and its afterglow in aneffort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. previous analysessuggested that grb 090709a exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a periodof 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration grbs but typical of flares fromsoft gamma-ray repeaters. when properly accounting for the underlying shape ofthe power-density spectrum of grb 090709a, we find no conclusive (&gt; 3 sigma)evidence for the reported periodicity. in conjunction with the location of thetransient (far from the galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in thelocal universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the galacticvalue, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. a long-duration grb,however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of thissource. grb 090709a is distinguished from other long-duration grbs primarily bythe large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (a_k,obs &gt;~ 2 mag).

0912.2996	a single sub-km kuiper belt object from a stellar occultation in  archival data	the kuiper belt is a remnant of the primordial solar system. measurements ofits size distribution constrain its accretion and collisional history, and theimportance of material strength of kuiper belt objects (kbos). small, sub-kmsized, kbos elude direct detection, but the signature of their occultations ofbackground stars should be detectable. observations at both optical and x-raywavelengths claim to have detected such occultations, but their implied kboabundances are inconsistent with each other and far exceed theoreticalexpectations. here, we report an analysis of archival data that reveals anoccultation by a body with a 500 m radius at a distance of 45 au. theprobability of this event to occur due to random statistical fluctuationswithin our data set is about 2%. our survey yields a surface density of kboswith radii larger than 250 m of 2.1^{+4.8}_{-1.7} x 10^7 deg^{-2}, ruling outinferred surface densities from previous claimed detections by more than 5sigma. the fact that we detected only one event, firmly shows a deficit ofsub-km sized kbos compared to a population extrapolated from objects with r&gt;50km. this implies that sub-km sized kbos are undergoing collisional erosion,just like debris disks observed around other stars.

1001.1156	supernova 2007bi as a pair-instability explosion	stars with initial masses 10 m_{solar} &lt; m_{initial} &lt; 100 m_{solar} fuseprogressively heavier elements in their centres, up to inert iron. the corethen gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to anexplosion -- an iron-core-collapse supernova (sn). in contrast, extremelymassive stars (m_{initial} &gt; 140 m_{solar}), if such exist, have oxygen coreswhich exceed m_{core} = 50 m_{solar}. there, high temperatures are reached atrelatively low densities. conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photonsinto electron-positron pairs occurs prior to oxygen ignition, and leads to aviolent contraction that triggers a catastrophic nuclear explosion. tremendousenergies (&gt;~ 10^{52} erg) are released, completely unbinding the star in apair-instability sn (pisn), with no compact remnant. transitional objects with100 m_{solar} &lt; m_{initial} &lt; 140 m_{solar}, which end up as iron-core-collapsesupernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps due to short instances ofthe pair instability, may have been identified. however, genuine pisne, perhapscommon in the early universe, have not been observed to date. here, we presentour discovery of sn 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving supernova locatedwithin a dwarf galaxy (~1% the size of the milky way). we measure the explodingcore mass to be likely ~100 m_{solar}, in which case theory unambiguouslypredicts a pisn outcome. we show that &gt;3 m_{solar} of radioactive 56ni weresynthesized, and that our observations are well fit by pisn models. a pisnexplosion in the local universe indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probablyhost extremely massive stars, above the apparent galactic limit, perhapsresulting from star formation processes similar to those that created the firststars in the universe.

1003.1720	discovery of a new photometric sub-class of faint and fast classical  novae	we present photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of a sample ofextragalactic novae discovered by the palomar 60-inch telescope during a searchfor "fast transients in nearest galaxies" (p60-fasting). designed as a fastcadence (1-day) and deep (g &lt; 21 mag) survey, p60-fasting was particularlysensitive to short-lived and faint optical transients. the p60-fasting novasample includes 10 novae in m31, 6 in m81, 3 in m82, 1 in ngc2403 and 1 inngc891. this significantly expands the known sample of extragalactic novaebeyond the local group, including the first discoveries in a starburstenvironment. surprisingly, our photometry shows that this sample is quiteinconsistent with the canonical maximum magnitude rate of decline (mmrd)relation for classical novae. furthermore, the spectra of the p60-fastingsample are indistinguishable from classical novae. we suggest that we haveuncovered a sub-class of faint and fast classical novae in a new phase space inluminosity-timescale of optical transients. thus, novae span two orders ofmagnitude in both luminosity and time. perhaps, the mmrd, which ischaracterized only by the white dwarf mass, was an over-simplification. novaphysics appears to be characterized by quite a rich four-dimensional parameterspace in white dwarf mass, temperature, composition and accretion rate.

1103.1797	the subluminous and peculiar type ia supernova ptf09dav	ptf09dav is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn) discovered by thepalomar transient factory (ptf). spectroscopically, it appears superficiallysimilar to the class of subluminous sn1991bg-like sne, but it has severalunusual features which make it stand out from this population. its peakluminosity is fainter than any previously discovered sn1991bg-like sn ia (m_b-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faintluminosity were due to extinction. the photospheric optical spectra have veryunusual strong lines of sc ii and mg i, with possible sr ii, together withstronger than average ti ii and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. the host galaxyof ptf09dav is ambiguous. the sn lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)of a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (m_r&gt;-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other1991bg-like sne which are invariably associated with massive, old stellarpopulations. ptf09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosityand color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous sne ia. theinferred 56ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003msun), as is the estimated ejectamass of 0.36msun. taken together, these properties make ptf09dav a remarkableevent. we discuss various physical models that could explain ptf09dav. heliumshell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a co white-dwarf can explainsome of the features of ptf09dav, including the presence of sc and the lowphotospheric velocities, but the observed si and mg are not predicted to bevery abundant in these models. we conclude that no single model is currentlycapable of explaining all of the observed signatures of ptf09dav.

1106.5491	automating discovery and classification of transients and variable stars  in the synoptic survey era	the rate of image acquisition in modern synoptic imaging surveys has alreadybegun to outpace the feasibility of keeping astronomers in the real-timediscovery and classification loop. here we present the inner workings of aframework, based on machine-learning algorithms, that captures expert trainingand ground-truth knowledge about the variable and transient sky to automate 1)the process of discovery on image differences and, 2) the generation ofpreliminary science-type classifications of discovered sources. since follow-upresources for extracting novel science from fast-changing transients areprecious, self-calibrating classification probabilities must be couched interms of efficiencies for discovery and purity of the samples generated. weestimate the purity and efficiency in identifying real sources with a two-epochimage-difference discovery algorithm for the palomar transient factory (ptf)survey. once given a source discovery, using machine-learned classificationtrained on ptf data, we distinguish between transients and variable stars witha 3.8% overall error rate (with 1.7% errors for imaging within the sloandigital sky survey footprint). at &gt;96% classification efficiency, the samplesachieve 90% purity. initial classifications are shown to rely primarily oncontext-based features, determined from the data itself and external archivaldatabases. in the ~one year since autonomous operations, this discovery andclassification framework has led to several significant science results, fromoutbursting young stars to subluminous type iip supernovae to candidate tidaldisruption events. we discuss future directions of this approach, including thepossible roles of crowdsourcing and the scalability of machine learning tofuture surveys such a the large synoptical survey telescope (lsst).

1111.0007	a revised view of the transient radio sky	we report on a re-analysis of archival data from the very large array for asample of ten long duration radio transients reported by bower and others.these transients have an implied all-sky rate that would make them the mostcommon radio transient in the sky and yet most have no quiescent counterpartsat other wavelengths and therefore no known progenitor (other than galacticneutron stars). we find that more than half of these transients are due to raredata artifacts. the remaining sources have lower signal-to-noise ratio (snr)than initially reported by 1 to 1.5-sigma. this lowering of snr matters greatlysince the sources are at the threshold. we are unable to decisively account forthe differences. by two orthogonal criteria one source appears to be a gooddetection. thus the rate of long duration radio transients without opticalcounterparts is, at best, comparable to that of the class of recentlydiscovered swift j1644+57 nuclear radio transients. we revisit the known andexpected classes of long duration radio transients and conclude that thedynamic radio sky remains a rich area for further exploration. informed by theexperience of past searches for radio transients, we suggest that futuresurveys pay closer attention to rare data errors and ensure that a wealth ofsensitive multi-wavelength data be available in advance of the radioobservations and that the radio searches should have assured follow-upresources.

0710.3192	the environment of m85 optical transient 2006-1: constraints on the  progenitor age and mass	m85 optical transient 2006-1 (m85 ot 2006-1) is the most luminous member ofthe small family of v838 mon-like objects, whose nature is still a mystery.this event took place in the virgo cluster of galaxies and peaked at anabsolute magnitude of i~-13. here we present hubble space telescope images ofm85 ot 2006-1 and its environment, taken before and after the eruption, alongwith a spectrum of the host galaxy at the transient location. we find that theprogenitor of m85 ot 2006-1 was not associated with any star forming region.the g and z-band absolute magnitudes of the progenitor were fainter than about-4 and -6 mag, respectively. therefore, we can set a lower limit of ~50 myr onthe age of the youngest stars at the location of the progenitor thatcorresponds to a mass of &lt;7 solar mass. previously published line indicessuggest that m85 has a mean stellar age of 1.6+/-0.3 gyr. if this mean age isrepresentative of the progenitor of m85 ot 2006-1, then we can furtherconstrain its mass to be less than 2 solar mass. we compare the energetics andmass limit derived for the m85 ot 2006-1 progenitor with those expected from asimple model of violent stellar mergers. combined with further modeling, thesenew clues may ultimately reveal the true nature of these puzzling events.

1112.4851	the palomar transient factory photometric calibration	the palomar transient factory (ptf) provides multiple epoch imaging for alarge fraction of the sky. here we describe the photometric calibration of theptf data products that relates the ptf magnitudes to other mag systems. thecalibration process utilizes sdss r~16 mag point source objects as photometricstandards. during photometric conditions, this allows us to solve for theextinction coefficients and color terms, and to estimate the cameraillumination correction. this also enables the calibration of fields that areoutside the sdss footprint. we test the precision and repeatability of the ptfphotometric calibration. given that ptf is observing in a single filter eachnight, we define a ptf calibrated magnitude system for r-band and g-band. weshow that, in this system, 59% (47%) of the photometrically calibrated ptfr-band (g-band) data achieve a photometric precision of 0.02-0.04 mag. giventhe objects' color, the ptf magnitude system can be converted to other systems.a night-by-night comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of individual starsobserved on multiple nights shows that they are consistent to a level of ~0.02mag. most of the data that were taken under non-photometric conditions can becalibrated relative to other epochs of the same sky footprint obtained duringphotometric conditions. we provide a guide describing the use of the ptfphotometric calibration data products, as well as the transformations betweenthe ptf magnitude system and the sdss and johnson-cousins systems.

1205.7040	hubble space telescope studies of low-redshift type ia supernovae:  evolution with redshift and ultraviolet spectral trends	we present an analysis of the maximum light, near ultraviolet (nuv; 2900-5500a) spectra of 32 low redshift (0.001&lt;z&lt;0.08) type ia supernovae (sne ia),obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst). we combine this spectroscopicsample with high-quality gri light curves obtained with robotic telescopes tomeasure photometric parameters, such as stretch, optical colour, andbrightness. by comparing our data to a comparable sample of sne ia atintermediate-z (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9), we detect modest spectral evolution (3-sigma), inthe sense that our mean low-z nuv spectrum has a depressed flux compared to itsintermediate-z counterpart. we also see a strongly increased dispersion aboutthe mean with decreasing wavelength, confirming the results of earlier surveys.these trends are consistent with changes in metallicity as predicted bycontemporary sn ia spectral models. we also examine the properties of variousnuv spectral diagnostics in the individual spectra. we find a generalcorrelation between stretch and the velocity (or position) of many nuv spectralfeatures. in particular, we observe that higher stretch sne have larger ca iih&amp;k velocities, that also correlate with host galaxy stellar mass. this lattertrend is probably driven by the well-established correlation between stretchand stellar mass. we find no trends between uv spectral features and opticalcolour. mean spectra constructed according to whether the sn has a positive ornegative hubble residual show very little difference at nuv wavelengths,indicating that the nuv evolution and variation we identify do not directlycorrelate with hubble residuals. our work confirms and strengthens earlierconclusions regarding the complex behaviour of sne ia in the nuv spectralregion, but suggests the correlations we find are more useful in constrainingprogenitor models than improving the use of sne ia as cosmological probes.

1206.0748	x-ray emission from supernovae in dense circumstellar matter  environments: a search for collisionless shocks	(abridged). the optical light curve of some sne may be powered by the outwarddiffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thickcircumstellar matter (csm). recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediatedand -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into acollisionless shock and can produce hard x-rays. the x-rays are expected topeak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. here we report on asearch, using swift and chandra, for x-ray emission from 28 sne that belong toclasses whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense csm(iin/ibn/slsn-i). two sne in our sample have x-ray properties that are roughlyconsistent with the expectation for x-rays from a collisionless shock inoptically thick csm. therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves arepowered by shock breakout in csm. we show that two other events were too x-raybright during the sn maximum optical light to be explained by the shockbreakout model. we conclude that the light curves of some, but not all,type-iin/ibn sne are powered by shock breakout in csm. for the rest of the snein our sample, including all the slsn-i events, our x-ray limits are not deepenough and were typically obtained at too early times to conclude about theirnature. we argue that the optical light curves of sne, for which the x-rayemission peaks at late times, are likely powered by the diffusion of shockenergy from a dense csm. we comment about the possibility to detect some ofthese events in radio.

1206.1064	the palomar transient factory photometric catalog 1.0	we construct a photometrically calibrated catalog of non-variable sourcesfrom the palomar transient factory (ptf) observations. the first version ofthis catalog presented here, the ptf photometric catalog 1.0, containscalibrated r_ptf-filter magnitudes for about 21 million sources brighter thanmagnitude 19, over an area of about 11233 deg^2. the magnitudes are provided inthe ptf photometric system, and the color of a source is required in order toconvert these magnitudes into other magnitude systems. we estimate that themagnitudes in this catalog have typical accuracy of about 0.02 mag with respectto magnitudes from the sloan digital sky survey. the median repeatability ofour catalog's magnitudes for stars between 15 and 16 mag, is about 0.01 mag,and it is better than 0.03 mag for 95% of the sources in this magnitude range.the main goal of this catalog is to provide reference magnitudes forphotometric calibration of visible light observations. subsequent versions ofthis catalog, which will be published incrementally online, will be extended toa larger sky area and will also include g_ptf-filter magnitudes, as well asvariability and proper motion information.

1303.3894	sn2009ip: constraints on the progenitor mass-loss rate	some supernovae (sne) show evidence for mass-loss events taking place priorto their explosions. measuring their pre-outburst mass-loss rates provideessential information regarding the mechanisms that are responsible for theseevents. here we present xmm-newton and swift x-ray observations taken after thelatest, and presumably the final, outburst of sn 2009ip. we use theseobservations as well as new near infra-red and visible light spectra, andpublished radio and visible light observations to put six independentorder-of-magnitude constrains on the mass-loss rate of the sn progenitor priorto the explosion. our methods utilize: the x-ray luminosity, the bound-freeabsorption, the h alpha luminosity, the sn rise-time, free-free absorption, andthe bolometric luminosity of the outburst detected prior to the explosion.assuming spherical mass-loss with a wind density profile, we estimate that theeffective mass-loss rate from the progenitor was between 10^-3 to 10^-2 solarmasses per year, over a few years prior to the explosion, with a velocity of~1000 km/s. this mass-loss rate corresponds to a total circum stellar mattermass of ~0.04 solar masses, within 6x10^15 cm of the sn. we note that themass-loss rate estimate based on the h alpha luminosity is higher by an orderof magnitude. this can be explained if the narrow line h alpha component isgenerated at radii larger than the shock radius, or if the csm has anaspherical geometry. we discuss simple geometries which are consistent with ourresults.

1303.6194	science with a wide-field uv transient explorer	the time-variable electromagnetic sky has been well-explored at a wide rangeof wavelengths. numerous high-energy space missions take advantage of the darkgamma-ray and x-ray sky and utilize very wide field detectors to provide almostcontinuous monitoring of the entire celestial sphere. in visible light, newwide-field ground-based surveys cover wide patches of sky with ever decreasingcadence, progressing from monthly-weekly time scale surveys to sub-nightsampling. in the radio, new powerful instrumentation offers unprecedentedsensitivity over wide fields of view, with pathfinder experiments for even moreambitious programs underway. in contrast, the ultra-violet (uv) variable sky isrelatively poorly explored, even though it offers exciting scientificprospects. here, we review the potential scientific impact of a wide-field uvsurvey on the study of explosive and other transient events, as well as knownclasses of variable objects, such as active galactic nuclei and variable stars.we quantify our predictions using a fiducial set of observational parameterswhich are similar to those envisaged for the proposed ultrasat mission. we showthat such a mission would be able to revolutionize our knowledge about massivestar explosions by measuring the early uv emission from hundreds of events,revealing key physical parameters of the exploding progenitor stars. such amission would also detect the uv emission from many tens of tidal-disruptionevents of stars by super massive black holes at galactic nuclei and enable ameasurement of the rate of such events. the overlap of such a wide-field uvmission with existing and planned gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrinotelescopes makes it especially timely.

1303.6282	sensitive search for radio variables and transients in the extended  chandra deep-field south	we report on an analysis of the extended chandra deep field south (e-cdfs)region using archival data from the very large array, with the goal of studyingradio variability and transients at the sub-mjy level. the 49 epochs of e-cdfsobservations at 1.4 ghz sample timescales from one day to 3 months. we findthat only a fraction (1%) of unresolved radio sources above 40 ujy are variableat the 4-sigma level. there is no evidence that the fractional variabilitychanges along with the known transition of radio source populations below onemillijansky. optical identifications of the sources show that the variableradio emission is associated with the central regions of an active galacticnucleus or a star-forming galaxy. after a detailed comparison of the efficacyof various source-finding algorithms, we use the best to carry out a transientsearch. no transients were found. this implies that the areal density oftransients with peak flux density greater than 0.21 mjy is less than 0.37deg^-2 (at a confidence level of 95%). this result is approximately an order ofmagnitude below the transient rate measured at 5 ghz by bower et al. (2007) butit is consistent with more recent upper limits from frail et al.

1402.4766	giant sparks at cosmological distances?	millisecond duration bright radio pulses at 1.4-ghz with high dispersionmeasures (dm) were reported by lorimer et al., keane et al., and thornton etal. their all-sky rate is $\approx 10^4$/day above $\sim$1 jy. related eventsare "perytons" -- similar pulsed, dispersed sources, but most certainly local.suggested models of fast radio bursts (frbs) can originate in the earth'satmosphere, in stellar coronae, in other galaxies, and even at cosmologicaldistances. using physically motivated assumptions combined with observedproperties, we explore these models. in our analysis, we focus on the lorimerevent: a 30 jy, 5-ms duration burst with dm$=$ 375 cm$^{-3}$ pc, exhibiting asteep frequency-dependent pulse width (the {\it sparker}). to be complete, wedrop the assumption that high dms are produced by plasma propagation and assumethat the source produces pulses with frequency-dependent arrival time ("chirpedsignals"). within this framework we explore a scenario in which perytons, the{\it sparker}, and the frbs are all atmospheric phenomenon occurring atdifferent heights. this model is {\it ad hoc} in that we cannot explain whyperytons at higher altitudes show greater dms or exhibit narrower pulses.nonetheless, we argue the {\it sparker} may be a peryton. we end with tworemarks. first, the detection of a single frb by an interferometer with akilometer (or longer) baseline will prove that frbs are of extra-terrestrialorigin. second, we urge astronomers to pursue observations and understanding ofperytons since they form (at least) a formidable foreground for the frbs.

1404.4085	interaction-powered supernovae: rise-time vs. peak-luminosity  correlation and the shock-breakout velocity	interaction of supernova (sn) ejecta with the optically thick circumstellarmedium (csm) of a progenitor star can result in a bright, long-lived shockbreakout event. candidates for such sne include type iin and superluminous sne.if some of these sne are powered by interaction, then there should be arelation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, andshock-breakout velocity. given that the shock velocity during shock breakout isnot measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between therise time and the peak luminosity of these sne. here, we present a sample of 15sne iin for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peakluminosity from observations obtained using the palomar transient factory. wereport on a possible correlation between the r-band rise time and peakluminosity of these sne, with a false-alarm probability of 3%. assuming thatthese sne are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theoryallows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. the lowerlimits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected forsne (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). this supports the suggestion that the early-time lightcurves of sne iin are caused by shock breakout in a dense csm. we note thatsuch a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. performing such atest on other classes of sne (e.g., superluminous sne) can be used to rule outthe interaction model for a class of events.

1406.7640	a wolf-rayet-like progenitor of supernova sn 2013cu from spectral  observations of a wind	the explosive fate of massive stripped wolf-rayet (w-r) stars is a key openquestion in stellar physics. an appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient w-rstars are the progenitors of some h-poor supernova (sn) explosions of typesiib, ib, and ic. a blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent withthose of some w-r stars, has been recently identified at the location of asn~ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined tohave been the progenitor. similar previous works have so far only resulted innondetections. comparison of early photometric observations of type icsupernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii&lt;10^12 cm, as expected for some w-r stars. however, the hallmark signature ofw-r stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. here,we report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum ofsn 2013cu (iptf13ast; type iib) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion ("flashspectroscopy"). we identify w-r-like wind signatures suggesting a progenitor ofthe wn(h) subclass. the extent of this dense wind may indicate increased massloss from the progenitor shortly prior to its explosion, consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

1407.1835	stacking the invisibles: a guided search for low-luminosity milky way  satellites	almost every known low-luminosity milky way dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellitegalaxy contains at least one rr lyrae star. assuming that a fraction of distant(60 &lt; d_{helio} &lt; 100 kpc) galactic halo rr lyrae stars are members of yet tobe discovered low-luminosity dsph galaxies, we perform a {\em guided} searchfor these low-luminosity dsph galaxies. in order to detect the presence of dsphgalaxies, we combine stars selected from more than 123 sightlines centered onrr lyrae stars identified by the palomar transient factory. we find that thismethod is sensitive enough to detect the presence of segue 1-like galaxies(m_v= -1.5^{+0.6}_{-0.8}, r_h=30 pc) even if only ~20 sightlines were occupiedby such dsph galaxies. yet, when our method is applied to the sdss dr10 imagingcatalog, no signal is detected. an application of our method to sightlinesoccupied by pairs of close (&lt;200 pc) horizontal branch stars, also did notyield a detection. thus, we place upper limits on the number of low-luminositydsph galaxies with half-light radii from 30 pc to 120 pc, and in the probedvolume of the halo. stronger constraints on the luminosity function may beobtained by applying our method to sightlines centered on rr lyrae starsselected from the pan-starrs1 survey, and eventually, from lsst. in theappendix, we present spectroscopic observations of an rrab star in thebo\"{o}tes 3 dsph and a light curve of an rrab star near the bo\"{o}tes 2 dsph.

1412.0342	a real-time fast radio burst: polarization detection and multiwavelength  follow-up	fast radio bursts (frbs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of theradio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapidmultiwavelength follow-up of an frb has been possible. new instrumentation hasdecreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, andenables polarimetry to be performed on frbs for the first time. we havediscovered an frb (frb 140514) in real-time on 14 may, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 utcat the parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengthswithin hours of the event. frb 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (dm)of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z\lesssim 0.5$. frb 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularlypolarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linearpolarization $&lt;10%$. we conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to thefrb. if there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected fromcoherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by faraday rotation causedby passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. frb140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known frb fields, andlies close to a previous discovery, frb 110220; based on the difference in dmsof these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity tosampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. follow-up conductedby 12 telescopes observing from x-ray to radio wavelengths was unable toidentify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out modelsin which frbs originate from nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) supernovae and long durationgamma-ray bursts.

1501.07535	fast transients at cosmological distances with the ska	impulsive radio bursts that are detectable across cosmological distancesconstitute extremely powerful probes of the ionized inter-galactic medium(igm), intergalactic magnetic fields, and the properties of space-time itself.their dispersion measures (dms) will enable us to detect the "missing" baryonsin the low-redshift universe and make the first measurements of the mean galaxyhalo profile, a key parameter in models of galaxy formation and feedback.impulsive bursts can be used as cosmic rulers at redshifts exceeding 2, andconstrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$ at redshiftsbeyond those readily accessible by type ia sne. both of these goals arerealisable with a sample of $\sim 10^4$ fast radio bursts (frbs) whosepositions are localized to within one arcsecond, sufficient to obtain hostgalaxy redshifts via optical follow-up. it is also hypothesised thatgravitational wave events may emit coherent emission at frequencies probed byska1-low, and the localization of such events at cosmological distances wouldenable their use as cosmological standard sirens.  to perform this science, such bursts must be localized to their specific hostgalaxies so that their redshifts may be obtained and compared against theirdispersion measures, rotation measures, and scattering properties. the ska canachieve this with a design that has a wide field-of-view, a substantialfraction of its collecting area in a compact configuration (80\% within a 3\,kmradius), and a capacity to attach high-time-resolution instrumentation to itssignal path.

1503.02293	strong near-infrared carbon in the type ia supernova iptf13ebh	we present near-infrared (nir) time-series spectroscopy, as well ascomplementary ultraviolet (uv), optical, and nir data, of the type ia supernova(sn ia) iptf13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated timeof explosion. the first nir spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosionand may be the earliest nir spectrum yet obtained of a sn ia. the most strikingfeatures in the spectrum are several nir c i lines, and the c i {\lambda}1.0693{\mu}m line is the strongest ever observed in a sn ia. interestingly, no strongoptical c ii counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopictime series began early and is densely-cadenced. except at the very earlyepochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strongnir c i compared to the weaker optical c ii appears to be general in sne ia.iptf13ebh is a fast decliner with {\delta}m15(b) = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.01, and itsabsolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. itis therefore categorized as a "transitional" event, on the fast-declining endof normal sne ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iptf13ebh showsnir spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal andsubluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the twoclasses. these nir observations suggest composition and density of the innercore similar to that of 91bg-like events, and a deep reaching carbon burninglayer not observed in slower declining sne ia. there is also a substantialdifference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curveand the velocity evolution of the si ii {\lambda}0.6355 {\mu}m line, implying along dark phase of ~ 4 days.

1511.09137	the arecibo fast radio burst: dense circum-burst medium	the nature of fast radio bursts (frb) has been extensively debated. here weinvestigate frb121102, detected at arecibo telescope and remarkable for itsunusually large spectral index. after extensive study we conclude that thespectral index is caused by a nebula with free-free absorption. we find thatputative nebula must lie beyond the milky way. we conclude that frbs are ofextra-galactic origin and that they arise in dense star-forming regions. thechallenge with extra-galactic models is the the high volumetric rate of frbs.this high rate allows us to eliminate all models of catastrophic stellardeaths. hyper-giant flares from young magnetars emerge as the most likelyprogenitors. some of the consequences are: (i) intergalactic frb models can besafely ignored. (ii) the rich ism environment of young magnetars can result insignificant contribution to dm, rotation measure (rm) and in some cases tosignificant free-free optical depth. (iii) the star-forming regions in the hostgalaxies can contribute significantly to the dm. including this contributionreduces the inferred distances to frbs and correspondingly increases thevolumetric rate of frbs (and, in turn, may require that giant flares can alsoproduce frbs). (iv) frbs are likely to be suppressed at lower frequencies.conversely, searching for frbs at higher frequencies (2-5 ghz) would beattractive. (v) the blast wave which produces the radio emission can undergorapid deceleration if the circum-burst medium is dense (as maybe the case forfrb121102), leading to x-ray, radio and possibly gamma-ray emission. (vi)galaxies with high star formation rate host will have a higher frb rate.however, such frbs will have differing dms owing to differing localcontributions. (vi) the dm and rm of frbs will prove to be noisy probes of theintergalactic medium (density, magnetic field) and cosmography.

1512.00846	flash spectroscopy: emission lines from the ionized circumstellar  material around $&lt;10$-day-old type ii supernovae	supernovae (sne) embedded in dense circumstellar material (csm) may showprominent emission lines in their early-time spectra ($\leq 10$ days after theexplosion), owing to recombination of the csm ionized by the shock-breakoutflash. from such spectra ("flash spectroscopy"), we can measure variousphysical properties of the csm, as well as the mass-loss rate of the progenitorduring the year prior to its explosion. searching through the palomar transientfactory (ptf and iptf) sn spectroscopy databases from 2009 through 2014, wefound 12 type ii sne showing flash-ionized (fi) signatures in their firstspectra. all are younger than 10 days. these events constitute 14\% of all 84sne in our sample having a spectrum within 10 days from explosion, and 18\% ofsne~ii observed at ages $&lt;5$ days, thereby setting lower limits on the fractionof fi events. we classified as "blue/featureless" (bf) those events having afirst spectrum which is similar to that of a black body, without any emissionor absorption signatures. it is possible that some bf events had fi signaturesat an earlier phase than observed, or that they lack dense csm around theprogenitor. within 2 days after explosion, 8 out of 11 sne in our sample areeither bf events or show fi signatures. interestingly, we found that 19 out of21 sne brighter than an absolute magnitude $m_r=-18.2$ belong to the fi or bfgroups, and that all fi events peaked above $m_r=-17.6$ mag, significantlybrighter than average sne~ii.

astro-ph;0101230	a survey for large separation lensed first quasars	little is known about the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars atlarge (7''-30'') image separations, which probe masses on the scale of galaxyclusters. we have carried out a survey for gravitationally-lensed objects,among sources in the first 20cm radio survey that have unresolved opticalcounterparts in the digitizations of the palomar observatory sky survey. fromthe statistics of ongoing surveys that search for quasars among first sources,we estimate that there are about 9100 quasars in this source sample, makingthis one of the largest lensing surveys to date. using broad-band imaging, wehave isolated all objects with double radio components separated by 5''-30'',that have unresolved optical counterparts with similar bvi colours. ourcriteria for similar colours conservatively allow for observational error andfor colour variations due to time delays between lensed images. spectroscopy ofthese candidates shows that none of the pairs are lensed quasars. this sets anupper limit (95% confidence) on the lensing fraction in this survey of3.3x10^-4, assuming 9100 quasars. although the source redshift distribution ispoorly known, a rough calculation of the expected lensing frequency and thedetection efficiencies and biases suggests that simple theoretical expectationsare of the same order of magnitude as our observational upper limit. ourprocedure is novel in that our exhaustive search for lensed objects does notrequire prior identification of the quasars in the sample as such.characterization of the first-selected quasar population will enable using ourresult to constrain quantitatively the mass properties of clusters.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

astro-ph;0607513	a time delay for the largest gravitationally lensed quasar: sdss  j1004+4112	we present 426 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 1000 days fromdecember 2003 to june 2006 for the gravitationally lensed quasar sdssj1004+4112. the time delay between the a and b images is 38.4+/-2.0 days in theexpected sense that b leads a and the overall time ordering is c-b-a-d-e. themeasured delay invalidates all published models. the models failed because theyneglected the perturbations from cluster member galaxies. models including thegalaxies can fit the data well, but strong conclusions about the cluster massdistribution should await the measurement of the longer, and less substructuresensitive, delays of the c and d images. for these images, a cb delay of681+/-15 days is plausible but requires confirmation, while cb and ad delays of&gt;560 days and &gt; 800 days are required. we clearly detect microlensing of thea/b images, with the delay-corrected flux ratios changing from b-a=0.44+/-0.01mag in the first season to 0.29+/-0.01 mag in the second season and 0.32+/-0.01mag in the third season.

astro-ph;0608183	multi-wavelength observations of grb 050820a: an exceptionally energetic  event followed from start to finish	we present observations of the unusually bright and long gamma-ray burst grb050820a, one of the best-sampled broadband data sets in the swift era. thegamma-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before themain event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to aphysical mechanism distinct from the grb itself. the large time lag between theprecursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in thegamma-ray, x-ray, and optical band-passes, something only achieved for ahandful of events to date. while the contemporaneous x-rays are the low-energytail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the gamma-rayflux. instead, the early-time optical data appear mostly consistent with theforward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical, and are thereforelikely the beginning of the afterglow. on hour time scales after the burst, thex-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion ofthe shock into the surrounding region, but rather indicate that there is aperiod of energy injection. observations at late times allow us to constrainthe collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to theta = 6.8 - 9.3 degrees.our estimates of both the kinetic energy of the afterglow and the promptgamma-ray energy release make grb 050820a one of the most energetic events forwhich such values could be determined.

astro-ph;0609582	the short-hard grb 051103: observations and implications for its nature	the bright short-hard grb 051103 was triangulated by the inter-planetarynetwork and found to occur in the direction of the nearby m81/m82 galaxy group.given its possible local-universe nature, we searched for an afterglowassociated with this burst. we observed the entire 3-sigma error quadrilateralusing the palomar 60-inch robotic telescope and the very large array (vla)about three days after the burst. we used the optical and radio observations toconstrain the flux of any afterglow related to this burst, and to show thatthis burst is not associated with a typical supernova out to z~0.15. ouroptical and radio observations, along with the konus/wind gamma-ray energy andlight curve are consistent with this burst being a giant flare of a softgamma-ray repeater (sgr) within the m81 galaxy group. furthermore, we find astar forming region associated with m81 within the error quadrilateral of thisburst which supports the sgr hypothesis. if confirmed, this will be the firstcase of a soft gamma-ray repeater outside the local group.

astro-ph;0611933	the incidence of dwarf novae in large area transient searches	understanding and quantifying the contribution of known classes of transientand variable sources is an important lesson to be learned from the manifold ofpre-cursors programs of the near-future large synoptic sky survey programs likeskymapper, pan-starrs and lsst. with this goal in mind, we undertookphotometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of three recently reportedunidentified transients. for two sources, wfi j132813.7-214237 and wfij161953.3+031909, we show that unfortunate coincidences lead to their previousdesignation as transients. while the former is now interpreted as the spatialcoincidence of a solar system object with faint background star, the latter ismerely a cataclysmic variable unfortunately caught in and out of eclipse. thethird candidate, rotse3 j160213.1-021311.7 is identified as an su uma-typedwarf novae with quiescent brightness of r~22.7 and an outburst amplitude ofabout 5 mag. the fourth event, sdss-sn15207, similarly shows evidence for adwarf nova origin. our main conclusion is that cataclysmic variables in theirvarious avata rs will contribute moderately to the population of transientobjects.

astro-ph;0612408	sn 2006gy: an extremely luminous supernova in the galaxy ngc 1260	with an extinction-corrected v-band peak absolute magnitude of about -22,supernova (sn) 2006gy is probably the brightest sn ever observed. we report onmulti-wavelength observations of this sn and its environment. our spectroscopyshows an h alpha emission line as well as absorption features which may beidentified as siii lines at low expansion velocity. the high peak luminosity,the slow rise to maximum, and the narrow h alpha line are similar to thoseobserved in hybrid type-ia/iin (also called iia) sne. the host galaxy, ngc1260, is dominated by an old stellar population with solar metallicity.however, our high resolution adaptive optics images reveal a dust lane in thisgalaxy, and there appears to be an hii region in the vicinity of the sn. theextra-ordinarily large peak luminosity, ~3x10^44 erg/s, demands a densecircum-stellar medium, regardless of the mass of the progenitor star. theinferred mass loss rate of the progenitor is ~0.1 solar mass per year over aperiod of ~10 yr prior to explosion. such an high mass-loss rate may be theresult of a binary star common envelope ejection. the total radiated energy inthe first two months is about 1.1x10^51 erg, which is only a factor of two lessthan that available from a super-chandrasekhar ia explosion. therefore, giventhe presence of a star forming region in the vicinity of the sn and the highenergy requirements, a plausible scenario is that sn 2006gy is related to thedeath of a massive star (e.g., pair production sn).

astro-ph;0703192	grb 060505: a possible short-duration gamma-ray burst in a star forming  region at redshift of 0.09	on 2006 may 5, a four second duration, low energy, ~10^49 erg, gamma-rayburst (grb) was observed, spatially associated with a z=0.0894 galaxy. here, wereport the discovery of the grb optical afterglow and observations of itsenvironment using gemini-south, hubble space telescope (hst), chandra, swiftand the very large array. the optical afterglow of this grb is spatiallyassociated with a prominent star forming region in the sc-type galaxy 2dfgrss173z112. its proximity to a star forming region suggests that the progenitordelay time, from birth to explosion, is smaller than about 10 myr. our hst deepimaging rules out the presence of a supernova brighter than an absolutemagnitude of about -11 (or -12.6 in case of ``maximal'' extinction) at abouttwo weeks after the burst, and limits the ejected mass of radioactive nickel 56to be less than about 2x10^-4 solar mass (assuming no extinction). although itwas suggested that grb 060505 may belong to a new class of long-duration grbswith no supernova, we argue that the simplest interpretation is that thephysical mechanism responsible for this burst is the same as for short-durationgrbs.

astro-ph;9611129	permanent superhumps in v1974 cyg	we present results of 32 nights of ccd photometry of v1974 cygni, from theyears 1994 and 1995. we verify the presence of two distinct periodicities inthe light curve: 0.0812585 day~1.95 hours and 0.0849767 d~2.04 hr. we establishthat the shorter periodicity is the orbital period of the underlying binarysystem. the longer period oscillates with an average value of |dot(p)| ~3x10^(7)--typical to permanent superhumps. the two periods obey the linearrelation between the orbital and superhump periods that holds among members ofthe su ursae majoris class of dwarf novae. a third periodicity of 0.083204d~2.00 hr appeared in 1994 but not in 1995. it may be related to the recentlydiscovered anti-superhump phenomenon. these results suggest a linkage betweenthe classical nova v1974 cyg and the su uma stars, and indicate the existenceof an accretion disk and permanent superhumps in the system no later than 30months after the nova outburst. from the precessing disk model of the superhumpphenomenon we estimate that the mass ratio in the binary system is between 2.2and 3.6. combined with previous results this implies a white dwarf mass of0.75-1.07 m sun.

0809.4270	calibrated griz magnitudes of tycho stars: all-sky photometric  calibration using bright stars	photometric calibration to 5% accuracy is frequently needed at arbitrarycelestial locations; however, existing all-sky astronomical catalogs do notreach this accuracy and time consuming photometric calibration procedures arerequired. i fit the hipparcos b_t and v_t magnitudes along with the 2mass j, h,and k magnitudes of tycho-2 catalog-stars with stellar spectral templates. fromthe best fit spectral template derived for each star, i calculate the syntheticsdss griz magnitudes and constructed an all-sky catalog of griz magnitudes forbright stars (v&lt;12). testing this method on sdss photometric telescopeobservations, i find that the photometric accuracy for a single star is usuallyabout 0.12, 0.12, 0.10 and 0.08 mag (1 sigma), for the g, r, i, and z-bands,respectively. however, by using ~10 such stars, the typical errors percalibrated field (systematic + statistical) can be reduced to about 0.04, 0.03,0.02, and 0.02,mag, in the g, r, i, and z-bands, respectively. therefore, incases for which several calibration stars can be observed in the field of viewof an instrument, accurate photometric calibration is possible.
