0706.1535	the initial conditions of star formation in the ophiuchus main cloud:  kinematics of the protocluster condensations	the earliest phases of clustered star formation and the origin of the stellarinitial mass function (imf) are currently much debated. in order to constrainthe origin of the imf, we investigated the internal and relative motions ofstarless condensations and protostars previously detected by us in the dustcontinuum at 1.2mm in the l1688 protocluster of the ophiuchus molecular cloudcomplex. the starless condensations have a mass spectrum resembling the imf andare therefore likely representative of the initial stages of star formation inthe protocluster. we carried out detailed molecular line observations,including some n2h+(1-0) mapping, of the ophiuchus protocluster condensationsusing the iram 30m telescope. we measured subsonic or at most transonic levelsof internal turbulence within the condensations, implying virial masses whichgenerally agree within a factor of ~ 2 with the masses derived from the 1.2mmdust continuum. this supports the notion that most of the l1688 starlesscondensations are gravitationally bound and prestellar in nature. we measured aglobal one-dimensional velocity dispersion of less than 0.4 km/s betweencondensations. this small relative velocity dispersion implies that, ingeneral, the condensations do not have time to interact with one another beforeevolving into pre-main sequence objects. our observations support the view thatthe imf is partly determined by cloud fragmentation at the prestellar stage.competitive accretion is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism at theprotostellar stage in the ophiuchus protocluster, but it may possibly governthe growth of starless, self-gravitating condensations initially produced bygravoturbulent fragmentation toward an imf, salpeter-like mass spectrum.

0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

0909.2315	fragmentation and mass segregation in the massive dense cores of cygnus  x	we present plateau de bure interferometer observations obtained in continuumat 1.3 and 3.5 mm towards the six most massive and young (ir-quiet) dense coresin cygnus x. located at only 1.7 kpc, the cygnus x region offers theopportunity of reaching small enough scales (of the order of 1700 au at 1.3 mm)to separate individual collapsing objects. the cores are sub-fragmented with atotal of 23 fragments inside 5 cores. only the most compact core, cygx-n63,could actually be a single massive protostar with an envelope mass as large as60 msun. the fragments in the other cores have sizes and separations similar tolow-mass pre-stellar and proto-stellar condensations in nearby protoclusters,and are probably of the same nature. a total of 9 out of these 23 protostellarobjects are found to be probable precursors of ob stars with envelope massesranging from 6 to 23 msun. the level of fragmentation is globally higher thanin the turbulence regulated, monolithic collapse scenario, but is not as highas expected in a pure gravo-turbulent scenario where the distribution of massis dominated by low-mass protostars/stars. here, the fractions of the totalcore masses in the high-mass fragments are reaching values as high as 28, 44,and 100 % in cygx-n12, cygx-n53, and cygx-n63, respectively, much higher thanwhat an imf-like mass distribution would predict. the increase of thefragmentation efficiency as a function of density in the cores is proposed tobe due to the increasing importance of self-gravity leading to gravitationalcollapse at the scale of the dense cores. at the same time, the cores tend tofragment into a few massive protostars within their central regions. we aretherefore probably witnessing here the primordial mass segregation of clustersin formation.

1001.2453	the link between molecular cloud structure and turbulence	we aim to better understand how the spatial structure of molecular clouds isgoverned by turbulence. for that, we study the large-scale spatial distributionof low density molecular gas and search for characteristic length scales. weemploy a 35 square degrees 13co 1-0 molecular line survey of cygnus x andvisual extinction (a_v) maps of 17 galactic clouds to analyse the spatialstructure using the delta-variance method. this sample contains a large varietyof different molecular cloud types with different star forming activity. thedelta-variance spectra obtained from the a_v maps show differences betweenlow-mass star-forming (sf) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (gmc) interms of shape of the spectrum and its power-law exponent beta. low-mass sfclouds have a double-peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc(though with a large scatter around this value) and 4 pc. gmcs show nocharacteristic scale in the a_v-maps, which can partly be ascribed to adistance effect due to a larger line-of-sight (los) confusion. thedelta-variance for cygnus, determined from the 13co survey, showscharacteristic scales at 4 pc and 40 pc, either reflecting the filamentstructure and large-scale turbulence forcing or - for the 4 pc scale - thescale below which the 13co 1-0 line becomes optically thick. though there aredifferent processes that can introduce characteristic scales, i.e. geometry,decaying turbulence the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence(the sonic scale), line-of-sight effects and energy injection due to expandingsupernova shells, outflows, hii-regions, and the relative contribution of theseeffects strongly varies from cloud to cloud, it is remarkable that theresulting turbulent structure of molecular clouds shows similarcharacteristics.

1001.3691	toward understanding the formation of multiple systems - a pilot  iram-pdbi survey of class 0 objects	the formation process of binary stars and multiple systems is poorlyunderstood. here, we seek to determine the typical outcome of protostellarcollapse and to constrain models of binary formation by core fragmentationduring collapse, using high-resolution millimeter continuum imaging of veryyoung (class 0) protostars observed at the beginning of the main accretionphase. we carried out a pilot high-resolution study of 5 class 0 objects, usingthe most extended (a) configuration of the iram pdbi at 1.3 mm, which allow usto probe the multiplicity of class 0 protostars down to separations a ~50 auand circumstellar mass ratios q ~0.07. we show that our pdbi observationsrevealed only wide (&gt;1500 au) protobinary systems and/or outflow-generatedfeatures. when combined with previous millimeter interferometric observationsof class 0 protostars, our pilot pdbi study tentatively suggests that thebinary fraction in the ~ 75-1000 au range increases from the class 0 to theclass i stage. it also seems to argue against purely hydrodynamic models ofbinary star formation. we briefly discuss possible alternative scenarios toreconcile the low multiplicity rate of class 0 protostars on small scales withthe higher binary fraction observed at later evolutionary stages.

1003.4198	dynamic star formation in the massive dr21 filament	the formation of massive stars is a highly complex process in which it is notclear whether the star-forming gas is in global gravitational collapse or in anequilibrium state, supported by turbulence. by studying one of the most massiveand dense star-forming regions in the galaxy at a distance of less than 3 kpc,the filament containing the well-known sources dr21 and dr21(oh), we expect tofind observational signatures that allow to discriminate between the two views.we use molecular line data from our 13co 1-0, cs 2-1, and n2h+ 1-0 survey ofthe cygnus x region obtained with the fcrao and high-angular resolutionobservations of co, cs, hco+, n2h+, and h2co, obtained with the iram 30mtelescope. we observe a complex velocity field and velocity dispersion in thedr21 filament in which regions of highest column-density, i.e. dense cores,have a lower velocity dispersion than the surrounding gas and velocitygradients that are not (only) due to rotation. infall signatures in opticallythick line profiles of hco+ and 12co are observed along and across the wholedr21 filament. from modelling the observed spectra, we obtain a typical infallspeed of 0.6 km/s and mass accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-3 msun/yrfor the two main clumps constituting the filament. these massive (4900 and 3300msun) clumps are both gravitationally contracting. all observed kinematicfeatures in the dr21 filament can be explained if it is formed by theconvergence of flows at large scales and is now in a state of globalgravitational collapse. whether this convergence of flows originated fromself-gravity at larger scales or from other processes can not be settled withthe present study. the observed velocity field and velocity dispersion areconsistent with results from (magneto)-hydrodynamic simulations where the coreslie at the stagnation points of convergent turbulent flows.

1005.1506	mapping the column density and dust temperature structure of irdcs with  herschel	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold and dense reservoirs of gas potentiallyavailable to form stars. many of these clouds are likely to be pristinestructures representing the initial conditions for star formation. the studypresented here aims to construct and analyze accurate column density and dusttemperature maps of irdcs by using the first herschel data from the hi-galgalactic plane survey. these fundamental quantities, are essential forunderstanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of theformation of stars in molecular clouds. we have developed a simplepixel-by-pixel sed fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.by fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatialvariations in both the dust column density and temperature within the irdcs.this method is applied to a sample of 22 irdcs exhibiting a range of angularsizes and peak column densities. our analysis shows that the dust temperaturedecreases significantly within irdcs, from background temperatures of 20-30 kto minimum temperatures of 8-15 k within the clouds, showing that densemolecular clouds are not isothermal. temperature gradients have most likely animportant impact on the fragmentation of irdcs. local temperature minima arestrongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach nh2 =1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellarcores. applying this technique to the full hi-gal data set will provideimportant constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of irdcs, andhelp identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.

1005.1565	the physical properties of the dust in the rcw 120 hii region as seen by  herschel	context. rcw 120 is a well-studied, nearby galactic hii region with ongoingstar formation in its surroundings. previous work has shown that it displays abubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer ofcollected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. given the well-definedphoto-dissociation region (pdr) boundary and collected layer, it is anexcellent laboratory to study the "collect and collapse" process of triggeredstar formation. using herschel space observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 micron, in combination with spitzer and apex-laboca data, we can forthe first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an hii region athigh angular resolution. aims. we seek a better understanding of rcw120 and itslocal environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. additionally,we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to thedust temperature. methods. we determine dust temperatures in selected regionsof the rcw 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (sed),derived using aperture photometry. additionally, we fit the sed extracted froma grid of positions to create a temperature map. results. we find a gradient indust temperature, ranging from &gt;30 k in the interior of rcw 120, to ~20k forthe material collected in the pdr, to ~10k toward local infrared dark cloudsand cold filaments. our results suggest that rcw 120 is in the process ofdestroying the pdr delineating its bubble morphology. the leaked radiation fromits interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. wefind support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,in rough agreement with what has been found previously. the extended wavelengthcoverage of the herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

1005.1615	star formation triggered by the galactic hii region rcw 120: first  results from the herschel space observatory	by means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of hii regions canpromote the formation of new stars of all masses. rcw 120 is a nearby galactichii region where triggered star formation occurs. this region is well-studied -there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. however, it issurrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtainan unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establishwhether very young protostars are present. we attempt to identify all youngstellar objects (ysos), especially those previously undetected at shorterwavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into thestar formation history in this region. we use herschel-pacs and -spire imagesto determine the distribution of ysos observed in the field. we use a spectralenergy distribution fitting tool to derive the ysos physical properties.herschel-pacs and -spire images confirm the existence of a young source andallow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 msun) class 0 object(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massivecondensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. this source was notdetected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the mispgal 70 micron data.several other red sources are detected at herschel wavelengths and coincidewith the peaks of the millimeter condensations. sed fitting results for thebrightest herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive class 0 thatforms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around rcw 120. theysos observed on the borders of rcw 120 are younger than its ionizing star,which has an age of about 2.5 myr.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1009.0598	gas dynamics in massive dense cores in cygnus-x	we study the kinematic properties of dense gas surrounding massive protostarsrecognized by bontemps et a. (2010) in a sample of five massive dense cores incygnus-x. we investigate whether turbulent support plays a major role instabilizing the core against fragmentation into jeans-mass objects oralternatively, the observed kinematics could indicate a high level of dynamics.we present iram 30m single-dish (hco+ and h13co+) and iram pdbi highangular-resolution observations of dense gas tracers (h13co+ and h13cn) toreveal the kinematics of molecular gas at scales from 0.03 to 0.1 pc. radiativetransfer modeling shows that h13co+ is depleted within the envelopes of massiveprotostars and traces the bulk of material surrounding the protostars ratherthan their inner envelopes. h13cn shows a better correspondence with the peakof the continuum emission, possibly due to abundance anomalies and specificchemistry in the close vicinity of massive protostars. analyzing theline-widths we show that the observed line-dispersion of h13co+ at the scale ofmdcs is smaller than expected from the quasi-static, turbulent-core model. atlarge-scales, global organized bulk motions are identified for 3 of the mdcs.at small-scales, several spectral components are identified in all mdcs showingfilamentary structures and intrinsic velocity gradients towards the continuumpeaks. the dynamics of these flows show diversity among the sample and we linkthis to the specific fragmentation properties of the mdcs. no clear evidence isfound for a turbulence regulated, equilibrium scenario within the sample ofmdcs. we propose a picture in which mdcs are not in equilibrium and theirdynamics is governed by small-scale converging flows, which may initiatestar-formation via their shears.

1102.3460	w43: the closest molecular complex of the galactic bar?	we used a large database extracted from galaxy-wide surveys of h {\scriptsizei}, $^{13}$co 1-0, $8 \micron$ and $870 \micron$ continuum to trace diffuseatomic gas, low- to medium-density molecular gas, high-density molecular gas,and star formation activity which we complemented by dedicated $^{12}$co 2--1,3--2 observations of the w43 region. from the detailed 3d(space-space-velocity) analysis of the molecular and atomic cloud tracersthrough the region and despite its wide velocity range (\emph{fwhm}$\sim22.3\kms$ around $\vlsr\sim 95.9 \kms$), we identified w43 as a large (equivalentdiameter $\sim 140$ pc) and coherent complex of molecular clouds which issurrounded by an atomic gas envelope (equivalent diameter $\sim 290$ pc). wemeasured the total mass of this newly-identified molecular complex ($m_{{\tinytotal}}\sim 7.1 \times 10^6 \msun$), the mass contained in dense $870 \micron$clumps ($&lt;5$ pc dense cloud structures, $m_{{\tiny clumps}}\sim 8.4 \times 10^5\msun$) and conclude that w43 is particularly massive and concentrated. thedistance we assume for the w43 complex is 6 kpc from the sun, which may placeit at the meeting point of the scutum-centaurus (or scutum-crux) galactic armand the bar, a dynamically complex region where high-velocity streams couldeasily collide. the star formation rate of w43 is suggested not to be steadybut it is increasing from $\, \sim 0.01 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its$8\,\mu$m luminosity) to $\sim 0.1 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from itsmolecular content). from the global properties of w43, we claim it is anextreme molecular complex in the milky way and it could even be formingstarburst clusters in the near future.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

1111.7021	herschel observations of a potential core forming clump: perseus b1-e	we present continuum observations of the perseus b1-e region from theherschel gould belt survey. these herschel data reveal a loose grouping ofsubstructures at 160 - 500 micron not seen in previous submillimetreobservations. we measure temperature and column density from these data andselect the nine densest and coolest substructures for follow-up spectral lineobservations with the green bank telescope. we find that the b1-e clump has amass of ~ 100 solar masses and appears to be gravitationally bound.furthermore, of the nine substructures examined here, one substructure (b1-e2)appears to be itself bound. the substructures are typically less than a jeanslength from their nearest neighbour and thus, may interact on a timescale of ~1 myr. we propose that b1-e may be forming a first generation of dense cores,which could provide important constraints on the initial conditions ofprestellar core formation. our results suggest that b1-e may be influenced by astrong, localized magnetic field, but further observations are still required.

1201.4732	search for starless clumps in the atlasgal survey	in this study, we present an unbiased sample of the earliest stages ofmassive star formation across 20 square-degree of the sky. within the region10deg &lt; l &lt; 20deg and |b| &lt; 1deg, we search the atlasgal survey at 870 micronfor dense gas condensations. these clumps are carefully examined forindications of ongoing star formation using ysos from the glimpse sourcecatalog as well as sources in the 24 micron mipsgal images, to search forstarless clumps. we calculate the column densities as well as the kinematicdistances and masses for sources where the v_lsr is known from spectroscopicobservations. within the given region, we identify 210 starless clumps withpeak column densities &gt; 1 x 10e23 cm^(-2). in particular, we identify potentialstarless clumps on the other side of the galaxy. the sizes of the clumps rangebetween 0.1 pc and 3 pc with masses between a few tens of solar masses up toseveral ten thousands of solar masses. most of them may form massive stars, butin the 20 square-degree we only find 14 regions massive enough to form starsmore massive than 20 solar masses and 3 regions with the potential to formstars more massive than 40 40 solar masses. the slope of the high-mass tail ofthe clump mass function for clumps on the near side of the galaxy is 2.2 and,therefore, salpeter-like. we estimate the lifetime of the most massive starlessclumps to be 60000 yr. the sample offers a uniform selection of starlessclumps. in the large area surveyed, we only find a few potential precursors ofstars in the excess of 40 solar masses. it appears that the lifetime of theseclumps is somewhat shorter than their free-fall times, although both valuesagree within the errors. in addition, these are ideal objects for detailedstudies and follow-up observations.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1202.1672	galactic cold cores iii. general cloud properties	we examine the cloud structure around the planck detections in 71 fieldsobserved with the herschel spire instrument. we wish to determine the generalphysical characteristics of the fields and to examine the morphology of theclouds where the cold high column density clumps are found. we derive colourtemperature and column density maps of the fields. we examine the infraredspectral energy distributions of the main clumps. the clouds are categorisedaccording to their large scale morphology. with the help of recently releasedwise satellite data, we look for signs of enhanced mid-infrared scattering(coreshine), an indication of growth of the dust grains, and examine the starformation activity associated with the cold clumps. the mapped clouds havedistances ranging from ~100pc to several kiloparsecs and cover a range of sizesand masses from cores of less than 10 solar masses to clouds with masses inexcess of 10000 solar mass. most fields contain some filamentary structures andin about half of the cases a filament or a few filaments dominate themorphology. in one case out of ten, the clouds show a cometary shape or havesharp boundaries indicative of compression by an external force. the width ofthe filaments is typically ~0.2-0.3pc. however, there is significant variationfrom 0.1pc to 1pc and the estimates are sensitive to the methods used and thevery definition of a filament. enhanced mid-infrared scattering, coreshine, wasdetected in four clouds with six additional tentative detections. the cloudldn183 is included in our sample and remains the best example of thisphenomenon. about half of the fields are associated with active star formationas indicated by the presence of mid-infrared point sources. the mid-infraredsources often coincide with structures whose sub-millimetre spectra are stilldominated by the cold dust.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

1203.5721	the dust properties of bubble hii regions as seen by herschel	because of their relatively simple morphology, "bubble" hii regions have beeninstrumental to our understanding of star formation triggered by hii regions.with the far-infrared (fir) spectral coverage of the herschel satellite, we canaccess the wavelengths where these regions emit the majority of their energythrough their dust emission. at herschel wavelengths 70 micron to 500 micron,the emission associated with hii regions is dominated by the cool dust in theirphotodissociation regions (pdrs). we find average dust temperatures of 26kalong the pdrs, with little variation between the hii regions in the sample,while local filaments and infrared dark clouds average 19k and 15krespectively. higher temperatures lead to higher values of the jeans mass,which may affect future star formation. the mass of the material in the pdr,collected through the expansion of the hii region, is between ~300 and ~10,000solar masses for the hii regions studied here. these masses are in roughagreement with the expected masses swept up during the expansion of the \hii\regions. approximately 20% of the total fir emission is from the direction ofthe bubble central regions. this suggests that we are detecting emission fromthe "near-side" and "far-side" pdrs along the line of sight and that bubblesare three-dimensional structures. we find only weak support for a relationshipbetween dust temperature and beta, of a form similar to that caused by noiseand calibration uncertainties alone.

1203.6307	globules and pillars seen in the [cii] 158 micron line with sofia	molecular globules and pillars are spectacular features, found only in theinterface region between a molecular cloud and an hii-region. impactingfar-ultraviolet (fuv) radiation creates photon dominated regions (pdrs) ontheir surfaces that can be traced by typical cooling lines. with the greatreceiver onboard sofia we mapped and spectrally resolved the [cii] 158 micronatomic fine-structure line and the highly excited 12co j=11-10 molecular linefrom three objects in cygnus x (a pillar, a globule, and a strong iras source).we focus here on the globule and compare our data with existing spitzer dataand recent herschel open-time pacs data. extended [cii] emission and morecompact co-emission was found in the globule. we ascribe this emission mainlyto an internal pdr, created by a possibly embedded star-cluster with at leastone early b-star. however, external pdr emission caused by the excitation bythe cyg ob2 association cannot be fully excluded. the velocity-resolved [cii]emission traces the emission of pdr surfaces, possible rotation of the globule,and high-velocity outflowing gas. the globule shows a velocity shift of ~2 km/swith respect to the expanding hii-region, which can be understood as theresidual turbulence of the molecular cloud from which the globule arose. thisscenario is compatible with recent numerical simulations that emphazise theeffect of turbulence. it is remarkable that an isolated globule shows thesestrong dynamical features traced by the [cii]-line, but it demands moreobservational studies to verify if there is indeed an embedded cluster ofb-stars.

1203.6472	cluster-formation in the rosette molecular cloud at the junctions of  filaments	for many years feedback processes generated by ob-stars in molecular clouds,including expanding ionization fronts, stellar winds, or uv-radiation, havebeen proposed to trigger subsequent star formation. however, hydrodynamicmodels including radiation and gravity show that uv-illumination has little orno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. the rosette molecularcloud, irradiated by the ngc2244 cluster, is a template region for triggeredstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure byapplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (disperse), andprobability density functions (pdfs) on herschel column density maps, obtainedwithin the hobys key program. the analysis reveals not only the filamentarystructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lieat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. the pdfs ofsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. the two uv-exposedregions have a double-peaked pdf we interprete as caused by shock compression.the deviations of the pdf from the log-normal shape typically associated withlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, arefound here within the very same cloud. this shows that there is no fundamentaldifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.we conclude that star-formation in rosette - and probably in high-massstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact ofuv-radiation. moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose fromthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.clusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced inthe direct interaction zone between an expanding hii--region and the molecularcloud.

1211.5232	recent star formation in the lupus clouds as seen by herschel	we present a study of the star formation histories of the lupus i, iii, andiv clouds using the herschel 70-500 micron maps obtained by the herschel gouldbelt survey key project. by combining the new herschel data with the existingspitzer catalog we obtained an unprecedented census of prestellar sources andyoung stellar objects in the lupus clouds, which allowed us to study theoverall star formation rate (sfr) and efficiency (sfe). the high sfe of lupusiii, its decreasing sfr, and its large number of pre-main sequence stars withrespect to proto- and prestellar sources, suggest that lupus iii is the mostevolved cloud, and after having experienced a major star formation event in thepast, is now approaching the end of its current star-forming cycle. lupus i iscurrently undergoing a large star formation event, apparent by the increasingsfr, the large number of prestellar objects with respect to more evolvedobjects, and the high percentage of material at high extinction (e.g., abovea_v=8 mag). also lupus iv has an increasing sfr; however, the relative numberof prestellar sources is much lower, suggesting that its star formation has notyet reached its peak.

1211.6360	herschel view of the taurus b211/3 filament and striations: evidence of  filamentary growth?	we present first results from the herschel gould belt survey for theb211/l1495 region in the taurus molecular cloud. thanks to their highsensitivity and dynamic range, the herschel images reveal the structure of thedense, star-forming filament b211 with unprecedented detail, along with thepresence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally orientedalong the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the herscheldata, we find that the radial density profile of the b211 filament approaches apower-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and thatthe temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. the observeddensity and temperature profiles of the b211 filament are in good agreementwith a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitationalcontraction with a polytropic equation of state: p {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}and t {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01&lt;1 (i.e. notstrictly isothermal). the morphology of the column density map, where some ofthe perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the b211 filament,further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations ontothe main filament. the typical velocities expected for the infalling materialin this picture are ~0.5-1 km/s, which are consistent with the existingkinematical constraints from previous co observations.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1304.0327	what determines the density structure of molecular clouds ? a case study  of orion b with herschel	a key parameter to the description of all star formation processes is thedensity structure of the gas. in this letter, we make use of probabilitydistribution functions (pdfs) of herschel column density maps of orion b,aquila, and polaris, obtained with the herschel gould belt survey (hgbs). weaim to understand which physical processes influence the pdf shape, and withwhich signatures. the pdfs of orion b (aquila) show a lognormal distributionfor low column densities until av 3 (6), and a power-law tail for high columndensities, consistent with a rho r^-2 profile for the equivalent sphericaldensity distribution. the pdf of orion b is broadened by external compressiondue to the nearby ob stellar aggregates. the pdf of a quiescent subregion ofthe non-star-forming polaris cloud is nearly lognormal, indicating thatsupersonic turbulence governs the density distribution. but we also observe adeviation from the lognormal shape at av&gt;1 for a subregion in polaris thatincludes a prominent filament. we conclude that (i) the point where the pdfdeviates from the lognormal form does not trace a universal av-threshold forstar formation, (ii) statistical density fluctuations, intermittency andmagnetic fields can cause excess from the lognormal pdf at an early cloudformation stage, (iii) core formation and/or global collapse of filaments and anon-isothermal gas distribution lead to a power-law tail, and (iv) externalcompression broadens the column density pdf, consistent with numericalsimulations.

1304.4098	first results from the herschel gould belt survey in taurus	the whole of the taurus region (a total area of 52 sq. deg.) has beenobserved by the herschel spire and pacs instruments at wavelengths of 70, 160,250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m as part of the herschel gould belt survey. in thispaper we present the first results from the part of the taurus region thatincludes the barnard 18 and l1536 clouds. a new source-finding routine, thecardiff source-finding algorithm (csar), is introduced, which is loosely basedon clumpfind, but that also generates a structure tree, or dendrogram, whichcan be used to interpret hierarchical clump structure in a complex region.sources were extracted from the data using the hierarchical version of csar andplotted on a mass-size diagram. we found a hierarchy of objects with sizes inthe range 0.024-2.7 pc. previous studies showed that gravitationally boundprestellar cores and unbound starless clumps appeared in different places onthe mass-size diagram. however, it was unclear whether this was due to a lackof instrumental dynamic range or whether they were actually two distinctpopulations. the excellent sensitivity of herschel shows that our sources fillthe gap in the mass-size plane between starless and pre-stellar cores, andgives the first clear supporting observational evidence for the theory thatunbound clumps and (gravitationally bound) prestellar cores are all part of thesame population, and hence presumably part of the same evolutionary sequence(c.f. simpson et al. 2011).

1306.0547	low-velocity shocks traced by extended sio emission along the w43  ridges: witnessing the formation of young massive clusters	the formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parentalclouds. we here focus on the high-density parts of w43, a molecular cloudundergoing an efficient event of formation. the cloud structure is studied witha column density image derived from herschel continuum maps obtained at 70,160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. we identify two high-column density filamentaryclouds, quoted as the w43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges, which both account for1.5x10^4 msun gas mass above 10^23 cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2,respectively. we used the n_2h^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the w43-mm1 andw43-mm2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound,despite their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. the mostintriguing result of the w43 large program is the bright wide-spread sio 2--1emission: 1--11 k kms$ stretching an area of ~28 pc^2. concentrated toward thew43-mm1 and w43-mm2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads to atotal luminosity of l_sio 2-1 ~4 10^4 k kms kpc^2pc^2. we measured a steeprelation between the luminosity and velocity extent of the sio~2--1 lines andpropose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity shocks observed here from themore classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass youngstellar objects. we used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate thatlow-velocity (&lt;10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10%) of si atomsinitially in gas phase or in grain mantles can explain the observed sio columndensity in w43. the spatial and velocity overlaps between the ridgeshigh-density gas (n_h2&gt;10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked sio gas suggests thatridges could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompaniedby low-velocity shocks. this mechanism may be the initial conditions for theformation of young massive clusters in these ridges.

1307.2590	global collapse of molecular clouds as a formation mechanism for the  most massive stars	the relative importance of primordial molecular cloud fragmentation versuslarge-scale accretion still remains to be assessed in the context of massivecore/star formation. studying the kinematics of the dense gas surroundingmassive-star progenitors can tell us the extent to which large-scale flow ofmaterial impacts the growth in mass of star-forming cores. here we present acomprehensive dataset of the 5500(+/-800) msun infrared dark cloudsdc335.579-0.272 (hereafter sdc335) which exhibits a network of cold, dense,parsec-long filaments. atacama large millimeter array (alma) cycle 0observations reveal two massive star-forming cores, mm1 and mm2, sitting at thecentre of sdc335 where the filaments intersect. with a gas mass of545(+770,-385) msun contained within a source diameter of 0.05pc, mm1 is one ofthe most massive, compact protostellar cores ever observed in the galaxy. as awhole, sdc335 could potentially form an ob cluster similar to the trapeziumcluster in orion. alma and mopra single-dish observations of the sdc335 densegas furthermore reveal that the kinematics of this hub-filament system areconsistent with a global collapse of the cloud. these molecular-line data pointtowards an infall velocity v_{inf} =0.7(+/-0.2) km/s, and a total mass infallrate \dot{m}_{inf} = 2.5(+/-1.0) x 10^{-3} msun/yr towards the central pc-sizeregion of sdc335. this infall rate brings 750(+/-300) msun of gas to the centreof the cloud per free-fall time (t_{ff}=3x10^5 yr). this is enough to doublethe mass already present in the central pc-size region in 3.5(+2.2,-1.0) xt_{ff}. these values suggest that the global collapse of sdc335 over the pastmillion year resulted in the formation of an early o-type star progenitor atthe centre of the cloud's gravitational potential well.

1308.6112	large scale iram 30m co-observations in the giant molecular cloud  complex w43	we aim to give a full description of the distribution and location of densemolecular clouds in the giant molecular cloud complex w43. it has previouslybeen identified as one of the most massive star-forming regions in our galaxy.to trace the moderately dense molecular clouds in the w43 region, we initiatedan iram 30m large program, named w43-hero, covering a large dynamic range ofscales (from 0.3 to 140 pc). we obtained on-the-fly-maps in 13co (2-1) and c18o(2-1) with a high spectral resolution of 0.1 km/s and a spatial resolution of12". these maps cover an area of ~1.5 square degrees and include the two mainclouds of w43, as well as the lower density gas surrounding them. a comparisonwith galactic models and previous distance calculations confirms the locationof w43 near the tangential point of the scutum arm at a distance from the sunof approximately 6 kpc. the resulting intensity cubes of the observed regionare separated into sub-cubes, centered on single clouds which are then analyzedin detail. the optical depth, excitation temperature, and h2 column densitymaps are derived out of the 13co and c18o data. these results are then comparedwith those derived from herschel dust maps. the mass of a typical cloud isseveral 10^4 solar masses while the total mass in the dense molecular gas (&gt;100cm^-3) in w43 is found to be about 1.9e6 solar masses. probability distributionfunctions obtained from column density maps derived from molecular line dataand herschel imaging show a log-normal distribution for low column densitiesand a power-law tail for high densities. a flatter slope for the molecular linedata pdf may imply that those selectively show the gravitationally collapsinggas.

1308.6490	co outflows from high-mass class 0 protostars in cygnus-x	as natural consequences of the accretion process, outflows are one of the few(indirect) tracers of accretion. we used co(2-1) pdbi observations towards 6mdcs in cygnus-x, containing 9 high-mass cores, to investigate what theaccretion process and origin of the material feeding the precursors ofhigh-mass stars are. we compared our sample to low-mass objects from theliterature and developed simple evolutionary models to reproduce theobservables. we find that 8/9 high-mass cores drive clear individual outflowsas true equivalents of class 0 protostars in the high-mass regime. theremaining core has only a tentative outflow detection. it could be amongst thefirst examples of a true individual high-mass prestellar core. we find that themomentum flux of high-mass objects has a linear relation to the envelope mass,as a scale-up of the relations found for low-mass protostars. this suggests afundamental proportionality between accretion rates and mass reservoir,suggesting identical collapse timescales for all masses. we conclude that ifthe pre-collapse evolution is quasi-static, the fragmentation scale (which issimilar for all masses) would limit the size of the initial mass reservoirs,leading to shorter free-fall times for higher mass stars. however, as we findidentical collapse timescales for all masses, a significant turbulent/magneticsupport is needed to slow down the collapse of the more massive envelopes in aquasi-static view. with this support still to be discovered, and withindications of large dynamics in pre-collapse gas for high-mass star formation,we propose that such an identical collapse timescale implies that the initialdensities, which should set the duration of the collapse, should be similar forall masses. this suggests that the mass that incorporates massive stars has tohave been accreted in a dynamical way from larger scales than those of low-massstars.

1312.0937	the atlasgal survey: a catalog of dust condensations in the galactic  plane	the formation processes and the evolutionary stages of high-mass stars arepoorly understood compared to low-mass stars. large-scale surveys are needed toprovide an unbiased census of high column density sites which can potentiallyhost precursors to high-mass stars. here we use the atlasgal survey covering420 sq. degree of the galactic plane at 870 $\mu$m; and use the mre-glc methodto identify the population of embedded sources throughout the inner galaxy. weidentify in total 10861 compact sub-millimeter sources with fluxes above 5sigma. completeness tests show that our catalogue is 97% complete above 5 sigmaand &gt;99% complete above 7$\sigma$. we correlate this sample with mid-infraredpoint source catalogues (msx at 21.3 $\mu$m and wise at 22 $\mu$m) anddetermine a lower limit of ~33% that are associated with embedded protostellarobjects. we note that the proportion of clumps associated with mid-infraredsources increases with increasing flux density, achieving a rather constantfraction of ~75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 jy/beam being associated withstar-formation. examining the source counts as a function of galactic longitudewe are able to identify the most prominent star forming regions in the galaxy.from the fraction of the likely massive quiescent clumps (~25%) we estimate aformation time-scale of ~7.5+/-2.5 $\times$ 10$^4$yr for the deeply embeddedphase before the emergence of luminous ysos. such a short duration for theformation of high-mass stars in massive clumps clearly proves that the earliestphases have to be dynamic with supersonic motions.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1404.4404	the formation of the w43 complex: constraining its atomic-to-molecular  transition and searching for colliding clouds	numerical simulations have explored the possibility to form molecular cloudsthrough either a quasi-static, self-gravitating mechanism or the collision ofgas streams or lower-density clouds. they also quantitatively predict thedistribution of matter at the transition from atomic to molecular gases. we aimto observationally test these models by studying the environment of w43, amolecular cloud complex near the tip of the galactic long bar. usinggalaxy-wide hi and 12co surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the w43molecular cloud complex. we also estimated the hi and h2 mass surface densitiesto constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within w43.we found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12co and higases. they are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the13co velocity structure of w43. since their velocity gradients are consistentwith free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,the w43 10^7msun potential well. we show that the hi surface density,sigma_hi=45-85msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases whenentering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. this suggeststhat an equilibrium between h2 formation and photodissociation has not yet beenreached. the h2-to-hi ratio measured over the w43 region and its surroundings,r_h2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular formin w43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along thescutum-centaurus arm. the w43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and infact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. already inthe molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from thescutum-centaurus arm. this is in clear disagreement with quasi-static andsteady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

1407.6400	sio emission from low- and high-velocity shocks in cygnus-x massive  dense clumps	we used pdbi observations of sio (2-1) to investigate the morphology andprofile of the sio emission within several massive dense clumps (mdcs) incygnus-x. we find that most molecular outflows are detected in both sio and co,although there are some cases of co outflows with no sio counterpart. we find asignificant amount of narrow line sio emission that appears to be unrelated tooutflows. the fraction of the total sio luminosity that is not associated withoutflows is highly variable in the different mdcs (from 10% to 90%); this mightbe a problem when extrapolating outflow properties from sio luminositieswithout resolving individual outflows. the extent of the narrow sio emissionvaries from rather compact (~ 0.03 pc) to widespread (~0.2 pc), and itskinematics often differs from those found by other high-density tracers such ash13co+. we find that the least centrally concentrated clumps with the leastmassive protostellar cores have the most widespread narrow sio emission. inline with previous evidence of sio emission associated with low-velocityshocks, we propose an evolutionary picture to explain the existence anddistribution of narrow sio line profiles. in this scenario, the least centrallycondensed mdcs are at an early stage where the sio emission traces shocks fromthe large-scale collapse of material onto the mdc (e.g. cygx-n40). as the mdccollapses, the sio emission becomes more confined to the close surroundings ofcores, tracing the post-shock material from the infalling mdc against the densecores (e.g. cygx-n3, n12, and n48). at later stages, when single massiveprotostars are formed, the sio luminosity is largely dominated by powerfuloutflows, and the weaker narrow component shows perhaps the last remnants ofthe initial collapse (e.g. cygx-n53 and n63).

1507.02055	herschel observations of the w3 gmc (ii): clues to the formation of  clusters of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for investigating the formation of high-massstars and clusters. this second study of w3 within the hobys key programprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within w3 to further constrain theprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative mass distributions (cmds)were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction av. theshape of the pdf, typically represented with a lognormal function at low av"breaking" to a power-law tail at high av, is influenced by various processesincluding turbulence and self-gravity. the breaks can also be identified, oftenmore readily, in the cmds. the pdf break from lognormal (av(sf)= 6-10 mag)appears to shift to higher av by stellar feedback, so that high-massstar-forming regions tend to have higher pdf breaks. a second break at av &gt; 50mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. because such aprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in w3, this secondbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-massstars/clusters. stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving thelocal evolution and state of regions within w3. a high initial star formationefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leadingto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., collidingflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. this scenario would becompatible with the "convergent constructive feedback" model introduced in ourprevious herschel study.

1507.05926	a census of dense cores in the aquila cloud complex: spire/pacs  observations from the herschel gould belt survey	we present and discuss the results of the herschel gould belt surveyobservations in a ~11 deg^2 area of the aquila molecular cloud complex at d~260pc, imaged with the spire/pacs cameras from 70 to 500 micron. we identify acomplete sample of starless dense cores and embedded protostars in this region,and analyze their global properties and spatial distributions. we find a totalof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellarcores, and they will likely form stars in the future. we also detect 58protostellar cores. the core mass function (cmf) derived for the prestellarcores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (imf),supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the imfand the cmf. the global shift in mass scale observed between the cmf and theimf is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. bycomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 myr. we find a strongcorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and thedensest filaments. about 90% of the herschel-identified prestellar cores arelocated above a background column density corresponding to a_v~7, and ~75% ofthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unitlength &gt;~16 m_sun/pc. these findings support a picture wherein the cores makingup the peak of the cmf (and probably responsible for the base of the imf)result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginallysupercritical filaments. given that filaments appear to dominate the massbudget of dense gas at a_v&gt;7, our findings also suggest that the physics ofprestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic"efficiency" sfr/m_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process indense gas.

1507.08869	detection of two power-law tails in the probability distribution  functions of massive gmcs	we report the novel detection of complex high-column density tails in theprobability distribution functions (pdfs) for three high-mass star-formingregions (cepob3, monr2, ngc6334), obtained from dust emission observed withherschel. the low column density range can be fit with a lognormaldistribution. a first power-law tail starts above an extinction (av) of ~6-14.it has a slope of alpha=1.3-2 for the rho~r^-alpha profile for an equivalentdensity distribution (spherical or cylindrical geometry), and is thusconsistent with free-fall gravitational collapse. above av~40, 60, and 140, wedetect an excess that can be fitted by a flatter power law tail with alpha&gt;2.it correlates with the central regions of the cloud (ridges/hubs) of size ~1 pcand densities above 10^4 cm^-3. this excess may be caused by physical processesthat slow down collapse and reduce the flow of mass towards higher densities.possible are: 1. rotation, which introduces an angular momentum barrier, 2.increasing optical depth and weaker cooling, 3. magnetic fields, 4. geometricaleffects, and 5. protostellar feedback. the excess/second power-law tail isclosely linked to high-mass star-formation though it does not imply a universalcolumn density threshold for the formation of (high-mass) stars.

1509.01819	a possible link between the power spectrum of interstellar filaments and  the origin of the prestellar core mass function	two major features of the prestellar cmf are: 1) a broad peak below 1 msun,presumably corresponding to a mean gravitational fragmentation scale, and 2) acharacteristic power-law slope, very similar to the salpeter slope of thestellar initial mass function (imf) at the high-mass end. while recent herschelobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar cmf is close to thethermal jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of thepower-law tail of the cmf/imf at the high-mass end is less clear. inutsuka(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-lawtail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum ofdensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellarturbulence. here, we report the statistical properties of the line-massfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with herschelusing a 1-d power spectrum analysis. the observed filament power spectra werefitted by a power-law function $(p_{true}(s) \propto s^{\alpha})$ afterremoving the effect of beam convolution at small scales. a gaussian-likedistribution of power-spectrum slopes was found centered at -1.6, close to thatof the one-dimensional velocity power spectrum generated by subsonickolomogorov turbulence (-1.67). an empirical correlation, $p^{0.5}(s_0) \propto&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;^{1.4 \pm 0.1} $, was also found between the amplitude of eachfilament power spectrum $p(s_0)$ and the mean column density along the filament$&lt;n_{\rm h_2}&gt;$. finally, the dispersion of line-mass fluctuations along eachfilament $\sigma_{\rm m_{line}}$ was found to scale with the physical length$l$ of the filament, roughly as $\sigma_{m_{line}} \propto l^{0.7}$. overall,our results are consistent with the suggestion that the bulk of the cmf/imfresults from the gravitational fragmentation of filaments.

1509.06567	environmental regulation of cloud and star formation in galactic bars	the strong time-dependence of the dynamics of galactic bars yields a complexand rapidly evolving distribution of dense gas and star forming regions.although bars mainly host regions void of any star formation activity, theirextremities can gather the physical conditions for the formation of molecularcomplexes and mini-starbursts. using a sub-parsec resolution hydrodynamicalsimulation of a milky way-like galaxy, we probe these conditions to explore howand where bar (hydro-)dynamics favours the formation or destruction ofmolecular clouds and stars. the interplay between the kpc-scale dynamics (gasflows, shear) and the parsec-scale (turbulence) is key to this problem. we finda strong dichotomy between the leading and trailing sides of the bar, in termof cloud fragmentation and in the age distribution of the young stars. afterorbiting along the bar edge, these young structures slow down at theextremities of the bar, where orbital crowding increases the probability ofcloud-cloud collision. we find that such events increase the mach number of thecloud, leading to an enhanced star formation efficiency and finally theformation of massive stellar associations, in a fashion similar togalaxy-galaxy interactions. we highlight the role of bar dynamics in decouplingyoung stars from the clouds in which they form, and discuss the implications onthe injection of feedback into the interstellar medium, in particular in thecontext of galaxy formation.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

1511.05138	atlasgal-selected massive clumps in the inner galaxy, ii:  characterisation of different evolutionary stages and their sio emission	the processes leading to the birth of high-mass stars are poorly understood.we characterise here a sample of 430 massive clumps from the atlasgal survey,which are representative of different evolutionary stages. to establish acensus of molecular tracers of their evolution we performed an unbiasedspectral line survey covering the 3-mm atmospheric window between 84-117 ghzwith the iram 30m. a smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the sio(5-4) transition with the apex telescope to complement the sio (2-1) line andprobe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus ofthe current study. we report a high detection rate of &gt;75% of the sio (2-1)line and a &gt;90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)transition. the sio (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detectionrates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitousdetection of sio in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous starformation process in massive clumps. we find a large fraction of infrared-quietclumps to exhibit sio emission, the majority of them only showing alow-velocity component (fwhm~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of theclump. in the current picture, where this is attributed to low-velocity shocksfrom cloud-cloud collisions, this can be used to pinpoint the youngest, thus,likely prestellar massive structures. based on the line ratio of the (5-4) tothe (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditionsthat lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.our analysis delivers a more robust estimate of sio column density andabundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity inmassive clumps as a function of age.

astro-ph;0201317	the environment and nature of the class i protostar elias 29: molecular  gas observations and the location of ices	a (sub-)millimeter line and continuum study of the class i protostar elias 29in the rho ophiuchi molecular cloud is presented, whose goals are to understandthe nature of this source, and to locate the ices that are abundantly presentalong this line of sight. within 15-60" beams, several different componentscontribute to the line emission. two different foreground clouds are detected,an envelope/disk system and a dense ridge of hco+ rich material. the latter twocomponents are spatially separated in millimeter interferometer maps. weanalyze the envelope/disk system by using inside-out collapse and flared diskmodels. the disk is in a relatively face-on orientation (&lt;60 degrees), whichexplains many of the remarkable observational features of elias 29, such as itsflat sed, its brightness in the near infrared, the extended components found inspeckle interferometry observations, and its high velocity molecular outflow.it cannot account for the ices seen along the line of sight, however. a smallfraction of the ices is present in a (remnant) envelope of mass 0.12-0.33 msun,but most of the ices (~70%) are present in cool (t&lt;40 k) quiescent foregroundclouds. this explains the observed absence of thermally processed ices(crystallized h2o) toward elias 29. nevertheless, the temperatures could besufficiently high to account for the low abundance of apolar (co, n2, o2) ices.this work shows that it is crucial to obtain spectrally and spatially resolvedinformation from single-dish and interferometric molecular gas observations inorder to determine the nature of protostars and to interpret infrared isosatellite observations of ices and silicates along a pencil beam.

astro-ph;0407482	multiple protostellar systems. i. a deep near infrared survey of taurus  and ophiuchus protostellar objects	(abridged) we performed a deep infrared imaging survey of 63 embedded youngstellar objects (ysos) located in the taurus and ophiuchus clouds to search forcompanions. the sample includes class i and flat infrared spectrum protostellarobjects. we find 17 companions physically bound to 15 ysos with angularseparations in the range 0.8-10" (110-1400 au) and derive a companion starfraction of 23+/-9 % and 29+/-7 % for embedded ysos in taurus and ophiuchus,respectively. in spite of different properties of the clouds and especially ofthe prestellar cores, the fraction of wide companions, 27+/-6 % for thecombined sample, is identical in the two star-forming regions. this suggeststhat the frequency and properties of wide multiple protostellar systems are notvery sensitive to specific initial conditions. comparing the companion starfraction of the youngest ysos still surrounded by extended envelopes to that ofmore evolved ysos, we find evidence for a possible evolution of the fraction ofwide multiple systems, which seems to decrease by a factor of about 2 on atimescale of about 10^5 yr. somewhat contrary to model predictions, we do notfind evidence for a sub-clustering of embedded sources at this stage on a scaleof a few 100 au that could be related to the formation of small-n protostellarclusters. possible interpretations for this discrepancy are discussed.
