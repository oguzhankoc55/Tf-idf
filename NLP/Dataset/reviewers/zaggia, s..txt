0704.1430	the blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: genuine blue  stragglers or young stellar population?	abridged... blue stragglers (bss) are thought to be the product of eitherprimordial or collisional binary systems. in the context of dwarf spheroidalgalaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine bss population from youngmain sequence (ms) stars tracing a ~1-2 gyr old star forming episode. assumingthat their blue plume populations are made of bss, we estimate the bssfrequency for 8 local group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using acompilation of ground and space based photometry.  our results can be summarized as follows: (i) the bss frequency in dwarfgalaxies, at any given mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters ofsimilar luminosities; (ii) the bss frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarfgalaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the milky way halo;and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significantanti-correlation between the bss frequency and the galaxy mv.  the low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxysample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) anegligible production of collisional bss; and consequently (iii) that theirblue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. the dwarf galaxiesanti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying theanti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial bss rather thanyoung main sequence stars.

0707.0937	vlt observations of the central compact object in the vela jr. supernova  remnant	x-ray observations have unveiled the existence of enigmatic point-likesources at the center of young (a few kyrs) supernova remnants. these sources,known as central compact objects (ccos), are thought to be neutron starsproduced by the supernova explosion, although their x-ray phenomenology makesthem markedly different from all the other young neutron stars discovered sofar.the aim of this work is to search for the optical/ir counterpart of thevela junior cco and to understand the nature of the associated halpha nebuladiscovered by pellizzoni et al. (2002).}{we have used deep optical (r band) andir (j,h,ks bands) observations recently performed by our group with the eso vltto obtain the first deep, high resolution images of the field with the goal ofresolving the nebula structure and pinpointing a point-like source possiblyassociated with the neutron star.our r-band image shows that both the nebula'sflux and its structure are very similar to the halpha ones, suggesting that thenebula spectrum is dominated by pure halpha line emission. however, the nebulais not detected in our ir observations, whick makes it impossible to toconstrain its spectrum. a faint point-like object (j&gt;22.6, h~21.6, ks ~ 21.4)compatible with the neutron star's chandra x-ray position is detected in our irimages (h and ks) but not in the optical one (r &gt; 25.6), where it is buried bythe nebula background. the nebula is most likely a bow-shock produced by theneutron star motion through the ism or, alternatively, a photo-ionizationnebula powered by uv radiation from a hot neutron star.

0909.0983	lithium in the globular cluster ngc 6397: evidence for dependence on  evolutionary status	most globular clusters are believed to host a single stellar populations.they can thus be considered a good place to study the spite plateau and probefor possible evolutionary modifications of the li content. we want to determinethe li content of subgiant (sg) and main sequence (ms) stars of the old,metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397. this work was aimed not only at studyingpossible li abundance variations but to investigate the cosmological lidiscrepancy. here, we present flames/giraffe observations of a sample of 84 sgand 79 ms stars in ngc 6397 selected in a narrow range of b-v colour and,therefore, effective temperatures. we determine both teff and a(li) using 3dhydrodynamical model atmospheres for all the ms and sg stars of the sample. wefind a significant difference in the li abundance between sg stars and msstars, the sg stars having an a(li) higher by almost 0.1 dex on average. wealso find a decrease in the a(li) with decreasing teff, both in ms and sgstars, albeit with a significantly different slope for the two classes ofstars. this suggests that the lithium abundance in these stars is, indeed,altered by some process, which is teff-dependent. the li abundance patternobserved in ngc 6397 is different from what is found among field stars, castingsome doubt on the use of globular cluster stars as representative of populationii with respect to the li abundance. none of the available theories of lidepletion appears to satisfactorily describe our observations.

0910.2305	lithium abundances of main sequence and sub-giant stars in the globular  cluster ngc 6397	we present flames/giraffe spectroscopy obtained at the very large telescope(vlt). using these observations we have been able for the first time to observethe li i doublet in the main sequence stars of a globular cluster. we alsoobserved li in a sample of sub-giant stars of the same b-v colour. our finalsample is composed of 84 sg stars and 79 ms stars. in spite of the fact that sgand ms span the same temperature range we find that the equivalent widths ofthe li i doublet in sg stars are systematically larger than those in ms stars,suggesting a higher li content among sg stars. this is confirmed by ourquantitative analysis which makes use of both 1d and 3d model atmospheres. wefind that sg stars show, on average, a li abundance higher by 0.1 dex than msstars. we also detect a positive slope of li abundance with effectivetemperature, the higher the temperature the higher the li abundance, both forsg and ms stars, although the slope is slightly steeper for ms stars. theseresults provide an unambigous evidence that the li abundance changes withevolutionary status. the physical mechanisms that contribute to this are notyet clear, since none of the proposed models seem to describe accurately theobservations. whether such mechanism can explain the cosmological lithiumproblem, is still an open question.

0707.4440	reaffirming the connection between the galactic stellar warp and the  canis major overdensity	we perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results presentedin the literature which interpret the cma overdensity as the signature of anaccreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the galaxy. several issuesare addressed. we show that arguments against the ``warp'' interpretation arebased on an erroneous perception of the milky way. there is nothing anomalouswith colour--magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-planebeing different. we witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population,first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discardedas a normal disc population. similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outerthin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.5), and spiral arms (aspart of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. most importantly, we showunambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellaroverdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in cma.the cmaover-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by galacticmodels without new substructures. given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerningthe properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction anddegeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough tosupport the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure withinthe milky way disc.

1011.1718	li - o anti-correlation in ngc 6752: evidence for li-enriched polluting  gas	elemental correlations and anti-correlations are known to be present inglobular clusters (gcs) owing to pollution by cno cycled gas. because of itsfragility li is destroyed at the temperature at which the cno cycling occurs,and this makes li a crucial study for the nature of the contaminating stars. weobserved 112 un-evolved stars at the turnoff of the ngc6752 cluster with flamesat the vlt to investigate the presence and the extent of a li-o correlation.this correlation is expected if there is a simple pollution scenario. li (670.8nm) and o triplet (771 nm) abundances are derived in nlte. all stars belong toa very narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram, so they have similarstellar parameters (teff, log g). we find that o and li correlate, with a highstatistical significance that confirms the early results for this cluster. atfirst glance this is what is expected if a simple pollution of pristine gaswith cno cycled gas (o-poor, li-poor) occurred. the slope of the relationship,however, is about 0.4, and differs from unity by over 7 sigma. a slope of oneis the value predicted for a pure contamination model. we confirm an extendedli-o correlation in non evolved stars of ngc 6752. at the same time thecharacteristic of the correlation shows that a simple pollution scenario is notsufficient to explain the observations. within this scenario the contaminantgas must have been enriched in li. this would rule out massive stars as mainpolluters, and favor the hypothesis that the polluting gas was enriched byintermediate or high-mass agb stars, unless the former can be shown to be ableto produce li. according to our observations, the fraction of polluting gascontained in the stars observed is a considerable fraction of the stellar massof the cluster.

1109.0992	x-shooter gto: chemical analysis of a sample of emp candidates	context: extremely metal-poor stars (emp) are very rare objects that hold intheir atmospheres the fossil record of the chemical composition of the earlyphases of galactic evolution. finding these objects and determining theirchemical composition provides important constraints on these early phases.aims: using a carefully designed selection method, we chose a sample ofcandidate emp stars from the low resolution spectra of the sloan digital skysurvey and observed them with x-shooter at the vlt to confirm theirmetallicities and determine abundances for as many elements as possible.method: the x-shooter spectra are analysed by means of one-dimensional,plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. corrections for the granulationeffects are computed using co5bold hydrodynamical simulations. results: all thecandidates are confirmed to be emp stars, proving the efficiency of ourselection method within about 0.5 dex. the chemical composition of this sampleis compatible with those of brighter samples, suggesting that the stars in thegalactic halo are well mixed. conclusions these observations show that it isfeasible to observe, in a limited amount of time, a large sample of about onehundred stars among emp candidates selected from the sdss. such a size ofsample will allow us, in particular, to confirm or refute the existence of avertical drop in the galactic halo metallicity distribution function around[fe/h] ~ -3.5.

1203.2607	a primordial star in the heart of the lion	context: the discovery and chemical analysis of extremely metal-poor starspermit a better understanding of the star formation of the first generation ofstars and of the universe emerging from the big bang. aims: we report the studyof a primordial star situated in the centre of the constellation leo (sdssj102915+172027). method: the star, selected from the low resolution-spectrum ofthe sloan digital sky survey, was observed at intermediate (with x-shooter atvlt) and at high spectral resolution (with uves at vlt). the stellar parameterswere derived from the photometry. the standard spectroscopic analysis based on1d atlas models was completed by applying 3d and non-lte corrections. results:an iron abundance of [fe/h]=--4.89 makes sdss j102915+172927 one of the lowest[fe/h] stars known. however, the absence of measurable c and n enhancementsindicates that it has the lowest metallicity, z&lt;= 7.40x10^{-7} (metal-massfraction), ever detected. no oxygen measurement was possible. conclusions: thediscovery of sdss j102915+172927 highlights that low-mass star formationoccurred at metallicities lower than previously assumed. even lower metallicitystars may yet be discovered, with a chemical composition closer to thecomposition of the primordial gas and of the first supernovae.

1203.2612	an extremely primitive halo star	the early universe had a chemical composition consisting of hydrogen, heliumand traces of lithium1, almost all other elements were created in stars andsupernovae. the mass fraction, z, of elements more massive than helium, iscalled "metallicity". a number of very metal poor stars have been found some ofwhich, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen andoxygen. for theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of starswith metallicities lower than z=1.5e-5, it has been suggested that low massstars (m&lt;0.8m\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form untilthe interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated tolie in the range 1.5e-8\leqz\leq1.5e-6, although competing theories claimingthe contrary do exist. here we report the chemical composition of a star with avery low z\leq6.9e-7 (4.5e-5 of that of the sun) and a chemical pattern typicalof classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen and oxygen. this shows that low mass stars can be formed atvery low metallicity. lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicityextension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. lithiumdepletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperaturesabove two million k in its history, which points to rather particular formationcondition or internal mixing process, for low z stars.

1206.0909	resolved stellar population of distant galaxies in the elt era	the expected imaging capabilities of future extremely large telescopes (elts)will offer the unique possibility to investigate the stellar population ofdistant galaxies from the photometry of the stars in very crowded fields. usingsimulated images and photometric analysis we explore here two representativescience cases aimed at recovering the characteristics of the stellarpopulations in the inner regions of distant galaxies. specifically: case a) atthe center of the disk of a giant spiral in the centaurus group, (mu b~21,distance of 4.6 mpc); and, case b) at half of the effective radius of a giantelliptical in the virgo cluster (mu~19.5, distance of 18 mpc). we generatesynthetic frames by distributing model stellar populations and adopting arepresentative instrumental set up, i.e. a 42 m telescope operating close tothe diffraction limit. the effect of crowding is discussed in detail showinghow stars are measured preferentially brighter than they are as the confusionlimit is approached. we find that (i) accurate photometry (sigma~0.1,completeness &gt;90%) can be obtained for case b) down to i~28.5, j~27.5 allowingus to recover the stellar metallicity distribution in the inner regions ofellipticals in virgo to within ~0.1 dex; (ii) the same photometric accuracyholds for the science case a) down to j~28.0, k~27.0, enabling to reconstructof the star formation history up to the hubble time via simple star counts indiagnostic boxes. for this latter case we discuss the possibility of derivingmore detailed information on the star formation history from the analysis oftheir horizontal branch stars. we show that the combined features of highsensitivity and angular resolution of elts may open a new era for our knowledgeof the stellar content of galaxies of different morphological type up to thedistance of the virgo cluster.

1206.1298	pre-ms depletion, accretion and primordial 7li	we reconsider the role of pre-main sequence (pre-ms) li depletion on thebasis of new observational and theoretical evidence: i) new observations ofhalpha emissions in young clusters show that mass accretion could be continuingtill the first stages of the ms, ii) theoretical implications fromhelioseismology suggest large overshooting values below the bottom of theconvective envelopes. we argue here that a significant pre-ms 7li destruction,caused by efficient overshoot mixing, could be followed by a matter accretionafter 7li depletion has ceased on ms thus restoring li almost to the pristinevalue. as a test case we show that a halo dwarf of 0.85 msun with an extendedovershooting envelope starting with an initial abundance of a(li) = 2.74 wouldburn li completely, but an accretion rate of the type 1e-8xe^{-t/3e6} msunyr$^{-1}$ would restore li to end with an a(li) = 2.31. a self-regulatingprocess is required to produce similar final values in a range of differentstellar masses to explain the popii spite plateau. however, this frameworkcould explain why open cluster stars have lower li abundances than thepre-solar nebula, the absence of li in the most metal poor dwarfs and a numberof other features which lack of a satisfactory explanation.

1310.6963	topos: i. survey design and analysis of the first sample	the metal-weak tail of the metallicity distribution function (mdf) of thegalactic halo stars contains crucial information on the formation mode of thefirst generation of stars. to determine this observationally, it is necessaryto observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. we present here theturn-off primordial stars survey (topos) that is conducted as an eso largeprogramme at the vlt. this project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand theformation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weaktail of the halo mdf below [m/h]=-3.5. in particular, we aim at determining thecritical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for theformation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of theelements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massivefirst stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the timewhen the galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of c-enhanced extremelymetal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. the largenumber of stars observed in the sdss provides a good sample of candidates ofstars at extremely low metallicity. candidates with turn-off colours down tomagnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of sdss by meansof an automated procedure. x-shooter has the potential of performing thenecessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities andabundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. we here present thestellar parameters of the first set of stars. the nineteen stars range in ironabundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the sun. two stars have a highradial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear tobe marginally bound to the galaxy and are possibly accreted from anothergalaxy.

[ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1408.5754	on the hi-hole and agb stellar population of the sagittarius dwarf  irregular galaxy	using two hst/acs data-sets that are separated by ~2 years has allowed us toderive the relative proper-motion for the sagittarius dwarf irregular (sagdig)and reduce the heavy foreground galactic contamination. the proper-motiondecontaminated sagdig catalog provides a much clearer view of the youngred-supergiant and intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch populations. wereport the identification of 3 milky way carbon-rich dwarf stars, probablybelonging to the thin disk, and pointing to the high incidence of this class atlow galactic latitudes. a sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts afaint, red extension of the well-defined sagdig carbon-rich sequence. theorigin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting theuncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. sagdig is also a gas-richgalaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (hi-hole), whichis offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. we nonethelessinvestigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motioncleaned stellar populations within the hi-hole with appropriately selectedcomparison regions, having higher hi densities external to the hole. thecomparison shows no significant differences. in particular, the centre of thehi-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400myr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. we concludethat there is no convincing evidence that the sagdig hi-hole is the result ofstellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gasare the most likely mechanism for its formation.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

0803.3722	optical and infrared observations of the x-ray source 1wga  j1713.4$-$3949 in the g347.3-0.5 snr	x-ray observations unveiled the existence of enigmatic point-like sources atthe centre of young supernova remnants (snrs). these sources, dubbed centralcompact objects (ccos), are thought to be neutron stars formed by the supernovaexplosion. however, their multi-wavelength phenomenology is surprisinglydifferent from that of most young neutron stars.the aim of this work is tounderstand the nature of the cco 1wga j1713.4-3949 in the g347.3-0.5 snr,through deep optical and ir observations, the first ever performed for thissource.by exploiting its derived chandra x-ray position we carried out optical(bvi) observations with the ntt and adaptive optics ir (jhks) observations withthe vlt. we detected two faint (i~23.5, i~24.3.) patchy objects in the nttimages, close to the chandra error circle. they were clearly resolved in ourvlt images which unveiled a total of six candidate counterparts (17.8&lt;h&lt;20.3)with quite red colours (h-ks~0.6). if they are stars, none of them can beassociated with 1wga j1713.4-3949 for the most likely values of distance andhydrogen column density. the identification of the faintest candidate with theneutron star itself can not be firmly excluded, while the identification with afallback disk is ruled out by its non-detection in the i band. no othercandidates are detected down to b~26, v~26.2, i~24.7, h~21.3 and k~20.5. ourhigh-resolution ir imaging of unveiled a few objects close/within the chandrax-ray position of 1wga j1713.4-3949. however, at present none of them can befirmly identified as its likely counterpart.

1409.4694	the chemical composition of red giants in 47 tucanae i: fundamental  parameters and chemical abundance patterns	context: the study of chemical abundance patterns in globular clusters is ofkey importance to constrain the different candidates for intra-clusterpollution of light elements. aims: we aim at deriving accurate abundances for alarge range of elements in the globular cluster 47 tucanae (ngc 104) to add newconstraints to the pollution scenarios for this particular cluster, expandingthe range of previously derived element abundances. methods: using tailored 1dlte atmospheric models together with a combination of equivalent widthmeasurements, lte, and nlte synthesis we derive stellar parameters and elementabundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 13 red giantstars near the tip of the rgb. results: we derive abundances of a total 27elements (o, na, mg, al, si, ca, sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr,mo, ru, ba, la, ce, pr, nd, eu, dy). departures from lte were taken intoaccount for na, al and ba. we find a mean [fe/h] = $-0.78\pm0.07$ and$[\alpha/{\rm fe}]=0.34\pm0.03$ in good agreement with previous studies. theremaining elements show good agreement with the literature, but the inclusionof nlte for al has a significant impact on the behaviour of this key element.conclusions: we confirm the presence of an na-o anti-correlation in 47 tucanaefound by several other works. our nlte analysis of al shifts the [al/fe] tolower values, indicating that this may be overestimated in earlier works. noevidence for an intrinsic variation is found in any of the remaining elements.

1501.04450	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of pre-main sequence stellar spectra	this paper describes the analysis of uves and giraffe spectra acquired by thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey in the fields of young clusters whosepopulation includes pre-main sequence (pms) stars. both methods that have beenextensively used in the past and new ones developed in the contest of thegaia-eso survey enterprise are available and used. the internal precision ofthese quantities is estimated by inter-comparing the results obtained by suchdifferent methods, while the accuracy is estimated by comparison withindependent external data, like effective temperature and surface gravityderived from angular diameter measurements, on a sample of benchmarks stars.specific strategies are implemented to deal with fast rotation, accretionsignatures, chromospheric activity, and veiling. the analysis carried out onspectra acquired in young clusters' fields during the first 18 months ofobservations, up to june 2013, is presented in preparation of the first releaseof advanced data products. stellar parameters obtained with the higherresolution and larger wavelength coverage from uves are reproduced withcomparable accuracy and precision using the smaller wavelength range and lowerresolution of the giraffe setup adopted for young stars, which allows us toprovide with confidence stellar parameters for the much larger giraffe sample.precisions are estimated to be $\approx$ 120 k r.m.s. in teff, $\approx$0.3 dexr.m.s. in logg, and $\approx$0.15 dex r.m.s. in [fe/h], for both the uves andgiraffe setups.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

1502.03934	the gaia-eso survey: a globular cluster escapee in the galactic halo	a small fraction of the halo field is made up of stars that share the lightelement (z&lt;=13) anomalies characteristic of second generation globular cluster(gc) stars. the ejected stars shed light on the formation of the galactic haloby tracing the dynamical history of the clusters, which are believed to haveonce been more massive. some of these ejected stars are expected to show strongal enhancement at the expense of shortage of mg, but until now no such star hasbeen found. we search for outliers in the mg and al abundances of the fewhundreds of halo field stars observed in the first eighteen months of thegaia-eso public spectroscopic survey. one halo star at the base of the redgiant branch, here referred to as 22593757-4648029 is found to have[mg/fe]=-0.36+-0.04 and [al/fe]=0.99+-0.08, which is compatible with the mostextreme ratios detected in gcs so far. we compare the orbit of 22593757-4648029to gcs of similar metallicity and find it unlikely that this star has beentidally stripped with low ejection velocity from any of the clusters. however,both chemical and kinematic arguments render it plausible that the star hasbeen ejected at high velocity from the anomalous gc omega centauri within thelast few billion years. we cannot rule out other progenitor gcs, because somemay have disrupted fully, and the abundance and orbital data are inadequate formany of those that are still intact.

1504.02484	the gaia-eso survey: n-body modelling of the gamma velorum cluster	the gaia-eso survey has recently unveiled the complex kinematic signature ofthe gamma velorum cluster: this cluster is composed of two kinematicallydistinct populations (hereafter, population a and b), showing two differentvelocity dispersions and a relative ~2 km s^-1 radial velocity (rv) shift. inthis paper, we propose that the two populations of the gamma velorum clusteroriginate from two different sub-clusters, born from the same parent molecularcloud. we investigate this possibility by means of direct-summation n-bodysimulations. our scenario is able to reproduce not only the rv shift and thedifferent velocity dispersions, but also the different centroid (~0.5 pc), thedifferent spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5pc) of the two populations. the observed 1-2 myr age difference between the twopopulations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the twosub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. oursimulations suggest that population b is strongly supervirial, while populationa is close to virial equilibrium. we discuss the implications of our models forthe formation of young star clusters and ob associations in the milky way.

1507.08066	the gaia-eso survey: characterisation of the [alpha/fe] sequences in the  milky way discs	we investigate, using the gaia-eso survey internal data-release 2, theproperties of the double sequence of the milky way discs (defined chemically asthe high-alpha and low-alpha populations), and discuss their compatibility withdiscs defined by other means such as metallicity, kinematics or positions.  this investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for starslocated in the extended solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars atdifferent ranges of galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. theseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novelmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifyingthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of theirmetallicity distribution functions. then, using the separation in chemicalspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/fe] -[fe/h] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relativeproportions of the two discs change across the galaxy.  we find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [fe/h]~ +0.2and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [fe/h]~ -0.8. radialand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, withmild spatial variations in its [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths, whereas for the thickdisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.  the small variations in the spatial [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths of the thindisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.on the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/fe] - [fe/h]variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for themixing of the metals in the young galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration orturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin discstarted forming.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

1512.03835	the gaia-eso survey: separating disk chemical substructures with cluster  models	(abridged) recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the galacticdisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.in this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporalvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. we used agaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, toseparate in the [mg/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane a clean disk star subsample from thegaia-eso survey internal data release 2. we find that the sample is separatedinto five groups associated with major galactic components; the metal-rich endof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.this is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) survey. the twometal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition([fe/h]&gt;-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. thisholds true at different radial regions. the distribution of galactocentricradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([fe/h]&lt;-0.25 dex) isshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. moreover,the metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale heightintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and itdisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. these stars might haveformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formationtaking place in the internal thin disk. their enhancement levels might be dueto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or theinner halo. the smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distributionwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] suggested bythe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.

astro-ph;0305540	search for the optical counterpart of the vela pulsar x-ray nebula	observations of the vela pulsar region with the chandra x-ray observatoryhave revealed the fine structure of its synchrotron pulsar-wind nebula (pwn),which showed an overall similarity with the crab pwn. however, contrary to thecrab, no firm detection of the vela pwn in optical has been reported yet. tosearch for the optical counterpart of the x-ray pwn, we analyzed deep opticalobservations performed with different telescopes. we compared the opticalimages with those obtained with the chandra acis to search for extendedemission patterns which could be identified as counterparts of the x-ray nebulaelements. although some features are seen in the optical images, we find nocorrelation with the x-ray structure. thus, we conclude that the diffuseoptical emission is more likely associated with filaments in the host vela snr.the derived upper limits on the optical flux from the pwn are compatibile,within the uncertainties, with the values expected on the basis of theextrapolations of the x-ray data.

astro-ph;0312064	photometric redshifts with the multilayer perceptron neural network:  application to the hdf-s and sdss	we present a technique for the estimation of photometric redshifts based onfeed-forward neural networks. the multilayer perceptron (mlp) artificial neuralnetwork is used to predict photometric redshifts in the hdf-s from an ultradeep multicolor catalog. various possible approaches for the training of theneural network are explored, including the deepest and most completespectroscopic redshift catalog currently available (the hubble deep field northdataset) and models of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies availablein the literature. the mlp can be trained on observed data, theoretical dataand mixed samples. the prediction of the method is tested on the spectroscopicsample in the hdf-s (44 galaxies). over the entire redshift range, $0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5$,the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf-sis good: the training on mixed data produces sigma_z(test) ~ 0.11, showing thatmodel libraries together with observed data provide a sufficiently completedescription of the galaxy population. the neural system capability is alsotested in a low redshift regime, 0&lt;z&lt;0.4, using the sloan digital sky surveydata release one (dr1) spectroscopic sample. the resulting accuracy on 88108galaxies is sigma_z(test) ~ 0.022. inputs other than galaxy colors - such asmorphology, angular size and surface brightness - may be easily incorporated inthe neural network technique. an important feature, in view of the applicationof the technique to large databases, is the computational speed: in theevaluation phase, redshifts of 10^5 galaxies are estimated in few seconds.

astro-ph;0405526	probing the canis major stellar over-density as due to the galactic warp	proper-motion, star counts and photometric catalog simulations are used toexplain the detected stellar over-density in the region of canis major (cma),claimed to be the core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy (martin et al. 2004,bellazzini et al. 2003), as due to the galactic warp and flare in the externaldisk. we compare the kinematics of cma m-giant selected sample with surroundinggalactic disk stars in the ucac2 catalog and find no peculiar proper motionsignature: cma stars mimic thick disk kinematics. moreover, when taking intoaccount the galactic warp and flare of the disk, 2mass star count profilesreproduce the cma stellar over-density. this star count analysis is confirmedby direct comparison with synthetic color-magnitude diagrams simulated with thebesancon models (robin et al. 2003) that include the warp and flare of thedisk. the presented evidence casts doubt on the identification of the cmaover-density as the core of a disrupted milky way satellite. this however doesnot make clear the origin of over-densities responsible for the ring structurein the anticenter direction of the galactic halo (newberg et al. 2002; yanny etal. 2003; zaggia et al. 2004, in preparation).

astro-ph;0603385	outer structure of the galactic warp and flare: explaining the canis  major over-density	(abridged) we derive the structure of the galactic stellar warp and flareusing 2mass rc and rgb stars, selected at mean heliocentric distances of 3, 7and 17 kpc.  our results are: (i) a clear stellar warp signature is derived for the 3selected rings; (ii) the derived stellar warp is consistent (both in amplitudeand phase-angle) with that for the galactic interstellar dust and hi gas; (iii)the sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. the stellar warp phase-angleorientation (+15 degrees) is close to the orientation angle of the galactic barand this produces an asymmetric warp for the inner rings; (iv) anorthern/southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at 17 kpc; (v)treating a mixture of thin and thick disk populations we trace the disk flaringand derive a constant scale-height (~0.65 kpc) within r(gc)~15 kpc. furtherout, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of ~1.5kpc at r(gc)~23 kpc; and (vi) these results provide further robust evidencethat there is no disk radial truncation at r(gc)~14 kpc.  in the particular case of the canis major over-density we confirm itscoincidence with the southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l=240. wepresent evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density,radial velocities, proper motion etc) of cma are consistent with it being anormal milky way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for amore complex interpretations of its origin. the present analysis does notprovide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the monoceros ring.nevertheless, we show that a warped flared milky way contributes significantlyat the locations of the monoceros ring.

astro-ph;0607020	eso imaging survey: infrared deep public survey	this paper presents new j and ks data obtained from observations conducted atthe eso 3.5m new technology telescope using the sofi camera. these data weretaken as part of the eso imaging survey deep public survey (dps) andsignificantly extend the earlier optical/infrared eis-deep survey presented ina previous paper. the dps-ir survey comprises two observing strategies: shallowks observations providing nearly full coverage of pointings with complementarymulti-band optical data and deeper j and ks observations of the central partsof these fields. the dps-ir survey provides a coverage of roughly 2.1 squaredegrees in ks with 0.63 square degrees to fainter magnitudes and also coveredin j, over three independent regions of the sky. the goal of the present paperis to describe the observations, the data reduction procedures, and to presentthe final survey products. the astrometric solution with an estimated accuracyof &lt;0.15" is based on the usno catalog. the final stacked images presented herenumber 89 and 272, in j and ks, respectively, the latter reflecting the largersurveyed area. the j and ks images were taken with a median seeing of 0.77" and0.8". the images reach a median 5sigma limiting magnitude of j_ab~23.06 in anaperture of 2", while the corresponding limiting magnitude in ks_ab is ~21.41and ~22.16 mag for the shallow and deep strategies. overall, the observedlimiting magnitudes are consistent with those originally proposed. the qualityof the data has been assessed by comparing the measured magnitude of sources atthe bright end directly with those reported by the 2mass survey and at thefaint end by comparing the counts of galaxies and stars with those of othersurveys to comparable depth and to model predictions. the final science-gradecatalogs and images are available at cds.

astro-ph;0612125	the exotic chemical composition of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the nearest neighbor of the milkyway. moving along a short period quasi-polar orbit within the halo, it is beingdestroyed by the tidal interaction with our galaxy, losing its stellar contentalong a huge stellar stream. we study the detailed chemical composition of 12giant stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal main body, together with 5 morein the associated globular cluster terzan 7 by means of high resolutionvlt-uves spectra. abundances are derived for up to 21 elements from o to nd, byfitting lines ew or line profiles against atlas 9 model atmospheres and synthespectral syntheses calculated ad-hoc. temperatures are derived from (v-i)_0 or(b-v)_0 colors, gravities from fe i - fe ii ionization equilibrium. themetallicity of the observed stars is between [fe/h]=-0.9 and 0. we detected ahighly peculiar ``chemical signature'', with undersolar alpha elements, na, al,sc, v, co, ni, cu and zn among others, and overabundant la, ce and nd. many ofthese abundance ratios (in particular light-odd elements and iron peak ones)are strongly at odds with what is observed within the milky way, they thus maybe a very useful tool to recognize populations originated within thesagittarius dwarf. this can be clearly seen in the case of the globular palomar12, which is believed to have been stripped from sagittarius: the cluster showsprecisely the same chemical ``oddities'', thus finally confirming itsextragalactic origin.

astro-ph;9703157	the relative distances to the virgo, fornax, and coma clusters of  galaxies through the dn-sigma and the fundamental plane relations	we derive the relative distances to the virgo, fornax, and coma clusters ofgalaxies by applying the dn-sigma and the fundamental plane (fp) relations tothe data of the homogeneous samples of early--type galaxies studied by caonetal, lucey etal, and jorgensen etal. the two distance indicators giveconsistent results, the relative distance moduli to fornax and coma withrespect to virgo being dmu(fv)=0.45+-0.15 and dmu(cv)=3.55+-0.15) respectively.the formal error on d(m-m) may be as small as 0.07 mag (~3% in distance),provided that all the sources of bias are taken into account and a correctstatistical approach is used. much of the actual uncertainty in the relativedistance of the clusters (12-15%), is due to the existence of systematicdepartures in the measurements of the velocity dispersions among the variousdatasets, and to the corrections for aperture effects. the above result for thefornax cluster is supported by the l-sigma-mu relation and, with lesseraccuracy, by the log(m)-log(re) relations. our value of dmu(fv) is in fairagreement with the one derived using planetary nebulae and sne-ia, while is inopen contrast with that coming from surface brightness fluctuations, globularclusters luminosity function, and infrared tully-fisher relation. in our datacoma appears slightly nearer than indicated by the other distance indicators,but now a better agreement with the tully-fisher relation seems to exist.finally we found that there aren't correlations of the residuals of thedn-sigma with the effective surface brightness, the total luminosity of thegalaxies, with the ellipticity and the shape parameter a4. instead acorrelation seems to exists with maximum vrot, with (v/sigma) and with theexponent m of the r^1/m fit to major axis light of galaxies.
