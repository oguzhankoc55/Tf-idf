0901.2898	the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies in the early universe	aims: the aim of this work is to collect a complete, mass--selected sample ofgalaxies with very low specific star formation rate, for a comparison with theprediction of recent theoretical models. method: we use the 24/k flux ratio,complemented by the sed fitting to the full 0.35-8.0 mum spectral distribution,to select quiescent galaxies from z~0.4 to z~4 in the goods--music sample. ourobservational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific starformation rate sfr/m_*, that can be used to compare with the theoreticalpredictions. results: we find that, in the framework of the well known globaldecline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction~15-20% of massive galaxies with very low specific star formation rate existsup to z~4, including a tail of "red&amp;dead" galaxies with sfr/m_*&lt;10^{-11}/yr.recent theoretical models vary to a large extent in the prediction of thefraction of galaxies with very low specific star formation rates, and areunable to provide a global match to our data.

0901.4364	spectroscopic observations of lyman-break galaxies at redshift ~ 4, 5  and 6 in the goods-south field	we report on observations of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey at mean redshift z~4, 5 and 6, obtainedwith fors2 spectrograph at the eso-vlt.this program has yielded spectroscopicidentifications for 114 galaxies of which 51 are at z~4, 31 at z~5, and 32 atz~6. the adopted selection criteria are effective, identifying galaxies at theexpected redshift with minimal foreground contamination. once selection effectsare properly accounted for, the rest-frame uv spectra of the higher-redshiftlbgs appear to be similar to their counterparts at z~3. as at z~3, lbgs at z~4and z~5 show lya both in emission and in absorption; when in absorption, stronginterstellar lines and red uv spectra are observed, a fact also measured at z~2and 3. at z~6, sensitivity issues bias our sample towards galaxies with lya inemission; nevertheless, these spectra appear to be similar to theirlower-redshift counterparts. as in other studies at similar redshifts, we findclear evidence that brighter lbgs tend to have weaker lya emission lines. atfixed rest-frame uv luminosity, the equivalent width of the lya emission lineis larger at higher redshifts. at all redshifts where the measurements can bereliably made, the redshift of the lya emission line turns out to be largerthan that of the interstellar absorption lines,with a median velocitydifference deltav~400 km/s at z~4 and 5, consistent with results at lowerredshifts. this shows that powerful, large-scale winds are common at highredshift.in general,there is no strong correlation between the morphology ofthe uv light and the spectroscopic properties. however, galaxies with deepinterstellar absorption lines and strong lya absorption appear to be morediffuse than galaxies with lya in emission.(abridged)

0903.3952	a comprehensive study of large scale structures in the goods-south field  up to z \sim 2.5	the aim of this paper is to identify and study the properties and galacticcontent of groups and clusters in the goods-south field up to z\sim2.5, and toanalyse the physical properties of galaxies as a continuous function ofenvironmental density up to high redshift. we use the deep (z850\sim26),multi-wavelength goods-music catalogue, which has a 15% of spectroscopicredshifts and accurate photometric redshifts for the remaining fraction. onthese data, we apply a (2+1)d algorithm, previously developed by our group,that provides an adaptive estimate of the 3d density field. we support ouranalysis with simulations to evaluate the purity and the completeness of thecluster catalogue produced by our algorithm. we find several high density peaksembedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. from the analysisof their physical properties (mass profile, m200, \sigmav, lx, u-b vs. bdiagram), we derive that most of them are groups of galaxies, while two arepoor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 mo. for these two clusters wefind, from the chandra 2ms data, an x-ray emission significantly lower thanexpected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters areeither not virialised or gas poor. we also analyse the dependance onenvironment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and starformations. we find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, moreluminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. the fraction of redgalaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. at higherz this dependance on density disappears. the variation of galaxy properties asa function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs atz\sim 1.5-2.

0905.0683	star formation and mass assembly in high redshift galaxies	we study the star formation and the mass assembly process of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;2.5galaxies using their ir emission from mips 24um band. we used an updatedversion of the goods-music catalog, extended by the addition of mid-ir fluxes.we compared two different estimators of the star formation rate: the totalinfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic andempirical ir templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy sed. forboth estimates, we computed the sfr density and the specific sfr. the two sfrtracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. however, theyshow a systematic trend, ir-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as thesfr increases. we show that: a) at z&gt;0.3, the sfr is well correlated withstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (usingir-based sfrs); b) the contribution to the global sfrd by massive galaxiesincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lowermass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the mostimportant contributors to the sfrd at any z are galaxies of about, orimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massivegalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median sfr 300 msun/yr. during thisepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) thessfr shows a clear bimodal distribution. the analysis of the sfrd and the ssfrseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxieshave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. acomparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the globalincrease in the ssfr with redshift and predict the existence of quiescentgalaxies even at z&gt;1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average ssfr.

0909.2853	evidence for a fast evolution of the uv luminosity function beyond  redshift 6 from a deep hawk-i survey of the goods-s field	we perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, tomeasure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in thisredshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of theirluminosity function. we present here the first results of an eso large program,that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in thenear-ir by the camera hawk-i at the vlt. we have obtained two hawk-i pointingson the goods south field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90arcmin2. the images reach y=26.7 mags for the two fields. we have used publicacs images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteriaz-y&gt;1, y-j&lt;1.5 and y-k&lt;2. the other public data in the ubvrijhk bands are usedto reject possible low redshift interlopers. the output has been compared withextensive monte carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of ourselection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. we detect 7high quality candidates in the magnitude range y=25.5-26.7. this intervalsamples the critical range for m* at z&gt;6 (m_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). afteraccounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidencelevel a luminosity function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including theeffects of cosmic variance. for galaxies brighter than m_1500=-19.0 we derive aluminosity density rho_uv=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/hz/mpc3, implying adecrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. on the basis of our findings, wemake predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,based on ultra-vista, hst-wfc3 or jwst-nircam, evaluating the bestobservational strategy to maximise their impact.

0707.1783	a photometrically detected forming cluster of galaxies at redshift 1.6  in the goods field	we report the discovery of a localized overdensity at z~1.6 in thegoods-south field, presumably a poor cluster in the process of formation. thethree-dimensional galaxy density has been estimated on the basis of wellcalibrated photometric redshifts from the multiband photometric goods-musiccatalog using the (2+1)d technique. the density peak is embedded in the largerscale overdensity of galaxies known to exist at z=1.61 in the area. theproperties of the member galaxies are compared to those of the surroundingfield and we found that the two populations are significantly differentsupporting the reality of the structure. the reddest galaxies, once evolvedaccording to their best fit models, have colors consistent with the redsequence of lower redshift clusters. the estimated m_200 total mass of thecluster is in the range 1.3 x 10^14 - 5.7x 10^14 msun, depending on the assumedbias factor b. an upper limit for the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity, based on the1ms chandra observations, is l_x=0.5 x 10^43 erg s^-1, suggesting that thecluster has not yet reached the virial equilibrium.

0912.3007	the unusual niv]-emitter galaxy gds j033218.92-275302.7: star formation  or agn-driven winds from a massive galaxy at z=5.56	aims: we investigate the nature of the source gds j033218.92-275302.7atredshift ~ 5.56. methods: the sed of the source is well sampled by 16 bandsphotometry, from uv-optical, near infrared and mid-infrared (mid-ir).thedetection of signal in the mid-ir spitzer/irac bands 5.8, 8.0 um -- where thenebular emission contribution is less effective -- suggests the presence of abalmer break, signature of an underlying stellar population formed at earlierepochs. the optical spectrum shows a clear lya emission line together withsemi-forbidden niv] 1483.3-1486.5 also in emission. results: from the sedfitting and the lya modelling it turns out that the source seems to have anevolved component with stellar mass of ~5 x10^(10) msolar and age ~ 0.4 gyrs,and a young component with an age of ~ 0.01 gyrs and sfr in the range of 30-200msolar yr^(-1). the limits on the effective radius derived from the acs/z850and vlt/ks bands indicate that this galaxy is denser than the local ones withsimilar mass. a relatively high nebular gas column density is favored from thelya line modelling (nhi&gt;=10^(21) cm^(-2)). a vigorous outflow (~ 450 km/s) hasbeen measured from the optical spectrum,consistent with the lya modelling. fromacs observations it turns out that the region emitting lya photons is spatiallycompact and of the same order of the effective radius estimated at the ~1400arest-frame wavelength, whose emission is dominated by the stellar continuumand/or agn. the gas is blown out from the central region,but given the mass ofthe galaxy it is uncertain whether it will pollute the igm to large distances.we argue that a burst of star formation in a dense gas environment is active(possibly containing hot and massive stars and/or a low luminosity agn),superimposed to an already formed fraction of stellar mass (abridged).

1001.1115	the great observatories origins deep survey - vlt/vimos spectroscopy in  the goods-south field: part ii	we present the full data set of the vimos spectroscopic campaign of theeso/goods program in the cdfs, which complements the fors2 eso/goodsspectroscopic campaign. the goods/vimos spectroscopic campaign is structured intwo separate surveys using two different vimos grisms. the vimos low resolutionblue (lr-blue) and medium resolution (mr) orange grisms have been used to coverdifferent redshift ranges. the lr-blue campaign is aimed at observing galaxiesmainly at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.5, while the mr campaign mainly aims at galaxies at z&lt;1 andlyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z&gt;3.5. the full goods/vimos spectroscopiccampaign consists of 20 vimos masks. this release adds 8 new masks to theprevious release (12 masks, popesso et al. 2009). in total we obtained 5052spectra, 3634 from the 10 lr-blue masks and 1418 from the 10 mr masks. asignificant fraction of the extracted spectra comes from serendipitouslyobserved sources: ~21% in the lr-blue and ~16% in the mr masks. we obtained2242 redshifts in the lr-blue campaign and 976 in the mr campaign for a totalsuccess rate of 62% and 69% respectively, which increases to 66% and 73% ifonly primary targets are considered. the typical redshift uncertainty isestimated to be ~0.0012 (~255 km/s) for the lr-blue grism and ~0.00040 (~120km/s) for the mr grism. by complementing our vimos spectroscopic catalog withall existing spectroscopic redshifts publicly available in the cdfs, wecompiled a redshift master catalog with 7332 entries, which we used toinvestigate large scale structures out to z~3.7. we produced stacked spectra oflbgs in a few bins of equivalent width (ew) of the ly-alpha and found evidencefor a lack of bright lbgs with high ew of the ly-alpha. finally, we obtainednew redshifts for 12 x-ray sources of the cdfs and extended-cdfs.

1001.3891	contamination on lyman continuum emission at z &gt;= 3: implication on the  ionising radiation evolution	we investigate the possibility of contamination by lower-redshift interlopersin the measure of the ionising radiation escaping from high redshift galaxies.taking advantage of the new ultra-deep vlt/vimos u-band number counts in thegoods-s field,we calculate the expected probability of contamination by low-zinterlopers as a function of the u-mag and the image spatial resolution (psf).assuming that ground-based observations can not resolve objects lying within a0.5" radius of each other, then each z&gt;=3 galaxy has a 2.1 and 3.2% chance offoreground contamination, adopting surface density u-band number counts down to27.5 and 28.5,respectively. those probabilities increase to 8.5 and 12.6%,assuming 1.0" radius. if applied to the estimates reported in the literature atz~3 for which a lyman continuum has been observed directly,the probability thatat least 1/3 of them are affected by foreground contamination is larger than50%.from a monte-carlo simulation we estimate the median integratedcontribution of foreground sources to the lyman continuum flux (f900). currentestimations from stacked data are &gt;2 sigma of the median integrated pollutionby foreground sources.the spatial cross-correlation between the u-band catalogand a sample of galaxies at z&gt;=3.4 in the goods-s field,produces a number ofu-band detected systems fully consistent with the expected superpositionstatistics. indeed, each of them shows the presence of at least one offsetcontaminant in the acs images. an exemplary case of a foreground contaminationin the hudf at redshift 3.797 by a foreground blue compact source (u=28.63 +/-0.2) is reported; if observed with a seeing larger than 0.5" the pollutingsource would mimic an observed (f1500/f900)_obs ~ 38, erroneously ascribed tothe source at higher redshift.

1007.1628	cosmic evolution of the civ in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations	we investigate the properties of triply ionized carbon (civ) in theintergalactic medium using a set of high-resolution and large box-sizecosmological hydrodynamic simulations of a $\lambda$cdm model. we rely on amodification of the gadget-2 code that self-consistently follows the metalenrichment mechanism by means of a detailed chemical evolution model. we focuson several numerical implementations of galactic feedback: galactic winds inthe energy driven and momentum driven prescriptions and active galactic nuclei(agn) powered by gas accretion onto massive black holes. we extract mock igmtransmission spectra in neutral hydrogen (hi) and civ and perform voigt profilefitting. the results are then compared with high-resolution quasar (qso)spectra obtained with the uves spectrograph at the vlt and the hiresspectrograph at keck. we find that feedback has little impact on statisticsrelated to the neutral hydrogen, while civ is more affected by galactic windsand/or agn feedback. when the same analysis is performed over observed andsimulated civ lines, we find reasonables good agreement between data andsimulations over the column density range $n_{\rm  civ}=10^{12.5-15}$ cm$^{-2}$. also the civ line-widths distribution appearsto be in agreement with the observed values, while the hi doppler parameters,$b_{\rm hi}$, are in general too large showing that the diffuse cosmic web isheated more than what is inferred by observations. the simulation withoutfeedback fails in reproducing the civ systems at high column densities at allredshift, while the agn feedback case agrees with observations only at $z&lt;3$,when this form of feedback is particularly effective. we also present scatterplots in the $b-n$ and in the $n_{\rm civ}-n_{\rm hi}$ planes, showing thatthere is rough agreement between observations and simulations only whenfeedback is taken into account.

1009.1140	the great observatories origins deep survey: constraints on the lyman  continuum escape fraction distribution of lyman--break galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.5	we use ultra-deep ultraviolet vlt/vimos intermediate-band and vlt/fors1narrow-band imaging in the goods southern field to derive limits on thedistribution of the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing radiation for l &gt;~l*(z=3) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at redshift 3.4--4.5. only one lbg, atredshift z=3.795, is detected in its lyman continuum (lyc; s/n~5.5), thehighest redshift galaxy currently known with a direct detection. itsultraviolet morphology is quite compact (r_eff=0.8, kpc physical). three out ofseven agn are also detected in their lyc, including one at redshift z=3.951 andz850 = 26.1. from stacked data (lbgs) we set an upper limit to the averagef_esc in the range 5%--20%, depending on the how the data are selected (e.g.,by magnitude and/or redshift). we undertake extensive monte carlo simulationsthat take into account intergalactic attenuation, stellar population synthesismodels, dust extinction and photometric noise in order to explore the momentsof the distribution of the escaping radiation. various distributions(exponential, log-normal and gaussian) are explored. we find that the medianf_esc is lower than ~6% with an 84% percentile limit not larger than 20%. ifthis result remains valid for fainter lbgs down to current observationallimits, then the lbg population might be not sufficient to account for theentire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here, with the exactdetails dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and qso contributionthereto. it is possible that f_esc depends on the uv luminosity of thegalaxies, with fainter galaxies having higher f_esc, and estimates of f_escfrom a sample of faint lbg from the hudf (i775&lt;28.5) are in broad quantitativeagreement with such a scenario.

1011.5500	spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies at redshift  beyond 7	we report the spectroscopic confirmation of two lyman break galaxies atredshift &gt; 7. the galaxies were observed as part of an ultra-deep spectroscopiccampaign with fors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 ``z--banddropout'' candidates selected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey. both galaxiesshow a prominent emission line at 9735a and 9858a respectively: the lines havefluxes of ~ 1.6-1.2 x 10^(-17) erg/s/cm2 and exhibit a sharp decline on theblue side and a tail on the red side. the asymmetry is quantitativelycomparable to the observed asymmetry in z ~ 6 ly-alpha lines, where absorptionby neutral hydrogen in the igm truncates the blue side of the emission lineprofile. we carefully evaluate the possibility that the galaxies are instead atlower redshift and we are observing either [oii], [oiii] or h-alpha emission:however from the spectroscopic and the photometric data we conclude that thereare no other plausible identifications, except for ly-alpha at redshift &gt;7,implying that these are two of the most robust redshift determination forgalaxies in the reionization epoch. based on their redshifts and broad--bandphotometry, we derive limits on the star formation rate and on the ultravioletspectral slopes of the two galaxies. we argue that these two galaxies alone areunlikely to have ionized the igm in their surroundings.

1107.1376	spectroscopic confirmation of z~7 lbgs: probing the earliest galaxies  and the epoch of reionization	we present the final results from our ultra-deep spectroscopic campaign withfors2 at the eso/vlt for the confirmation of z~7 "z--band dropout" candidatesselected from our vlt/hawk-i imaging survey over three independent fields. inparticular we report on two newly discovered galaxies at redshift ~6.7 in thentt deep field: both galaxies show a ly-alpha emission line with rest-frame ewsof the order 15-20 a and luminosities of 2-4 x 10^{42} erg/s. we also presentthe results of ultra-deep observations of a sample of i-dropout galaxies, fromwhich we set a solid upper limit on the fraction of interlopers. out of the 20z-dropouts observed we confirm 5 galaxies at 6.7 &lt; z &lt; 7.1. this issystematically below the expectations drawn on the basis of lower redshiftobservations: in particular there is a significant lack of objects withintermediate ly-alpha ews (between 20 and 55 a). we conclude that the trend forthe fraction of ly-alpha emission in lbgs that is constantly increasing fromz~3 to z~6 is most probably reversed from z~6 to z~7.  explaining the observed rapid change in the lae fraction among the drop-outpopulation with reionization requires a fast evolution of the neutral fractionof hydrogen in the universe. assuming that the universe is completely ionizedat z=6 and adopting the semi-analytical models of dijkstra et al. (2011), wefind that our data require a change of the neutral hydrogen fraction of theorder delta chi_{hi} ~ 0.6 in a time delta z ~ 1, provided that the escapefraction does not increase dramatically over the same redshift interval.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

0710.3704	the red and blue galaxy populations in the goods field: evidence for an  excess of red dwarfs	we study the evolution of the galaxy population up to z\sim3 as a function ofits colour properties. in particular, luminosity functions and luminositydensities have been derived as a function of redshift for the blue/late andred/early populations. we use data from the goods-music catalogue which havetypical magnitude limits z&lt;26 and ks&lt;23.5 for most of the sample. about 8% ofthe galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts; the remaining have well calibratedphotometric redshifts derived from the extremely wide multi-wavelength coveragein 14 bands (from the u band to the spitzer 8 \mu m band). we have derived acatalogue of galaxies complete in rest-frame b-band, which has been divided intwo subsamples according to their rest-frame u-v colour (or derived specificstar formation rate, ssfr) properties. we confirm a bimodality in the u-vcolour and ssfr of the galaxy sample up to z\sim 3. this bimodality is used tocompute the lfs of the blue/late and red/early subsamples. the lfs of theblue/late and total samples are well represented by steep schechter functionsevolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. the volume density of the lfsof the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. the shape ofthe red/early lfs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to theextrapolation of a flat schechter function and can be represented by the sum oftwo schechter functions. our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchicalclustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse uvbackground, shows a general broad agreement with the lfs of both populations,the larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.hints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of theirstellar mass and spatial distributions.

1201.5121	the lyman alpha forest flux probability distribution at z&gt;3	we present a measurement of the lyman alpha flux probability distributionfunction (pdf) measured from a set of eight high resolution quasar spectra withemission redshifts at 3.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.8. we carefully study the effect of metalabsorption lines on the shape of the pdf. metals have a larger impact on thepdf measurements at lower redshift, where there are fewer lyman alphaabsorption lines. this may be explained by an increase in the number of metallines which are blended with lyman alpha absorption lines toward higherredshift, but may also be due to the presence of fewer metals in theintergalactic medium with increasing lookback time. we also provide a newmeasurement of the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth, tau_eff,at 2.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and find no evidence for a deviation from a power lawevolution in the log(tau_eff)-log(1+z) plane. the flux pdf measurements arefurthermore of interest for studies of the thermal state of the intergalacticmedium (igm) at z ~ 3 . by comparing the pdf to state-of-the-art cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulations, we place constraints on the temperature of the igmand compare our results with previous measurements of the pdf at lowerredshift. at redshift z=3, our new pdf measurements are consistent with anisothermal temperature-density relation, t=t_0 delta^{gamma-1}, with atemperature at the mean density of t_0 = 19250 +/- 4800 k and a slopegamma=0.90+/-0.21 (1 sigma uncertainties). in comparison, joint constraintswith previous pdf measurements at z&lt;3 favour an inverted (gamma&lt;1)temperature-density relation with t_0=17900 +/- 3500 k and gamma=0.70 +/- 0.12,in broad agreement with previous analyses.

0712.2452	tracing the gas at redshift 1.7-3.5 with the lyman-alpha forest: the flo  approach	[abridged] we present flo (from lines to over-densities), a new technique toreconstruct the hydrogen density field for the lya forest lines observed inhigh resolution qso spectra. the method is based on the hypothesis that the lyalines arise in the low to intermediate density intergalactic gas and that thejeans length is the typical size of the lya absorbers. the reliability of flois tested against mock spectra obtained from cosmological simulations. therecovering algorithm gives satisfactory results in the range from the meandensity to over-densities of ~30 and reproduces correctly the correlationfunction of the density field and the 1d power spectrum on scales between ~20and 60 comoving mpc. a sample of lya forests from 22 high resolution qsospectra is analysed, covering the redshift range 1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5. for each line ofsight, we fit voigt profiles to the lines of the lya forest, providing thelargest, homogeneous sample of fitted lya lines ever studied. the line numberdensity evolution with redshift follows a power-law relation: dn/dz=(166 +/- 4)[(1+z)/3.5]^{(2.8 +/- 0.2)} (1 sigma errors). the two-point correlationfunction of lines shows a signal up to separations of ~2 comoving mpc; weaklines (log n(hi)&lt;13.8) also show a significant clustering but on smaller scales(r&lt;1.5 comoving mpc). we estimate with flo the hydrogen density field towardthe 22 observed lines of sight. the redshift distribution of the averagedensities computed for each qso is consistent with the cosmic mean hydrogendensity in the analysed redshift range. the two-point correlation function andthe 1d power spectrum of the delta field are estimated. the correlationfunction shows clustering signal up to ~4 comoving mpc.

1312.6299	characterizing faint galaxies in the reionization epoch: lbt confirms  two l&lt;0.2l* sources at z=6.4 behind the clash/frontier fields cluster  macs0717.5+3745	we report the lbt/mods1 spectroscopic confirmation of two images of faintlyman alpha emitters at $z=6.4$ behind the frontier fields galaxy clustermacsj0717.5+3745. a wide range of lens models suggests that the two images arehighly magnified, with a strong lower limit of mu&gt;5. these are the faintest z&gt;6candidates spectroscopically confirmed to date. these may be also multipleimages of the same z=6.4 source as supported by their similar intrinsicproperties, but the lens models are inconclusive regarding this interpretation.to be cautious, we derive the physical properties of each image individually.thanks to the high magnification, the observed near-infrared (restframeultraviolet) part of the spectral energy distributions and ly-alpha lines arewell detected with s/n(m_1500)&gt;~10 and s/n(ly-alpha)~10-15. adopting mu&gt;5, theabsolute magnitudes, m_1500, and ly-alpha fluxes, are fainter than -18.7 and2.8x10^(-18)erg/s/cm2, respectively. we find a very steep ultraviolet spectralslope beta=-3.0+/-0.5 (f_lambda=lambda^(beta)), implying that these are veryyoung, dust-free and low metallicity objects, made of standard stellarpopulations or even extremely metal poor stars (age&lt;~30myr, e(b-v)=0 andmetallicity 0.0-0.2 z/zsolar). the objects are compact (&lt; 1 kpc^(2)), and witha stellar mass m* &lt; 10^(8) m_solar. the very steep beta, the presence of thely-alpha line and the intrinsic fwhm (&lt;300 km/s) of these newborn objects donot exclude a possible leakage of ionizing radiation. we discuss thepossibility that such faint galaxies may resemble those responsible for cosmicreionization.

0802.1532	cosmic dynamics in the era of extremely large telescopes	the redshifts of all cosmologically distant sources are expected toexperience a small, systematic drift as a function of time due to the evolutionof the universe's expansion rate. a measurement of this effect would representa direct and entirely model-independent determination of the expansion historyof the universe over a redshift range that is inaccessible to other methods.here we investigate the impact of the next generation of extremely largetelescopes on the feasibility of detecting and characterising the cosmologicalredshift drift. we consider the lyman alpha forest in the redshift range 2 &lt; z&lt; 5 and other absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos as the mostsuitable targets for a redshift drift experiment. assuming photon-noise limitedobservations and using extensive monte carlo simulations we determine theaccuracy to which the redshift drift can be measured from the ly alpha forestas a function of signal-to-noise and redshift. based on this relation and usingthe brightness and redshift distributions of known qsos we find that a 42-mtelescope is capable of unambiguously detecting the redshift drift over aperiod of ~20 yr using 4000 h of observing time. such an experiment wouldprovide independent evidence for the existence of dark energy without assumingspatial flatness, using any other cosmological constraints or making any otherastrophysical assumption.

1403.5466	new observations of z~7 galaxies: evidence for a patchy reionization	we present new results from our search for z~7 galaxies from deepspectroscopic observations of candidate z-dropouts in the candels fields.despite the extremely low flux limits achieved by our sensitive observations,only 2 galaxies have robust redshift identifications, one from its lyalphaemission line at z=6.65, the other from its lyman-break, i.e. the continuumdiscontinuity at the lyalpha wavelength consistent with a redshift 6.42, butwith no emission line. in addition, for 23 galaxies we present deep limits inthe lyalpha ew derived from the non detections in ultra-deep observations.using this new data as well as previous samples, we assemble a total of 68candidate z~7 galaxies with deep spectroscopic observations, of which 12 have aline detection. with this much enlarged sample we can place solid constraintson the declining fraction of ly$\alpha$ emission in z~7 lyman break galaxiescompared to z~6, both for bright and faint galaxies. applying a simpleanalytical model, we show that the present data favor a patchy reionizationprocess rather than a smooth one.

1407.3787	a 52 hours vlt/fors2 spectrum of a bright z~7 hudf galaxy: no ly-alpha  emission	we aim to determine the redshift of gds-1408, the most solid z~7 galaxycandidate lying in the hubble ultra deep field. we have used all the vltspectra of gds-1408 collected by us and two other groups with fors2 at vlt inthe last five years, for a total integration time of 52hr. the combinedspectrum is the deepest ever obtained of a galaxy in the reionization epoch. wedo not detect any emission line or continuum over the whole wavelength range,up to 10100a. based on an accurate set of simulations, we are able to put astringent upper limit of f(lya)&lt;3x10^(-18) erg/s/cm2 at 3-9 sigma in theexplored wavelength range, corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent widthew&lt;9a. combining this limit with the sed modelling we refine the redshift to bez=6.82+/- 0.1 (1-sigma). the same sed fitting indicates that gds-1408 isrelatively extinct (a1600~1) with a dust corrected star formation rate of ~ 20msol/yr. the comparison between the un-attenuated equivalent width predicted bythe case-b recombination theory and the observed upper limit, provides a limiton the effective lya escape fraction of f_(esc)^(eff)(lya)&lt;8%. even though wecannot rule out a major contribution of the inter/circum galactic medium indamping the line, a plausible interpretation is that gds-1408 is moderatelyevolved and contains sufficient gas and dust to attenuate the lya emission,before it reaches the intergalactic medium. the redshift confirmation of eventhe best z~7 candidates is very hard to achieve (unless the lya or unusuallystrong rest-uv nebular emission lines are present) with the current generationof 8-10m class telescopes. we show that both jwst and e-elt will be necessaryto make decisive progresses. currently, the increased redshift accuracyobtained with this kind of analysis makes alma an interesting option for theredshift confirmation.

1502.00640	alma constraints on the faint millimetre source number counts and their  contribution to the cosmic infrared background	we have analysed 18 alma continuum maps in bands 6 and 7, with rms down to7.8$\mu$jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$jy and100$\mu$jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. the areacovered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. we improved the source extraction method byrequiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with thebeam size. this method enabled us to remove spurious detections that haveplagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. we detected 50 faintsources with s/n$&gt;$3.5 down to 60$\mu$jy, hence improving the statistics by afactor of four relative to previous studies. the inferred differential numbercounts are $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $s_{\lambda= 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$jy, and $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3mm flux $\rm s_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$jy. at the faintest flux limits,i.e. 30$\mu$jy and 40$\mu$jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential numbercounts of $\rm dn/d(log_{10}s) &lt; 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rmdn/d(log_{10}s)&lt;3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. our results provide a newlower limit to cib intensity of 17.2${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of12.9${\rm jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. moreover, the flattening of the integratednumber counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close tothe cib intensity. our data imply that galaxies with sfr$&lt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$certainly contribute less than 50% to the cib while more than 50% of the cibmust be produced by galaxies with $\rm sfr&gt;40~m_{\odot}/yr$. the differentialnumber counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models ofgalaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. consequently, this supportsthe galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.

1502.02562	faint agns at z&gt;4 in the candels goods-s field: looking for contributors  to the reionization of the universe	in order to derive the agn contribution to the cosmological ionizingemissivity we have selected faint agn candidates at $z&gt;4$ in the candelsgoods-south field which is one of the deepest fields with extensivemultiwavelength coverage from chandra, hst, spitzer and various groundbasedtelescopes. we have adopted a relatively novel criterion. as a first step highredshift galaxies are selected in the nir $h$ band down to very faint levels($h\leq27$) using reliable photometric redshifts. this corresponds at $z&gt;4$ toa selection criterion based on the galaxy rest-frame uv flux. agn candidatesare then picked up from this parent sample if they show x-ray fluxes above athreshold of $f_x\sim 1.5\times 10^{-17}$ cgs (0.5-2 kev). we have found 22 agncandidates at $z&gt;4$ and we have derived the first estimate of the uv luminosityfunction in the redshift interval $4&lt;z&lt;6.5$ and absolute magnitude interval$-22.5\lesssim m_{1450} \lesssim -18.5$ typical of local seyfert galaxies. thefaint end of the derived luminosity function is about two/four magnitudesfainter at $z\sim 4-6$ than that derived from previous uv surveys. we have thenestimated ionizing emissivities and hydrogen photoionization rates in the sameredshift interval under reasonable assumptions and after discussion of possiblecaveats, the most important being the large uncertainties involved in theestimate of photometric redshift for sources with featureless, almost power-lawseds and/or low average escape fraction of ionizing photons from the agn hostgalaxies. we argue that, under reasonable evaluations of possible biases, theprobed agn population can produce at $z=4-6.5$ photoionization rates consistentwith that required to keep highly ionized the intergalactic medium observed inthe lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift qso spectra, providing an importantcontribution to the cosmic reionization.

0806.3075	the qso proximity effect at redshift &lt;z&gt;=2.6 with the flo approach	we revisit the proximity effect produced by qsos at redshifts 2.1-3.3applying the flo approach (saitta et al. 2008) to a sample of ~6300 ly-alphalines fitted in 21 high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. this newtechnique allows to recover the hydrogen density field from the hi columndensities of the lines in the ly-alpha forest, on the basis of simpleassumptions on the physical state of the gas. to minimize the systematicuncertainties that could affect the density recovering in the qso vicinity, wecarefully determined the redshifts of the qsos in our sample and modelled indetail their spectra to compute the corresponding ionising fluxes. the meandensity field obtained from the observed spectra shows a significantover-density in the region within 4 proper mpc from the qso position,confirming that qsos are hosted in high density peaks. the absolute value ofrho/&lt;rho&gt; for the peak is uncertain by a factor of ~3, depending on the assumedqso spectral slope and the minimum hi column density detectable in the spectra.we do not confirm the presence of a significant over-density extending toseparations of ~15 proper mpc from the qso, claimed in previous works atredshifts &lt;z&gt;=2.5 and 3.8. our best guess for the uv background ionisation ratebased on the igm mean density recovered by flo is gamma_uvb ~ 10^{-12} s^{-1}.however, values of gamma_uvb ~ 3x10^{-12} s^{-1} could be viable if an invertedtemperature-density relation with index alpha=-0.5 is adopted.

astro-ph;0109453	measuring the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble deep field  south	we present an analysis of the evolution of galaxy clustering in the redshiftinterval 0&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hdf-s. the hst optical data are combined with infraredisaac/vlt observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxiesbrighter than i_ab&lt;27.5. the clustering signal is obtained in differentredshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses thebest redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes intoaccount the redshift probability function of each object. this second methodmakes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals wherecontamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. with bothmethods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the hdf-s isconsistent with the previous results in the hdf-n. while at redshift lower thanz~1 the hdf galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b&lt;1) with respect to theunderlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,depending on the cosmological model. these results support previous claimsthat, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. the impact of cosmicerrors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in theclustering measurements in the hdf surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noisein most regimes. future observations with instruments like the acs on hst willimprove the s/n by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of theerrors will be required. in fact, pure shot-noise will give a smallercontribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volumeeffects or non-poissonian discreteness effects.

astro-ph;0112290	exploring the intergalactic medium with vlt/uves	the remarkable efficiency of the uves spectrograph at the vlt has made itpossible to push high-resolution, high-s/n ground observations of the ly-aforest down to z~1.5, gaining new insight into the physical conditions of theintergalactic medium and its evolution over more than 90% of the cosmic time.the universal expansion, the uv ionizing background and the gravitationalcondensation of structures are the driving factors shaping the number densityand the column density distribution of the absorbers. a (limited) contributionof uv photons produced by galaxies is found to be important to reproduce theobserved evolutionary pattern at very high and low redshift. the lyman forestcontains most of the baryons, at least at z&gt;1.5, and acts as a reservoir forgalaxy formation. the typical doppler parameter at a fixed column density ismeasured to slightly increase with decreasing redshift, but the inferredtemperature at the mean density is increasing with redshift. the signatures ofheii reionization and feedback from the formation of galactic structures havepossibly been detected in the lyman forest.

astro-ph;0412044	the b-band luminosity function of red and blue galaxies up to z=3.5	we have explored the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of red andblue galaxies up to $z=3.5$. this was possible joining a deep i band compositegalaxy sample, which includes the spectroscopic k20 sample and the hdfssamples, with the deep $h_{ab}=26$ and $k_{ab}=25$ samples derived from thedeep nir images of the hubble deep fields north and south, respectively. about30% of the sample has spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fractionwell-calibrated photometric redshifts. this allowed to select and measuregalaxies in the rest-frame blue magnitude up to $z\sim 3$ and to derive theredshift evolution of the b-band luminosity function of galaxies separated bytheir rest-frame $u-v$ color or specific (i.e. per unit mass) star-formationrate. the class separation was derived from passive evolutionary tracks or fromtheir observed bimodal distributions. both distributions appear bimodal atleast up to $z\sim 2$ and the locus of red/early galaxies is clearly identifiedup to these high redshifts. both luminosity and density evolutions are neededto describe the cosmological behaviour of the red/early and blue/latepopulations. the density evolution is greater for the early population with adecrease by one order of magnitude at $z\sim 2-3$ with respect to the value at$z\sim 0.4$. the luminosity densities of the early and late type galaxies with$m_b&lt;-20.6$ appear to have a bifurcation at $z&gt;1$. indeed while star-forminggalaxies slightly increase or keep constant their luminosity density, "early"galaxies decrease in their luminosity density by a factor $\sim 5-6$ from$z\sim 0.4$ to $z\sim 2.5-3$. a comparison with one of the latest versions ofthe hierarchical cdm models shows a broad agreement with the observed numberand luminosity density evolutions of both populations.

astro-ph;0512147	probing the evolution of the near-ir luminosity function of galaxies to  z ~ 3 in the hubble deep field south	[abridged] we present the rest-frame js-band and ks-band luminosity functionof a sample of about 300 galaxies selected in the hdf-s at ks&lt;23 (vega). we usecalibrated photometric redshift together with spectroscopic redshift for 25% ofthe sample. the sample has allowed to probe the evolution of the lf in thethree redshift bins [0;0.8), [0.8;1.9) and [1.9;4) centered at the medianredshift z_m ~ [0.6,1.2,3]. the values of alpha we estimate are consistent withthe local value and do not show any trend with redshift. we do not see evidenceof evolution from z=0 to z_m ~ 0.6 suggesting that the population of localbright galaxies was already formed at z&lt;0.8. on the contrary, we clearly detectan evolution of the lf to z_m ~ 1.2 characterized by a brightening of m* and bya decline of phi*. to z_m ~ 1.2 m* brightens by about 0.4-0.6 mag and phi*decreases by a factor 2-3. this trend persists, even if at a less extent, downto z_m ~ 3 both in the js-band and in the ks-band lf. the decline of the numberdensity of bright galaxies seen at z&gt;0.8 suggests that a significant fractionof them increases their stellar mass at 1&lt;z&lt;2-3 and that they underwent astrong evolution in this redshift range. on the other hand, this implies alsothat a significant fraction of local bright/massive galaxies was already inplace at z&gt;3. thus, our results suggest that the assembly of high-mass galaxiesis spread over a large redshift range and that the increase of their stellarmass has been very efficient also at very high redshift at least for a fractionof them.

astro-ph;0603095	the clustering evolution of distant red galaxies in the goods-music  sample	we use the goods-music sample, a catalog of ~3000 ks-selected galaxies basedon vlt and hst observation of the goods-south field with extendedmulti-wavelength coverage (from 0.3 to 8 micron) and accurate estimates of thephotometric redshifts to select 179 drgs with j-ks&gt;1.3 in an area of 135 sq.arcmin. we first show that the j-ks&gt;1.3 criterion selects a ratherheterogeneous sample of galaxies, going from the targeted high-redshiftluminous evolved systems, to a significant fraction of lower redshift (1&lt;z&lt;2)and less luminous dusty starbursts. these low-redshift drgs are significantlyless clustered than higher-z drgs. with the aid of extreme and simplifiedtheoretical models of clustering evolution we show that it is unlikely that thetwo samples are drawn from the same population observed at two different stagesof evolution. high-z drgs likely represent the progenitors of the more massiveand more luminous galaxies in the local universe and might mark the regionsthat will later evolve into structures of intermediate mass, like groups orsmall galaxy clusters. low-z drgs, on the other hand, will likely evolve intoslightly less massive field galaxies.

astro-ph;0606297	on the radio properties of the highest redshift quasars	we present deep radio observations of the most distant complete quasar sampledrawn from the sloan digital sky survey. combining our new data with those fromliterature we obtain a sample which is ~100 per cent complete down to s_1.4ghz= 60 \mu jy over the redshift range 3.8 &lt; z &lt; 5. the fraction of radiodetections is relatively high (~43 per cent), similar to what observed locallyin bright optical surveys. even though the combined radio and opticalproperties of quasars remain overall unchanged from z ~ 5 to the localuniverse, there is some evidence for a slight over-abundance of radio-loudsources at the highest redshifts when compared with the lower-z regime.  exploiting the deep radio vla observations we present the first attempt todirectly derive the radio luminosity function of bright quasars at z ~ 4. theunique depth -- both in radio and optical -- allows us to thoroughly explorethe population of optically bright fr~ii quasars up to z ~ 5 and opens a windowon the behaviour of the brightest fr~i sources. a close investigation of thespace density of radio loud quasars also suggests a differential evolution,with the more luminous sources showing a less pronounced cut-off at high z whencompared with the less luminous ones.

astro-ph;0607672	tomography of the intergalactic medium with ly-alpha forests in close  qso pairs	we study the three-dimensional distribution of non virialised matter at z~2using high resolution spectra of qso pairs and simulated spectra drawn fromcosmological hydrodynamical simulations. we have collected the largest sampleof qso pairs ever observed with uves at the eso-vlt, with angular separationsbetween ~1 and 14 arcmin. the observed correlation functions of the transmittedflux in the hi lyman alpha forest along and transverse to the lines of sightare in good agreement implying that the distortions in redshift space due topeculiar velocities are small. the clustering signal is significant up tovelocity separations of ~200 km/s, or about 3 h^{-1} comoving mpc. the regionsat lower overdensity (rho/&lt;rho&gt; &lt; 6.5) are still clustered but on smallerscales (delta v &lt; 100 km/s). the observed and simulated correlation functionsare compatible at the 3 sigma level. a better concordance is obtained when onlythe low overdensity regions are selected for the analysis or when the effectiveoptical depth of the simulated spectra is increased artificially, suggesting adeficiency of strong lines in the simulated spectra. we found that also a lowervalue of the power-law index of the temperature-density relation for the lymanalpha forest gas improves the agreement between observed and simulated results.if confirmed, this would be consistent with other observations favouring a lateheii reionization epoch (at z~3). we remark the detection of a significantclustering signal in the cross correlation coefficient at a transverse velocityseparation delta v_{\perp} ~500 km/s whose origin needs further investigation.

astro-ph;0609068	the galaxy mass function up to z=4 in the goods-music sample: into the  epoch of formation of massive galaxies	the goal of this work is to measure the evolution of the galaxy stellar massfunction and of the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, in orderto study the assembly of massive galaxies in the high redshift universe. wehave used the goods-music catalog, containing ~3000 ks-selected galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage extending from the u band to the spitzer 8 micronband, of which 27% have spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fraction haveaccurate photometric redshifts. on this sample we have applied a standardfitting procedure to measure stellar masses. we compute the galaxy stellar massfunction and the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, taking intoproper account the biases and incompleteness effects. within the well knowntrend of global decline of the stellar mass density with redshift, we show thatthe decline of the more massive galaxies may be described by an exponentialtimescale of ~6 gyrs up to z~1.5, and proceeds much faster thereafter, with anexponential timescale of ~0.6 gyrs. we also show that there is some evidencefor a differential evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, with low massgalaxies evolving faster than more massive ones up to z~1-1.5 and that thegalaxy stellar mass function remains remarkably flat (i.e. with a slope closeto the local one) up to z~1-1.3. the observed behaviour of the galaxy stellarmass function is consistent with a scenario where about 50% of present-daymassive galaxies formed at a vigorous rate in the epoch between redshift 4 and1.5, followed by a milder evolution until the present-day epoch.

astro-ph;9710174	the uv background and the lyman alpha clouds at high redshift	the estimate of the ionizing uv background through the proximity effectanalysis is discussed. taking into account the correct bending of the columndensity distribution which appears in high resolution high s/n data, a value ofthe uv background ~5x10^{-22} cgs is obtained in the redshift interval z=1.7-4without indication of any appreciable redshift evolution. inferences on thespectral shape of the uv background between the hi and heii edges are providedby the study of metal line ratios like siiv/civ in optically thin systems. thepresence of a jump near the heii edge seems favoured at very high redshiftsz&gt;3. an increasing heii jump with increasing redshift can be responsible forthe decreasing in the minimum temperatures of the lyman alpha clouds withincreasing z. new studies of the cosmic evolution of star-forming galaxiesallow the estimate of a galaxy-dominated uv background intensity ~1.3 x10^{-21}f_{esc} cgs at z=0.5 where f_{esc}&lt;20% is the escape fraction of ionizing uvphotons from the galaxies. finally it is also shown that in a uv backgrounddominated by qsos and/or star-forming galaxies the cosmological baryon densityof the lyman alpha clouds decreases rapidly with cosmic time possibly due toincreasing bulk heating in the intergalactic medium with cosmic time.

astro-ph;9711067	the optical-uv continuum of a sample of qsos	the average optical-uv continuum shape of qsos has been investigated usingspectra of 62 qsos having good relative photometric calibrations. the qsospectra were extracted from two complete color selected samples in themagnitude intervals b ~ 16-20. the analysis was performed fitting power-lawcontinua (f proportional to nu^(alpha)) in well defined rest-frame wavelengthintervals after removing regions of the spectrum affected by strong emissionlines or weak emission bumps. the average slope in the rest-frame optical-uvregion 1200 - 5500 a shows a rapid change around the 3000 a emission bump withalpha=0.15 longward of it and alpha=-0.65 at shorter wavelengths. althoughthese average slopes have been obtained using spectra of qsos with differentluminosities and redshifts, there are no significant correlations of theaverage spectral index with these quantities. for a few qsos in the sample wewere able to measure the same softening of the spectral shape within theindividual spectrum. these results have significant consequences on theestimate of the cosmological evolution of the optically selected qsos as theyaffect, for instance, the k-corrections. new k-corrections in the b, v, r andgr bands were computed. the derived average spectral shape in the optical-uvband puts interesting constraints on the expected emission mechanisms.

astro-ph;9802013	star-formation at z=4.7 in the environment of the qso br1202-07	we present here the spectrum of the galaxy companion to the z=4.7 quasarbr1202-0725, in the optical range 6000-9000 a, corresponding to 1050-1580 arest-frame. we detect a strong lya emission line at z=4.702, with an integratedflux of 2x10^{-16} ergs/cm^2/s, and a uv continuum longward of the lya emissionat a flux level of 3x10^{-19}ergs/cm^2/s/a. we fail to detect any civ[1550]emission with a 3 sigma upper limit of 3x10^{-17} ergs/cm^2/s $. we show thatthe ratio between lya and continuum intensity and the absence of a strong civemission imply that the uv continuum radiation is the result of an intensestar-formation activity rather than of a reprocessing of the qso flux. thetotal estimated sfr of this z=4.7 star-forming region is about 15-54 msun/yr,depending on the imf and the metallicity. the present data suggest that the lyaemission has a velocity and spatial structure, with possible velocitydifferences of about 500 km/s on scales of few kpc. these velocity patterns maybe a signature of collapsing or merging phenomena in the qso and itsenvironment, as expected from current models of galaxy formation at high z.

astro-ph;9802282	erratum on the qso evolution derived from the hbqs and other complete  qso surveys	an eso key programme dedicated to an homogeneous bright qso survey (hbqs) hasbeen completed. 327 qsos (mb&lt;-23, 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.2) have been selected over 555 deg^2with 15&lt;b&lt;18.75. for b&lt;16.4 the qso surface density turns out to be a factor2.2 higher than what measured by the pg survey, corresponding to a surfacedensity of 0.013+/-.006 deg^{-2}. if the edinburgh qso survey is included, anoverdensity of a factor 2.7 is observed, corresponding to a density of0.016+/-0.005 deg^{-2}. in order to derive the qso optical luminosity function(lf) we used monte carlo simulations that take into account of the selectioncriteria, photometric errors and qso spectral slope distribution. the lf can berepresented with a pure luminosity evolution (l(z)\propto(1+z)^k) of a twopower law both for q_0=0.5 and q_0=0.1. for q_0=0.5 k=3.26, slower than theprevious boyle's (1992) estimations of k=3.45. a flatter slope beta=-3.72 ofthe bright part of the lf is also required. the observed overdensity of brightqsos is concentrated at z&lt;0.6. it results that in the range 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6 theluminosity function is flatter than observed at higher redshifts. in thisredshift range, for mb&lt;-25, 32 qsos are observed instead of 19 expected fromour best-fit ple model. this feature requires a luminosity dependent luminosityevolution in order to satisfactorily represent the data in the whole 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.2interval.

astro-ph;9802340	the photometric redshift distribution and evolutionary properties of  galaxies up to z= 4.5 in the field of the quasar br1202-0725	we present a deep bvrik multicolor catalog of galaxies in the field of thehigh redshift (z=4.7) quasar br 1202-0725. reliable colors have been measuredfor galaxies selected down to r=25. the choice of the optical filters has beenoptimized to define a robust multicolor selection of galaxies at 3.8&lt;z&lt; 4.5.within this interval the surface density of galaxy candidates with z~4 in thisfield is 1 arcmin^{-2}. photometric redshifts have been derived for thegalaxies in the field with the maximum likelihood analysis using the gissellibrary of ~10^6 synthetic spectra. the accuracy of the method used has beendiscussed and tested using galaxies in the hubble deep field (hdf) with knownspectroscopic redshifts and accurate photometry. a peak in the redshiftdistribution is present at z~0.6 with relatively few galaxies at z&gt;1.5. atvariance with brighter surveys (i&lt;22.5) there is a tail in the distributiontowards high redshifts up to z~4. the luminosity function at z~0.6 shows asteepening for m_b&gt;-19. the observed cosmological ultraviolet luminositydensity is computed in the overall redshift interval z=0.3-4.5 reaching a value2x10^{19} w/hz/mpc^3 at z~0.8. we have derived in a homogeneous way, using thegissel libraries, the physical parameters connected with the fitted spectralenergy distributions. the bulk of the blue intermediate redshift populationwith z=0.4-1 mostly consists of very young star-forming galaxies with a medianstarburst age of the order of a few 10^8 yr and typical mass in luminous stars~2x10^8 mo.

astro-ph;9806204	the size and geometry of the ly_alpha clouds	spectra of the qso pair q0307-195a,b have been obtained in the ly-alphaforest (3660 - 3930 a) and c iv (4720 - 4850 a) regions with a fwhm resolutionbetween 0.7 and 0.5 a. 46 lines have been detected in the spectrum of object awhile 36 in the spectrum of object b, of them 29 and 20 were identified asly-alpha absorptions respectively. the present observations have beensupplemented with data of comparable quality on other 7 qso pairs available inthe literature to give an enlarged sample of 217 ly-alpha lines with restequivalent width w_o &gt; 0.3 a. the analysis of the hits (i.e. when an absorptionline appears in both qso spectra) and misses (i.e. when a line is seen in anyof the qso spectra, but no line is seen in the other), carried out with animproved statistical approach, indicates that the absorbers have typically alarge size (h = h_0/100 km/s/mpc, q_0 = 0.5): r = 362 h^{-1} kpc, with 95 %confidence limits 298&lt; r &lt;426 h^{-1} kpc and r = 412 h^{-1} kpc, with 95 %confidence limits 333&lt; r &lt;514 h^{-1} kpc for the radius in idealized sphericaland disc geometries, respectively. the present data do not allow to establishany correlation of the typical inferred size with the proper separation or withthe redshift of the pairs. the correlation between the observed equivalentwidths of the absorbers in the adjacent lines of sight becomes poorer andpoorer with increasing proper separation. a disc geometry with a column densityprofile n(r) \propto (r/r_0)^{-gamma}, gamma=4, is found to reasonablyreproduce the data with r_0 ~ 100-200 h^{-1} kpc, but also spherical cloudswith the same column density profile and a power-law distribution of radii maygive a satisfactory representation of the observations.

astro-ph;9809258	the gravitational lensing in the qso 1208+10 from the proximity effect  in its lyman alpha forest	the quasar q1208+1011 (z_{em}=3.8) is the second highest redshift doublequasar ever detected. several indications point toward it being a gravitationallensed system, although a definitive proof is still lacking. we present newevidence of its lensed nature based on the weakness of the ``proximity effect''measured in the high resolution lyman absorption spectrum of the qso. aluminosity amplification as large as 22 has been derived from this analysis.indications on the redshift of the lensing galaxy can be obtained from theanalysis of the intervening heavy element absorption systems discovered in theqso high resolution spectrum. on statistical and dynamical grounds a mgiisystem present at z=1.13 appears as the most likely candidate for the lensinggalaxy. we compare the observed parameters with a simple isothermal model forthe lens to derive the properties of the lensing galaxy. the resultingmagnification factor is smaller, although marginally consistent with thatderived by the analysis of the proximity effect.

astro-ph;9811475	probing the large scale structure with qsos and radio-galaxies	qsos and radio-galaxies, together with the cmb, ``normal'' galaxies andclusters, represent the main source of information about the origin andevolution of the large scale structure. they can be used either directly, astracers of the density peaks, or as cosmic lighthouses, probing the universealong the line of sight with their conspicuous flow of photons. the amplitudeof the qso clustering has been measured to be $r_o \simeq 6 \hmpc$ at $z\sim 2$and appears to increase with redshift. these properties are consistent with ascenario in which the quasars, with a lifetime of $t \sim 10^8 yr$, sparselysample halos of mass greater than $m_{min} \sim 10^{12}-10^{13} h^{-1}$m$_{\odot}$. radio-galaxies are found to cluster on similar scales. the studyof qso and radio-galaxy environments is in qualitative agreement with theirclustering properties. absorption-line systems observed in high-resolutionspectra of qsos show structure, including voids/underdensities andoverdensities, from the smallest scales to tens of mpc. qso pairs, groups andlenses allow us to get a 3-d glimpse of the absorbers, providing invaluableinformation about their size, ionization, mass. great progress in this field isexpected from the new instrumentation coming into operation at the 8-m classtelescopes.

astro-ph;9909126	high redshift evolution of optically and ir-selected galaxies: a  comparison with cdm scenarios	a combination of ground-based (ntt and vlt) and hst (hdf-n and hdf-s) publicimaging surveys have been used to collect a sample of 1712 i-selected and 319$k\leq 21$ galaxies. photometric redshifts have been obtained for all thesegalaxies. the results have been compared with the prediction of an analyticrendition of the current cdm hierarchical models for galaxy formation. we focusin particular on two observed quantities: the galaxy redshift distribution atk&lt;21 and the evolution of the uv luminosity density. the derived photometricredshift distribution is in agreement with the hierarchical cdm prediction,with a fraction of only 5% of galaxies detected at z&gt;2. this result stronglysupports hierarchical scenarios where present-day massive galaxies are theresult of merging processes. the observed uv luminosity density in thei-selected sample is confined within a factor of 4 over the whole range0&lt;z&lt;4.5. cdm models in a critical universe are not able to produce the densityof uv photons that is observed at z&gt;3. cdm models in $\lambda$-dominateduniverse are in better agreement at 3&lt;z&lt;4.5, but predict a pronounced peak atz~1.5 and a drop by a factor of 8 from z=1.5 to z=4 that is not observed in thedata. we conclude that improvements are required in the treatment of thephysical processes directly related to the sfr, e.g. the starbust activity inmerger processes and/or different feedback to the star formation activity.
