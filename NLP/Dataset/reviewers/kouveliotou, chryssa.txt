0706.1518	grb051022: physical parameters and extinction of a prototype dark burst	grb051022 was undetected to deep limits in early optical observations, butprecise astrometry from radio and x-ray showed that it most likely originatedin a galaxy at z~0.8. we report radio, optical, near infra-red and x-rayobservations of grb051022. using the available x-ray and radio data, we modelthe afterglow and calculate the energetics of the afterglow, finding it to bean order of magnitude lower than that of the prompt emission. the broad-bandmodeling also allows us to precisely define various other physical parametersand the minimum required amount of extinction, to explain the absence of anoptical afterglow. our observations suggest a high extinction, at least 2.3magnitudes in the infrared (j) and at least 5.4 magnitudes in the optical (u)in the host-galaxy restframe. such high extinctions are unusual for grbs, andlikely indicate a geometry where our line of sight to the burst passes througha dusty region in the host that is not directly co-located with the burstitself.

1006.2214	photospheric radius expansion during magnetar bursts	on august 24th 2008 the new magnetar sgr 0501+4516 (discovered by swift)emitted a bright burst with a pronounced double-peak structure in hard x-rays,reminiscent of the double-peak temporal structure seen in some brightthermonuclear bursts on accreting neutron stars. in the latter case this is dueto photospheric radius expansion (pre): when the flux reaches the eddingtonlimit, the photosphere expands and cools so that emission becomes softer anddrops temporarily out of the x-ray band, re-appearing as the photospheresettles back down. we consider the factors necessary to generate double-peakedpre events, and show that such a mechanism could plausibly operate in magnetarbursts, despite the vastly different emission process. identification of themagnetic eddington limit in a magnetar would constrain magnetic field anddistance and could, in principle, enable a measurement of gravitationalredshift. it would also locate the emitting region at the neutron star surface,constraining the burst trigger mechanism. conclusive confirmation of pre eventswill require more detailed radiative models for bursts. however for sgr0501+4516 the predicted critical flux (using the magnetic field strengthinferred from timing and the distance suggested by its probable location in theperseus arm of our galaxy) is consistent with that observed in the august 24thburst.

1007.2228	the connection between thermal and non-thermal emission in gamma-ray  bursts: general considerations and grb090902b as a case study	photospheric (thermal) emission is inherent to the gamma-ray burst (grb)"fireball" model. we show here, that inclusion of this component in theanalysis of the grb prompt emission phase naturally explains some of the promptgrb spectra seen by the fermi satellite over its entire energy band. thesub-mev peak is explained as multi-color black body emission, and the highenergy tail, extending up to the gev band, results from roughly similarcontributions of synchrotron emission, synchrotron self compton(ssc) andcomptonization of the thermal photons by energetic electrons originating afterdissipation of the kinetic energy above the photosphere. we show how thisanalysis method results in a complete, self consistent picture of the physicalconditions at both emission sites of the thermal and non-thermal radiation. westudy the connection between the thermal and non-thermal parts of the spectrum,and show how the values of the free model parameters are deduced from the data.we demonstrate our analysis method on grb090902b: we deduce a lorentz factor inthe range 920 &lt;= \eta &lt;= 1070, photospheric radius r_{ph} ~ 7.2 - 8.4 * 10^{11}cm and dissipation radius r_\gamma &gt;= 3.5 - 4.1 * 10^{15} cm. by comparison toafterglow data, we deduce that a large fraction, epsilon_d ~85% - 95% of thekinetic energy is dissipated, and that large fraction, ~equipartition of thisenergy is carried by the electrons and the magnetic field. this high value ofepsilon_d questions the "internal shock" scenario as the main energydissipation mechanism for this grb.

1009.5045	time-resolved spectroscopy of the 3 brightest and hardest short  gamma-ray bursts observed with the fgst gamma-ray burst monitor	from july 2008 to october 2009, the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) on boardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fgst) has detected 320 gamma-ray bursts(grbs). about 20% of these events are classified as short based on their t90duration below 2 s. we present here for the first time time-resolvedspectroscopy at timescales as short as 2 ms for the three brightest short grbsobserved with gbm. the time-integrated spectra of the events deviate from theband function, indicating the existence of an additional spectral component,which can be fit by a power-law with index ~-1.5. the time-integrated epeakvalues exceed 2 mev for two of the bursts, and are well above the valuesobserved in the brightest long grbs. their epeak values and their low-energypower-law indices ({\alpha}) confirm that short grbs are harder than long ones.we find that short grbs are very similar to long ones, but with light curvescontracted in time and with harder spectra stretched towards higher energies.in our time-resolved spectroscopy analysis, we find that the epeak values rangefrom a few tens of kev up to more than 6 mev. in general, the hardnessevolutions during the bursts follows their flux/intensity variations, similarto long bursts. however, we do not always see the epeak leading the light-curverises, and we confirm the zero/short average light-curve spectral lag below 1mev, already established for short grbs. we also find that the time-resolvedlow-energy power-law indices of the band function mostly violate the limitsimposed by the synchrotron models for both slow and fast electron cooling andmay require additional emission processes to explain the data. finally, weinterpreted these observations in the context of the current existing modelsand emission mechanisms for the prompt emission of grbs.

1010.2679	when a standard candle flickers	the crab nebula is the only hard x-ray source in the sky that is both brightenough and steady enough to be easily used as a standard candle. as a result,it has been used as a normalization standard by most x-ray/gamma raytelescopes. although small-scale variations in the nebula are well-known, sincethe start of science operations of the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) inaugust 2008, a ~ 7% (70 mcrab) decline has been observed in the overall crabnebula flux in the 15 - 50 kev band, measured with the earth occultationtechnique. this decline is independently confirmed with three otherinstruments: the swift burst alert telescope (swift/bat), the rossi x-raytiming explorer proportional counter array (rxte/pca), and the internationalgamma-ray astrophysics laboratory imager on board integral (ibis). a similardecline is also observed in the ~3 - 15 kev data from the rxte/pca and integraljoint european monitor (jem-x) and in the 50 - 100 kev band with gbm andintegral/ibis. observations from 100 to 500 kev with gbm suggest that thedecline may be larger at higher energies. the pulsed flux measured withrxte/pca since 1999 is consistent with the pulsar spin-down, indicating thatthe observed changes are nebular. correlated variations in the crab nebula fluxon a ~3 year timescale are also seen independently with the pca, bat, and ibisfrom 2005 to 2008, with a flux minimum in april 2007. as of august 2010, thecurrent flux has declined below the 2007 minimum.

1101.1450	long term radiative behavior of sgr 1900+14	the prolific magnetar sgr 1900+14 showed two outbursts in the last decade andhas been closely monitored in the x-rays to track the changes in its radiativeproperties. we use archival chandra and xmm-newton observations of sgr 1900+14to construct a history of its spectrum and persistent x-ray flux spanning aperiod of about seven years. we show that the decline of its x-ray flux inthese two outburst episodes follows the same trend. the flux begins to declinepromptly and rapidly subsequent to the flares, then decreases gradually forabout 600 days, at which point it resumes a more rapid decline. utilizing thehigh quality spectral data in each epoch, we also study the spectralcoevolution of the source with its flux. we find that neither the magneticfield strength nor the magnetospheric properties change over the period spannedby the observations, while the surface temperature as well as the inferredemitting area both decline with time following both outbursts. we also showthat the source reached the same minimum flux level in its decline from thesetwo subsequent outbursts, suggesting that this flux level may be its steadyquiescent flux.

1101.2458	a new derivation of grb jet opening angles from the prompt gamma-ray  emission	the jet opening angle of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is an important parameterfor determining the characteristics of the progenitor, and the informationcontained in the opening angle gives insight into the relativistic outflow andthe total energy that is contained in the burst. unfortunately, a confidentinference of the jet opening angle usually requires broadband measurement ofthe afterglow of the grb, from the x-ray down to the radio and from minutes todays after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. forthis reason, very few of all detected grbs have constrained jet angles. wepresent an alternative approach to derive jet opening angles from the promptemission of the grb, given that the grb has a measurable epeak and fluence, andwhich does not require any afterglow measurements. we present the distributionof derived jet opening angles for the first two years of the fermi gamma-rayburst monitor (gbm) operation, and we compare a number of our derived openingangles to the reported opening angles using the traditional afterglow method.we derive the collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy, e_{\gamma}, for grbs withredshift and find that some of the grbs in our sample are inconsistent with aproto-magnetar progenitor. finally, we show that the use of the derived jetopening angles results in a tighter correlation between the rest-frame epeakand e_{\gamma} than has previously been presented, which places long grbs andshort grbs onto one empirical power law.

1101.3325	first-year results of broadband spectroscopy of the brightest fermi-gbm  gamma-ray bursts	we present here our results of the temporal and spectral analysis of a sampleof 52 bright and hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed with the fermi gamma-rayburst monitor (gbm) during its first year of operation (july 2008-july 2009).our sample was selected from a total of 253 gbm grbs based on each event peakcount rate measured between 0.2 and 40mev. the final sample comprised 34 longand 18 short grbs. these numbers show that the gbm sample contains a muchlarger fraction of short grbs, than the cgro/batse data set, which we explainas the result of our (different) selection criteria and the improved gbmtrigger algorithms, which favor collection of short, bright grbs over batse. afirst by-product of our selection methodology is the determination of adetection threshold from the gbm data alone, above which grbs most likely willbe detected in the mev/gev range with the large area telescope (lat) onboardfermi. this predictor will be very useful for future multiwavelength grb followups with ground and space based observatories. further we have estimated theburst durations up to 10mev and for the first time expanded the duration-energyrelationship in the grb light curves to high energies. we confirm that grbdurations decline with energy as a power law with index approximately -0.4, aswas found earlier with the batse data and we also notice evidence of a possiblecutoff or break at higher energies. finally, we performed time-integratedspectral analysis of all 52 bursts and compared their spectral parameters withthose obtained with the larger data sample of the batse data. we find that thetwo parameter data sets are similar and confirm that short grbs are in generalharder than longer ones.

1107.2121	fermi/gbm observations of sgr j0501+4516 bursts	we present our temporal and spectral analyses of 29 bursts from sgrj0501+4516, detected with the gamma-ray burst monitor onboard the fermigamma-ray space telescope during the 13 days of the source activation in 2008(august 22 to september 3). we find that the t90 durations of the bursts can befit with a log-normal distribution with a mean value of ~ 123 ms. we alsoestimate for the first time event durations of soft gamma repeater (sgr) burstsin photon space (i.e., using their deconvolved spectra) and find that these arevery similar to the t90s estimated in count space (following a log-normaldistribution with a mean value of ~ 124 ms). we fit the time-integrated spectrafor each burst and the time-resolved spectra of the five brightest bursts withseveral models. we find that a single power law with an exponential cutoffmodel fits all 29 bursts well, while 18 of the events can also be fit with twoblack body functions. we expand on the physical interpretation of these twomodels and we compare their parameters and discuss their evolution. we showthat the time-integrated and time-resolved spectra reveal that epeak decreaseswith energy flux (and fluence) to a minimum of ~30 kev at f=8.7e-6 erg/cm2/s,increasing steadily afterwards. two more sources exhibit a similar trend: sgrsj1550-5418 and 1806-20. the isotropic luminosity corresponding to these fluxvalues is roughly similar for all sources (0.4-1.5 e40 erg/s).

1107.4050	extended tails from sgr 1806-20 bursts	in 2004, sgr 1806-20 underwent a period of intense and long-lasting burstactivity that included the giant flare of 27 december 2004 -- the most intenseextra-solar transient event ever detected at earth. during this active episode,we routinely monitored the source with rossi x-ray timing explorer andoccasionally with chandra. during the course of these observations, weidentified two relatively bright bursts observed with konus-wind in hard x-raysthat were followed by extended x-ray tails or afterglows lasting hundreds tothousands of seconds. here, we present detailed spectral and temporal analysisof these events observed about 6 and 1.5 months prior to the 27 december 2004giant flare. we find that both x-ray tails are consistent with a coolingblackbody of constant radius. these spectral results are qualitatively similarto those of the burst afterglows recorded from sgr 1900+14 and recently fromsgr 1550-5418. however, the latter two sources exhibit significant increase intheir pulsed x-ray intensity following the burst, while we did not detect anysignificant changes in the rms pulsed amplitude during the sgr 1806-20 events.moreover, we find that the fraction of energy partitioned to the burst (promptenergy release) and the tail (afterglow) differs by an order of magnitudebetween sgr 1900+14 and sgr 1806-20. we suggest that such differences can beattributed to differences in the crustal heating mechanism of these neutronstars combined with the geometry of the emitting areas.

1107.6024	constraints on the synchrotron shock model for the fermi gbm gamma-ray  burst 090820a	discerning the radiative dissipation mechanism for prompt emission ingamma-ray bursts (grbs) requires detailed spectroscopic modeling that straddlesthe $\nu f_{\nu}$ peak in the 100 kev - 1 mev range. historically, empiricalfits such as the popular band function have been employed with considerablesuccess in interpreting the observations. while extrapolations of the bandparameters can provide some physical insight into the emission mechanismsresponsible for grbs, these inferences do not provide a unique way ofdiscerning between models. by fitting physical models directly this degeneracycan be broken, eliminating the need for empirical functions; our analysis hereoffers a first step in this direction. one of the oldest, and leading,theoretical ideas for the production of the prompt signal is the synchrotronshock model (ssm). here we explore the applicability of this model to a bright{\it fermi} gbm burst with a simple temporal structure, grb {\it 090820}a. ourinvestigation implements, for the first time, thermal and non-thermalsynchrotron emissivities in the rmfit forward-folding spectral analysissoftware often used in gbm burst studies. we find that these synchrotronemissivities, together with a blackbody shape, provide at least as good a matchwith the data as the band grb spectral fitting function. this success isachieved in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectral fits.

1109.4064	temporal deconvolution study of long and short gamma-ray burst light  curves	the light curves of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are believed to result frominternal shocks reflecting the activity of the grb central engine. theirtemporal deconvolution can reveal potential differences in the properties ofthe central engines in the two populations of grbs which are believed tooriginate from the deaths of massive stars (long) and from mergers of compactobjects (short). we present here the results of the temporal analysis of 42grbs detected with the gamma-ray burst monitor onboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope. we deconvolved the profiles into pulses, which we fit withlognormal functions. the distributions of the pulse shape parameters andintervals between neighboring pulses are distinct for both burst types and alsofit with lognormal functions. we have studied the evolution of these parametersin different energy bands and found that they differ between long and shortbursts. we discuss the implications of the differences in the temporalproperties of long and short bursts within the framework of the internal shockmodel for grb prompt emission.

1207.1434	broadband spectral investigations of sgr j1550-5418 bursts	we present the results of our broadband spectral analysis of 42 sgrj1550-5418 bursts simultaneously detected with the swift/x-ray telescope (xrt)and the fermi/gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm), during the 2009 january activeepisode of the source. the unique spectral and temporal capabilities of the xrtwindowed timing mode have allowed us to extend the gbm spectral coverage forthese events down to the x-ray domain (0.5-10 kev). our earlier analysis of thegbm data found that the sgr j1550-5418 burst spectra were described equallywell with a comptonized model or with two blackbody functions; the two modelswere statistically indistinguishable. our new broadband (0.5 - 200 kev)spectral fits show that, on average, the burst spectra are better describedwith two blackbody functions than with the comptonized model. thus, our jointxrt/gbm analysis clearly shows for the first time that the sgr j1550-5418 burstspectra might naturally be expected to exhibit a more truly thermalizedcharacter, such as a two-blackbody or even a multi-blackbody signal. using theswift and rxte timing ephemeris for sgr j1550-5418 we construct thedistribution of the xrt burst counts with spin phase and find that it is notcorrelated with the persistent x-ray emission pulse phase from sgr j1550-5418.these results indicate that the burst emitting sites on the neutron star neednot be co-located with hot spots emitting the bulk of the persistent x-rayemission. finally, we show that there is a significant pulse phase dependenceof the xrt burst counts, likely demonstrating that the surface magnetic fieldof sgr j1550-5418 is not uniform over the emission zone, since it isanticipated that regions with stronger surface magnetic field could triggerbursts more efficiently.

1212.1011	quasi-periodic oscillations and broadband variability in short magnetar  bursts	the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in magnetar giant flareshas opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. however, with onlythree giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient qualityto search for qpos, such analysis is seriously data limited. we set out aprocedure for doing qpo searches in the far more numerous, short, lessenergetic magnetar bursts. the short, transient nature of these bursts requiresthe implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliableinferences. using bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as acombination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at highfrequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. we useempirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodicand quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies. we compare our methodwith previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole moreconservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives. weillustrate our bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from themagnetar sgr j0501+4516 observed by the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor, and wefind no evidence for the presence of qpos in any of the bursts in the unbinnedspectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst.however, whether this signal is due to a genuine quasi-periodic process, or canbe attributed to unmodeled effects in the noise is at this point a matter ofinterpretation.

1303.1370	new methods for timing analysis of transient events, applied to  fermi/gbm magnetar bursts	in order to discern the physical nature of many gamma-ray sources in the sky,we must look not only in spectral and spatial dimensions, but also understandtheir temporal variability. however, timing analysis of sources with a highlytransient nature, such as magnetar bursts, is difficult: standard fouriertechniques developed for long-term variability generally observed, for example,from agn often do not apply. here, we present newly developed timing methodsapplicable to transient events of all kinds, and show their successfulapplication to magnetar bursts observed with fermi/gbm. magnetars are a primesubject for timing studies, thanks to the detection of quasi-periodicities inmagnetar giant flares and their potential to help shed light on the structureof neutron stars. using state-of-the art statistical techniques, we search forquasi-periodicities (qpos) in a sample of bursts from soft gamma repeater sgrj0501+4516 observed with fermi/gbm and provide upper limits for potential qpodetections. additionally, for the first time, we characterise the broadbandvariability behaviour of magnetar bursts and highlight how this new informationcould provide us with another way to probe these mysterious objects.

1402.1079	nustar results and future plans for magnetar and rotation-powered pulsar  observations	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) is the first focusing hardx-ray mission in orbit and operates in the 3-79 kev range. nustar's sensitivityis roughly two orders of magnitude better than previous missions in this energyband thanks to its superb angular resolution. since its launch in 2012 june,nustar has performed excellently and observed many interesting sourcesincluding four magnetars, two rotation-powered pulsars and the cataclysmicvariable ae aquarii. nustar also discovered 3.76-s pulsations from thetransient source sgr j1745-29 recently found by swift very close to thegalactic center, clearly identifying the source as a transient magnetar. formagnetar 1e 1841-045, we show that the spectrum is well fit by an absorbedblackbody plus broken power-law model with a hard power-law photon index of~1.3. this is consistent with previous results by integral and rxte. we alsofind an interesting double-peaked pulse profile in the 25-35 kev band. for aeaquarii, we show that the spectrum can be described by a multi-temperaturethermal model or a thermal plus non-thermal model; a multi-temperature thermalmodel without a non-thermal component cannot be ruled out. furthermore, we donot see a spiky pulse profile in the hard x-ray band, as previously reportedbased on suzaku observations. for other magnetars and rotation-powered pulsarsobserved with nustar, data analysis results will be soon available.

1404.2756	quasi-periodic oscillations in short recurring bursts of the soft-gamma  repeater j1550-5418	the discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in magnetar giant flareshas opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. the scarcity ofgiant flares makes a search for qpos in the shorter, far more numerous burstsfrom soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) desirable. in huppenkothen et al (2013), wedeveloped a bayesian method for searching for qpos in short magnetar bursts,taking into account the effects of the complicated burst structure, and haveshown its feasibility on a small sample of bursts. here, we apply the samemethod to a much larger sample from a burst storm of 286 bursts from sgrj1550-5418. we report a candidate signal at 260 hz in a search of theindividual bursts, which is fairly broad. we also find two qpos at 93 hz andone at 127 hz, when averaging periodograms from a number of bursts inindividual triggers, at frequencies close to qpos previously observed inmagnetar giant flares. finally, for the first time, we explore the overallburst variability in the sample, and report a weak anti-correlation between thepower-law index of the broadband model characterising aperiodic burstvariability, and the burst duration: shorter bursts have steeper power lawindices than longer bursts. this indicates that longer bursts vary over abroader range of time scales, and are not simply longer versions of the shortbursts.

1406.3377	nustar observations of x-ray bursts from the magnetar 1e 1048.1-5937	we report the detection of eight bright x-ray bursts from the 6.5-s magnetar1e 1048.1-5937, during a 2013 july observation campaign with the nuclearspectroscopic telescope array (nustar). we study the morphological and spectralproperties of these bursts and their evolution with time. the bursts resultedin count rate increases by orders of magnitude, sometimes limited by thedetector dead time, and showed blackbody spectra with kt=6-8 kev in the t90duration of 1-4 s, similar to earlier bursts detected from the source. we findthat the spectra during the tail of the bursts can be modeled with an absorbedblackbody with temperature decreasing with flux. the bursts flux decaysfollowed a power-law of index 0.8-0.9. in the burst tail spectra, we detect a~13 kev emission feature, similar to those reported in previous bursts fromthis source as well as from other magnetars observed with the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte). we explore possible origins of the spectral featuresuch as proton cyclotron emission, which implies a magnetic field strength ofb~2x10^15 g in the emission region. however, the consistency of the energy ofthe feature in different objects requires further explanation.

1408.1644	a broadband x-ray study of the geminga pulsar with nustar and xmm-newton	we report on the first hard x-ray detection of the geminga pulsar above 10kev using a 150 ks observation with the nustar observatory. the double-peakedpulse profile of non-thermal emission seen in the soft x-ray band persists athigher energies. broadband phase-integrated spectra over the 0.2-20 kev bandwith nustar and archival xmm-newton data do not fit to a conventionaltwo-component model of a blackbody plus power-law, but instead exhibit spectralhardening above ~5 kev. we find two spectral models fit the data well: (1) ablackbody (kt1 ~ 42 ev) with a broken power-law (gamma1 ~ 2.0, gamma2 ~ 1.4 andebreak ~ 3.4 kev), and (2) two blackbody components (kt1 ~ 44 ev and kt2 ~ 195ev) with a power-law component (gamma ~ 1.7). in both cases, the extrapolationof the rayleigh-jeans tail of the thermal component is consistent with the uvdata, while the non-thermal component overpredicts the near-infrared data,requiring a spectral flattening at e ~ 0.01 - 1 kev. while strong phasevariation of the power-law index is present below ~5 kev, our phase-resolvedspectroscopy with nustar indicates that another hard non-thermal component withgamma ~ 1.3 emerges above ~5 kev. the spectral hardening in non-thermal x-rayemission as well as spectral flattening between the optical and x-ray bandsargue against the conjecture that a single power-law may account formulti-wavelength non-thermal spectra of middle-aged pulsars.

1410.7602	synchrotron cooling in energetic gamma-ray bursts observed by the fermi  gamma-ray burst monitor	we study the time-resolved spectra of eight grbs observed by fermi gbm in itsfirst five years of mission, with 1 kev - 1 mev fluence $f&gt;1.0\times10^{-4}$erg cm$^{-2}$ and signal-to-noise level $\text{s/n}\geq10.0$ above 900 kev. weaim to constrain in detail the spectral properties of grb prompt emission on atime-resolved basis and to discuss the theoretical implications of the fittingresults in the context of various prompt emission models. we performtime-resolved spectral analysis using a variable temporal binning techniqueaccording to optimal s/n criteria, resulting in a total of 299 time-resolvedspectra. we fit the band function to all spectra and obtain the distributionsfor the low-energy power-law index $\alpha$, the high-energy power-law index$\beta$, the peak energy in the observed $\nu f_\nu$ spectrum $e_\text{p}$, andthe difference between the low- and high-energy power-law indices $\deltas=\alpha-\beta$. using the distributions of $\delta s$ and $\beta$, theelectron population index $p$ is found to be consistent with the "moderatelyfast" scenario which fast- and slow-cooling scenarios cannot be distinguished.we also apply a physically motivated synchrotron model, which is a triplepower-law with constrained power-law indices and a blackbody component, to testfor consistency with a synchrotron origin for the prompt emission and obtainthe distributions for the two break energies $e_\text{b,1}$ and $e_\text{b,2}$,the middle segment power-law index $\beta$, and the planck function temperature$kt$. a synchrotron model is found consistent with the majority oftime-resolved spectra for these eight energetic fermi gbm bursts with goodhigh-energy photon statistics, as long as both the cooling and injection breakare included and the leftmost spectral slope is lifted either by inclusion of athermal component or when an evolving magnetic field is accounted for.

1501.00495	the needle in the 100 deg2 haystack: uncovering afterglows of fermi grbs  with the palomar transient factory	the fermi gamma-ray space telescope has greatly expanded the number andenergy window of observations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). however, the coarselocalizations of tens to a hundred square degrees provided by the fermi grbmonitor instrument have posed a formidable obstacle to locating the bursts'host galaxies, measuring their redshifts, and tracking their panchromaticafterglows. we have built a target-of-opportunity mode for the intermediatepalomar transient factory in order to perform targeted searches for fermiafterglows. here, we present the results of one year of this program: 8afterglow discoveries out of 35 searches. two of the bursts with detectedafterglows (grbs 130702a and 140606b) were at low redshift (z=0.145 and 0.384respectively) and had spectroscopically confirmed broad-line type icsupernovae. we present our broadband follow-up including spectroscopy as wellas x-ray, uv, optical, millimeter, and radio observations. we study possibleselection effects in the context of the total fermi and swift grb samples. weidentify one new outlier on the amati relation. we find that two bursts areconsistent with a mildly relativistic shock breaking out from the progenitorstar, rather than the ultra-relativistic internal shock mechanism that powersstandard cosmological bursts. finally, in the context of the zwicky transientfacility, we discuss how we will continue to expand this effort to find opticalcounterparts of binary neutron star mergers that may soon be detected byadvanced ligo and virgo.

1510.01647	impact of declining proposal success rates on scientific productivity	over the last decade proposal success rates in the fundamental sciences havedropped significantly. astronomy and related fields funded by nasa and nsf areno exception. data across agencies show that this is not principally the resultof a decline in proposal merit (the proportion of proposals receiving highrankings is largely unchanged), nor of a shift in proposer demographics(seniority, gender, and institutional affiliation have all remained unchanged),nor of an increase (beyond inflation) in the average requested funding perproposal, nor of an increase in the number of proposals per investigator in anyone year. rather, the statistics are consistent with a scenario in which agencybudgets for competed research are flat or decreasing in inflation-adjusteddollars, the overall population of investigators has grown, and a largerproportion of these investigators are resubmitting meritorious but unfundedproposals. this white paper presents statistics which support this conclusion,as well as recent research on the time cost of proposal writing versus that ofproducing publishable results. we conclude that an aspirational proposalsuccess rate of 30-35% would still provide a healthily competitive environmentfor researchers, would more fully utilize the scientific capacity of thecommunity's facilities and missions, and provide relief to the funding agencieswho face the logistics of ever-increasing volumes of proposals.

astro-ph;0003292	timing noise in sgr 1806-20	we have phase connected a sequence of rxte pca observations of sgr 1806-20covering 178 days. we find a simple secular spin-down model does not adequatelyfit the data. the period derivative varies gradually during the observationsbetween 8.1 and 11.7 * 10^-11 s/s (at its highest, ~40% larger than the longterm trend), while the average burst rate as seen with batse drops throughoutthe time interval. the phase residuals give no compelling evidence forperiodicity, but more closely resemble timing noise as seen in radio pulsars.the magnitude of the timing noise, however, is large relative to the noiselevel typically found in radio pulsars. combining these results with the noiselevels measured for some axps, we find all magnetar candidates have \delta_8values larger than those expected from a simple extrapolation of thecorrelation found in radio pulsars. we find that the timing noise in sgr1806-20 is greater than or equal to the levels found in some accreting systems(e.g., vela x-1, 4u 1538-52 and 4u 1626-67), but the spin-down of sgr 1806-20has thus far maintained coherence over 6 years. alternatively, an orbital modelwith a period p_orb = 733 days provides a statistically acceptable fit to thedata. if the phase residuals are created by doppler shifts from agravitationally bound companion, then the allowed parameter space for the massfunction (small) and orbital separation (large) rule out the possibility ofaccretion from the companion sufficient to power the persistent emission fromthe sgr.

0705.3713	the magnetar nature and the outburst mechanism of a transient anomalous  x-ray pulsar	anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) belong to a class of neutron stars believed toharbor the strongest magnetic fields in the universe, as indicated by theirenergetic bursts and their rapid spindowns. however, an unambiguous measurementof their surface field strengths has not been made to date. it is also notknown whether axp outbursts result from changes in the neutron star magneticfield or crust properties. here we report a spectroscopic measurement of thesurface magnetic field strength of an axp, xte j1810$-$197, and solidify itsmagnetar nature. the field strength obtained from detailed spectral analysisand modeling, b = (2.72$\pm$0.03)$\times10^{14}$ g, is remarkably close to thevalue inferred from the rate of spindown of this source and remains nearlyconstant during numerous observations spanning over an order of magnitude insource flux. the surface temperature, on the other hand, declines steadily anddramatically following the 2003 outburst of this source. our findingsdemonstrate that heating occurs in the upper neutron star crust during anoutburst and sheds light on the transient behaviour of axps.

astro-ph;0403523	long term spectral and timing behavior of the black hole candidate xte  j1908+094	we present the long term x-ray light curves, detailed spectral and timinganalyses of xte j1908+094 using the rossi x-ray timing explorer proportionalcounter array observations covering two outbursts in 2002 and early 2003. atthe onset of the first outburst, the source was found in a spectrally low/hardstate lasting for ~40 days, followed by a three day long transition to thehigh/soft state. the source flux (in 2$-$10 kev) reached $\sim$100 mcrab on2002 april 6, then decayed rapidly. in power spectra, we detect strongband-limited noise and varying low-frequency quasi periodic oscillations thatevolved from ~0.5 hz to ~5 hz during the initial low/hard state of the source.we find that the second outburst closely resembled the spectral evolution ofthe first. the x-ray transient's overall outburst characteristics lead us toclassify xte j1908+094 as a black-hole candidate. here we also derive precisex-ray position of the source using chandra observations which were performedduring the decay phase of the first outburst and following the second outburst.

astro-ph;0407144	the glast burst monitor	the next large nasa mission in the field of gamma-ray astronomy, glast, isscheduled for launch in 2007. aside from the main instrument lat (large-areatelescope), a gamma-ray telescope for the energy range between 20 mev and &gt; 100gev, a secondary instrument, the glast burst monitor (gbm), is foreseen. withthis monitor one of the key scientific objectives of the mission, thedetermination of the high-energy behaviour of gamma-ray bursts and transientscan be ensured. its task is to increase the detection rate of gamma-ray burstsfor the lat and to extend the energy range to lower energies (from ~10 kev to\~30 mev). it will provide real-time burst locations over a wide fov withsufficient accuracy to allow repointing the glast spacecraft. time-resolvedspectra of many bursts recorded with lat and the burst monitor will allow theinvestigation of the relation between the kev and the mev-gev emission fromgrbs over unprecedented seven decades of energy. this will help to advance ourunderstanding of the mechanisms by which gamma-rays are generated in gamma-raybursts.

astro-ph;0410560	a deep search with hst for late time supernova signatures in the hosts  of xrf 011030 and xrf 020427	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are, like gamma-ray bursts (grbs), thought to signal thecollapse of massive stars in distant galaxies. many models posit that theisotropic equivalent energies of xrfs are lower than those for grbs, such thatthey are visible from a reduced range of distances when compared with grbs.here we present the results of two epoch hubble space telescope imaging of twoxrfs. these images taken approximately 45 and 200 days post burst reveal noevidence for an associated supernova in either case. supernovae such as sn1998bw would have been visible out to z ~1.5 in each case, while faintersupernovae such as sn 2002ap would have been visible to z ~ 1. if the xrfs lieat such large distances, their energies would not fit the observed correlationbetween the grb peak energy and isotropic energy release, in which soft burstsare less energetic. we conclude that, should these xrfs reside at low redshifts($z&lt;0.6$), either their line of sight is heavily extinguished, or they areassociated with extremely faint supernovae, or, unlike grbs, these xrfs do nothave temporally coincident supernovae.

astro-ph;0510096	the optical afterglow of the short gamma-ray burst grb 050709	it has long been known that there are two classes of gamma-ray bursts (grbs),mainly distinguished by their durations. the breakthrough in our understandingof long-duration grbs (those lasting more than ~2 s), which ultimately linkedthem with energetic type ic supernovae, came from the discovery of theirlong-lived x-ray and optical afterglows, when precise and rapid localizationsof the sources could finally be obtained. x-ray localizations have recentlybecome available for short (duration &lt;2 s) grbs, which have evaded opticaldetection for more than 30 years. here we report the first discovery oftransient optical emission (r-band magnitude ~23) associated with a shortburst; grb 050709. the optical afterglow was localized with subarcsecondaccuracy, and lies in the outskirts of a blue dwarf galaxy. the optical andx-ray afterglow properties 34 h after the grb are reminiscent of the afterglowsof long grbs, which are attributable to synchrotron emission fromultrarelativistic ejecta. we did not, however, detect a supernova, as found inmost nearby long grb afterglows, which suggests a different origin for theshort grbs.

astro-ph;0602402	the prelude to and aftermath of the giant flare of 2004 december 27:  persistent and pulsed x-ray properties of sgr 1806-20 from 1993 to 2005	on 2004 december 27, a highly-energetic giant flare was recorded from themagnetar candidate sgr 1806-20. in the months preceding this flare, thepersistent x-ray emission from this object began to undergo significantchanges. here, we report on the evolution of key spectral and temporalparameters prior to and following this giant flare. using the rossi x-raytiming explorer, we track the pulse frequency of sgr 1806-20 and find that thespin-down rate of this sgr varied erratically in the months before and afterthe flare. contrary to the giant flare in sgr 1900+14, we find no evidence fora discrete jump in spin frequency at the time of the december 27th flare(|dnu/nu| &lt; 5 x 10^-6). in the months surrounding the flare, we find a strongcorrelation between pulsed flux and torque consistent with the model formagnetar magnetosphere electrodynamics proposed by thompson, lyutikov &amp;kulkarni (2002). as with the flare in sgr 1900+14, the pulse morphology of sgr1806-20 changes drastically following the flare. using the chandra x-rayobservatory and other publicly available imaging x-ray detector observations,we construct a spectral history of sgr 1806-20 from 1993 to 2005. the usualmagnetar persistent emission spectral model of a power-law plus a blackbodyprovides an excellent fit to the data. we confirm the earlier finding bymereghetti et al. (2005) of increasing spectral hardness of sgr 1806-20 between1993 and 2004. contrary to the direct correlation between torque and spectralhardness proposed by mereghetti et al., we find evidence for a sudden torquechange that triggered a gradual hardening of the energy spectrum on a timescaleof years. interestingly, the spectral hardness, spin-down rate, pulsed, andphase-averaged of sgr 1806-20 all peak months before the flare epoch.

astro-ph;0604320	jet breaks in short gamma-ray bursts. ii: the collimated afterglow of  grb 051221a	we report the best evidence to date of a jet break in a short gamma-ray burst(grb) afterglow, using chandra and swift xrt observations of the x-rayafterglow of grb 051221a. the combined x-ray light curve, which has threebreaks, is similar to those commonly observed in swift observations of longgrbs. a flat segment of the light curve at ~0.1 days after the burst representsthe first clear case of strong energy injection in the external shock of ashort grb afterglow. the last break occurs at ~4 days post-burst and breaks toa power-law decay index of ~2. we interpret this as a jet break, with importantimplications for models of short grbs, since it requires collimation of theafterglow into a jet with an initial opening angle ~4-8 degrees and implies atotal jet kinetic energy of e_jet ~(1-5) x 10^{49} erg. combined with the lackof a jet break in grb 050724, this suggests a wide range in jet collimation inshort grbs, with at least some having collimation similar to that found in longgrbs, though with significantly lower jet energies.

astro-ph;0608166	infrared and optical observations of grb 030115 and its extremely red  host galaxy: implications for dark bursts	we present near-infrared (nir) and optical observations of the afterglow ofgrb 030115. discovered in an infrared search at kitt peak 5 hours after theburst trigger, this afterglow is amongst the faintest observed in the r-band atan early epoch, and exhibits very red colors, with $r-k\approx 6$. themagnitude of the optical afterglow of grb 030115 is fainter than many upperlimits for other bursts, suggesting that without early nir observations itwould have been classified as a ``dark'' burst. both the color and opticalmagnitude of the afterglow are likely due to dust extinction and indicate thatat least some optical afterglows are very faint due to dust along the line ofsight. multicolor {\it hubble space telescope} observations were also taken ofthe host galaxy and the surrounding field. photometric redshifts imply that thehost, and a substantial number of faint galaxies in the field are at $z \sim2.5$. the overdensity of galaxies is sufficiently great that grb 030115 mayhave occurred in a rich high-redshift cluster. the host galaxy shows extremelyred colors (r-k=5) and is the first grb host to be classified as an extremelyred object (ero). some of the galaxies surrounding the host also show very redcolors, while the majority of the cluster are much bluer, indicating ongoingunobscured star formation. as it is thought that much of high redshift starformation occurs in highly obscured environments it may be that grb 030115represent a transition object, between the relatively unobscured afterglowsseen to date and a population which are very heavily extinguished, even in thenir.

astro-ph;9509078	batse observations of the large-scale isotropy of gamma-ray bursts	we use dipole and quadrupole statistics to test the large-scale isotropy ofthe first 1005 gamma-ray bursts observed by the burst and transient sourceexperiment (batse). in addition to the entire sample of 1005 gamma-ray bursts,many subsets are examined. we use a variety of dipole and quadrupole statisticsto search for galactic and other predicted anisotropies and for anisotropies ina coordinate-system independent manner. we find the gamma-ray burst locationsto be consistent with isotropy, e.g., for the total sample the observedgalactic dipole moment &lt;cos theta&gt; differs from the value predicted forisotropy by 0.9 sigma and the observed galactic quadrupole moment &lt;sin^2 b -1/3&gt; by 0.3 sigma. we estimate for various models the anisotropies that couldhave been detected. if one-half of the locations were within 86 degrees of thegalactic center, or within 28 degrees of the galactic plane, the ensuing dipoleor quadrupole moment would have typically been detected at the 99% confidencelevel. we compare the observations with the dipole and quadrupole moments ofvarious galactic models. several galactic gamma-ray bursts models have momentswithin 2 sigma of the observations; most of the galactic models proposed todate are no longer in acceptable agreement with the data. although a sphericaldark matter halo distribution could be consistent with the data, the requiredcore radius is larger than the core radius of the dark matter halo used toexplain the galaxy's rotation curve. gamma-ray bursts are much more isotropicthan any observed galactic population, strongly favoring but not requiring anorigin at cosmological distances.

astro-ph;9705184	the optical counterpart to gamma-ray burst grb970228 observed using the  hubble space telescope	although more than 2,000 astronomical gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have beendetected, and numerous models proposed to explain their occurrence, they haveremained enigmatic owing to the lack of an obvious counterpart at otherwavelengths. the recent ground-based detection of a transient source in thevicinity of grb 970228 may therefore have provided a breakthrough. the opticalcounterpart appears to be embedded in an extended source which, if a galaxy ashas been suggested, would lend weight to those models that place grbs atcosmological distances. here we report the observations using the hubble spacetelescope of the transient counterpart and extended source 26 and 39 days afterthe initial gamma-ray outburst. we find that the counterpart has faded sincethe initial detection (and continues to fade), but the extended source exhibitsno significant change in brightness between the two dates of observationsreported here. the size and apparent constancy between the two epochs of hstobservations imply that it is extragalactic, but its faintness makes adefinitive statement about its nature difficult. nevertheless, the decayprofile of the transient source is consistent with a popular impulsive-fireballmodel, which assumes a merger between two neutron stars in a distant galaxy.

astro-ph;9801169	hst/stis observations of the optical counterpart to grb 970228	we report on observations of the fading optical counterpart of the gamma-rayburst grb 970228, made on 4~september~1997 using the stis ccd on the hubblespace telescope. the unresolved counterpart is detected at v=28 +/- 0.25,consistent with a continued power-law decline with exponent -1.14 +/- 0.05. noproper motion is detected, in contradiction of an earlier claim. thecounterpart is located within, but near the edge of, a faint extended sourcewith diameter ~0."8 and integrated magnitude 25.7 +/- 0.25. comparison withwfpc2 data taken one month after the initial burst and ntt data taken on march13 shows no evidence for fading of the extended emission.  after adjusting for the probable galactic extinction in the direction of grb970228 of a_v=0.7, we find that the observed nebula is consistent with thesizes of galaxies of comparable magnitude found in the hubble deep field andother deep hst images, and that only 2% of the sky is covered by galaxies ofsimilar or greater surface brightness. we therefore conclude that the extendedsource observed about grb 970228 is most likely a galaxy at moderate redshift,and is almost certainly the host of the gamma-ray burst.

astro-ph;9902236	hst and palomar imaging of grb 990123: implications for the nature of  gamma-ray bursts and their hosts	we report on hst and palomar optical images of the field of grb 990123,obtained on 8 and 9 february 1999. we find that the optical transient (ot)associated with grb 990123 is located on an irregular galaxy, with magnitudev=24.20 +/- 0.15. the strong metal absorption lines seen in the spectrum of theot, along with the low probability of a chance superposition, lead us toconclude that this galaxy is the host of the grb. the ot is projected withinthe ~1'' visible stellar field of the host, nearer the edge than the center. wecannot, on this basis, rule out the galactic nucleus as the site of the grb,since the unusual morphology of the host may be the result of an ongoinggalactic merger, but our demonstration that this host galaxy has extremely blueoptical to infrared colors more strongly supports an association between grbsand star formation. we find that the ot magnitude on 1999 feb 9.05, v = 25.45+/- 0.15, is about 1.5 mag fainter than expected from extrapolation of thedecay rate found in earlier observations. a detailed analysis of the ot lightcurve suggests that its fading has gone through three distinct phases: an earlyrapid decline (f_{nu} \propto t^{-1.6} for t &lt; 0.1 days), a slower intermediatedecline power-law decay (f_{nu} \propto t^{-1.1} for 0.1 &lt; t &lt; 2 days), andthen a more rapid decay (at least as steep as (f_{\nu} \propto t^{-1.8} for t &gt;2 days). the break to steeper slope at late times may provide evidence that theoptical emission from this grb was highly beamed.

astro-ph;9910062	statistical properties of sgr 1900+14 bursts	we study the statistics of soft gamma repeater (sgr) bursts, using a database of 187 events detected with batse and 837 events detected with rxte pca,all from sgr 1900+14 during its 1998-1999 active phase. we find that thefluence or energy distribution of bursts is consistent with a power law ofindex 1.66, over 4 orders of magnitude. this scale-free distribution resemblesthe gutenberg-richter law for earthquakes, and gives evidence forself-organized criticality in sgrs. the distribution of time intervals betweensuccessive bursts from sgr 1900+14 is consistent with a log-normaldistribution. there is no correlation between burst intensity and the waitingtimes till the next burst, but there is some evidence for a correlation betweenburst intensity and the time elapsed since the previous burst. we also find acorrelation between the duration and the energy of the bursts, but withsignificant scatter. in all these statistical properties, sgr bursts resembleearthquakes and solar flares more closely than they resemble any knownaccretion-powered or nuclear-powered phenomena. thus our analysis lends supportto the hypothesis that the energy source for sgr bursts is internal to theneutron star, and plausibly magnetic.

0812.1217	late time observations of grb080319b: jet break, host galaxy and  accompanying supernova	the swift discovered grb080319b was by far the most distant source everobserved at naked eye brightness, reaching a peak apparent magnitude of 5.3 ata redshift of z=0.937. we present our late-time optical (hst, gemini &amp; vlt) andx-ray (chandra) observations, which confirm that an achromatic break occurredin the power-law afterglow light curve at ~11 days post-burst. this most likelyindicates that the gamma-ray burst (grb) outflow was collimated, which for auniform jet would imply a total energy in the jet e_{jet} \gsim 10^{52} erg.our observations also show a late-time excess of red light, which is wellexplained if the grb was accompanied by a supernova (sn), similar to those seenin some other long-duration grbs. the latest observations are dominated bylight from the host and show that the grb took place in a faint dwarf galaxy(r(ab)\approx27.0, rest-frame m_b\approx-17.2). this galaxy is small even bythe standards of other grb hosts, which is suggestive of a low metallicityenvironment. intriguingly, the properties of this extreme event - a small hostand bright supernova - are entirely typical of the very low-luminosity burstssuch as grb980425 and grb060218.
