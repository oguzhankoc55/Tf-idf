0903.0665	hot gas halos around disk galaxies: confronting cosmological simulations  with observations	models of disk galaxy formation commonly predict the existence of an extendedreservoir of accreted hot gas surrounding massive spirals at low redshift. as atest of these models, we use x-ray and h-alpha data of the two massive,quiescent edge-on spirals ngc 5746 and ngc 5170 to investigate the amount andorigin of any hot gas in their halos. contrary to our earlier claim, thechandra analysis of ngc 5746, employing more recent calibration data, does notreveal any significant evidence for diffuse x-ray emission outside the opticaldisk, with a 3-sigma upper limit to the halo x-ray luminosity of 4e39 erg/s. anidentical study of the less massive ngc 5170 also fails to detect anyextraplanar x-ray emission. by extracting hot halo properties of disk galaxiesformed in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we compare these results toexpectations for cosmological accretion of hot gas by spirals. for milkyway-sized galaxies, these high-resolution simulations predict hot halo x-rayluminosities which are lower by a factor of ~2 compared to our earlier resultsreported by toft et al. (2002). we find the new simulation predictions to beconsistent with our observational constraints for both ngc 5746 and ngc 5170,while also confirming that the hot gas detected so far around more activelystar-forming spirals is in general probably associated with stellar activity inthe disk. observational results on quiescent disk galaxies at the high-mass endare nevertheless providing powerful constraints on theoretical predictions, andhence on the assumed input physics in numerical studies of disk galaxyformation and evolution.

0706.2768	towards a holistic view of the heating and cooling of the intracluster  medium	(abridged) x-ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "coolcore" (cc) clusters and "non-cool core" (ncc) clusters. yet relatively littleattention has been given to the origins of this dichotomy and, in particular,to the energetics and thermal histories of the two classes. we develop a modelfor the entropy profiles of clusters starting from the configurationestablished by gravitational shock heating and radiative cooling. at largeradii, gravitational heating accounts for the observed profiles and theirscalings well. however, at small and intermediate radii, radiative cooling andgravitational heating cannot be combined to explain the observed profiles ofeither type of cluster. the inferred entropy profiles of ncc clusters requirethat material is preheated prior to cluster collapse in order to explain theabsence of low entropy (cool) material in these systems. we show that a similarmodification is also required in cc clusters in order to match their propertiesat intermediate radii. in cc clusters, this modification is unstable, and anadditional process is required to prevent cooling below a temperature of a fewkev. we show that this can be achieved by adding a self-consistent agn feedbackloop in which the lowest-entropy, most rapidly cooling material is heated sothat it rises buoyantly to mix with material at larger radii. the resultingmodel does not require fine tuning and is in excellent agreement with a widevariety of observational data. some of the other implications of this model arebriefly discussed.

0704.1218	the impact of radio feedback from active galactic nuclei in cosmological  simulations: formation of disk galaxies	in this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to activegalactic nuclei (agn) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. weassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an agn, istransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. combining a theoreticalmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description ofstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies andtheir central black holes. the novelty in our model is that we consider twodistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disksand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer toas riafs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretiondisks, we assume that only the riaf is responsible for the agn feedback. wefind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretionrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to ariaf structure. at this point, the feedback from the agn becomes efficient andslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completelyhalts star formation in the bulge. as a result, the nucleus becomes astochastically fuelled low-luminosity agn (seyfert galaxy) with recurrentshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. our model predictsseveral properties of the low-luminosity agn including the bolometricluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the agnlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of seyfert galaxiesand their radio activity. we also find that the mass ratios between the centralblack hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of thestrength of either supernova feedback or agn feedback.

0905.3401	the colour of galaxies in distant groups	(abridged) we present new optical and near-infrared imaging for a sample of98 spectroscopically-selected galaxy groups at 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.55. we measure accuratecolours for group members and the surrounding field population, statisticallycomplete above a stellar mass limit of m=1e10 msun. the overall colourdistribution is bimodal in both the field and group samples; but at fixedluminosity the fraction of group galaxies populating the red peak is larger, by20+/-7 per cent, than that of the field. in particular, group members withearly-type morphologies, as identified in hst imaging, exhibit a tight redsequence, similar to that seen for more massive clusters. we show thatapproximately 20-30 per cent of galaxies on the red sequence may bedust-reddened galaxies with non-negligible star formation and early-spiralmorphologies. this is true of both the field and group sample, and shows littledependence on near infrared luminosity. thus, the fraction of bright groupmembers with no sign of star formation or agn activity is 54+/-6 per cent. ourfield sample, which includes galaxies in all environments, contains 35+/-3 percent of such inactive galaxies, consistent with the amount expected if all suchgalaxies are located in groups and clusters. this reinforces our earlierconclusions, that dense environments at z&lt;0.5 are associated with a prematurecessation of star formation in some galaxies; in particular we find no evidencefor significantly enhanced star formation in these environments. simple galaxyformation models predict a quenching of star formation in groups that is tooefficient, overpopulating the red sequence. attempts to fix this by increasingthe timescale of this quenching equally for all group members distorts thecolour distribution in a way that is inconsistent with observations.

0908.0750	the accretion of galaxies into groups and clusters	we use the galaxy stellar mass and halo merger tree information from thesemi-analytic model galaxy catalogue of font et al. (2009) to examine theaccretion of galaxies into a large sample of groups and clusters, covering awide range in halo mass (10e12.9 to 10e15.3 msun/h), and selected from each offour redshift epochs (z=0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). we find that clusters at allexamined redshifts have accreted a significant fraction of their final galaxypopulations through galaxy groups. a 10e14.5 msun/h mass cluster at z=0 has, onaverage, accreted ~ 40% of its galaxies (mstellar &gt; 10e9 msun/h) from haloswith masses greater than 10e13 msun/h. further, the galaxies which are accretedthrough groups are more massive, on average, than galaxies accreted throughsmaller halos or from the field population. we find that at a given epoch, thefraction of galaxies accreted from isolated environments is independent of thefinal cluster or group mass. in contrast, we find that observing a cluster ofthe same halo mass at each redshift epoch implies different accretion rates ofisolated galaxies, from 5-6 % per gyr at z=0 to 15% per gyr at z=1.5. we findthat combining the existence of a butcher oemler effect at z=0.5 and theobservations that galaxies within groups display significant environmentaleffects with galaxy accretion histories justifies striking conclusions. namely,that the dominant environmental process must begin to occur in halos of 10e12-- 10e13 msun/h, and act over timescales of &gt; 2 gyrs. this argues in favor of amechanism like "strangulation", in which the hot halo of a galaxy is strippedupon infalling into a more massive halo . this simple model predicts that byz=1.5 galaxy groups and clusters will display little to no environmentaleffects.

0911.2641	the case for agn feedback in galaxy groups	[abridged] the relatively recent insight that energy input from supermassiveblack holes (bhs) can have a substantial effect on the star formation rates(sfrs) of galaxies motivates us to examine its effects on the scale of galaxygroups. at present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significantfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. to explore the effectsof bh feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydrosimulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations project. while bothinclude galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback frombhs. we compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range ofobservational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (l-m-t) scaling relations, k-bandluminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (cbg), sfrs and agesof the cbg, and gas/stellar metallicities. both runs yield entropy profilessimilar to the data, while the run without agn feedback yields highly peakedtemperature profiles, in discord with the observations. energy input from bhssignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 msun,yielding fgas-t and l-t relations that are in agreement with the data. the runwithout agn feedback suffers from the well known overcooling problem; theresulting k-band luminosities are much larger than observed. by contrast, therun that includes bh feedback yields k-band luminosities and cbg sfrs and agesin agreement with current estimates. both runs yield very similar gas-phasemetallicities that match x-ray data, but they predict very different stellarmetallicities. based on the above, galaxy groups provide a compelling case thatbh feedback is a crucial ingredient in the formation of massive galaxies.

1002.3170	the redshift one ldss-3 emission line survey (roles) ii: survey method  and z~1 mass-dependent star-formation rate density	motivated by suggestions of 'cosmic downsizing', in which the dominantcontribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (sfrd) proceeds fromhigher to lower mass galaxies with increasing cosmic time, we describe thedesign and implementation of the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey(roles). roles is a k-selected (22.5 &lt; k_ab &lt; 24.0) survey for dwarf galaxies[8.5&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt; 9.5] at 0.89 &lt; z &lt; 1.15 drawn from two extremely deep fields(goods-s and ms1054-fires). using the [oii]3727 emission line, we obtainredshifts and star-formation rates (sfrs) for star-forming galaxies down to alimit of ~0.3 msun/yr. we present the [oii] luminosity function measured inroles and find a faint end slope of alpha_faint ~ -1.5, similar to thatmeasured at z~0.1 in the sdss. by combining roles with higher mass surveys, wemeasure the sfrd as a function of stellar mass using [oii] (with and withoutvarious empirical corrections), and using sed-fitting to obtain the sfr fromthe rest-frame uv luminosity for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. ourbest estimate of the corrected [oii]-sfrd and uv sfrd both independently showthat the sfrd evolves equally for galaxies of all masses between z~1 and z~0.1.the exact evolution in normalisation depends on the indicator used, with the[oii]-based estimate showing a change of a factor of ~2.6 and the uv-based afactor of ~6. we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalisationbetween the indicators, but note that the magnitude of this uncertainty iscomparable to the discrepancy between indicators seen in other z~1 works. ourresult that the shape of the sfrd as a function of stellar mass (and hence themass range of galaxies dominating the sfrd) does not evolve between z~1 andz~0.1 is robust to the choice of indicator.

1002.3172	the local star-formation rate density: assessing calibrations using  [oii], ha and uv luminosities	we explore the use of simple star-formation rate (sfr) indicators (such asmay be used in high-redshift galaxy surveys) in the local universe using [oii],ha, and u-band luminosities from the deeper 275 deg^2 stripe 82 subsample ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) coupled with uv data from the galaxyevolution explorer satellite (galex). we examine the consistency of suchmethods using the star-formation rate density (sfrd) as a function of stellarmass in this local volume, and quantify the accuracy of corrections for dustand metallicity on the various indicators. rest-frame u-band promises to be aparticularly good sfr estimator for high redshift studies since it does notrequire a particularly large or sensitive extinction correction, yet yieldsresults broadly consistent with more observationally expensive methods. wesuggest that the [oii]-derived sfr, commonly used at higher redshifts (z~1),can be used to reliably estimate sfrs for ensembles of galaxies, but for highmass galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10), a larger correction than is typically used isrequired to compensate for the effects of metallicity dependence and dustextinction. we provide a new empirical mass-dependent correction for the[oii]-sfr.

1002.4414	the mass assembly of galaxy groups and the evolution of the magnitude  gap	we investigate the assembly of groups and clusters of galaxies using themillennium dark matter simulation and the associated gas simulations andsemi-analytic catalogues of galaxies. in particular, in order to find anobservable quantity that could be used to identify early-formed groups, westudy the development of the difference in magnitude between their brightestgalaxies to assess the use of magnitude gaps as possible indicators. we selectgalaxy groups and clusters at redshift z=1 with dark matter halo mass m(r200) &gt;1e13/h msun, and trace their properties until the present time (z=0). weconsider only the systems with x-ray luminosity l_x&gt; 0.25e42/h^2 erg/s at z=0.while it is true that a large magnitude gap between the two brightest galaxiesof a particular group often indicates that a large fraction of its mass wasassembled at an early epoch, it is not a necessary condition. more than 90% offossil groups defined on the basis of their magnitude gaps (at any epochbetween 0&lt;z&lt;1) cease to be fossils within 4 gyr, mostly because other massivegalaxies are assembled within their cores, even though most of the mass intheir haloes might have been assembled at early times. we show that, comparedto the conventional definition of fossil galaxy groups based on the magnitudegap delta m(12)&gt; 2 (in the r-band, within 0.5r200 of the centre of the group),an alternative criterion delta m(14)&gt;2.5 (within the same radius) finds 50%more early-formed systems, and those that on average retain their fossil phaselonger. however, the conventional criterion performs marginally better atfinding early-formed groups at the high-mass end of groups. nevertheless, bothcriteria fail to identify a majority of the early-formed systems.

1003.0011	galaxy formation spanning cosmic history	over the past several decades, galaxy formation theory has met withsignificant successes. in order to test current theories thoroughly we requirepredictions for as yet unprobed regimes. to this end, we describe a newimplementation of the galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. ourmotivation is the success of the model described by bower et al. in explainingmany aspects of galaxy formation. despite this success, the bower et al. modelfails to match some observational constraints and certain aspects of itsphysical implementation are not as realistic as we would like. the modeldescribed in this work includes substantially updated physics, taking intoaccount developments in our understanding over the past decade, and removescertain limiting assumptions made by this (and most other) semi-analyticmodels. this allows it to be exploited reliably in high-redshift and low massregimes. furthermore, we have performed an exhaustive search of model parameterspace to find a particular set of model parameters which produce results ingood agreement with a wide range of observational data (luminosity functions,galaxy sizes and dynamics, clustering, colours, metal content) over a widerange of redshifts. this model represents a solid basis on which to performcalculations of galaxy formation in as yet unprobed regimes.

1004.2050	mass transport by buoyant bubbles in galaxy clusters	we investigate the effect of three important processes by which agn-blownbubbles transport material: drift, wake transport and entrainment. the first ofthese, drift, occurs because a buoyant bubble pushes aside the adjacentmaterial, giving rise to a net upward displacement of the fluid behind thebubble. for a spherical bubble, the mass of upwardly displaced material isroughly equal to half the mass displaced by the bubble, and should be ~10^{7-9} solar masses depending on the local icm and bubble parameters. we showthat in classical cool core clusters, the upward displacement by drift may be akey process in explaining the presence of filaments behind bubbles. a bubblealso carries a parcel of material in a region at its rear, known as the wake.the mass of the wake is comparable to the drift mass and increases the averagedensity of the bubble, trapping it closer to the cluster centre and reducingthe amount of heating it can do during its ascent. moreover, material droppingout of the wake will also contribute to the trailing filaments. mass transportby the bubble wake can effectively prevent the build-up of cool material in thecentral galaxy, even if agn heating does not balance icm cooling. finally, weconsider entrainment, the process by which ambient material is incorporatedinto the bubble. abridged

1008.4799	gas expulsion by quasar-driven winds as a solution to the over-cooling  problem in galaxy groups and clusters	galaxy groups are not scaled down versions of massive galaxy clusters - thehot gas in groups (known as the intragroup medium, igrm for short) is, onaverage, less dense than the intracluster medium, implying that one or morenon-gravitational processes (e.g., radiative cooling, star formation, and/orfeedback) has had a relatively larger effect on groups. in the present study,we compare a number of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that form part ofthe overwhelmingly large simulations project to isolate and quantify theeffects of cooling and feedback from supernovae (sne) and active galacticnuclei (agn) on the gas. this is achieved by comparing lagrangian thermalhistories of the gas in the different runs, which were all started fromidentical initial conditions. while radiative cooling, star formation, and snfeedback are all necessary ingredients, only runs that also include agnfeedback are able to successfully reproduce the optical and x-ray properties ofgroups and low-mass clusters. we isolate how, when, and exactly what gas isheated by agn. interestingly, we find that the gas that constitutes thepresent-day igrm is that which was not strongly heated by agn. instead, the lowmedian density/high median entropy of the gas in present-day groups is achievedby the ejection of lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies at highredshift (primarily 2 &lt; z &lt; 4). this corresponds to the epoch when supermassiveblack holes accreted most of their mass, typically at a rate that is close tothe eddington limit (i.e., when the black holes are in a `quasar mode').

1011.0602	the stellar and hot gas content of low-mass galaxy clusters	we analyse the stellar and hot gas content of 18 nearby, low-mass galaxyclusters, detected in redshift space and selected to have a dynamical mass3e14&lt;m/msun&lt;6e14, as measured from the 2df galaxy redshift survey. we combinex-ray measurements from both chandra and xmm with ground-based near-infraredobservations from ctio, aat and cfht to compare the mass in hot gas and starsto the dynamical mass and state of the clusters. only 13 of the clusters aredetected in x-ray emission, and for these systems we find that a range of 7-20per cent of their baryonic mass, and &lt;3 per cent of their dynamical mass, isdetected in starlight, similar to what is observed in more massive clusters. incontrast, the five undetected clusters are underluminous in x-ray emission, byup to a factor 10, given their stellar mass. although the velocity distributionof cluster members in these systems is indistinguishable from a gaussian, allshow subtle signs of being unrelaxed: either they lack a central, dominantgalaxy, or the bright galaxy distribution is less concentrated and/or moreelongated than the rest of the sample. thus we conclude that low-mass clustersand groups selected from the velocity distribution of their galaxies exhibit adichotomy in their hot gas properties. either they are detected in x-ray, inwhich case they generally lie on the usual scaling relations, or they arecompletely undetected in x-ray emission. the non-detections may be partlyrelated to the apparently young dynamical state of the clusters, but it remainsa distinct possibility that some of these systems are exceptionally devoid ofhot emitting gas as the result of its expulsion or rarefaction.

1011.5506	on the impact of empirical and theoretical star formation laws on galaxy  formation	we investigate the consequences of applying different star formation laws inthe galaxy formation model galform. three broad star formation laws areimplemented: the empirical relations of kennicutt and schmidt and blitz &amp;rosolowsky and the theoretical model of krumholz, mckee &amp; tumlinson. these lawshave no free parameters once calibrated against observations of the starformation rate (sfr) and gas surface density in nearby galaxies. we start frompublished models, and investigate which observables are sensitive to a changein the star formation law, without altering any other model parameters. we showthat changing the star formation law (i) does not significantly affect eitherthe star formation history of the universe or the galaxy luminosity functionsin the optical and near-ir, due to an effective balance between the quiescentand burst star formation modes; (ii) greatly affects the cold gas contents ofgalaxies; (iii) changes the location of galaxies in the sfr versus stellar massplane, so that a second sequence of "passive" galaxies arises, in addition tothe known "active" sequence. we show that this plane can be used todiscriminate between the star formation laws.

1011.5509	direct observational evidence for a large transient galaxy population in  groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1	(abridged) we introduce our survey of galaxy groups at 0.85&lt;z&lt;1, as anextension of the group environment and evolution collaboration (geec). here wepresent the first results, based on gemini gmos-s nod-and-shuffle spectroscopyof seven galaxy groups selected from spectroscopically confirmed, extended xmmdetections in cosmos. in total we have over 100 confirmed group members, andfour of the groups have &gt;15 members. the dynamical mass estimates are in goodagreement with the masses estimated from the x-ray luminosity, with most of thegroups having 13&lt;log(mdyn/msun)&lt;14. our spectroscopic sample is statisticallycomplete for all galaxies with mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun, and for blue galaxies wesample masses as low as mstar=1e8.8 msun. like lower-redshift groups, thesesystems are dominated by red galaxies, at all stellar masses mstar&gt;1e10.1 msun.few group galaxies inhabit the "blue cloud" that dominates the surroundingfield; instead, we find a large and possibly distinct population of galaxieswith intermediate colours. the "green valley" that exists at low redshift isinstead well-populated in these groups, containing ~30 per cent of galaxies.these do not appear to be exceptionally dusty galaxies, and about half showprominent balmer-absorption lines. furthermore, their hst morphologies appearto be intermediate between those of red-sequence and blue-cloud galaxies of thesame stellar mass. we postulate that these are a transient population,migrating from the blue cloud to the red sequence, with a star formation ratethat declines with an exponential timescale 0.6 gyr&lt; tau &lt; 2 gyr. theirprominence among the group galaxy population, and the marked lack of blue,star-forming galaxies, provides evidence that the group environment eitherdirectly reduces star formation in member galaxies, or at least prevents itsrejuvenation during the normal cycle of galaxy evolution.

1012.2388	the dawn of the red: star formation histories of group galaxies over the  past 5 billion years	we examine the star formation properties of group and field galaxies in twosurveys, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss; at z ~ 0.08) and the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec; at z ~ 0.4). using uv imagingfrom the galex space telescope, along with optical and, for geec, near infraredphotometry, we compare the observed spectral energy distributions to largesuites of stellar population synthesis models. this allows us to accuratelydetermine star formation rates and stellar masses. we find that star forminggalaxies of all environments undergo a systematic lowering of their starformation rate between z=0.4 and z=0.08 regardless of mass. nonetheless, thefraction of passive galaxies is higher in groups than the field at bothredshifts. moreover, the difference between the group and field grows with timeand is mass-dependent, in the sense the the difference is larger at low masses.however, the star formation properties of star forming galaxies, as measured bytheir average specific star formation rates, are consistent within the errorsin the group and field environment at fixed redshift. the evolution of passivefraction in groups between z=0.4 and z=0 is consistent with a simple accretionmodel, in which galaxies are environmentally affected 3 gyrs after falling intoa ~ 10e13 msun group. this long timescale appears to be inconsistent with theneed to transform galaxies quickly enough to ensure that star forming galaxiesappear similar in both the group and field, as observed.

1101.3780	a spectroscopic measurement of galaxy formation timescales with roles	we present measurements of the specific star-formation rate (ssfr)-stellarmass relation for star-forming galaxies. our deep spectroscopic samples arebased on the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey, roles, and europeansouthern observatory, eso, public spectroscopy at z=1, and on the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) at z=0.1. these datasets cover an equally deep mass range of8.5&lt;~log(m*/msun)&lt;~11 at both epochs. we find that the ssfr--mass relationevolves in a way which is remarkably independent of stellar mass, as wepreviously found for the star-formation rate density (sfrd)--mass relation. athigher masses, such as those probed by previous surveys, the evolution inssfr--mass is almost independent of stellar mass. at higher masses(log(m*/msun)&gt;10) the shapes of the cumulative cosmic sfrds are very similar atboth z=0.1 and z=1.0, both showing 70% of the total sfrd above a mass oflog(m*/msun)&gt;10. mass functions are constructed for star-forming galaxies andfound to evolve by only &lt;35% between z=1 and z=0.1 over the whole mass range.the evolution is such that the mass function decreases with increasing cosmictime, confirming that galaxies are leaving the star-forming sequence/bluecloud. the observational results are extended to z~2 by adding two recent lymanbreak galaxy samples, and data at these three epochs (z=0.1, 1, 2) are comparedwith the galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. galform predicts anoverall sfr density (sfrd) as a function of stellar mass in reasonableagreement with the observations. the star formation timescales inferred from1/ssfr also give reasonable overall agreement, with the agreement becomingworse at the lowest and highest masses.

1106.0306	numerical overcooling in shocks	we present a study of cooling in radiative shocks simulated with smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) and adaptive mesh refinement codes. we obtain asimilarity solution for a shock-tube problem in the presence of radiativecooling, and test how well the solution is reproduced in gadget and flash.shock broadening governed by the details of the numerical scheme (artificialviscosity or riemann solvers) leads to potentially significant overcooling inboth codes. we interpret our findings in terms of a resolution criterion, andapply it to realistic simulations of cosmological accretion shocks onto galaxyhaloes, cold accretion and thermal feedback from supernovae or active galacticnuclei. to avoid numerical overcooling of accretion shocks onto haloes thatshould develop a hot corona requires a particle or cell mass resolution of 10^6m_sun, which is within reach of current state-of-the-art simulations. at thismass resolution, thermal feedback in the interstellar medium of a galaxyrequires temperatures of supernova or agn driven bubbles to be in excess of10^7 k at densities of n_h=1.0 cm^-3, in order to avoid spurious suppression ofthe feedback by numerical overcooling.

0710.0964	ram pressure stripping the hot gaseous halos of galaxies in groups and  clusters	we use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations tostudy the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous halos of galaxies as theyfall into massive groups and clusters. the sensitivity of the results to theorbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. fortypical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ~30% of the initial hotgalactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 gyr. we propose a physicallysimple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulationsremarkably well. the model is analogous to the original formulation of gunn &amp;gott (1972), except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot)gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disk) and takes into accountthat stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic timescale.the model reproduces the results of the simulations to within approximately 10%at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structuralproperties we have explored. the one exception involves unlikely systems wherethe orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10% ofthe group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the modelunder-predicts the stripping following pericentric passage). the proposed modelhas several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressurestripping of both observed and cosmologically-simulated galaxies and as a wayto improve current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. one immediateconsequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies ingroups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with thestandard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.

1201.3676	substructure in the most massive geec groups: field-like populations in  dynamically active groups	the presence of substructure in galaxy groups and clusters is believed to bea sign of recent galaxy accretion and can be used not only to probe theassembly history of these structures, but also the evolution of their membergalaxies. using the dressler-shectman (ds) test, we study substructure in asample of intermediate redshift (z ~ 0.4) galaxy groups from the groupenvironment and evolution collaboration (geec) group catalog. we find that 4 ofthe 15 rich geec groups, with an average velocity dispersion of ~525 km s-1,are identified as having significant substructure. the identified regions oflocalized substructure lie on the group outskirts and in some cases appear tobe infalling. in a comparison of galaxy properties for the members of groupswith and without substructure, we find that the groups with substructure have asignificantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parentcolour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than theoverall group population. in addition, we observe correlations between thedetection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocitydistributions and velocity dispersion profiles. based on this analysis, weconclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and thatthese groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groupswith no detected substructure. these results indicate that the substructuregalaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could beinfalling, do not exhibit signs of environmental effects, since little or nostar-formation quenching is observed in these systems.

1206.4049	lightcone mock catalogues from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation  - i. construction and application to the bzk colour selection	we introduce a method for constructing end-to-end mock galaxy cataloguesusing a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, applied to the halo mergertrees extracted from a cosmological n-body simulation. the mocks that weconstruct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed according tothe epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of the observer, andincorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time. we determinethe position between the snapshot outputs at which a galaxy enters theobserver's lightcone by interpolation. as an application, we consider theeffectiveness of the bzk colour selection technique, which was designed toisolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5. the mock catalogue is inreasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all bzk galaxies, aswell as with the observed counts of the subsample of bzks that are star-forminggalaxies. we predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies withk_{ab}&lt;=23, and 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5, are selected by the bzk technique. interlopergalaxies, outside the intended redshift range, are predicted to dominate brightsamples of bzk galaxies (i.e. with k_{ab}&lt;=21). fainter k-band cuts arenecessary to reduce the predicted interloper fraction. we also show thatshallow b-band photometry can lead to confusion in classifying bzk galaxies asbeing star-forming or passively evolving. overall, we conclude that the bzkcolour selection technique is capable of providing a sample of galaxies that isrepresentative of the 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxy population.

1207.0972	the slowly evolving role of environment in a spectroscopic survey of  star formation in mstar &gt; 5e8 msun galaxies since z=1	we present a deep [oii] emission line survey of faint galaxies (22.5&lt;kab&lt;24)in the chandra deep field south and the fires field. with these data we measurethe star formation rate (sfr) in galaxies in the stellar mass range 8.85 &lt;log(m*/msun) &lt; 9.5 at 0.62&lt;z&lt;0.885, to a limit of sfr = 0.1msun/yr. thepresence of a massive cluster (ms1054-03) in the fires field, and ofsignificant large scale structure in the cdfs field, allows us to study theenvironmental dependence of sfrs amongst this population of low-mass galaxies.comparing our results with more massive galaxies at this epoch, with ourprevious survey (roles) at the higher redshift z=1, and with sdss stripe 82data, we find no significant evolution of the stellar mass function ofstar-forming galaxies between z=0 and z=1, and no evidence that its shapedepends on environment. the correlation between specific star formation rate(ssfr) and stellar mass at z=0.75 has a power-law slope of beta=-0.2, withevidence for a steeper relation at the lowest masses. the normalization of thiscorrelation lies as expected between that corresponding to z=1 and the presentday. the global sfr density is consistent with an evolution of the form (1+z)^2over 0&lt;z&lt;1, with no evidence for a dependence on stellar mass. the ssfr ofthese star-forming galaxies at z=0.75 does not depend upon the density of theirlocal environment. considering just high-density environments, the low-mass endof the ssfr-m* relation in our data is steeper than that in stripe 82 at z=0,and shallower than that measured by roles at z=1. evolution of low-massgalaxies in dense environments appears to be more rapid than in the generalfield.

1211.1395	how supernova explosions power galactic winds	feedback from supernovae is an essential aspect of galaxy formation. in orderto improve subgrid models of feedback we perform a series of numericalexperiments to investigate how supernova explosions power galactic winds. weuse the flash hydrodynamic code to model a simplified ism, including gravity,hydrodynamics, radiative cooling above 10,000 k, and star formation thatreproduces the kennicutt-schmidt relation. by simulating a small patch of theism in a tall box perpendicular to the disk, we obtain sub-parsec resolutionallowing us to resolve individual supernova events and we investigate how thewind properties depend on those of the ism and the galaxy. we find thatoutflows are more efficient in disks with lower surface densities or gasfractions. a simple model in which the warm cloudy medium is the barrier thatlimits the expansion of blast waves reproduces the scaling of outflowproperties with disk parameters at high star formation rates. the scaling wefind sets the investigation of galaxy winds on a new footing, providing aphysically motivated sub-grid description of winds that can be implemented incosmological hydrodynamic simulations and phenomenological models.

1302.2562	efficient satellite quenching at z~1 from the geec2 spectroscopic survey  of galaxy groups	we present deep gmos-s spectroscopy for 11 galaxy groups at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.0, forgalaxies with r_{ab}&lt;24.75. our sample is highly complete (&gt;66%) for eight ofthe eleven groups. using an optical-nir colour-colour diagram, the galaxies inthe sample were separated with a dust insensitive method into three categories:passive (red), star-forming (blue), and intermediate (green). the strongestenvironmental dependence is observed in the fraction of passive galaxies, whichmake up only ~20 per cent of the field in the mass range10^{10.3}&lt;m_{star}/m_\odot&lt;10^{11.0} but are the dominant component of groups.if we assume that the properties of the field are similar to those of the`pre-accreted' population, the environment quenching efficiency (\epsilon_\rho)is defined as the fraction of field galaxies required to be quenched in orderto match the observed red fraction inside groups. the efficiency obtained is~0.4, similar to its value in intermediate-density environments locally. whilegreen (intermediate) galaxies represent ~20 per cent of the star-formingpopulation in both the group and field, at all stellar masses, the average ssfrof the group population is lower by a factor of ~3. the green population doesnot show strong h-delta absorption that is characteristic of starburstgalaxies. finally, the high fraction of passive galaxies in groups, whencombined with satellite accretion models, require that most accreted galaxieshave been affected by their environment. thus, any delay between accretion andthe onset of truncation of star formation (\tau) must be &lt;2 gyr, shorter thanthe 3-7 gyr required to fit data at z=0. the relatively small fraction ofintermediate galaxies requires that the actual quenching process occursquickly, with an exponential decay timescale of \tau_q&lt;1 gyr.

0801.0990	testing cold dark matter with the hierarchical buildup of stellar light	(abridged) we demonstrate that the tenet of hierarchical structure growthleads directly to a robust, falsifiable prediction for the correlation betweenstellar fraction (fstar) and total system mass (m500) of galaxy groups andclusters. this prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonicphysics or cosmological parameters. in particular, if the fstar-m500 relationis fixed and does not evolve with redshift, cdm models predict the logarithmicslope of this relation to be b&gt;-0.3. this constraint can be weakened if thefstar-m500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must beformed in situ in groups at low redshift. conservatively requiring that atleast half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint fromevolution models is b&gt;-0.35. since the most massive clusters (m500=1e15 msun)are observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with m500=5e13 msunmust have fstar&lt;0.03. recent observations by gonzalez et al. (2007) indicate amuch steeper relation, with fstar&gt;0.04 in groups, leading to b=-0.64. ifconfirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today'sclusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from thehigher-redshift progenitors of those groups. we perform a careful analysis ofthese and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties intheir measurements. although correlated uncertainties on stellar and totalmasses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistentwith theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.

1308.1406	do group dynamics play a role in the evolution of member galaxies?	we examine galaxy groups from the present epoch to z = 1 to explore theimpact of group dynamics on galaxy evolution. we use group catalagues from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss), the group environment and evolutioncollaboration (geec) and the high redshift geec2 sample to study how theobserved member properties depend on galaxy stellar mass, group dynamical massand dynamical state of the host group. we find a strong correlation between thefraction of non-star-forming (quiescent) galaxies and galaxy stellar mass, butdo not detect a significant difference in the quiescent fraction with groupdynamical mass, within our sample halo mass range of 10^13-10^14.5 m_sun, orwith dynamical sate. however, at a redshift of approximately 0.4 we do see someevidence that the quiescent fraction in low mass galaxies (log(m_star/m_sun) &lt;10.5) is lower in groups with substructure. additionally, our results show thatthe fraction of groups with non-gaussian velocity distributions increases withredshift to roughly z = 0.4, while the amount of detected substructure remainsconstant to z = 1. based on these results, we conclude that for massivegalaxies (log(m_star/m_sun_ &gt; 10.5), evolution is most strongly correlated tothe stellar mass of a galaxy with little or no additional effect related toeither the group dynamical mass or dynamical state. for low mass galaxies, wedo see some evidence of a correlation between the quiescent fraction and theamount of detected substructure, highlighting the need to probe further downthe stellar mass function to elucidate the role of the environment in galaxyevolution.

1312.4418	star formation and environmental quenching of geec2 group galaxies at  z~1	we present new analysis from the geec2 spectroscopic survey of galaxy groupsat $0.8&lt;z&lt;1$. our previous work revealed an intermediate population between thestar-forming and quiescent sequences and a strong environmental dependence inthe fraction of quiescent galaxies. only $\sim5$ per cent of star-forminggalaxies in both the group and field sample show a significant enhancement instar formation, which suggests that quenching is the primary process in thetransition from the star-forming to the quiescent state. to model theenvironmental quenching scenario, we have tested the use of differentexponential quenching timescales and delays between satellite accretion and theonset of quenching. we find that with no delay, the quenching timescale needsto be long in order to match the observed quiescent fraction, but then thismodel produces too many intermediate galaxies. fixing a delay time of 3 gyr, assuggested from the local universe, produces too few quiescent galaxies. theobserved fractions are best matched with a model that includes a delay that isproportional to the dynamical time and a rapid quenching timescale ($\sim0.25$gyr), but this model also predicts intermediate galaxies h{\delta} strengthhigher than that observed. using stellar synthesis models, we have tested otherscenarios, such as the rejuvenation of star formation in early-type galaxiesand a portion of quenched galaxies possessing residual star formation. ifenvironment quenching plays a role in the geec2 sample, then our work suggeststhat only a fraction of intermediate galaxies may be undergoing this transitionand that quenching occurs quite rapidly in satellite galaxies ($\lesssim0.25$gyr).

1403.0769	a medieval multiverse: mathematical modelling of the 13th century  universe of robert grosseteste	in his treatise on light, written in about 1225, robert grosseteste describesa cosmological model in which the universe is created in a big-bang likeexplosion and subsequent condensation. he postulates that the fundamentalcoupling of light and matter gives rises to the material body of the entirecosmos. expansion is arrested when matter reaches a minimum density andsubsequent emission of light from the outer region leads to compression andrarefaction of the inner bodily mass so as to create nine celestial spheres,with an imperfect residual core. in this paper we reformulate the latindescription in terms of a modern mathematical model. the equations whichdescribe the coupling of light and matter are solved numerically, subject toinitial conditions and critical criteria consistent with the text. formation ofa universe with a non-infinite number of perfected spheres is extremelysensitive to the initial conditions, the intensity of the light and thetransparency of these spheres. in this "medieval multiverse", only a smallrange of opacity and initial density profiles lead to a stable universe withnine perfected spheres. as in current cosmological thinking, the existence ofgrosseteste's universe relies on a very special combination of fundamentalparameters.

1404.3724	bent by baryons: the low mass galaxy-halo relation	the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos is of vital importancefor evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxyformation physics. we show that the widely used method of abundance matchingbased on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two ofits underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lowerrate due to the effect of baryons. in this regime, reliance on dark matter onlysimulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. wefind that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halomasses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching doesnot point to a failure of lcdm, but simply to a failure to account for baryoniceffects. our results also imply that the local group contains only a fewhundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs thatabundance matching would suggest. we show how relations derived from abundancematching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently tocalibrate models of galaxy formation.

1404.6251	overconsumption, outflows and the quenching of satellite galaxies	the baryon cycle of galaxies is a dynamic process involving the intake,consumption and ejection of vast quantities of gas. in contrast, theconventional picture of satellite galaxies has them methodically turning alarge gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed due toexternal ram pressure. this picture needs revision. our modern understanding ofthe baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of thefresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping eventsoccur, a process we call overconsumption. we compile measurements from theliterature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts todetermine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gasstripping events -- either direct stripping of the disk (ram pressurestripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) -- or frominternally-driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. the observedtimescales show significant deviation from the evolution expected for gasstripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is muchmore efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows quench satellitesbefore orbit-based stripping occurs. given the strong redshift evolution ofstar formation rates, at high redshift (z &gt; 1.5) even moderate outflow rateswill lead to extremely short quenching times with the expectation that suchsatellites will be quenched almost immediately following the cessation ofcosmological inflow, regardless of stripping events. observations of highredshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow ratewith current measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2.5 timesthe star formation rate for galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^{10.5} solarmasses.

1406.6362	the chosen few: the low mass halos that host faint galaxies	since reionization prevents star formation in most halos below 3 x 10^9 solarmasses, dwarf galaxies only populate a fraction of existing dark matter halos.we use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the local group to study thediscriminating factors for galaxy formation in the early universe and connectthem to the present-day properties of galaxies and halos. a combination ofselection effects related to reionization, and the subsequent evolution ofhalos in different environments, introduces strong biases between thepopulation of halos that host dwarf galaxies, and the total halo population.halos that host galaxies formed earlier and are more concentrated. in addition,halos more affected by tidal stripping are more likely to host a galaxy for agiven mass or maximum circular velocity, vmax, today. consequently, satellitehalos are populated more frequently than field halos, and satellite halos of10^8 - 10^9 solar masses or vmax of 12 - 20 km/s, similar to the local groupdwarf spheroidals, have experienced a greater than average reduction in bothmass and vmax after infall. they are on closer, more radial orbits with higherinfall velocities and earlier infall times. together, these effects make dwarfgalaxies highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution.

1407.7040	the eagle project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and  their environments	we introduce the virgo consortium's eagle project, a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes inrepresentative volumes. we discuss the limitations of such simulations in lightof their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and howthese affect their predictive power. one major improvement is our treatment offeedback from massive stars and agn in which thermal energy is injected intothe gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowingwinds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. becausethe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, wecalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of thegalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.the observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over thefull mass range, $10^8 &lt; m_*/m_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreementclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented forhydrodynamical simulations. we compare our results to a representative set oflow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find goodagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passivefractions, tully-fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxyclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic civ and ovi. whilethe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent withobservations for $m_* \gtrsim 10^9 m_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep atlower masses. the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters ofgalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting ahigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for agn feedback. eagleconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

1409.8297	the effect of baryons on the inner density profiles of rich clusters	we use the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments"(eagle) cosmological simulation to investigate the effect of baryons on thedensity profiles of rich galaxy clusters. we focus on eagle clusters with$m_{200}&gt;10^{14}~m_\odot$ of which we have six examples. the central brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs) in the simulation have steep stellar density profiles,$\rho_*(r) \propto r^{-3}$. stars dominate the mass density for$r&lt;10~\rm{kpc}$, and, as a result, the total mass density profiles are steeperthan the navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, in remarkable agreement withobservations. the dark matter halo itself closely follows the nfw form at allresolved radii ($r\gtrsim3.0~\rm{kpc}$). the eagle bcgs have similar surfacebrightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles as the bcgs in thesample of newman et al., which have the most detailed measurements currentlyavailable. after subtracting the contribution of the stars to the centraldensity, newman et al. infer significantly shallower slopes than the nfw value,in contradiction with the eagle results. we discuss possible reasons for thisdiscrepancy, and conclude that an inconsistency between the kinematical modeladopted by newman et al. for their bcgs, which assumes isotropic stellarorbits, and the kinematical structure of the eagle bcgs, in which the orbitalstellar anisotropy varies with radius and tends to be radially biased, couldexplain at least part of the discrepancy.

1410.7391	the metallicity of galactic winds	the abundance evolution of galaxies depends critically on the balance betweenthe mixing of metals in their interstellar medium, the inflow of new gas andthe outflow of enriched gas. we study these processes in gas columnsperpendicular to a galactic disk using sub-parsec resolution simulations thattrack stellar ejecta with the flash code. we model a simplified interstellarmedium stirred and enriched by supernovae and their progenitors. we vary thedensity distribution of the gas column and integrate our results over anexponential disk to predict wind and ism enrichment properties for diskgalaxies. we find that winds from more massive galaxies are hotter and morehighly enriched, in stark contrast to that which is often assumed in galaxyformation models. we use these findings in a simple model of galacticenrichment evolution, in which the metallicity of forming galaxies is theresult of accretion of nearly pristine gas and outflow of enriched gas along anequilibrium sequence. we compare these predictions to the observedmass-metallicity relation, and demonstrate how the galaxy's gas fraction is akey controlling parameter. this explains the observed flattening of themass-metallicity relation at higher stellar masses.

1501.01311	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: calibration of subgrid  physics and model variations	we present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore theparameter space of the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironments" (eagle) simulation project. four of the simulations follow theevolution of a periodic cube l = 50 cmpc on a side, and each employs adifferent subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with starformation. the relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations eachreproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. three of thesimulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we showanalytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses thatreduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. such losses aregreatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the eagle reference model - byinjecting more energy in higher density gas. this model produces galaxies withthe observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scalingrelations. in the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process ofthe reference model was varied at a time. we find that the properties ofgalaxies with stellar mass &lt;~ m* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar massfunction) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback fromaccretion onto their central black holes. both processes must be efficient inorder to reproduce the observed galaxy population. in general, simulations thathave been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass functionwill still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement thatgalaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range ofobservables.

1503.04807	molecular hydrogen abundances of galaxies in the eagle simulations	we investigate the abundance of galactic molecular hydrogen (h$_2$) in the"evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle)cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we assign h$_2$ masses to gas particlesin the simulations in post-processing using two different prescriptions thatdepend on the local dust-to-gas ratio and the interstellar radiation field.both result in h$_2$ galaxy mass functions that agree well with observations inthe local and high-redshift universe. the simulations reproduce the observedscaling relations between the mass of h$_2$ and the stellar mass, starformation rate and stellar surface density. towards high edshifts, galaxies inthe simulations display larger h$_2$ mass fractions, and correspondingly lowerh$_2$ depletion timescales, also in good agreement with observations. thecomoving mass density of h$_2$ in units of the critical density, $\omega_{\rmh_2}$, peaks at $z\approx 1.2-1.5$, later than the predicted peak of the cosmicstar formation rate activity, at $z\approx 2$. this difference stems from thedecrease in gas metallicity and increase in interstellar radiation field withredshift, both of which hamper h$_2$ formation. we find that the cosmic h$_2$budget is dominated by galaxies with $m_{\rm h_2}&gt;10^9\,\rm m_{\odot}$, starformation rates $&gt;10\,\rm m_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$ and stellar masses $m_{\rmstellar}&gt;10^{10}\,\rm m_{\odot}$, which are readily observable in the opticaland near-ir. the match between the h$_2$ properties of galaxies that emerge inthe simulations and observations is remarkable, particularly since h$_2$observations were not used to adjust parameters in eagle.

1503.05553	the distribution of neutral hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies and  quasars in the eagle simulation	the observed high covering fractions of neutral hydrogen (hi) with columndensities above $\sim 10^{17} \rm{cm}^{-2}$ around lyman-break galaxies (lbgs)and bright quasars at redshifts z ~ 2-3 has been identified as a challenge forsimulations of galaxy formation. we use the eagle cosmological, hydrodynamicalsimulation, which has been shown to reproduce a wide range of galaxy propertiesand for which the subgrid feedback was calibrated without considering gasproperties, to study the distribution of hi around high-redshift galaxies. wepredict the covering fractions of strong hi absorbers ($n_{\rm{hi}} \gtrsim10^{17} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) inside haloes to increase rapidly with redshift but todepend only weakly on halo mass. for massive ($m_{200} \gtrsim 10^{12} {\rmm_{\odot}}$) halos the covering fraction profiles are nearly scale-invariantand we provide fitting functions that reproduce the simulation results. whileefficient feedback is required to increase the hi covering fractions to thehigh observed values, the distribution of strong absorbers in and around halosof a fixed mass is insensitive to factor of two variations in the strength ofthe stellar feedback. in contrast, at fixed stellar mass the predicted hidistribution is highly sensitive to the feedback efficiency. the fiducial eaglesimulation reproduces both the observed global column density distributionfunction of hi and the observed radial covering fraction profiles of strong hiabsorbers around lbgs and bright quasars.

1504.04025	the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gas  distributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gasdistributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations. the combination of thesestate-of-the-art hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four ordersof magnitude in halo mass ($11 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/ [h^{-1}m_\odot]) &lt; 15$), awide radial range ($-2.3 &lt; log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc ]) &lt; 1.3$) and redshifts $0 &lt;z &lt; 1$. the shape parameters of the dark matter, stellar and hot gasdistributions follow qualitatively similar trends: they become more aspherical(and triaxial) with increasing halo mass, radius and redshift. we measure themisalignment of the baryonic components (hot gas and stars) of galaxies withtheir host halo as a function of halo mass, radius, redshift, and galaxy type(centrals vs satellites and early- vs late-type). overall, galaxies align wellwith the local distribution of the total (mostly dark) matter. however, thestellar distributions on galactic scales exhibit a median misalignment of about45-50 degrees with respect to their host haloes. this misalignment is reducedto 25-30 degrees in the most massive haloes ($13 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot ]) &lt; 15$). half of the disc galaxies in the eagle simulationshave a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40degrees. we present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probabilitydistribution of galaxy-halo misalignment to enable a straightforward inclusionof our results into models of galaxy formations based on purely collisionlessn-body simulations.

1504.04374	colours and luminosities of z=0.1 simulated galaxies in the eagle  simulations	we calculate the colours and luminosities of redshift z = 0.1 galaxies fromthe eagle simulation suite using the galaxev population synthesis models. wetake into account obscuration by dust in birth clouds and diffuse ism using atwo-component screen model, following the prescription of charlot and fall. wecompare models in which the dust optical depth is constant to models where itdepends on gas metallicity, gas fraction and orientation. the colours of eaglegalaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those ofobserved galaxies. in particular, eagle produces a red sequence of passivegalaxies and a blue cloud of star forming galaxies, with approximately thecorrect fraction of galaxies in each population and with g-r colours within 0.1magnitudes of those observed. luminosity functions from uv to nir wavelengthsdiffer from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resultingfrom a choice between petrosian and kron photometric apertures. despite thegenerally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. theblue cloud of eagle galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than inthe data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction inmassive eagle galaxies. there is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxiescompared to observations. the overall level of agreement with the observedcolour distribution suggests that eagle galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages,metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those ofobserved galaxies.

1507.06996	intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report results for the alignments of galaxies in the eagle and cosmo-owlssimulations as a function of galaxy separation and halo mass. the combinationof these hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four orders ofmagnitude in halo mass ($10.7&lt;log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot])&lt;15$) and alarge range of separations ($-1&lt;log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc])&lt; 2$). we focus on twoclasses of alignments: the orientations of galaxies with respect to either thedirections to, or the orientations of, surrounding galaxies. we find that thestrength of the alignment is a strongly decreasing function of the distancebetween galaxies. the orientation-direction alignment can remain significant upto ~100 mpc, for galaxies hosted by the most massive haloes in our simulations.galaxies hosted by more massive subhaloes show stronger alignment. at a fixedhalo mass, more aspherical or prolate galaxies exhibit stronger alignments. thespatial distribution of satellites is anisotropic and significantly alignedwith the major axis of the main host halo. the major axis of satellitegalaxies, when all stars are considered, are preferentially aligned towards thecentre of the main host halo. the predicted projected direction-orientationalignment, $\epsilon_{g+}(r_{p})$, is in broad agreement with recentobservations when only stars within the typical observable extent of a galaxyare used to define galaxy orientations. we find that theorientation-orientation alignment is weaker than the orientation-directionalignment on all scales. overall, the strength of galaxy alignments dependsstrongly on the subset of stars that are used to measure the orientations ofgalaxies and it is always weaker than the alignment of the dark matter haloes.thus, alignment models that use halo orientation as a direct proxy for galaxyorientation will overestimate the impact of intrinsic alignments on weaklensing analyses.

1507.08281	recycled stellar ejecta as fuel for star formation and implications for  the origin of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation	we use cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the eagle and owlsprojects to assess the significance of recycled stellar ejecta as fuel for starformation. the fractional contributions of stellar mass loss to the cosmic starformation rate (sfr) and stellar mass densities increase with time, reaching$35 \%$ and $19 \%$, respectively, at $z=0$. the importance of recyclingincreases steeply with galaxy stellar mass for $m_{\ast} &lt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$, and decreases mildly at higher mass. this trend arises from themass dependence of feedback associated with star formation and agn, whichpreferentially suppresses star formation fuelled by recycling. recycling ismore important for satellites than centrals and its contribution decreases withgalactocentric radius. the relative contribution of agb stars increases withtime and towards galaxy centers. this is a consequence of the more gradualrelease of agb ejecta compared to that of massive stars, and the preferentialremoval of the latter by star formation-driven outflows and by lock up instellar remnants. recycling-fuelled star formation exhibits a tight, positivecorrelation with galaxy metallicity, with a secondary dependence on therelative abundance of alpha elements (which are predominantly synthesized inmassive stars), that is insensitive to the subgrid models for feedback. hence,our conclusions are directly relevant for the origin of the mass-metallicityrelation and metallicity gradients. applying the relation between recycling andmetallicity to the observed mass-metallicity relation yields our best estimateof the mass-dependent contribution of recycling. for centrals with a masssimilar to that of the milky way, we infer the contributions of recycledstellar ejecta to the sfr and stellar mass to be $35 \%$ and $20 \%$,respectively.

1509.05056	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: the importance of the  hydrodynamics scheme	we present results from a subset of simulations from the "evolution andassembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle) suite in which theformulation of the hydrodynamics scheme is varied. we compare simulations thatuse the same subgrid models without re-calibration of the parameters butemploying the standard gadget flavour of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)instead of the more recent state-of-the-art anarchy formulation of sph that wasused in the fiducial eagle runs. we find that the properties of most galaxies,including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the detailsof the hydrodynamics solver. however, the star formation rates of the mostmassive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurioussurface tension in the simulation using standard sph. this affects theefficiency with which agn activity can quench star formation in these galaxiesand it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the x-rayemission from these objects. the differences that can be attributed to thehydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lowerresolution. we also find that the use of a time step limiter is important forachieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of thelow-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.

1511.01098	the apostle simulations: solutions to the local group's cosmic puzzles	the local group of galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests ofmodels of cosmic structure formation. for example, observations of the milkyway (mw) and andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement withn-body simulations of the "lambda cold dark matter" ({\lambda}cdm) model: thereare far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos(the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the mostmassive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightestsatellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes ofsatellites" problem). here we present results from apostle (a project ofsimulating the local environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the localgroup (lg) members. applying the eagle code to the lg environment, we find thatour simulations match the observed abundance of lg galaxies, including thesatellite galaxies of the mw and andromeda. due to changes to the structure ofhalos and the evolution in the lg environment, the simulations reproduce theobserved relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individualdwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in theirdark matter profiles. satellite systems form with a range of spatialanisotropies, including one similar to that of the mw, confirming that such aconfiguration is not unexpected in {\lambda}cdm. finally, based on the observedvelocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of themaximum circular velocity for the halos of nine mw dwarf spheroidals.

1511.04909	the distribution of atomic hydrogen in eagle galaxies: morphologies,  profiles, and hi holes	we compare the mass and internal distribution of atomic hydrogen (hi) in 2200present-day central galaxies with m_star &gt; 10^10 m_sun from the 100 mpc eaglereference simulation to observational data. atomic hydrogen fractions arecorrected for self-shielding using a fitting formula from radiative transfersimulations and for the presence of molecular hydrogen using an empirical or atheoretical prescription from the literature. the resulting neutral hydrogenfractions, m_(hi+h2)/m_star, agree with observations to better than 0.1 dex forgalaxies with m_star between 10^10 and 10^11 m_sun. our fiducial, empirical h2model based on gas pressure results in galactic hi mass fractions, m_hi/m_star,that agree with observations from the gass survey to better than 0.3 dex, butthe alternative theoretical h2 formula leads to a negative offset inm_hi/m_star of up to 0.5 dex. visual inspection reveals that most hi disks insimulated hi-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recentaccretion events. many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large hiholes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementationin eagle. the hi mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holesin the hi disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1dex). the presence of large hi holes also makes the radial hi surface densityprofiles somewhat too low in the centre, at \sigma_hi &gt; 1 m_sun pc^-2 (by afactor of &lt;~ 2 compared to data from the bluedisk survey). in the outer region(\sigma_hi &lt; 1 m_sun pc^-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively withobservations. scaled by hi size, the simulated profiles of hi-rich (m_hi &gt;10^9.8 m_sun) and control galaxies (10^9.1 m_sun &gt; m_hi &gt; 10^9.8 m_sun) followeach other closely, as observed.

1511.07344	evidence for a change in the dominant satellite galaxy quenching  mechanism at z=1	we present an analysis of galaxies in groups and clusters at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2$,from the gclass and geec2 spectroscopic surveys. we compute a "conversionfraction" $f_{\rm convert}$ that represents the fraction of galaxies that wereprematurely quenched by their environment. for massive galaxies, $m_{\rmstar}&gt;10^{10.3}m_\odot$, we find $f_{\rm convert}\sim 0.4$ in the groups and$\sim 0.6$ in the clusters, similar to comparable measurements at $z=0$. thismeans the time between first accretion into a more massive halo and final starformation quenching is $t_p\sim 2$ gyr. this is substantially longer than theestimated time required for a galaxy's star formation rate to become zero onceit starts to decline, suggesting there is a long delay time during which littledifferential evolution occurs. in contrast with local observations we findevidence that this delay timescale may depend on stellar mass, with $t_p$approaching $t_{\rm hubble}$ for $m_{\rm star}\sim 10^{9.5}m_\odot$. the resultsuggests that the delay time must not only be much shorter than it is today,but may also depend on stellar mass in a way that is not consistent with asimple evolution in proportion to the dynamical time. instead, we find the dataare well-matched by a model in which the decline in star formation is due to"overconsumption", the exhaustion of a gas reservoir through star formation andexpulsion via modest outflows in the absence of cosmological accretion.dynamical gas removal processes, which are likely dominant in quenching newlyaccreted satellites today, may play only a secondary role at $z=1$.

0807.0001	the colours of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters	current models of galaxy formation predict satellite galaxies in groups andclusters that are redder than observed. we investigate the effect on thecolours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram pressure stripping of theirhot gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. weincorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamicsimulations within the durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. thesimulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressivethan previously assumed. the main uncertainty in the model is the treatment ofgas expelled by supernovae. with reasonable assumptions for the stripping ofthis material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significantfraction of their hot gas for several gigayears, thereby replenishing theirreservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively longperiod of time. a bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to thatobserved in sdss data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxiesare in good agreement with the data. in addition, our model naturally accountsfor the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from smallgroups to high mass clusters.

astro-ph;0005294	exploring the evolution of spiral galaxies	we have constructed a family of simple models for spiral galaxy evolution toallow us to investigate observational trends in star formation history withgalaxy parameters. the models are used to generate broad band colours fromwhich ages and metallicities are derived in the same way as the data. wegenerate a grid of model galaxies and select only those which lie in regions ofparameter space covered by the sample. the data are consistent with theproposition that the star formation history of a region within a galaxy dependsprimarily on the local surface density of the gas but that one or twoadditional ingredients are required to fully explain the observational data.the observed age gradients appear steeper than those produced by the densitydependent star formation law, indicating that the star formation law or infallhistory must vary with galactocentric radius. furthermore, themetallicity-magnitude and age-magnitude correlations are not reproduced by alocal density dependence alone. these correlations require one or both of thefollowing: (i) a combination of mass dependent infall and metal enrichedoutflow, or (ii) a mass dependent galaxy formation epoch. distinguishing thesepossibilities on the basis of current data is extremely difficult.

astro-ph;0010505	a low global star formation rate in the rich galaxy cluster ac114 at  z=0.32	we present the results of a wide-field survey for h-alpha emitting galaxiesin the cluster ac114 at z=0.32. spectra centred on h-alpha at the clusterredshift have been obtained for 586 galaxies to i~22 out to a radius around2mpc. at most, only ~10% of these were found to be h-alpha-emitting clustermembers. these objects are predominantly blue and of late-type spiralmorphology, consistent with them hosting star formation. however, ~65% of thecluster members classified morphologically as spirals (with hst), have nodetectable h-alpha emission; star-formation and morphological evolution incluster galaxies appear to be largely decoupled. changes in the h-alphadetection rate and the strength of h-alpha emission with environment are foundto be weak within the region studied. star formation within the cluster membersis also found to be strongly and uniformly suppressed, with the rates inferredfrom the h-alpha emission not exceeding 4mo/yr, and ac114's h-alpha luminosityfunction being an order of magnitude below that observed for field galaxies atthe same redshift. none of the galaxies detected have the high star formationrates associated with `starburst' galaxies; however, this may still bereconciliable with the known (8+/-3%) fraction of `post-starburst' galaxieswithin ac114, given the poorly determined but short lifetimes of starbursts andthe possibility that much of the associated star formation is obscured by dust.

astro-ph;0109022	bubbles, feedback and the intra-cluster medium: three-dimensional  hydrodynamic simulations	we use a three dimensional hydrodynamical code to simulate the effect ofenergy injection on cooling flows in the intracluster medium. specifically, wecompare a simulation of a 10$^{15}$ $m_\odot$ cluster with radiative coolingonly, with a second simulation in which thermal energy is injected 31 $\kpc$off-centre, over 64 kpc$^{3}$ at a rate of $4.9\times 10^{44} \ergs$ for 50myr. the heat injection forms a hot, low density bubble which quickly rises,dragging behind it material from the cluster core. the rising bubble pusheswith it a shell of gas which expands and cools. we find the appearance of thebubble in x-ray temperature and luminosity to be in good qualitative agreementwith recent {\it chandra} observations of cluster cores. toward the end of thesimulation, at 600 myr, the displaced gas begins to fall back toward the core,and the subsequent turbulence is very efficient at mixing the low and highentropy gas. the result is that the cooling flow is disrupted for up to $\sim50$ myr after the injection of energy ceases. thus, this mechanism provides avery efficient method for regulating cooling flows, if the injection eventsoccur with a 1:1 duty cycle.

astro-ph;0203334	an h-alpha survey of the rich cluster a1689	(abridged) we present results of an h-alpha survey in the rich cluster a1689at z=0.18, using the ldss++ spectrograph on the aat. we obtained spectracovering redshifted h-alpha for 522 galaxies brighter than i=22.5, covering afield of 8.7'x8.7'. we detect h-alpha emission in 46 of these galaxies;accounting for selection effects due to sampling and cluster membership, wedetermine that 24% of cluster members brighter than m_r=-16.5+5log(h) aredetected with h-alpha flux greater than 4h^{-2}x 10^{38} ergs/s. thiscorresponds to a limiting star formation rate of 0.008 h^{-2} msun/yr, assuming1 magnitude of dust extinction. from a hubble space telescope mosaic covering7.5' x 10.0', we determine morphologies for 199 galaxies brighter than i=21,and find that 20% of the cluster members are of type sa or later. more than 90%of cluster spirals show h-alpha emission, compared with less than 10% of e ands0 galaxies. the cluster h-alpha luminosity function has a low normalisationrelative to the z~0.2 field, by ~50%, after accounting for the differentfraction of spiral galaxies in the two environments. when compared with localfield galaxies, this suggests that star formation activity is suppressed inearly-type cluster galaxies, relative to their field counterparts. our sampleincludes 29 galaxies previously observed with isocam at 6 and 15 microns. wedetect all 15-micron sources at h-alpha, so there is no evidence for any starformation completely hidden at h-alpha. comparing the 15-micron and h-alphafluxes, we find evidence that some mid-infrared-detected galaxies could beobscured by as much as 3 magnitudes of extinction at h-alpha, although thisdepends on the largely unknown contribution from any agn-heated dust to themid-infrared flux.

astro-ph;0205240	modified-entropy models for the intracluster medium	we present a set of cluster models that link the present-day properties ofclusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation. these models treat theentropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamentalproperty. because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient thatrises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster dependentirely on its dark-matter potential and the entropy distribution of itsuncondensed gas. guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropydistribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernovaheating by assuming that the gas-density distribution would be identical tothat of the dark matter. the lowest-entropy gas would then fall below acritical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a hubble time.radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify theentropy of that low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distributionfunction and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. usingsome phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on theexistence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set ofcluster models. the surface-brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, andluminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge fromthese models. by introducing a single adjustable parameter related to theamount of intracluster gas that can cool within a hubble time, we can alsoreproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations ofcooling-flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.

astro-ph;0304447	on the origin of intracluster entropy	the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium and the shape of itsconfining potential well completely determine the x-ray properties of a relaxedcluster of galaxies, motivating us to explore the origin of intraclusterentropy and to describe how it develops in terms of some simple models. wepresent an analytical model for smooth accretion, including both preheating andradiative cooling, that links a cluster's entropy distribution to its massaccretion history and shows that smooth accretion overproduces the entropyobserved in massive clusters by a factor ~2-3, depending on the mass accretionrate. any inhomogeneity in the accreting gas reduces entropy production at theaccretion shock; thus, smoothing of the gas accreting onto a cluster raises itsentropy level. because smooth accretion produces more entropy than hierarchicalaccretion, we suggest that some of the observed differences between clustersand groups may arise because preheating smooths the smaller-scale lumps of gasaccreting onto groups more effectively than it smooths the larger-scale lumpsaccreting onto clusters. this effect may explain why entropy levels at theoutskirts of groups are ~2-3 times larger than expected from self-similarscaling arguments. the details of how the density distribution of accreting gasaffects the entropy distribution of a cluster are complex, and we suggest howto explore the relevant physics with numerical simulations.

0808.2994	the flip-side of galaxy formation: a combined model of galaxy formation  and cluster heating	only ~10% of baryons in the universe are in the form of stars, yet mostmodels of luminous structure formation have concentrated on the properties ofthe luminous stellar matter. in this paper we focus on the "flip side" ofgalaxy formation and investigate the properties of the material that is notpresently locked up in galaxies. this "by-product" of galaxy formation can beobserved as an x-ray emitting plasma (the intracluster medium, hereafter icm)in groups and clusters, and we present a version of the durham semi-analyticgalaxy formation model galform that allows us to investigate the properties ofthe icm. as we would expect on the basis of gravitational scaling arguments,the previous model (presented in bower et al. 2006) fails to reproduce even themost basic observed properties of the icm; however, we present a simplemodification to the model to allow for heat input into the icm from the agn"radio mode" feedback. this heating acts to expel gas from the x-ray luminouscentral regions of the host halo. with this modification, the model reproducesthe observed gas mass fractions and luminosity-temperature relation of groupsand clusters. introducing the heating process into the model requires changesto a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observedgalaxy properties. with the revised parameters, the best fitting luminosityfunction is comparable to that presented in bower et al. (2006). the new modelmakes a fundamental step forward, providing a unified model of galaxy andcluster icm formation. however, the detailed comparison with the data is notcompletely satisfactory, and we highlight key areas for improvement.

astro-ph;0306342	the difference between clusters and groups: a journey from cluster cores  to their outskirts and beyond	in this review, we take the reader on a journey. we start by looking at theproperties of galaxies in the cores of rich clusters. we have focused on theoverall picture: star formation in clusters is strongly suppressed relative tofield galaxies at the same redshift. we will argue that the increasing activityand blue populations of clusters with redshift results from a greater level ofactivity in field galaxies rather than a change in the transformation imposedby the cluster environment. with this in mind, we travel out from the clusterfocussing firstly on the properties of galaxies in the outskirts of clustersand then on galaxies in isolated groups. at low redshift, we are able toefficiently probe these environments using the sloan and 2df redshift surveys.these allow an accurate comparison of galaxy star formation rates in differentregions. the current results show a strong suppression of star formation abovea critical threshold in local density. the threshold seems similar regardlessof the overall mass of the system. at low redshift at least, only galaxies inclose, isolated pairs have their star formation rate boosted above the globalaverage. at higher redshift, work on constructing homogeneous catalogues ofgalaxies in groups and in the infall regions of clusters is still at an earlystage. in the final section, we draw these strands together, summarising whatwe can deduce about the mechanisms that transform star forming field galaxiesinto their quiescent cluster counter-parts. we discuss what we can learn aboutthe impact of environment on the global star formation history of the universe.

astro-ph;0310809	exploring the selection of galaxy clusters and groups: an optical survey  for x-ray dark clusters	data from a new, wide field, coincident optical and x-ray survey, the x-raydark cluster survey (xdcs) are presented. this survey comprises simultaneousand independent searches for clusters of galaxies in the optical and x-raypassbands. optical cluster detection algorithms implemented on the data aredetailed. two distinct optically selected catalogues are constructed, one basedon i-band overdensity, the other on overdensities of colour-selected galaxies.the superior accuracy of the colour-selection technique over that of the singlepassband method is demonstrated, via internal consistency checks and comparisonwith external spectroscopic redshift information. this is compared with anx-ray selected cluster catalogue. in terms of gross numbers, the survey yields185 i-band selected, 290 colour selected and 15 x-ray selected systems,residing in ~11deg^2 of optical + x-ray imaging. the relationship betweenoptical richness/ luminosity and x-ray luminosity is examined, by measuringx-ray luminosities at the positions of our 290 colour-selected systems. powerlaw correlations between the optical richness/ luminosity versus x-rayluminosity are fitted, both exhibiting approximately 0.2 dex of intrinsicscatter. interesting outliers in these correlations are discussed in greaterdetail. spectroscopic follow up of a subsample of x-ray underluminous systemsconfirms their reality.

astro-ph;0412064	the evolution of [oii] emission from cluster galaxies	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in cluster galaxies.we complement data from the cnoc1 cluster survey (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.6) with measurementsfrom galaxy clusters in the 2df galaxy redshift survey (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.1) andmeasurements from recently published work on higher redshift clusters, up toalmost z=1. we focus our attention on galaxies in the cluster core, ie.galaxies with r&lt;0.7h^{-1}_{70}mpc. averaging over clusters in redshift bins, wefind that the fraction of galaxies with strong [oii] emission is &lt; 20% incluster cores, and the fraction evolves little with redshift. in contrast,field galaxies from the survey show a very strong increase over the sameredshift range. it thus appears that the environment in the cores of richclusters is hostile to star formation at all the redshifts studied. we comparethis result with the evolution of the colours of galaxies in cluster cores,first reported by butcher &amp; oemler (1984). using the same galaxies for ouranalysis of the [oii] emission, we confirm that the fraction of blue galaxies,which are defined as galaxies 0.2 mag bluer in the rest frame b-v than the redsequence of each cluster, increases strongly with redshift. since the coloursof galaxies retain a memory of their recent star formation history, whileemission from the [oii] line does not, we suggest that these two results canbest be reconciled if the rate at which the clusters are being assembled ishigher in the past, and the galaxies from which it is being assembled aretypically bluer.

astro-ph;0501379	on the evolutionary status of early-type galaxies in clusters at z~0.2 -  i. the fundamental plane	we investigate a spectroscopic sample of 48 early-type (e+s0) galaxies in therich cluster abell 2390 (z=0.23) and 48 e+s0 galaxies from a previouslypublished survey of abell 2218 (z=0.18). the a2390 spectra are based on multiobject spectroscopy with mosca at the calar alto 3.5-m, complemented byground-based and hst f555w and f814w observations. our investigation spans abroad range in luminosity (-20.5&gt;m_r&gt;-23.0) and a wide fov of 1.5x1.5 mpc^2.since the a2218 and a2390 samples are very similar, we can combine them andanalyse a total of 96 e+s0 galaxies at z~0.2. we construct the faber-jacksonrelation (fjr) for all e+s0s and detect a modest luminosity evolution. theaverage offset from the local fjr in gunn r-band is (deltam_r)=0.32+-0.22^m.less-massive galaxies show a trend for a larger evolution than more-massivegalaxies. hst/wfpc2 surface brightness profile fits were used to derivestructural parameters. for 34 e+s0 galaxies which enter the fundamental plane(fp) we deduce a mild evolution in gunn r with a zero-point offset of0.10+-0.06, corresponding to 0.31+-0.18^m. elliptical and lenticular galaxiesare uniformly distributed along the fp with a similar scatter of 0.1 dex. wefind little evidence for differences between the populations of ellipticals ands0s. lenticulars induce on average a larger evolution of 0.44+-0.18^m thanellipticals with 0.02+-0.21^m. the m/l ratios at z=0.2 are offset by(deltalog(m/l_r))=-0.12+-0.06 dex compared to those of coma. our results can bereconciled with a passive evolution of the stellar populations and a highformation redshift for the bulk of the stars in e+s0 galaxies. however, ourfindings are also consistent with the hierarchical formation picture for richclusters.

astro-ph;0511682	discovery of a very extended x-ray halo around a quiescent spiral galaxy  - the "missing link" of galaxy formation	hot gaseous haloes surrounding galaxies and extending well beyond thedistribution of stars are a ubiquitous prediction of galaxy formationscenarios. the haloes are believed to consist of gravitationally trapped gaswith a temperature of millions of kelvin. the existence of such hot haloesaround massive elliptical galaxies has been established through their x-rayemission. while gas out-flowing from starburst spiral galaxies has beendetected, searches for hot haloes around normal, quiescent spiral galaxies haveso far failed, casting doubts on the fundamental physics in galaxy formationmodels. here we present the first detection of a hot, large-scale gaseous halosurrounding a normal, quiescent spiral galaxy, ngc 5746, alleviating along-standing problem for galaxy formation models. in contrast to starburstgalaxies, where the x-ray halo can be powered by the supernova energy, there isno such power source in ngc 5746. the only compelling explanation is that weare here witnessing a galaxy forming from gradually in-flowing hot and dilutehalo gas.

astro-ph;0609314	revisiting the baryon fractions of galaxy clusters: a comparison with  wmap 3-year results	the universal baryonic mass fraction (omega_b/omega_m) can be sensitivelyconstrained using x-ray observations of galaxy clusters. in this paper, wecompare the baryonic mass fraction inferred from measurements of the cosmicmicrowave background with the gas mass fractions (f_gas) of a large sample ofclusters taken from the recent literature. in systems cooler than 4 kev, f_gasdeclines as the system temperature decreases. however, in higher temperaturesystems, f_gas(r500) converges to approx. (0.12 +/- 0.02)(h/0.72)^{-1.5}, wherethe uncertainty reflects the systematic variations between clusters at r500.this is significantly lower than the maximum-likelihood value of the baryonfraction from the recently released wmap 3-year results. we investigatepossible reasons for this discrepancy, including the effects of radiativecooling and non-gravitational heating, and conclude that the most likelysolution is that omega_m is higher than the best-fit wmap value (we findomega_m = 0.36^{+0.11}_{-0.08}), but consistent at the 2-sigma level.degeneracies within the wmap data require that sigma_8 must also be greaterthan the maximum likelihood value for consistency between the data sets.

astro-ph;0610839	the stellar mass content of distant galaxy groups	we have obtained near-infrared imaging of 58 galaxy groups, in the redshiftrange 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6, from the william herschel telescope and from the spitzer iracdata archive. the groups are selected from the cnoc2 redshift survey, withadditional spectroscopy from the baade telescope (magellan). our group samplesare statistically complete to k(vega}=17.7 (ingrid) and [3.6](ab)=19.9 (irac).  from these data we construct near-infrared luminosity functions, for groupsin bins of velocity dispersion, up to 800 km/s, and redshift. the total amountof near-infrared luminosity per group is compared with the dynamical mass,estimated from the velocity dispersion, to compute the mass-to-light ratio,m/lk. we find that the m/lk values in these groups are in good agreement withthose of their statistical descendants at z=0, with no evidence for evolutionbeyond that expected for a passively evolving population. there is a trend ofm/lk with group mass, which increases from m/lk~10 for groups with sigma&lt;250km/s to m/lk~100 for sigma=425-800 km/s. this trend is weaker, but stillpresent, if we estimate the total mass from weak lensing measurements. in termsof stellar mass, stars make up ~2 per cent of the mass in the smallest groups,and ~1 per cent in the most massive groups. we also use the near-infrared datato consider the correlations between stellar populations and stellar masses,for group and field galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6. we find that fewer group galaxiesshow strong [oii] emission compared with field galaxies of the same stellarmass and at the same redshift. we conclude that most of the stellar mass inthese groups was already in place by z~0.4, with little environment-drivenevolution to the present day.

astro-ph;0610893	investigating hot gas in the halos of two massive spirals: observations  and cosmological simulations	models of disk galaxy formation commonly predict the existence of an extendedreservoir of hot gas surrounding massive spirals at low redshift. as a test ofthese models, we have obtained x-ray and optical data of the two massiveedge-on spirals ngc 5746 and ngc 5170, in order to investigate the amount andorigin of hot gas in their disks and halos. chandra observations of ngc 5746reveal evidence for diffuse x-ray emission with a total luminosity of ~7 x10^39 erg/s surrounding this galaxy out to at least ~20 kpc from the disk,whereas an identical study of the less massive ngc 5170 fails to detect anyextraplanar x-ray emission. unlike the case for other disk galaxies withdetected x-ray halos, the halo emission around ngc 5746 is not accompanied byextraplanar h-alpha or radio emission, and there is no evidence for significantnuclear or starburst activity in the disk. in contrast to these other cases,the emission around ngc 5746 therefore appears to arise from the cooling ofexternally accreted material rather than from disk outflows. to verify thisidea, we present results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation andevolution, showing our observations to be in good agreement with expectationsfor cosmological accretion, while also confirming that the x-ray halos of otherspirals do not fit well into an accretion scenario. we find that the estimatedcooling rate of hot halo gas around ngc 5746 would provide sufficient materialfor star formation in the disk to proceed at its present rate. this lendssupport to the idea that a supply of hot ambient gas is potentially availableas fuel for star formation in massive, nearby spirals, and suggests thataccretion of hot gas could be important for maintaining the stellar disks ofsuch galaxies.

astro-ph;0612354	models for jet power in elliptical galaxies: a case for rapidly spinning  black holes	the power of jets from black holes are expected to depend on both the spin ofthe black hole and the structure of the accretion disk in the region of thelast stable orbit. we investigate these dependencies using two differentphysical models for the jet power: the classical blandford-znajek (bz) modeland a hybrid model developed by meier. in the bz case, the jets are powered bymagnetic fields directly threading the spinning black hole while in the hybridmodel, the jet energy is extracted from both the accretion disk as well as theblack hole via magnetic fields anchored to the accretion flow inside andoutside the hole's ergosphere. the hybrid model takes advantage of thestrengths of both the blandford-payne and bz mechanisms, while avoiding themore controversial features of the latter. we develop these models more fullyto account for general relativistic effects and to focus on advection-dominatedaccretion flows (adaf) for which the jet power is expected to be a significantfraction of the accreted rest mass energy.  we apply the models to elliptical galaxies, in order to see if these modelscan explain the observed correlation between the bondi accretion rates and thetotal jet powers. for typical values of the disk viscosity parameteralpha~0.04-0.3 and mass accretion rates consistent with adaf modelexpectations, we find that the observed correlation requires j&gt;0.9; i.e., itimplies that the black holes are rapidly spinning. our results suggest that thecentral black holes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidlyrotating in order to drive jets powerful enough to heat the intracluster mediumand quench cooling flows.

astro-ph;0612392	modelling the jet power in elliptical galaxies: support for rapidly  spinning black holes	recently, allen et al. measured a tight correlation between the bondiaccretion rates and jet powers of the nuclei of nearby x-ray luminouselliptical galaxies. we employ two models of jet powering to understand theabove correlation and derive constraints on the spin and accretion rate of thecentral black holes. the first is the blandford-znajek model, in which the spinenergy of the hole is extracted as jet power; the second model is an hybridversion of the blandford-payne and blandford-znajek processes, in which theoutflow is generated in the inner parts of the accretion disk. we assumeadvection-dominated accretion flows (adaf) and account for general relativisticeffects. our modelling implies that for typical values of the disk viscosityparameter alpha~0.01-1 the tight correlation implies the narrow range of spinsj~0.7-1 and accretion rates mdot(r_ms)~(0.01-1) mdot_bondi. our results providesupport for the "spin paradigm" scenario and suggest that the central blackholes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidly rotating in order todrive radio jets powerful enough to quench the cooling flows.

astro-ph;0701335	modelling shock heating in cluster mergers: i. moving beyond the  spherical accretion model	(abridged) the thermal history of the intracluster medium (icm) is complex.heat input from cluster mergers, agn, and galaxy winds offsets and may evenhalt the cooling of the icm. consequently, the processes that set theproperties of the icm play a key role in determining how galaxies form. in thispaper we focus on the shock heating of the icm during cluster mergers, with theeventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation.  we use a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to track the evolution of the icmin idealised two-body mergers. we find the heating of the icm can be understoodrelatively simply by considering the evolution of the gas entropy during themergers. we examine the processes that generate the entropy in order tounderstand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. we find that: (1)the energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kineticenergy available when the systems first touch. the smaller system penetratesdeep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) for unequal massmergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. theheating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of thefinal system. (3) the bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinctepisodes. the first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock waveis generated that propagates outwards from the centre. this causes the combinedsystem to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. the secondepisode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. thisrevised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physicalunderstanding of cosmological gas simulations.

astro-ph;9612151	a weak lensing survey in the fields of z~1 luminous radio sources	in this paper we present weak lensing observations of the fields around 8 z~1luminous radio sources. these data are searched for the lensing signatures ofclusters that are either physically associated with the radio objects, or areforeground systems projected along the line of sight. the radio sources wereall imaged with wfpc-2/hst providing high quality shape information on largenumbers of faint galaxies around them. statistical analysis of the coherentshear field visible in the shapes of the faint galaxies indicates that we havedetected a weak lensing signal close to one of the targets, 3c336 at z=0.927,with a high level of confidence. a second, independent wfpc-2 observation ofthis target reinforces this detection. our results support the earliersuggestion of weak lensing in this field by fort et al (1996) usingground-based data. we also combined the shear distributions in the remaining 7field to improve our sensitivity to weak shear signals from any structuretypically associated with these sources. we find no detectable signal andestimate an upper limit on the maximum shear allowed by our observations. usingan n(z) estimated from lensing analyses we convert our observed lensing signaland limits into estimates of the masses of the various structures. we suggestthat further lensing observations of distant radio sources and their hostenvironments may allow the cluster l_x-mass relationship to be mapped athigh-z. this is crucial for interpreting the results of the next generation ofdeep x-ray surveys, and thus constraining the redshift evolution of the clustermass function out to z=1.

astro-ph;9705099	a dynamical study of optically selected distant clusters	we present a programme of spectroscopic observations of galaxies in a sampleof optically-selected clusters taken from the catalogue of couch et al (1991).previous rosat observations of these clusters have shown them to have lowerx-ray luminosities, given their optical richness, than might be expected on thebasis of local samples. in the present paper we extend this work by determiningvelocity dispersions of a subsample of the clusters. we confirm the dynamicalreality of all but one of the original sample, and find velocity dispersionscomparable with present-day clusters of equivalent comoving space density.thus, in the context of the $l_x-\sigma$ relation for present-day clusters,there is evidence for a higher velocity dispersion at fixed x-ray luminosity.  a key question is whether the high velocity dispersions are indicative of thegravitational potential. if they are, the x-ray luminosities measured in boweret al., 1994 (paper i), would then imply an implausibly low efficiency of x-raygeneration. alternatively, the discrepancy could be explained if the clusterswere systems of lower virial temperature, in which the apparent velocitydispersion is inflated by an infalling, unrelaxed halo. this might resulteither from an increase with redshift in the infall rate for clusters, or fromthe preferential selection of clusters embedded in filaments oriented along theline of sight. since clusters with similar properties can be found in localoptically selected catalogues, we suggest that the latter explanation is morelikely.

astro-ph;9805290	the colour-magnitude relation as a constraint on the formation of rich  cluster galaxies	in this paper, we examine the role that the colour-magnitude relation (cmr)can play in constraining the formation history of rich cluster galaxies.  firstly, we consider the colour evolution of galaxies after star formationceases. we show that the scatter of the cmr places a strong constraint on thespread in age of the bulk of the stellar population. however, although the bulkof stars must be formed in a short period, continuing formation of stars in afraction of the galaxies is not so strongly constrained.  we examine a model in which star formation occurs over an extended period oftime in most galaxies. an extension of this type of star formation historyallows us to reconcile the small present-day scatter of the cmr with theobserved blue galaxy fractions of intermediate redshift galaxy clusters.  secondly, the cmr can also be used to constrain the degree of merging betweenpre-existing stellar systems. this test relies on the slope of the cmr. we showthat random mergers between galaxies very rapidly remove any well-defined cmr.however, we prefer to examine the merger process using a self-consistent mergertree. in such a model there are two effects: massive galaxies preferentiallymerge with systems of similar mass; and the rate of mass growth is considerablysmaller than for the random merger case. as a result of both of these effects,the cmr persists through a larger number of merger steps. the passive evolutionof galaxy colours and their averaging in dissipationless mergers provideopposing constraints on the formation of cluster galaxies in a hierarchicalmodel; but at the level of current constraints, a compromise solution appearspossible.

astro-ph;9806120	a bayesian classifier for photometric redshifts: identification of high  redshift clusters	photometric redshift classifiers provide a means of estimating galaxyredshifts from observations using a small number of broad-band filters.however, the accuracy with which redshifts can be determined is sensitive tothe star formation history of the galaxy, for example the effects of age,metallicity and on-going star formation. we present a photometric classifierthat explicitly takes into account the degeneracies implied by thesevariations, based on the flexible stellar population synthesis code of kodama &amp;arimoto. the situation is encouraging since many of the variations in stellarpopulations introduce colour changes that are degenerate. we use a bayesianinversion scheme to estimate the likely range of redshifts compatible with theobserved colours. when applied to existing multi-band photometry for abell 370,most of the cluster members are correctly recovered with little fieldcontamination. the inverter is focussed on the recovery of a wide variety ofgalaxy populations in distant (z~1) clusters from broad band colours coveringthe 4000 angstrom break. it is found that this can be achieved with impressiveaccuracy ($|\delta z| &lt; 0.1$), allowing detailed investigation into theevolution of cluster galaxies with little selection bias.

astro-ph;9807240	measuring \omega_0 from the entropy evolution of clusters	in this paper, we have extended the entropy-driven model of cluster evolutiondeveloped by bower (1997) in order to be able to predict the evolution ofgalaxy clusters for a range of cosmological scenarios. we have applied thismodel to recent measurements of the evolution of the l_x-t normalisation andx-ray luminosity function in order to place constraints on cosmologicalparameters. we find that these measurements alone do not select a particularcosmological frame-work. an additional constraint is required on the effectiveslope of the power spectrum to break the degeneracy that exists between thisand the background cosmology. we have therefore included a theoreticalcalculation of the \omega_0 dependence on the power spectrum, based on the colddark matter paradigm, which infers \omega_0&lt;0.55 (0.1&lt;\omega_0&lt;0.7 for\omega_0+\lambda_0=1), at the 95% confidence level. alternatively, anindependent measurement of the slope of the power spectrum from galaxyclustering requires \omega_0&lt;0.6 (\omega_0&lt;0.65 for \omega_0+\lambda_0=1),again to 95% confidence. the rate of entropy evolution is insensitive to thevalues of \omega_0 considered, although is sensitive to changes in thedistribution of the intracluster medium.

astro-ph;9808325	the formation history of early-type galaxies: an observational  perspective	this talk investigates the formation of early-type galaxies from adeliberately observational view point. i begin by reviewing the conclusionsthat can be reached by comparing the detailed properties of galaxies inpresent-day clusters, focusing on the colour-magnitude relation in particular.the overriding picture is one of homogeneity, implying a remarkable uniformityin the formation of these galaxies. this picture contrasts with the increasingactivity seen in clusters as a function of redshift, creating an apparentparadox been the obvious diversity of star formation histories in distantcluster galaxies and their uniformity in local systems. a resolution isfeasible so long as star formation occurs over an extended epoch.  in addition to placing limits on variations in star formation history theexistence of a tight `fundamental relations', such as the colour-magnituderelation, can be used to investigate galaxy mergers and to set limits on thedegree to which present-day clusters galaxies are built by combining systems ofstars formed in smaller units. the final part of this talk turns to early-typegalaxies in the field, and tries to apply the same techniques that have beensuccessful in clusters. this is an emerging field in which appropriatedata-sets are only just becoming available; however, comparison of theformation histories of galaxies in a wide variety of environments is key todistinguishing between the classical and hierarchical models for galaxyformation.

astro-ph;9903436	ram pressure stripping of spiral galaxies in clusters	we use 3-dimensional sph/n-body simulations to study ram pressure strippingof gas from spiral galaxies orbiting in clusters. we find that the analyticexpectation of gunn &amp; gott (1972) relating the gravitational restoring forceprovided by the disk to the ram pressure force, provides a good approximationto the radius that gas will be stripped from a galaxy. however, at small radiiit is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component.a spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster such as coma, willhave its gaseous disk truncated to $\sim 4$ kpc, thus losing $\sim 80%$ of itsdiffuse gas mass. the timescale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossingtime $\sim 10^7$ years. galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclinedto the direction of motion through the intra-cluster medium will losesignificantly less gas. we conclude that ram-pressure alone is insufficient toaccount for the rapid and widespread truncation of star-formation observed incluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of sab's to s0's that isnecessary to explain the butcher-oemler effect.

astro-ph;9909401	the star formation histories of low surface brightness galaxies	we have performed deep imaging of a diverse sample of 26 low surfacebrightness galaxies (lsbgs) in the optical and the near-infrared. using stellarpopulation synthesis models, we find that it is possible to place constraintson the ratio of young to old stars (which we parameterise in terms of theaverage age of the galaxy), as well as the metallicity of the galaxy, usingoptical and near-infrared colours. lsbgs have a wide range of morphologies andstellar populations, ranging from older, high metallicity earlier types to muchyounger and lower metallicity late type galaxies. despite this wide range ofstar formation histories, we find that colour gradients are common in lsbgs.these are most naturally interpreted as gradients in mean stellar age, with theouter regions of lsbgs having younger ages than their inner regions. in anattempt to understand what drives the differences in lsbg stellar populations,we compare lsbg average ages and metallicities with their physical parameters.strong correlations are seen between a lsbg's star formation history and its kband surface brightness, k band absolute magnitude and gas fraction. thesecorrelations are consistent with a scenario in which the star formation historyof a lsbg primarily correlates with its surface density and its metallicitycorrelates both with its mass and surface density.
