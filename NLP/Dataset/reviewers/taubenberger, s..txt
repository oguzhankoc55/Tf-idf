0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0904.0119	evidence of asymmetry in sn 2007rt, a type iin supernova	an optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the slowly-evolving typeiin sn2007rt is presented, covering a duration of 481 days after discovery. itsearliest spectrum, taken approximately 100 days after the explosion epoch,indicates the presence of a dense circumstellar medium, with which thesupernova ejecta is interacting. this is supported by the slowly-evolving lightcurve. a notable feature in the spectrum of sn 2007rt is the presence of abroad he i 5875 line, not usually detected in type iin supernovae. this mayimply that the progenitor star has a high he/h ratio, having shed a significantportion of its hydrogen shell via mass-loss. an intermediate resolutionspectrum reveals a narrow halpha p-cygni profile, the absorption component ofwhich has a width of 128 km/s. this slow velocity suggests that the progenitorof sn 2007rt recently underwent mass-loss with wind speeds comparable to thelower limits of those detected in luminous blue variables. asymmetries in theline profiles of h and he at early phases bears some resemblance todouble-peaked features observed in a number of ib/c spectra. these asymmetriesmay be indicative of an asymmetric or bipolar outflow or alternatively dustformation in the fast expanding ejecta. in addition, the late time spectrum, atover 240 days post-explosion, shows clear evidence for the presence of newlyformed dust.

0904.0637	sn 1999ga: a low-luminosity linear type ii supernova?	type ii-linear supernovae are thought to arise from progenitors that havelost most of their h envelope by the time of the explosion, and they are poorlyunderstood because they are only occasionally discovered. it is possible thatthey are intrinsically rare, but selection effects due to their rapidluminosity evolution may also play an important role in limiting the number ofdetections. in this context, the discovery of a subluminous type ii-linearevent is even more interesting. we investigate the physical properties andcharacterise the explosion site of the type ii sn 1999ga, which exploded in thenearby spiral galaxy ngc 2442. spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimatethe mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of theprogenitor star in the final stages of its life. the study of the environmentin the vicinity of the explosion site provides information on a possiblerelation between these unusual supernovae and the properties of the galaxieshosting them. despite the lack of early-time observations, we providereasonable evidence that sn 1999ga was probably a type ii-linear supernova thatejected a few solar masses of material, with a very small amount of radioactiveelements of the order of 0.01 solar masses.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0906.2811	a massive star origin for an unusual helium-rich supernova in an  elliptical galaxy	the unusual helium-rich (type ib) supernova sn 2005e is distinguished fromany supernova hitherto observed by its faint and rapidly fading light curve,prominent calcium lines in late-phase spectra and lack of any mark of recentstar formation near the supernova location. these properties are claimed to beexplained by a helium detonation in a thin surface layer of an accreting whitedwarf (perets et al. 2010). here we report on observations of sn 2005czappeared in an elliptical galaxy, whose observed properties resemble those ofsn 2005e in that it is helium-rich and unusually faint, fades rapidly, showsmuch weaker oxygen emission lines than those of calcium in the well-evolvedspectrum. we argue that these properties are best explained by a core-collapsesupernova at the low-mass end ($8-12 m_{\odot}$) of the range of massive starsthat explode (smartt 2009). such a low mass progenitor had lost itshydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, having very thin oxygen-richand silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, thus ejecting a very smallamount of radioactive $^{56}$ni and oxygen. although the host galaxy ngc 4589is an elliptical, some studies have revealed evidence of recent star-formationactivity (zhang et al. 2008), consistent with the core-collapse scenario.

0908.0247	late-time supernova light curves: the effect of internal conversion and  auger electrons	energy release from radioactive decays contributes significantly to supernovalight curves. previous works, which considered the energy deposited bygamma-rays and positrons produced by 56ni, 56co, 57ni, 57co, 44ti and 44sc,have been quite successful in explaining the light curves of both core collapseand thermonuclear supernovae. we point out that auger and internal conversionelectrons together with the associated x-ray cascade, constitute an additionalheat source. when a supernova is transparent to gamma-rays, these electrons cancontribute significantly to light curves for reasonable nucleosynthetic yields.in particular, the electrons emitted in the decay of 57co, which are largelydue to internal conversion from a fortuitously low-lying 3/2- state in thedaughter 57fe, constitute an additional significant energy deposition channel.we show that when the heating by these electrons is accounted for, a slow-downin the lightcurve of sn 1998bw is naturally obtained for typical hypernovanucleosynthetic yields. additionally, we show that for generic type iasupernova yields, the auger electrons emitted in the ground-state toground-state electron capture decay of 55fe exceed the energy released by the44ti decay chain for many years after the explosion.

0908.0537	the normal type ia sn 2003hv out to very late phases	an extensive dataset for sn 2003hv that covers the flux evolution frommaximum light to day +786 is presented. the data are combined with publishednebular-phase infrared spectra, and the observations are compared to modellight curves and synthetic nebular spectra. sn 2003hv is a normal type iasupernova (sn ia) with photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent withits rarely observed b-band decline-rate parameter, delta m_15 = 1.61 +- 0.02.the blueshift of the most isolated [fe ii] lines in the nebular-phase opticalspectrum appears consistent with those observed in the infrared at similarepochs. at late times there is a prevalent color evolution from the opticaltoward the near-infrared bands. we present the latest-ever detection of a sn iain the near-infrared in hubble space telescope images. the study of theultraviolet/optical/infrared (uvoir) light curve reveals that a substantialfraction of the flux is "missing" at late times. between 300-700 days pastmaximum brightness, the uvoir light curve declines linearly following the decayof radioactive co56, assuming full and instantaneous positron trapping. at 700days we detect a possible slowdown of the decline in optical bands, mainly inthe v band. the data are incompatible with a dramatic infrared catastrophe.however, the idea that an infrared catastrophe occurred in the densest regionsbefore 350 days can explain the missing flux from the uvoir wavelengths and theflat-topped profiles in the near-infrared. we argue that such a scenario ispossible if the ejecta are clumpy. the observations suggest that positrons aremost likely trapped in the ejecta.

0911.3774	characteristic velocities of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova  cores	the velocity of the inner ejecta of stripped-envelope core-collapsesupernovae (cc-sne) is studied by means of an analysis of their nebularspectra. stripped-envelope cc-sne are the result of the explosion of bare coresof massive stars ($\geq 8$ m$_{\odot}$), and their late-time spectra aretypically dominated by a strong [o {\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6363 emissionline produced by the innermost, slow-moving ejecta which are not visible atearlier times as they are located below the photosphere. a characteristicvelocity of the inner ejecta is obtained for a sample of 56 stripped-envelopecc-sne of different spectral types (iib, ib, ic) using direct measurements ofthe line width as well as spectral fitting. for most sne, this value shows asmall scatter around 4500 km s$^{-1}$. observations ($&lt; 100$ days) ofstripped-envelope cc-sne have revealed a subclass of very energetic sne, termedbroad-lined sne (bl-sne) or hypernovae, which are characterised by broadabsorption lines in the early-time spectra, indicative of outer ejecta movingat very high velocity ($v \geq 0.1 c$). sne identified as bl in the early phaseshow large variations of core velocities at late phases, with some having muchhigher and some having similar velocities with respect to regular cc-sne. thismight indicate asphericity of the inner ejecta of bl-sne, a possibility weinvestigate using synthetic three-dimensional nebular spectra.

1006.0504	multiple major outbursts from a restless luminous blue variable in ngc  3432	we present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of an unusualluminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 3432, covering three major outbursts inoctober 2008, april 2009 and november 2009. previously, this star experiencedan outburst also in 2000 (known as sn 2000ch). during outbursts the starreached an absolute magnitude between -12.1 and -12.8. its spectrum showed h,he i and fe ii lines with p-cygni profiles during and soon after the eruptivephases, while only intermediate-width lines in pure emission (including he ii4686a were visible during quiescence. the fast-evolving light curve soon afterthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and theoverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes ofvariability of an extremely active lbv. however, the widths of the spectrallines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar tothose observed in wolf-rayet stars. although modulated light curves are typicalof lbvs during the s-dor variability phase, the luminous maxima and the highfrequency of outbursts are unexpected in s-dor variables. such extremevariability may be associated with repeated ejection episodes during a gianteruption of an lbv. alternatively, it may be indicative of a high level ofinstability shortly preceding the core-collapse or due to interaction with amassive, binary companion. in this context, the variable in ngc 3432 sharessome similarities with the famous stellar system hd 5980 in the smallmagellanic cloud, which includes an erupting lbv and an early wolf-rayet star.

1006.5888	an asymmetric explosion as the origin of spectral evolution diversity in  type ia supernovae	type ia supernovae (sne ia) form an observationally uniform class of stellarexplosions, in that more luminous objects have smaller decline-rates. thisone-parameter behavior allows sne ia to be calibrated as cosmological `standardcandles', and led to the discovery of an accelerating universe. recentinvestigations, however, have revealed that the true nature of sne ia is morecomplicated. theoretically, it has been suggested that the initialthermonuclear sparks are ignited at an offset from the centre of thewhite-dwarf (wd) progenitor, possibly as a result of convection before theexplosion. observationally, the diversity seen in the spectral evolution of sneia beyond the luminosity decline-rate relation is an unresolved issue. here wereport that the spectral diversity is a consequence of random directions fromwhich an asymmetric explosion is viewed. our findings suggest that the spectralevolution diversity is no longer a concern in using sne ia as cosmologicalstandard candles. furthermore, this indicates that ignition at an offset fromthe centre of is a generic feature of sne ia.

1007.1881	hydrogen and helium in the late phase of sne iib	supernovae of type iib contain large fractions of helium and traces ofhydrogen, which can be observed in the early and late spectra. estimates of thehydrogen and helium mass and distribution are mainly based on early-timespectroscopy and are uncertain since the respective lines are usually observedin absorption. constraining the mass and distribution of h and he is importantto gain insight into the progenitor systems of these sne.  we implement a nlte treatment of hydrogen and helium in a three-dimensionalnebular code. ionisation, recombination, (non-)thermal electron excitation andh$\alpha$ line scattering are taken into account to compute the formation ofh$\alpha$, which is by far the strongest h line observed in the nebular spectraof sne iib. other lines of h and he are also computed but are rarely identifiedin the nebular phase. nebular models are computed for the type iib sne 1993j,2001ig, 2003bg and 2008ax as well as for sn 2007y, which shows h$\alpha$absorption features at early times and strong h$\alpha$ emission in its latephase, but has been classified as a sn ib. we suggest to classify sn 2007y as asn iib. optical spectra exist for all sne of our sample, and there is one irnebular observation of sn 2008ax, which allows an exploration of its heliummass and distribution.  we develop a three-dimensional model for sn 2008ax. we obtain estimates forthe total mass and kinetic energy in good agreement with the results fromlight-curve modelling found in the literature. we further derive abundances ofhe, c, o, ca and $^{56}$ni. we demonstrate that h$\alpha$ absorption isprobably responsible for the double-peaked profile of the [o {\sc i}]$\lambda\lambda$ 6300, 6363 doublet in several sne iib and present a mechanismalternative to shock interaction for generating late-time h$\alpha$ emission ofsne iib.

1011.5665	high luminosity, slow ejecta and persistent carbon lines: sn 2009dc  challenges thermonuclear explosion scenarios	sn 2009dc shares similarities with normal type ia supernovae, but is clearlyoverluminous, with a (pseudo-bolometric) peak luminosity of log(l) = 43.47[erg/s]. its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light,and the early-time near-ir light curves show secondary maxima, although theminima between the first and second peaks are not very pronounced. bluer bandsexhibit an enhanced fading after ~200 d, which might be caused by dustformation or an unexpectedly early ir catastrophe. the spectra of sn 2009dc aredominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times,and by iron-group elements at late phases. strong c ii lines are present until~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear sne. the ejectavelocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous sne ia.no signatures of csm interaction are found in the spectra. assuming that thelight curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests thatsn 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56ni assuming the smallest possiblerise time of 22 d. together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solarmasses, this confirms that sn 2009dc is a member of the class of possiblesuper-chandrasekhar-mass sne ia similar to sne 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if. astudy of the hosts of sn 2009dc and other superluminous sne ia reveals atendency of these sne to explode in low-mass galaxies. a low metallicity of theprogenitor may therefore be an important pre-requisite for producingsuperluminous sne ia. we discuss a number of explosion scenarios, ranging fromsuper-chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf progenitors over dynamical white-dwarfmergers and type i 1/2 sne to a core-collapse origin of the explosion. none ofthe models seem capable of explaining all properties of sn 2009dc, so that thetrue nature of this sn and its peers remains nebulous.

1101.3935	effects of explosion asymmetry and viewing angle on the type ia  supernova color and luminosity calibration	phenomenological relations exist between the peak luminosity and otherobservables of type ia supernovae (sne~ia), that allow one to standardize theirpeak luminosities. however, several issues are yet to be clarified: sne~ia showcolor variations after the standardization. also, individual sne~ia can showresiduals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\sim0.15$ mag. in this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual arerelated to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\gsim150$ days after maximum light. a sample of 11 sne ia which likely suffer fromlittle host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\sigma$) between the peak$b-v$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. furthermore, a nearlyidentical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three sne with$b-v \gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. following the interpretation that thelate-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from whichan off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is adominant factor controlling the sn color and that a large part of the colorvariations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction. we alsoinvestigate a relation between the peak luminosity residuals and the wavelengthshift in nebular emission lines in a sample of 20 sne. we thereby found a hintof a correlation (at $\sim 1.6 \sigma$ level). the confirmation of this willrequire a future sample of sne with more accurate distance estimates. radiationtransfer simulations for a toy explosion model where different viewing anglescause the late-time emission-line shift are presented, predicting a strongcorrelation between the color and shift, and a weaker one for the luminosityresidual.

1105.3049	nero - a post maximum supernova radiation transport code	the interpretation of supernova (sn) spectra is essential for deriving snejecta properties such as density and composition, which in turn can tell usabout their progenitors and the explosion mechanism. a very large number ofatomic processes are important for spectrum formation. several tools forcalculating sn spectra exist, but they mainly focus on the very early or lateepochs. the intermediate phase, which requires a nlte treatment of radiationtransport has rarely been studied. in this paper we present a new sn radiationtransport code, nero, which can look at those epochs. all the atomic processesare treated in full nlte, under a steady-state assumption. this is a validapproach between roughly 50 and 500 days after the explosion depending on sntype. this covers the post-maximum photospheric and the early and theintermediate nebular phase. as a test, we compare nero to the radiationtransport code of jerkstrand et al. (2011) and to the nebular code of mazzaliet al. (2001). all three codes have been developed independently and acomparison provides a valuable opportunity to investigate their reliability.currently, nero is one-dimensional and can be used for predicting spectra ofsynthetic explosion models or for deriving sn properties by spectral modelling.to demonstrate this, we study the spectra of the 'normal' sn ia 2005cf between50 and 350 days after the explosion and identify most of the common sn ia linefeatures at post maximum epochs.

1111.2497	sn 2009e: a faint clone of sn 1987a	in this paper we investigate the properties of sn 2009e, which exploded in arelatively nearby spiral galaxy (ngc 4141) and that is probably the faintest1987a-like supernova discovered so far. spectroscopic observations whichstarted about 2 months after the supernova explosion, highlight significantdifferences between sn 2009e and the prototypical sn 1987a. modelling the dataof sn 2009e allows us to constrain the explosion parameters and the propertiesof the progenitor star, and compare the inferred estimates with those availablefor the similar sne 1987a and 1998a. the light curve of sn 2009e is lessluminous than that of sn 1987a and the other members of this class, and themaximum light curve peak is reached at a slightly later epoch than in sn 1987a.late-time photometric observations suggest that sn 2009e ejected about 0.04solar masses of 56ni, which is the smallest 56ni mass in our sample of1987a-like events. modelling the observations with a radiation hydrodynamicscode, we infer for sn 2009e a kinetic plus thermal energy of about 0.6 foe, aninitial radius of ~7 x 10^12 cm and an ejected mass of ~19 solar masses. thephotospheric spectra show a number of narrow (v~1800 km/s) metal lines, withunusually strong ba ii lines. the nebular spectrum displays narrow emissionlines of h, na i, [ca ii] and [o i], with the [o i] feature being relativelystrong compared to the [ca ii] doublet. the overall spectroscopic evolution isreminiscent of that of the faint 56ni-poor type ii-plateau supernovae. thissuggests that sn 2009e belongs to the low-luminosity, low 56ni mass, low-energytail in the distribution of the 1987a-like objects in the same manner as sn1997d and similar events represent the faint tail in the distribution ofphysical properties for normal type ii-plateau supernovae.

0710.3763	supernova rates from the southern intermediate redshift eso supernova  search (stress)	to measure the supernova (sn) rates at intermediate redshift we performed thesouthern intermediate redshift eso supernova search (stress). unlike most ofthe current high redshift sn searches, this survey was specifically designed toestimate the rate for both type ia and core collapse (cc) sne. we counted thesne discovered in a selected galaxy sample measuring sn rate per unit blue bandluminosity. our analysis is based on a sample of ~43000 galaxies and on 25spectroscopically confirmed sne plus 64 selected sn candidates. our approach isaimed at obtaining a direct comparison of the high redshift and local rates andat investigating the dependence of the rates on specific galaxy properties,most notably their colour. the type ia sn rate, at mean redshift z=0.3, amountsto 0.22^{+0.10+0.16}_{-0.08 -0.14} h_{70}^2 snu, while the cc sn rate, atz=0.21, is 0.82^{+0.31 +0.30}_{-0.24 -0.26} h_{70}^2 snu. the quoted errors arethe statistical and systematic uncertainties. with respect to local value, thecc sn rate at z=0.2 is higher by a factor of ~2 already at redshift, whereasthe type ia sn rate remains almost constant. this implies that a significantfraction of sn ia progenitors has a lifetime longer than 2-3 gyr. we alsomeasured the sn rates in the red and blue galaxies and found that the sn iarate seems to be constant in galaxies of different colour, whereas the cc snrate seems to peak in blue galaxies, as in the local universe. sn rates perunit volume were found to be consistent with other measurements showing asteeper evolution with redshift for cc sne with respect to sne ia. finally wehave exploited the link between star formation (sf) and sn rates to predict theevolutionary behaviour of the sn rates and compare it with the path indicatedby observations.

1201.5123	normal type ia supernovae from violent mergers of white dwarf binaries	one of the most important questions regarding the progenitor systems of typeia supernovae (sne ia) is whether mergers of two white dwarfs can lead toexplosions that reproduce observations of normal events. here we present afully three-dimensional simulation of a violent merger of two carbon-oxygenwhite dwarfs with masses of $0.9 \mathrm{m_\odot}$ and $1.1 \mathrm{m_\odot}$combining very high resolution and exact initial conditions. a well-testedcombination of codes is used to study the system. we start with the dynamicalinspiral phase and follow the subsequent thermonuclear explosion under theplausible assumption that a detonation forms in the process of merging. we thenperform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and radiative transfersimulations to predict synthetic observables from the homologously expandingsupernova ejecta. we find that synthetic color lightcurves of our merger, whichproduces about $0.62 \mathrm{m_\odot}$ of $^{56}\mathrm{ni}$, show goodagreement with those observed for normal sne ia in all wave bands from u to k.line velocities in synthetic spectra around maximum light also agree well withobservations. we conclude, that violent mergers of massive white dwarfs canclosely resemble normal sne ia. therefore, depending on the number of suchmassive systems available these mergers may contribute at least a smallfraction to the observed population of normal sne ia.

1203.4839	constraining type ia supernova models: sn 2011fe as a test case	the nearby supernova sn 2011fe can be observed in unprecedented detail.therefore, it is an important test case for type ia supernova (sn ia) models,which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of theseobjects. here, we explore how available and expected future observations of sn2011fe can be used to constrain sn ia explosion scenarios. we base ourdiscussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in achandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two whitedwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the mostwidely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to sne ia. althoughboth models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early andnear-maximum spectra of sn 2011fe obtained by the nearby supernova factory(snfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. the levelof agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating theexplosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leadsto differences in the 55co production. sn 2011fe is close enough to be followedsufficiently long to study this effect.

1209.0645	on the brightness distribution of type ia supernovae from violent white  dwarf mergers	we investigate the brightness distribution expected for thermonuclearexplosions that might result from the ignition of a detonation during theviolent merger of white dwarf (wd) binaries. determining their brightnessdistribution is critical for evaluating whether such an explosion model couldbe responsible for a significant fraction of the observed population of sne ia.we argue that the brightness of an explosion realized via the violent mergermodel is determined by the mass of nickel 56 produced in the detonation of theprimary wd. we use a set of sub-chandrasekhar mass wd detonation models toderive a relationship between primary wd mass and expected peak bolometricbrightness. we use this relationship to convert the masses of merging primarywds from binary population models to a predicted distribution of explosionbrightness. we find a striking similarity between the shape of our theoreticalpeak-magnitude distribution and that observed for sne ia: our model produces abrightness distribution that roughly covers the range and matches the shape ofthe one observed for sne ia. however, this agreement hinges on a particularphase of mass accretion during binary evolution: the primary wd gains~0.15-0.35 msun from a slightly-evolved helium star companion. we also findthat with high probability, violent wd mergers involving the most massiveprimaries (which should produce bright sne) have delay times &lt;500 myr(abridged).

1210.1411	moderately luminous type ii supernovae	core-collapse supernovae (cc-sne) descend from progenitors more massive thanabout 8 msun. because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta mayeventually interact with the circumstellar medium (csm) via highly energeticprocesses detectable in the radio, x-ray, ultraviolet (uv) and, sometimes, inthe optical domains. in this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and nearinfrared observations of five type ii sne, namely sne 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,1995ad, and 1996w. together with few other sne they form a group of moderatelyluminous type ii events. we collected photometry and spectroscopy with severaltelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectralevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. both photometry andspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. the lightcurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95&lt;m_{b}&lt;-18.70$). the ejectedmasses of ^56\ni for three sne span a wide range of values($2.8\times10^{-2}$msun$&lt;$m(\ni)$&lt;1.4\times10^{-1}$msun), while for a fourth(sn2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$msun).clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (hv) features ofthe balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of sne 2009dd and1996w. for sn2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type iin to astandard type ii sn. modelling the observations of sne 2009dd, 2010aj and1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermalenergies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm andejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 msun. these values suggest moderate-mass,super-asymptotic giant branch (sagb) or red super-giants (rsg) stars as snprecursors, in analogy with other luminous type iip sne 2007od and 2009bw.

1210.3568	interacting supernovae and supernova impostors. sn 2009ip, is this the  end?	we report the results of a 3 year-long dedicated monitoring campaign of arestless luminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 7259. the object, named sn 2009ip,was observed photometrically and spectroscopically in the optical andnear-infrared domains. we monitored a number of erupting episodes in the pastfew years, and increased the density of our observations during eruptiveepisodes. in this paper we present the full historical data set from 2009-2012with multi-wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events betweenaugust - september 2012. we construct bolometric light curves and measure thetotal luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events. we label them the2012a event (lasting ~50 days) with a peak of 3x10^41 erg/s, and the 2012bevent (14 day rise time, still ongoing) with a peak of 8x10^42 erg/s. thelatter event reached an absolute r-band magnitude of about -18, comparable tothat of a core-collapse supernova (sn). our historical monitoring has detectedhigh-velocity spectral features (~13000 km/s) in september 2011, one yearbefore the current sn-like event. this implies that the detection of such highvelocity outflows cannot, conclusively, point to a core-collapse sn origin. wesuggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to afaint core-collapse sn. we propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of thelatest peak, the variability history of sn 2009ip, and the detection of broadspectral lines indicative of high-velocity ejecta are consistent with apulsational pair-instability event, and that the star may have survived thelast outburst. the question of the survival of the lbv progenitor star and itsfuture fate remain open issues, only to be answered with future monitoring ofthis historically unique explosion.

1302.2913	helium-ignited violent mergers as a unified model for normal and rapidly  declining type ia supernovae	the progenitors of type ia supernovae (sne ia) are still unknown, despitesignificant progress during the last years in theory and observations. violentmergers of two carbon--oxygen (co) white dwarfs (wds) are one candidatesuggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal sneia. here, we simulate the merger of two co wds using a moving-mesh code thatallows for the inclusion of thin helium (he) shells (0.01\,\msun) on top of thewds, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. the accretion of he onto theprimary wd leads to the formation of a detonation in its he shell. thisdetonation propagates around the co wd and sends a converging shock wave intoits core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-knowndouble-detonation scenario for  he-accreting co wds. however, in contrast to that scenario where a massive heshell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the hedetonation is ignited dynamically. accordingly the required he-shell mass issignificantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affectthe optical display of the explosion. we show that this scenario, which worksfor co primary wds with co- as well as he-wd companions, has the potential toexplain the different brightness distributions, delay times and relative ratesof normal and fast declining sne ia. finally, we discuss extensions to ourunified merger model needed to obtain a comprehensive picture of the fullobserved diversity of sne ia.

(2012) he4r270 ejecta model. spectralmodelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusionand we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with theobserved spectral evolution. we estimate that the photosphere reaches thehelium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40days. this suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasingoptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.we also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the sn sitewhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellowsupergiant coincident with sn 2011dh. the b, v and r band decline rates of0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with theremaining flux being emitted by the sn. hence we find that the star was indeedthe progenitor of sn 2011dh as previously suggested by maund et al.

1308.4833	synthetic light curves and spectra for three-dimensional  delayed-detonation models of type ia supernovae	in a companion paper, seitenzahl et al. (2013) presented a set ofthree-dimensional delayed detonation models for thermonuclear explosions ofnear-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (wds). here, we present multi-dimensionalradiative transfer simulations that provide synthetic light curves and spectrafor those models. the model sequence explores both changes in the strength ofthe deflagration phase (controlled by the ignition configuration) and the wdcentral density. in agreement with previous studies, we find that the strengthof the deflagration significantly affects the explosion and the observables.variations in the central density also have an influence on both brightness andcolour, but overall it is a secondary parameter in our set of models. in manyrespects, the models yield a good match to normal type ia supernovae (sne ia):peak brightness, rise/decline time scales and synthetic spectra are all inreasonable agreement. there are, however, several differences. in particular,the models are too red around maximum light, manifest spectral line velocitiesthat are a little too high and yield i-band light curves that do not matchobservations. although some of these discrepancies may simply relate toapproximations made in the modelling, some pose real challenges to the models.if viewed as a complete sequence, our models do not reproduce the observedlight-curve width-luminosity relation (wlr) of sne ia: all our models showsimilar b-band decline rates, irrespective of peak brightness. this suggeststhat simple variations in the strength of the deflagration phase inchandrasekhar-mass deflagration-to-detonation models do not readily explain theobserved diversity of normal sne ia. this may imply that some other parameterwithin the chandrasekhar-mass paradigm is key to the wlr, or that a substantialfraction of normal sne ia arise from an alternative explosion scenario.

1310.1311	the supernova css121015:004244+132827: a clue for understanding  super-luminous supernovae	we present optical photometry and spectra of the super luminous type ii/iinsupernova css121015:004244+132827 (z=0.2868) spanning epochs from -30 days(rest frame) to more than 200 days after maximum. css121015 is one of the moreluminous supernova ever found and one of the best observed. the photometricevolution is characterized by a relatively fast rise to maximum (~40 days inthe sn rest frame), and by a linear post-maximum decline. the light curve showsno sign of a break to an exponential tail. a broad halpha is first detected at~ +40 days (rest-frame). narrow, barely-resolved balmer and [o iii] 5007 alines, with decreasing strength, are visible along the entire spectralevolution. the spectra are very similar to other super luminous supernovae(slsne) with hydrogen in their spectrum, and also to sn 2005gj, sometimesconsidered a type ia interacting with h-rich csm. the spectra are also similarto a subsample of h-deficient slsne. we propose that the properties ofcss121015 are consistent with the interaction of the ejecta with a massive,extended, opaque shell, lost by the progenitor decades before the finalexplosion, although a magnetar powered model cannot be excluded. based on thesimilarity of css121015 with other slsne (with and without h), we suggest thatthe shocked-shell scenario should be seriously considered as a plausible modelfor both types of slsn.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1401.5426	underluminous type ii plateau supernovae: ii. pointing towards moderate  mass precursors	we present new data for five under-luminous type ii-plateau supernovae (sneiip), namely sn 1999gn, sn 2002gd, sn 2003z, sn 2004eg and sn 2006ov. this newsample of low-luminosity sne iip (ll sne iip) is analyzed together with similarobjects studied in the past. all of them show a flat light curve plateaulasting about 100 days, an under luminous late-time exponential tail, intrinsiccolours that are unusually red, and spectra showing prominent and narrowp-cygni lines. a velocity of the ejected material below 10^3 km/s is inferredfrom measurements at the end of the plateau. the 56ni masses ejected in theexplosion are very small (less than 10^-2 solar masses). we investigate thecorrelations among 56ni mass, expansion velocity of the ejecta and absolutemagnitude in the middle of the plateau, confirming the main findings of hamuy(2003), according to which events showing brighter plateau and larger expansionvelocities are expected to produce more 56ni. we propose that these faintobjects represent the low luminosity tail of a continuous distribution inparameters space of sne iip. the physical properties of the progenitors at theexplosion are estimated through the hydrodynamical modeling of the observablesfor two representative events of this class, namely sn 2005cs and sn 2008in. wefind that the majority of ll sne iip, and quite possibly all, originate in thecore-collapse of intermediate mass stars, in the mass range 10-15 solar masses.

1404.1002	early ultraviolet emission in the type ia supernova lsq12gdj: no  evidence for ongoing shock interaction	we present photospheric-phase observations of lsq12gdj, a slowly-declining,uv-bright type ia supernova. classified well before maximum light, lsq12gdj hasextinction-corrected absolute magnitude $m_b = -19.8$, and pre-maximumspectroscopic evolution similar to sn 1991t and the super-chandrasekhar-mass sn2007if. we use ultraviolet photometry from swift, ground-based opticalphotometry, and corrections from a near-infrared photometric template toconstruct the bolometric (1600-23800 \aa) light curve out to 45 days past$b$-band maximum light. we estimate that lsq12gdj produced $0.96 \pm 0.07$$m_\odot$ of $^{56}$ni, with an ejected mass near or slightly above thechandrasekhar mass. as much as 27% of the flux at the earliest observed phases,and 17% at maximum light, is emitted bluewards of 3300 \aa. the absence ofexcess luminosity at late times, the cutoff of the spectral energy distributionbluewards of 3000 \aa, and the absence of narrow line emission and strong na id absorption all argue against a significant contribution from ongoing shockinteraction. however, up to 10% of lsq12gdj's luminosity near maximum lightcould be produced by the release of trapped radiation, including kinetic energythermalized during a brief interaction with a compact, hydrogen-poor envelope(radius $&lt; 10^{13}$ cm) shortly after explosion; such an envelope arisesgenerically in double-degenerate merger scenarios.

1406.2120	interacting supernovae and supernova impostors. sn 2007sv: the major  eruption of a massive star in ugc 5979	we report the results of the photometric and spectroscopic monitoringcampaign of the transient sn 2007sv. the observables are similar to those oftype iin supernovae, a well-known class of objects whose ejecta interact withpre-existing circum-stellar material. the spectra show a blue continuum atearly phases and prominent balmer lines in emission, however, the absolutemagnitude at the discovery of sn 2007sv (m_r = - 14.25 +/- 0.38) indicate it tobe most likely a supernova impostor. this classification is also supported bythe lack of evidence in the spectra of very high velocity material as expectedin supernova ejecta. in addition we find no unequivocal evidence of broad linesof alpha - and/or fe-peak elements. the comparison with the absolute lightcurves of other interacting objects (including type iin supernovae) highlightsthe overall similarity with the prototypical impostor sn 1997bs. this supportsour claim that sn 2007sv was not a genuine supernova, and was instead asupernova impostor, most likely similar to the major eruption of a luminousblue variable.

1407.0136	properties of extragalactic dust inferred from linear polarimetry of  type ia supernovae	aims: the aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to investigate the properties ofextragalactic dust and compare them to what is seen in the galaxy; 2) toaddress in an independent way the problem of the anomalous extinction curvesreported for reddened type ia supernovae (sn) in connection to the environmentsin which they explode. methods: the properties of the dust are derived from thewavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddenedtype ia sn: 1986g, 2006x, 2008fp, and 2014j. [...] results: all four objectsare characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios(r_v) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized byvery blue polarization peaks. in all cases the polarization position angle iswell aligned with the local spiral structure. while sn~1986g is compatible withthe most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the galaxy,sn2006x, 2008fp, and 2014j show unprecedented behaviours. the observeddeviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to therelatively large amounts of reddening characterizing the objects in the sample.conclusions: the dust responsible for the polarization of these four sn is mostlikely of interstellar nature. the polarization properties can be interpretedin terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. the anomalousbehaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galacticenvironment in which the sn explode, rather than with the progenitor systemfrom which they originate. for the extreme case of sn2014j, we cannot excludethe contribution of light scattered by local material; however, the observedpolarization properties require an ad hoc geometrical dust distribution.

1408.0731	the type iib sn 2011dh - two years of observations and modelling of the  lightcurves	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy aswell as modelling of the lightcurves of the type iib supernova (sn) 2011dh. ourextensive dataset spans two years, and complemented with spitzer mid-infrared(mir) data, we use it to build an optical-to-mir bolometric lightcurve betweendays 3 and 732. to model the bolometric lightcurve before day 400 we use a gridof hydrodynamical sn models and a bolometric correction determined withsteady-state nlte modelling. using this method we find a helium core mass of3.1 (+0.7-0.4) solar masses for sn 2011dh, consistent within error bars withprevious results. we present bolometric and broad-band lightcurves between days100 and 500 for the jerkstrand et al. (2014) steady-state nlte models, and thepreferred 12 solar masses (initial mass) model shows a good overall agreementwith the observed lightcurves. we find an excess in the k and the mir bandsdeveloping between days 100 and 250, during which an increase in the opticaldecline rate is also observed. a local origin of the excess is suggested by thedepth of the hei 2.058 micron absorption. steady-state nlte models with amodest dust opacity in the core, turned on during this period, reproduce theobserved behaviour, but an additional excess in the spitzer 4.5 micron bandremains. co first-overtone band emission is detected at day 206, and possiblyat day 89, and assuming the additional excess to be dominated by co fundamentalband emission, we find fundamental to first-overtone band ratios considerablyhigher than observed in sn 1987a. this paper concludes our extensiveobservational and modelling work on sn 2011dh. the results from hydrodynamicalmodelling, steady-state nlte modelling, and stellar evolutionary progenitoranalysis are all consistent, and suggest an initial mass of 12 solar masses forthe progenitor.

1408.0732	late-time spectral line formation in type iib supernovae, with  application to sn 1993j, sn 2008ax, and sn 2011dh	we investigate line formation processes in type iib supernovae (sne) from 100to 500 days post-explosion using spectral synthesis calculations. the modelingidentifies the nuclear burning layers and physical mechanisms that produce themajor emission lines, and the diagnostic potential of these. we compare themodel calculations with data on the three best observed type iib sne to-date -sn 1993j, sn 2008ax, and sn 2011dh. oxygen nucleosynthesis depends sensitivelyon the main-sequence mass of the star and modeling of the [o i] 6300, 6364lines constrains the progenitors of these three sne to the m_zams=12-16 m_sunrange (ejected oxygen masses 0.3-0.9 m_sun), with sn 2011dh towards the lowerend and sn 1993j towards the upper end of the range. the high ejecta massesfrom m_zams &gt;= 17 m_sun progenitors give rise to brighter nebular phaseemission lines than observed. nucleosynthesis analysis thus supports a scenarioof low/moderate mass progenitors for type iib sne, and by implication an originin binary systems. we demonstrate how oxygen and magnesium recombination linesmay be combined to diagnose the magnesium mass in the sn ejecta. for sn 2011dh,a magnesium mass of of 0.02-0.14 m_sun is derived, which gives a mg/oproduction ratio consistent with the solar value. nitrogen left in the heenvelope from cno-burning gives strong [n ii] 6548, 6583 emission lines thatdominate over h-alpha emission in our models. the hydrogen envelopes of typeiib sne are too small and dilute to produce any noticeable h-alpha emission orabsorption after ~150 days, and nebular phase emission seen around 6550 a is inmany cases likely caused by [n ii] 6548, 6583. finally, the influence ofradiative transport on the emergent line profiles is investigated...(abridged)

1409.2784	sn 2013df, a double-peaked iib supernova from a compact progenitor and  an extended h envelope	optical observations of the type iib sn 2013df from a few days to about 250days after explosion are presented. these observations are complemented with uvphotometry taken by \textit{swift} up to 60 days post-explosion. thedouble-peak optical light curve is similar to those of sne 1993j and 2011fualthough with different decline and rise rates. from the modelling of thebolometric light curve, we have estimated that the total mass of synthesised$^{56}$ni in the explosion is $\sim0.1$ m$_{\odot}$, while the ejecta mass is$0.8-1.4$ m$_{\odot}$ and the explosion energy $0.4-1.2 \times 10^{51}$erg. inaddition, we have estimated a lower limit to the progenitor radius ranging from$64-169$ $r_{\odot}$. the spectral evolution indicates that sn 2013df had ahydrogen envelope similar to sn 1993j ($\sim 0.2$ m$_{\odot}$). the lineprofiles in nebular spectra suggest that the explosion was asymmetric with thepresence of clumps in the ejecta, while the [o\,{\sc i}]$\lambda$$\lambda$$6300$, $6364$ luminosities, may indicate that the progenitorof sn 2013df was a relatively low mass star ( $\sim 12-13 $ m$_{\odot}$).

1411.4424	a metric space for type ia supernova spectra	we develop a new framework for use in exploring type ia supernova (sn ia)spectra. combining principal component analysis (pca) and partial least squareanalysis (pls) we are able to establish correlations between the principalcomponents (pcs) and spectroscopic/photometric sne ia features. the techniquewas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the nearby supernovafactory. the ability of pca to group together sne ia with similar spectralfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by twoimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivativesof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines anddiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through theuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input datamatrix. these allow us to define a stable pc parameter space which can be usedto characterize synthetic sn ia spectra by means of real sn features. usingpls, we demonstrate that the information from important previously knownspectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pew) of si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 and the line velocity of s ii 5640 / si ii 6355) at a given epoch,is contained within the pc space and can be determined through a linearcombination of the most important pcs. we also show that the pc spaceencompasses photometric features like b or v magnitudes, b-v color and salt2parameters c and x1. the observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavilyaffected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. allthe above mentioned applications allowed us to construct a metric space forcomparing synthetic sn ia spectra with observations.

1411.7599	spectroscopy of the type ia supernova 2011fe past 1000 days	in this letter we present an optical spectrum of sn 2011fe taken 1034 d afterthe explosion, several hundred days later than any other spectrum of a type iasupernova (disregarding light-echo spectra and local-group remnants). thespectrum is still dominated by broad emission features, with no trace of alight echo or interaction of the supernova ejecta with surrounding interstellarmaterial. comparing this extremely late spectrum to an earlier one taken 331 dafter the explosion, we find that the most prominent feature at 331 d - [feiii] emission around 4700 a - has entirely faded away, suggesting a significantchange in the ionisation state. instead, [fe ii] lines are probably responsiblefor most of the emission at 1034 d. an emission feature at 6300-6400 a hasnewly developed at 1034 d, which we tentatively identify with fe i{\lambda}6359, [fe i] {\lambda}{\lambda}6231, 6394 or [o i]{\lambda}{\lambda}6300, 6364. interestingly, the features in the 1034-dspectrum seem to be collectively redshifted, a phenomenon that we currentlyhave no convincing explanation for. we discuss the implications of our findingsfor explosion models, but conclude that sophisticated spectral modelling isrequired for any firm statement.

1509.09062	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium - vii. the  metamorphosis of asassn-15ed from a narrow line type ibn to a normal type ib  supernova	we present the results of the spectroscopic and photometric monitoringcampaign of asassn-15ed. the transient was discovered quite young by the allsky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn). amateur astronomers allowed usto sample the photometric sn evolution around maximum light, which we estimateto have occurred on jd = 2457087.4 +- 0.6 in the r-band. its apparent r-bandmagnitude at maximum was r = 16.91 +- 0.10, providing an absolute magnitudem(r) ~ -20.04 +- 0.20, which is slightly more luminous than the typicalmagnitudes estimated for type ibn sne. the post-peak evolution was wellmonitored, and the decline rate (being in most bands around 0.1 mag/d duringthe first 25 d after maximum) is marginally slower than the average declinerates of sne ibn during the same time interval. the object was initiallyclassified as a type ibn sn because early-time spectra were characterized by ablue continuum with superimposed narrow p-cygni lines of he i, suggesting thepresence of a slowly moving (1200-1500 km/s), he-rich circumstellar medium.later on, broad p-cygni he i lines became prominent. the inferred velocities,as measured from the minimum of the broad absorption components, were between6000 and 7000 km/s. as we attribute these broad features to the sn ejecta, thisis the first time we have observed the transition of a type ibn sn to a type ibsn.

1509.09065	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium - viii. psn  j07285387+3349106, a highly reddened supernova ibn	we present spectroscopic and photometric observations for the type ibnsupernova (sn) dubbed psn j07285387+3349106. using data provided by amateurastronomers, we monitored the photometric rise of the sn to maximum light,occurred on 2015 february 18.8 ut (jd(max,v) = 2457072.0 +- 0.8). psnj07285387+3349106 exploded in the inner region of an infrared luminous galaxy,and is the most reddened sn ibn discovered so far. we apply multiple methods toderive the total reddening to the sn, and determine a total colour excesse(b-v)(tot) = 0.99 +- 0.48 mag. accounting for the reddening correction, whichis affected by a large uncertainty, we estimate a peak absolute magnitude ofm(v) = -20.30 +- 1.50. the spectra are dominated by continuum emission at earlyphases, and he i lines with narrow p-cygni profiles are detected. we alsoidentify weak fe iii and n ii features. all these lines show an absorptioncomponent which is blue-shifted by about 900-1000 km/s. the spectra also showrelatively broad he i line wings with low contrast, which extend to above 3000km/s. from about 2 weeks past maximum, broad lines of o i, mg ii and the ca iinear-infrared triplet are identified. the composition and the expansionvelocity of the circumstellar material, and the presence of he i andalpha-elements in the sn ejecta indicate that psn j07285387+3349106 wasproduced by the core-collapse of a stripped-envelope star. we suggest that theprecursor was wne-type wolf-rayet star in its dense, he-rich circumstellarcocoon.

1510.04128	type ia supernovae from violent mergers of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs:  polarisation signatures	the violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs has been proposed as aviable progenitor for some type ia supernovae. however, it has been argued thatthe strong ejecta asymmetries produced by this model might be inconsistent withthe low degree of polarisation typically observed in type ia supernovaexplosions. here, we test this claim by carrying out a spectropolarimetricanalysis for the model proposed by pakmor et al. (2012) for an explosiontriggered during the merger of a 1.1 m$_{\odot}$ and 0.9 m$_{\odot}$carbon-oxygen white dwarf binary system. owing to the asymmetries of theejecta, the polarisation signal varies significantly with viewing angle. wefind that polarisation levels for observers in the equatorial plane are modest($\lesssim$ 1 per cent) and show clear evidence for a dominant axis, as aconsequence of the ejecta symmetry about the orbital plane. in contrast,orientations out of the plane are associated with higher degrees ofpolarisation and departures from a dominant axis. while the particular modelstudied here gives a good match to highly-polarised events such as sn 2004dt,it has difficulties in reproducing the low polarisation levels commonlyobserved in normal type ia supernovae. specifically, we find that significantasymmetries in the element distribution result in a wealth of strongpolarisation features that are not observed in the majority of currentlyavailable spectropolarimetric data of type ia supernovae. future studies willmap out the parameter space of the merger scenario to investigate ifalternative models can provide better agreement with observations.

1511.04325	quantitative spectral analysis of the sdb star hd 188112: a helium-core  white dwarf progenitor	hd 188112 is a bright (v = 10.2 mag) hot subdwarf b (sdb) star with a masstoo low to ignite core helium burning and is therefore considered as apre-extremely low mass (elm) white dwarf (wd). elm wds (m $\le$ 0.3 msun) arehe-core objects produced by the evolution of compact binary systems. we presentin this paper a detailed abundance analysis of hd 188112 based onhigh-resolution hubble space telescope (hst) near and far-ultravioletspectroscopy. we also constrain the mass of the star's companion. we use hybridnon-lte model atmospheres to fit the observed spectral lines and derive theabundances of more than a dozen elements as well as the rotational broadeningof metallic lines. we confirm the previous binary system parameters bycombining radial velocities measured in our uv spectra with the alreadypublished ones. the system has a period of 0.60658584 days and a wd companionwith m $\geq$ 0.70 msun. by assuming a tidally locked rotation, combined withthe projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 7.9 $\pm$ 0.3 km s$^{-1}$) weconstrain the companion mass to be between 0.9 and 1.3 msun. we further discussthe future evolution of the system as a potential progenitor of a(underluminous) type ia supernova. we measure abundances for mg, al, si, p, s,ca, ti, cr, mn, fe, ni, and zn, as well as for the trans-iron elements ga, sn,and pb. in addition, we derive upper limits for the c, n, o elements and findhd 188112 to be strongly depleted in carbon. we find evidence of non-lteeffects on the line strength of some ionic species such as si ii and ni ii. themetallic abundances indicate that the star is metal-poor, with an abundancepattern most likely produced by diffusion effects.

astro-ph;0605700	sn 2005cs in m51 i. the first month of evolution of a subluminous sn ii  plateau	early time optical observations of supernova (sn) 2005cs in the whirlpoolgalaxy (m51), are reported. photometric data suggest that sn 2005cs is amoderately under-luminous type ii plateau supernova (sn iip). the sn wasunusually blue at early epochs (u-b ~ -0.9 about three days after explosion)which indicates very high continuum temperatures. the spectra show relativelynarrow p-cygni features, suggesting ejecta velocities lower than observed inmore typical sne iip. the earliest spectra show weak absorption features in theblue wing of the he i 5876a absorption component and, less clearly, of h$\beta$and h$\alpha$. based on spectral modelling, two different interpretations canbe proposed: these features may either be due to high-velocity h and he icomponents, or (more likely) be produced by different ions (n ii, si ii).analogies with the low-luminosity, $^{56}$ni-poor, low-velocity sne iip arealso discussed.  while a more extended spectral coverage is necessary in order to determineaccurately the properties of the progenitor star, published estimates of theprogenitor mass seem not to be consistent with stellar evolution models.

astro-ph;0607078	sn 2004aw: confirming diversity of type ic supernovae	optical and near-infrared observations of the type ic supernova (sn) 2004aware presented, obtained from day -3 to day +413 with respect to the b-bandmaximum. the photometric evolution is characterised by a comparatively slowpost-maximum decline of the light curves. the peaks in redder bands aresignificantly delayed relative to the bluer bands, the i-band maximum occurring8.4 days later than that in b. with an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in thev band the sn can be considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. this alsoholds for the u through i bolometric light curve, where sn 2004aw has aposition intermediate between sne 2002ap and 1998bw. spectroscopically sn2004aw provides a link between a normal type ic supernova like sn 1994i and thegroup of broad-lined sne ic. the spectral evolution is rather slow, with aspectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. the shape of thenebular [o i] 6300,6364 line indicates a highly aspherical explosion. heliumcannot be unambiguously identified in the spectra, even in the near-infrared.using an analytical description of the light curve peak we find that the totalmass of the ejecta in sn 2004aw is 3.5-8.0 m_sun, significantly larger than insn 1994i, although not as large as in sn 1998bw. the same model suggests thatabout 0.3 m_sun of {56}ni has been synthesised in the explosion. no connectionto a grb can be firmly established.

astro-ph;0702565	esc and kait observations of the transitional type ia sn 2004eo	we present optical and infrared observations of the unusual type ia supernova(sn) 2004eo. the light curves and spectra closely resemble those of theprototypical sn 1992a, and the luminosity at maximum (m_b = -19.08) is close tothe average for a sn ia. however, the ejected 56ni mass derived by modellingthe bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limitof the 56ni mass distribution observed in normal sne ia. accordingly, sn 2004eoshows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (delta m_(b) =1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 similar to that of sn 1992a. the physical properties of sn 2004eocause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocitygradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by benetti et al.(2005). similar behaviour is seen in a few other sne ia. thus, there may infact exist a few sne ia with intermediate physical properties.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.
