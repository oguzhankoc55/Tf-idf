0909.3025	does stellar feedback create hi holes? an hst/vla study of holmberg ii	we use deep hst/acs f555w and f814w photometry of resolved stars in the m81group dwarf irregular galaxy ho ii to study the hypothesis that the holesidentified in the neutral ism (hi) are created by stellar feedback. from thedeep photometry, we construct color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) and measure thestar formation histories (sfhs) for stars contained in hi holes from twoindependent holes catalogs, as well as select control fields, i.e., similarsized regions that span a range of hi column densities. converting the recentsfhs into stellar feedback energies, we find that enough energy has beengenerated to have created all holes. however, the required energy is not alwaysproduced over a time scale that is less than the estimated kinematic age of thehole. the combination of the cmds, recent sfhs, and locations of young starsshows that the stellar populations inside hi holes are not coherent,single-aged, stellar clusters, as previously suggested, but rather multi-agepopulations distributed across each hole. from a comparison of the modeled andobserved integrated magnitudes, and the locations and energetics of starsinside of hi holes, we propose a potential new model: a viable mechanism forcreating the observed hi holes in ho ii is stellar feedback from multiplegenerations of sf spread out over tens or hundreds of myr, and thus, theconcept of an age for an hi hole is intrinsically ambiguous. we further findthat \halpha and 24 micron emission, tracers of the most recent star formation,do not correlate well with the positions of the hi holes. however, uv emission,which traces star formation over roughly the last 100 myr, shows a much bettercorrelation with the locations of the hi holes.

1009.4618	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ix. constraining asymptotic giant  branch evolution with old metal-poor galaxies	in an attempt to constrain evolutionary models of the asymptotic giant branch(agb) phase at the limit of low masses and low metallicities, we have examinedthe luminosity functions and number ratio between agb and red giant branch(rgb) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the acs nearby galaxysurvey treasury (angst). this database provides hst optical photometry togetherwith maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories fordozens of galaxies within 4 mpc. we select 12 galaxies characterized bypredominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue rgb,and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in theircolor--magnitude diagrams. thousands of agb stars brighter than the tip of thergb (trgb) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per galaxy), hence thepoisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the agb/rgb ratio. wemodel the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing agb (tp-agb)evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. thistechnique allows us to set stringent constraints to the tp-agb models oflow-mass metal-poor stars (with m&lt;1.5 msun, [fe/h]&lt;~-1.0). indeed, those whichsatisfactorily reproduce the observed agb/rgb ratios have tp-agb lifetimesbetween 1.2 and 1.8 myr, and finish their nuclear burning lives with massesbetween 0.51 and 0.55 msun. this is also in good agreement with recentobservations of white dwarf masses in the m4 old globular cluster. theseconstraints can be added to those already derived from magellanic cloud starclusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating agbevolutionary models.

1101.1093	the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury viii. the global star formation  histories of 60 dwarf galaxies in the local volume	we present uniformly measured star formation histories (sfhs) of 60 nearby(d~4mpc) dwarf galaxies based on cmds of resolved stellar populations fromimages taken with hst as part of the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury program(angst). this volume-limited sample contains 12 dsph/de, 5 dwarf spiral, 28 di,12 transition, and 3 tidal dwarf galaxies. from the best fit sfhs we find threesignificant results: (1) the average dwarf galaxy formed &gt;50% of its stars byz~2 and 60% of its stars by z~1, regardless of current morphological type; (2)the mean sfhs of dis, dtrans, and dsphs are similar over most of cosmic time,with the clearest differences appearing during the most recent 1 gyr; and (3)the mean values are inconsistent with simple sfh models, e.g., exponentiallydeclining sfrs. the mean sfhs are in general agreement with the cosmic sfh,although we observe offsets near z~1 that could be evidence that low masssystems experienced delayed star formation relative to more massive galaxies.the sample shows a strong density-morphology relationship, such that the dsphsare less isolated than dis. we find that the transition from a gas-rich togas-poor galaxy cannot be solely due to internal mechanisms such as stellarfeedback, and instead is likely the result of external mechanisms, e.g., rampressure and tidal forces. the average transition dwarf is slightly lessisolated and less gas-rich than the typical di. further, the transition dwarfscan be divided into two groups: interacting and gas-poor or isolated andgas-rich, suggesting two possible evolutionary pathways.

1104.0464	the m81 group dwarf irregular galaxy ddo 165. i. high velocity neutral  gas in a post-starburst system	we present new multi-configuration vla hi spectral line observations of them81 group dirr post-starburst galaxy ddo 165. the hi morphology is complex,with multiple column density peaks surrounding a large region of very low hisurface density that is offset from the center of the stellar distribution. thebulk of the neutral gas is associated with the southern section of the galaxy;a secondary peak in the north contains ~15% of the total hi mass. thesecomponents appear to be kinematically distinct, suggesting that either tidalprocesses or large-scale blowout have recently shaped the ism of ddo 165. usingspatially-resolved position-velocity maps, we find multiple localizedhigh-velocity gas features. cross-correlating with radius-velocity analyses, weidentify eight shell/hole structures in the ism with a range of sizes (~400-900pc) and expansion velocities (~7-11 km/s). these structures are compared withnarrow- and broad-band imaging from kpno and hst. using the latter data, recentworks have shown that ddo 165's previous "burst" phase was extended temporally(&gt;1 gyr). we thus interpret the high-velocity gas features, hi holes, andkinematically distinct components of the galaxy in the context of the immediateeffects of "feedback" from recent star formation. in addition to creating hiholes and shells, extended star formation events are capable of creatinglocalized high velocity motion of the surrounding interstellar material. acompanion paper connects the energetics from the hi and hst data.

1104.0981	a deep chandra view of the ngc 404 central engine	we present the results of a 100 ks {\it chandra} observation of the ngc 404nuclear region. the long exposure and excellent spatial resolution of {\itchandra} has enabled us to critically examine the nuclear environment of ngc404, which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially anintermediate-mass black hole (on the order of a few times $10^5$ \msun). wefind two distinct x-ray sources: a hard, central point source coincident withthe optical and radio centers of the galaxy, and a soft extended region that iscoincident with areas of high h$\alpha$ emission and likely recent starformation. when we fit the 0.3-8 kev spectra of each region separately, we findthe hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law (\pl = 1.88),while the soft off-nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ($kt$ =0.67 kev). we therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hotgas in the nuclear region of ngc 404. we estimate the 2-10 kev luminosity to be1.3$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. a low-level of diffuse x-rayemission is detected out to $\sim$15\as ($\sim$0.2 kpc) from the nucleus. wecompare our results to the observed relationships between power law photonindex and eddington ratio for both x-ray binaries and low luminosity activegalaxies and find ngc 404 to be consistent with other low luminosity activegalaxies. we therefore favor the conclusion that ngc 404 harbors anintermediate-mass black hole accreting at a very low level.

1105.2571	the history of star formation in galaxy disks in the local volume as  measured by the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury	we present a measurement of the age distribution of stars residing in spiraldisks and dwarf galaxies. we derive a complete star formation history of the~140 mpc^3 covered by the volume-limited sample of galaxies in the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst). the total starformation rate density history is dominated by the large spirals in the volume,although the sample consists mainly of dwarf galaxies. our measurement shows afactor of ~3 drop at z~2, in approximate agreement with results from othermeasurement techniques. while our results show that the overall star formationrate density has decreased since z~1, the measured rates during this epoch arehigher than those obtained from other measurement techniques. this enhancedrecent star formation rate appears to be largely due to an increase in thefraction of star formation contained in low-mass disks at recent times.finally, our results indicate that despite the differences at recent times, theepoch of formation of ~50% of the stellar mass in dwarf galaxies was similar tothat of ~50% of the stellar mass in large spiral galaxies (z&gt;~2), despite theobserved galaxy-to-galaxy diversity among the dwarfs.

1105.4117	the formation of kiloparsec-scale hi holes in dwarf galaxies	the origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (h i) distributions ofsome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. starformation histories (sfhs) derived from resolved stars give us the uniqueopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape thecurrently visible h i distribution. our sample of five nearby dwarf irregulargalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total h i mass and absoluteb-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. weuse very large array h i line data to estimate the energy required to createthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. we compare this energy estimate tothe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed fromsfhs derived from data taken with the hubble space telescope. the inferredintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds ourenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expectedefficiencies. therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficientenergy to produce the observed holes. however, we find no obvious signature ofsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures whencomparing the global sfhs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or tothose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. we also fail tofind evidence of a central star cluster in fuv or halpha imaging. we concludethat large h i holes are likely formed from multiple generations of starformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

1108.1405	observational constraints on red and blue helium burning sequences	we derive the optical luminosity, colors, and ratios of the blue and redhelium burning (heb) stellar populations from archival hubble space telescopeobservations of nineteen starburst dwarf galaxies and compare them withtheoretical isochrones from padova stellar evolution models acrossmetallicities from z=0.001 to 0.009. we find that the observational data andthe theoretical isochrones for both blue and red heb populations overlap inoptical luminosities and colors and the observed and predicted blue to red hebratios agree for stars older than 50 myr over the time bins studied. thesefindings confirm the usefulness of applying isochrones to interpretobservations of heb populations. however, there are significant differences,especially for the red heb population. specifically we find: (1) offsets incolor between the observations and theoretical isochrones of order 0.15 mag(0.5 mag) for the blue (red) heb populations brighter than m_v ~ -4 mag, whichcannot be solely due to differential extinction; (2) blue heb stars fainterthan m_v ~ -3 mag are bluer than predicted; (3) the slope of the red hebsequence is shallower than predicted by a factor of ~3; and (4) the modelsoverpredict the ratio of the most luminous blue to red heb stars correspondingto ages &lt;50 myr. additionally, we find that for the more metal-rich galaxies inour sample (z&gt; 0.5 zsolar) the red heb stars overlap with the red giant branchstars in the color magnitude diagrams, thus reducing their usefulness asindicators of star formation for ages &gt;100 myr.

1109.2905	modeling the effects of star formation histories on halpha and  ultra-violet fluxes in nearby dwarf galaxies	we consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (sfhs) onhalpha and galex far ultra-violet (fuv) star formation rate (sfr) indicators.under the assumption of a fully populated chabrier imf, we compare thedistribution of halpha-to-fuv flux ratios from ~ 1500 simple, periodic modelsfhs with observations of 185 galaxies from the spitzer local volume legacysurvey. we find a set of sfh models that are well matched to the data, suchthat more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant sfhs,while low mass systems experience bursts amplitudes of ~ 30 (i.e., an increasein the sfr by a factor of 30 over the sfr during the inter-burst period), burstdurations of tens of myr, and periods of ~ 250 myr; these sfhs are broadlyconsistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systemswith lower sfrs. we analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellarmass, r-band surface brightness, halpha-derived sfr, and blue luminosity, andfind that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. wefind that our model sfhs are generally able to reproduce both the observedsystematic decline and increased scatter in halpha-to-fuv ratios toward lowmass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. we also compare ourpredictions with those from the integrated galactic imf theory with a constantsfr. we find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observedratios, only the time variable sfh models are capable of producing the observedpopulation of low mass galaxies ($m_{*}$ &lt; 10$^{7}$ msun) with normalhalpha-to-fuv ratios. these results demonstrate that a variable imf alone hasdifficulty explaining the observed scatter in the halpha-to-fuv ratios. weconclude by considering the limitations of the model sfhs, and discuss the useof additional empirical constraints to improve future sfh modeling efforts.

1201.4859	the star formation history of leo t from hubble space telescope imaging	we present the star formation history (sfh) of the faintest knownstar-forming galaxy, leo t, based on imaging taken with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) wide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2). the hst/wfpc2color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of leo t is exquisitely deep, extending ~ 2magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, permitting excellentconstraints on star formation at all ages. we use a maximum likelihood cmdfitting technique to measure the sfh of leo t assuming three different sets ofstellar evolution models: padova (solar-scaled metallicity) and basti (bothsolar-scaled and alpha-enhanced metallicities). the resulting sfhs areremarkably consistent at all ages, indicating that our derived sfh is robust tothe choice of stellar evolution model. from the lifetime sfh of leo t, we findthat 50% of the total stellar mass formed prior to z ~ 1 (7.6 gyr ago).subsequent to this epoch, the sfh of leo t is roughly constant until the mostrecent ~ 25 myr, where the sfh shows an abrupt drop. this decrease could be dueto a cessation of star formation or stellar initial mass function samplingeffects, but we are unable to distinguish between the two scenarios. overall,our measured sfh is consistent with previously derived sfhs of leo t. however,the hst-based solution provides improved age resolution and reduceduncertainties at all epochs. the sfh, baryonic gas fraction, and location ofleo t are unlike any of the other recently discovered faint dwarf galaxies inthe local group, and instead bear strong resemblance to gas-rich dwarf galaxies(irregular or transition), suggesting that gas-rich dwarf galaxies may sharecommon modes of star formation over a large range of stellar mass (~ 10^5-10^9msun).

1205.2732	observational constraints on the molecular gas content in nearby  starburst dwarf galaxies	using star formation histories derived from optically resolved stellarpopulations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with thehubble space telescope, we measure the stellar mass surface densities of starsnewly formed in the bursts. by assuming a star formation efficiency (sfe), wethen calculate the inferred gas surface densities present at the onset of thestarbursts. assuming a sfe of 1%, as is often assumed in normal star-forminggalaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very highhi surface densities (~10^2-10^3 msun pc^-2), which are much higher than havebeen observed in dwarf galaxies. this implies either higher values of sfe inthese dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of h_2 indwarfs (or both). raising the assumed sfes to 10% or greater (in line withobservations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies),still results in hi surface densities higher than observed in 10 galaxies.thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of thegas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form at the onsetof the bursts. our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range10^19-10^21 cm^-2 for the sample. in those galaxies where co observations havebeen made, these densities correspond to values of the co-h_2 conversion factor(x_co) in the range &gt;3-80x10^20 cm^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1, or up to 40x greater thangalactic x_co values.

1206.4045	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury i: bright uv stars in the  bulge of m31	as part of the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) multi-cycleprogram, we observed a 12' \times 6.5' area of the bulge of m31 with thewfc3/uvis filters f275w and f336w. from these data we have assembled a sampleof \sim4000 uv-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. weuse updated padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars intothree classes: post-agb stars (p-agb), post-early agb (pe-agb) stars andagb-manqu\'e stars. p-agb stars are the end result of the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations,whereas pe-agb and agb-manqu\'e (together referred to as the hotpost-horizontal branch; hp-hb) stars are the result of insufficient envelopemasses to allow a full agb phase, and are expected to be particularly prominentat high helium or {\alpha} abundances when the mass loss on the rgb is high.our data support previous claims that most uv-bright sources in the bulge arelikely hot (extreme) horizontal branch stars (ehb) and their progeny. weconstruct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show thatthey are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated uv oroptical light. however, we find that this uv-bright population does notdominate the total uv luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only theprogeny of the ehb stars that are the likely source of the uvx. we calculatethat only a few percent of ms stars in the central bulge can have gone throughthe hp-hb phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance fromthe center. we also find that the surface density of hot uv-bright stars hasthe same radial variation as that of low-mass x-ray binaries. we discuss age,metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observedradial variation in the uv-bright population.

1209.5395	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iii. measuring ages and  masses of partially resolved stellar clusters	the apparent age and mass of a stellar cluster can be strongly affected bystochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, when inferred fromthe integrated color of low mass clusters (less than ~10^4 solar masses). weuse simulated star clusters to show that these effects are minimized when thebrightest, rapidly evolving stars in a cluster can be resolved, and the lightof the fainter, more numerous unresolved stars can be analyzed separately. whencomparing the light from the less luminous cluster members to models ofunresolved light, more accurate age estimates can be obtained than whenanalyzing the integrated light from the entire cluster under the assumptionthat the initial mass function is fully populated. we show the success of thistechnique first using simulated clusters, and then with a stellar cluster inm31. this method represents one way of accounting for the discrete, stochasticsampling of the stellar initial mass function in less massive clusters and canbe leveraged in studies of clusters throughout the local group and other nearbygalaxies.

1211.6105	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury iv. a probabilistic approach  to inferring the high mass stellar initial mass function and other power-law  functions	we present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of thepresent day power-law stellar mass function (mf) of a resolved young starcluster. this technique (a) fully exploits the information content of a givendataset; (b) accounts for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way;(c) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (d) avoids thepitfalls associated with binning data; and (e) is applicable to virtually anyresolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of thehigh mass stellar mf (m &gt; 1 msun). using simulated clusters and markov chainmonte carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show thatestimates of the mf slope, {\alpha}, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,{\delta}{\alpha}, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and stellarmass range they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses andthe completeness are well-characterized. using idealized mock data, we computethe lower limit precision on {\alpha} and provide an analytic approximation for{\delta}{\alpha} as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range.we find that ~ 3/4 of quoted literature uncertainties are smaller than thetheoretical lower limit. by correcting these uncertainties to the theoreticallower limits, we find the literature studies yield &lt;{\alpha}&gt;=2.46 with a1-{\sigma} dispersion of 0.35 dex. we verify that it is impossible for apower-law mf to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of theimf. we show that avoiding substantial biases in the mf slope requires: (1)including the mf as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates;(2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses; and (3) fullycharacterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of agiven mass.

1301.7422	comparing the ancient star formation histories of the magellanic clouds	we present preliminary results from a new hst archival program aimed attightly constraining the ancient (&gt;4 gyr ago) star formation histories (sfhs)of the field populations of the smc and lmc. we demonstrate the quality of thearchival data by constructing hst/wfpc2-based color-magnitude diagrams (cmds;m_{f555w} ~ +8) for 7 spatially diverse fields in the smc and 8 fields in thelmc. the hst-based cmds are &gt;2 magnitudes deeper than any from ground basedobservations, and are particularly superior in high surface brightness regions,e.g., the lmc bar, which contain a significant fraction of star formation andare crowding limited from ground based observations. to minimize systematicuncertainties, we derive the sfh of each field using an identical maximumlikelihood cmd fitting technique. we then compute an approximate mass weightedaverage sfh for each galaxy. we find that both galaxies lack a dominant burstof early star formation, which suggests either a suppression or anunder-fueling of early star formation. from 10-12 gyr ago, the lmc experienceda period of enhanced stellar mass growth relative to the smc. similar to someprevious studies, we find two notable peaks in the sfh of the smc at ~4.5 and 9gyr ago, which could be due to repeated close passages with the lmc, implyingan interaction history that has persisted for at least 9 gyr. we find littleevidence for strong periodic behavior in the lifetime sfhs of both mcs,suggesting that repeated encounters with the milky way are unlikely. beginning~3.5 gyr ago, both galaxies show increases in their sfhs, in agreement withprevious studies, and thereafter, track each other remarkably well.

1305.7243	measuring galaxy star formation rates from integrated photometry:  insights from color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stars	we use empirical star formation histories (sfhs), measured from hst-basedresolved star color-magnitude diagrams, as input into population synthesiscodes to model the broadband spectral energy distributions (seds) of ~50 nearbydwarf galaxies (6.5 &lt; log m/m_* &lt; 8.5, with metallicities ~10% solar). in thepresence of realistic sfhs, we compare the modeled and observed seds from theultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared (nir) and assess the reliability ofwidely used uv-based star formation rate (sfr) indicators. in the fuv through ibands, we find that the observed and modeled seds are in excellent agreement.in the spitzer 3.6micron and 4.5micron bands, we find that modeled sedssystematically over-predict observed luminosities by up to ~0.2 dex, dependingon treatment of the tp-agb stars in the synthesis models. we assess thereliability of uv luminosity as a sfr indicator, in light of independentlyconstrained sfhs. we find that fluctuations in the sfhs alone can cause factorof ~2 variations in the uv luminosities relative to the assumption of aconstant sfh over the past 100 myr. these variations are not stronglycorrelated with uv-optical colors, implying that correcting uv-based sfrs forthe effects of realistic sfhs is difficult using only the broadband sed.additionally, for this diverse sample of galaxies, we find that stars olderthan 100 myr can contribute from &lt;5% to100% of the present day uv luminosity,highlighting the challenges in defining a characteristic star formationtimescale associated with uv emission. we do find a relationship between uvemission timescale and broadband uv-optical color, though it is different thanpredictions based on exponentially declining sfh models. our findings havesignificant implications for the comparison of uv-based sfrs acrosslow-metallicity populations with diverse sfhs.

1306.2420	timescales on which star formation affects the neutral ism	turbulent neutral hydrogen (hi) line widths are often thought to be drivenprimarily by star formation (sf), but the timescale for converting sf energy tohi kinetic energy is unclear. as a complication, studies on the connectionbetween hi line widths and sf in external galaxies often use broadband tracersfor the sf rate, which must implicitly assume that sf histories (sfhs) havebeen constant over the timescale of the tracer. in this paper, we comparemeasures of hi energy to time-resolved sfhs in a number of nearby dwarfgalaxies. we find that hi energy surface density is strongly correlated onlywith sf that occurred 30-40 myr ago. this timescale corresponds to theapproximate lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitors (~ 8 msun). thisanalysis suggests that the coupling between sf and the neutral ism is strongeston this timescale, due either to an intrinsic delay between the release of thepeak energy from sf or to the coherent effects of many sne during thisinterval. at \sigma_sfr &gt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2, we find a mean couplingefficiency between sf energy and hi energy of \epsilon = 0.11 +/- 0.04 usingthe 30-40 myr timescale. however, unphysical efficiencies are required in lower\sigma_sfr systems, implying that sf is not the primary driver of hi kinematicsat \sigma_sfr &lt; 10^-3 msun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

1308.4417	hst/wfc3 observations of low-mass globular clusters am 4 and palomar 13:  physical properties and implications for mass loss	we investigate the loss of low-mass stars in two of the faintest globularclusters known, am 4 and palomar 13 (pal 13), using hst/wfc3 f606w and f814wphotometry. to determine the physical properties of each cluster --- age, mass,metallicity, extinction, present day mass function (mf) --- we use the maximumlikelihood color-magnitude diagram (cmd) fitting program match and thedartmouth, padova and basti stellar evolution models. for am 4, the dartmouthmodels provide the best match to the cmd and yield an age of &gt;13 gyr,metallicity log z/z_solar = -1.68 +/- 0.08, a distance modulus (m-m)_v = 17.47+/- 0.03 and reddening a_v = 0.19 +/- 0.02. for pal 13 the dartmouth modelsgive an age of 13.4 +/- 0.5 gyr, log z/z_solar = -1.55 +/- 0.06, (m-m)_v =17.17 +/- 0.02 and a_v = 0.43 +/- 0.01. we find that the systematicuncertainties due to choice in assumed stellar model greatly exceed the randomuncertainties, highlighting the importance of using multiple stellar modelswhen analyzing stellar populations. assuming a single-sloped power law mf, wefind that am 4 and pal 13 have spectral indices alpha = +0.68 +/- 0.34 andalpha = -1.67 +/- 0.25 (where a salpeter mf has alpha = +1.35), respectively.comparing our derived slopes with literature measurements of cluster integratedmagnitude (m_v) and mf slope indicates that am 4 is an outlier. its mf slope issubstantially steeper than clusters of comparable luminosity, while pal 13 hasa mf in line with the general trend. we discuss both primordial and dynamicalorigins for the unusual mf slope of am 4 and tentatively favor the dynamicalscenario. however, mf slopes of more low luminosity clusters are needed toverify this hypothesis.

1402.7264	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury v: ages and masses of the  year 1 stellar clusters	we present ages and masses for 601 star clusters in m31 from the analysis ofthe six filter integrated light measurements from near ultraviolet to nearinfrared wavelengths, made as part of the panchromatic hubble andromedatreasury (phat). we derive the ages and masses using a probabilistic technique,which accounts for the effects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initialmass function. tests on synthetic data show that this method, in conjunctionwith the exquisite sensitivity of the phat observations and their broadwavelength baseline, provides robust age and mass recovery for clusters rangingfrom $\sim 10^2 - 2 \times 10^6 m_\odot$. we find that the cluster agedistribution is consistent with being uniform over the past $100$ myr, whichsuggests a weak effect of cluster disruption within m31. the age distributionof older ($&gt;100$ myr) clusters fall towards old ages, consistent with apower-law decline of index $-1$, likely from a combination of fading anddisruption of the clusters. we find that the mass distribution of the wholesample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of$-1.9 \pm 0.1$ over the range of $10^3-3 \times 10^5 m_\odot$. however, if wesubdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we find that the agedistributions remain unchanged. however, the mass spectral index variessignificantly, showing best fit values between $-2.2$ and $-1.8$, with theshallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. we explore therobustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the clustermass function may vary with respect to environment.

1403.4609	the acs lcid project. x. the star formation history of ic 1613:  revisiting the over-cooling problem	we present an analysis of the star formation history (sfh) of a field nearthe half light radius in the local group dwarf irregular galaxy ic 1613 basedon deep hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys imaging. ourobservations reach the oldest main sequence turn-off, allowing a timeresolution at the oldest ages of ~1 gyr. our analysis shows that the sfh of theobserved field in ic 1613 is consistent with being constant over the entirelifetime of the galaxy. these observations rule out an early dominant episodeof star formation in ic 1613. we compare the sfh of ic 1613 with expectationsfrom cosmological models. since most of the mass is in place at early times forlow mass halos, a naive expectation is that most of the star formation shouldhave taken place at early times. models in which star formation follows massaccretion result in too many stars formed early and gas mass fractions whichare too low today (the "over-cooling problem"). the depth of the presentphotometry of ic 1613 shows that, at a resolution of ~1 gyr, the star formationrate is consistent with being constant, at even the earliest times, which isdifficult to achieve in models where star formation follows mass assembly.

1404.4981	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. vi. the reliability of  far-ultraviolet flux as a star formation tracer on sub-kpc scales	we have used optical observations of resolved stars from the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) to measure the recent (&lt; 500 myr) starformation histories (sfhs) of 33 fuv-bright regions in m31. the region areasranged from ~$10^4$ to $10^6$ pc$^2$, which allowed us to test the reliabilityof fuv flux as a tracer of recent star formation on sub-kpc scales. the starformation rates (sfrs) derived from the extinction-corrected observed fuvfluxes were, on average, consistent with the 100-myr mean sfrs of the sfhs towithin the 1$\sigma$ scatter. overall, the scatter was larger than theuncertainties in the sfrs and particularly evident among the smallest regions.the scatter was consistent with an even combination of discrete sampling of theinitial mass function and high variability in the sfhs. this resultdemonstrates the importance of satisfying both the full-imf and theconstant-sfr assumptions for obtaining precise sfr estimates from fuv flux.assuming a robust fuv extinction correction, we estimate that a factor of 2.5uncertainty can be expected in fuv-based sfrs for regions smaller than $10^5$pc$^2$, or a few hundred pc. we also examined ages and masses derived from uvflux under the common assumption that the regions are simple stellarpopulations (ssps). the sfhs showed that most of the regions are not ssps, andthe age and mass estimates were correspondingly discrepant from the sfhs. forthose regions with ssp-like sfhs, we found mean discrepancies of 10 myr in ageand a factor of 3 to 4 in mass. it was not possible to distinguish the ssp-likeregions from the others based on integrated fuv flux.

1404.7144	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies i. hubble  space telescope / wide field planetary camera 2 observations	we present uniformly measured star formation histories (sfhs) of 40 localgroup dwarf galaxies based on color-magnitude diagram (cmd) analysis fromarchival hubble space telescope imaging. we demonstrate that accurate sfhs canbe recovered from cmds that do not reach the oldest main sequence turn-off(msto), but emphasize that the oldest msto is critical for preciselyconstraining the earliest epochs of star formation. we find that: (1) theaverage lifetime sfhs of dwarf spheroidals (dsphs) can be approximated by anexponentially declining sfh with $\tau$ $\sim$ 5 gyr; (2) lower luminositydsphs are less likely to have extended sfhs than more luminous dsphs; (3) theaverage sfhs of dwarf irregulars (dirrs), transition dwarfs (dtrans), and dwarfellipticals (des) can be approximated by the combination of an exponentiallydeclining sfh ($\tau$ $\sim$ 3-4 gyr) for lookback ages $&gt;$ 10-12 gyr ago and aconstant sfh thereafter; (4) the observed fraction of stellar mass formed priorto z=2 ranges considerably (80\% for galaxies with m $&lt;$ 10$^5$ m$_{\odot}$ to30\% for galaxies with m$&gt;$10$^7$ m$_{\odot}$) and is largely explained byenvironment; (5) the distinction between "ultra-faint" and "classical" dsphs isarbitrary; (6) lg dirrs formed a significantly higher fraction of stellar massprior to z=2 than the sdss galaxies from leiter 2012 and the sfhs from theabundance matching models of behroozi et al. 2013. this may indicate higherthan expected star-formation efficiencies at early times in low mass galaxies.finally, we provide all the sfhs in tabulated electronic format for use by thecommunity.

1405.3281	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies ii. searching  for signatures of reionization	we search for signatures of reionization in the star formation histories(sfhs) of 38 local group dwarf galaxies (10$^4$ $&lt;$ m$_{\star}$ $&lt;$ 10$^9$m$_{\odot}$). the sfhs are derived from color-magnitude diagrams using archivalhubble space telescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. only fivequenched galaxies (and v, and vi, and xiii, leo iv, hercules) are consistentwith forming the bulk of their stars before reionization, when fulluncertainties are considered. observations of 13 of the predicted `truefossils' identified by bovill &amp; ricotti show that only two (hercules and leoiv) indicate star formation quenched by reionization. however, both are withinthe virial radius of the milky way and evidence of tidal disturbancecomplicates this interpretation. we argue that the late-time gas capturescenario posited by ricotti for the low mass, gas-rich, and star-forming fossilcandidate leo t is observationally indistinguishable from simple gas retention.given the ambiguity between environmental effects and reionization, the bestreionization fossil candidates are quenched low mass field galaxies (e.g., kkr25).

1405.4870	comparing m31 and milky way satellites: the extended star formation  histories of andromeda ii and andromeda xvi	we present the first comparison between the lifetime star formation histories(sfhs) of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites. using the advanced camera forsurveys aboard the hubble space telescope, we obtained deep optical imaging ofandromeda ii (m$_{v} = -$12.0; log(m$_{\star}$/m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 6.7) andandromeda xvi (m$_{v} = -$7.5; log(m$_{\star}$/m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 4.9)yielding color-magnitude diagrams that extend at least 1 magnitude below theoldest main sequence turnoff, and are similar in quality to those available forthe mw companions. and ii and and xvi show strikingly similar sfhs: both formed50-70% of their total stellar mass between 12.5 and 5 gyr ago (z$\sim$5-0.5)and both were abruptly quenched $\sim$ 5 gyr ago (z$\sim$0.5). the predominanceof intermediate age populations in and xvi makes it qualitatively differentfrom faint companions of the mw and clearly not a pre-reionization fossil.neither and ii nor and xvi appears to have a clear analog among mw companions,and the degree of similarity in the sfhs of and ii and and xvi is not seenamong comparably faint-luminous pairs of mw satellites. these findings providehints that satellite galaxy evolution may vary substantially among hosts ofsimilar stellar mass. although comparably deep observations of more m31satellites are needed to further explore this hypothesis, our results underlinethe need for caution when interpreting satellite galaxies of an individualsystem in a broader cosmological context.

1406.0838	reversal of fortune: increased star formation efficiencies in the early  histories of dwarf galaxies?	on dwarf galaxy scales, the different shapes of the galaxy stellar massfunction and the dark halo mass function require a star-formation efficiency(sfe) in these systems that is currently more than 1 dex lower than that ofmilky way-size halos. here, we argue that this trend may actually be reversedat high redshift. specifically, by combining the resolved star-formationhistories of nearby isolated dwarfs with the simulated mass-growth rates ofdark matter halos, we show that the assembly of these systems occurs in twophases: (1) an early, fast halo accretion phase with a rapidly deepeningpotential well, characterized by a high sfe; and (2) a late slow halo accretionphase where, perhaps as a consequence of reionization, the sfe is low. nearbydwarfs have more old stars than predicted by assuming a constant or decreasingsfe with redshift, a behavior that appears to deviate qualitatively from thetrends seen amongst more massive systems. taken at face value, the data suggestthat, at sufficiently early epochs, dwarf galaxy halos above the atomic coolingmass limit can be among the most efficient sites of star formation in theuniverse.

1407.0829	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. progression of large-scale  star formation across space and time in m31	we investigate the clustering of early-type stars younger than 300 myr ongalactic scales in m31. based on the stellar photometric catalogs of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury program that also provides stellarparameters derived from the individual energy distributions, our analysis isfocused on the young stars in three star-forming regions, located atgalactocentric distances of about 5, 10, and 15 kpc, corresponding to the innerspiral arms, the ring structure, and the outer arm, respectively. we apply thetwo-point correlation function to our selected sample to investigate theclustering behavior of these stars across different time- and length-scales. wefind that young stellar structure survives across the whole extent of m31longer than 300 myr. stellar distribution in all regions appears to beself-similar, with younger stars being systematically more strongly clusteredthan the older, which are more dispersed. the observed clustering isinterpreted as being induced by turbulence, the driving source for which isprobably gravitational instabilities driven by the spiral arms, which arestronger closer to the galactic centre.

1409.0899	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury x. ultraviolet to infrared  photometry of 117 million equidistant stars	we have measured stellar photometry with the hubble space telescope (hst)wide field camera 3 (wfc3) and advanced camera for surveys (acs) in nearultraviolet (f275w, f336w), optical (f475w, f814w), and near infrared (f110w,f160w) bands for 117 million resolved stars in m31. as part of the panchromatichubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey, we measured photometry withsimultaneous point spread function fitting across all bands and at all sourcepositions after precise astrometric image alignment (&lt;5-10 milliarcsecondaccuracy). in the outer disk, the photometry reaches a completeness-limiteddepth of f475w~28, while in the crowded, high surface brightness bulge, thephotometry reaches f475w~25. we find that simultaneous photometry and optimizedmeasurement parameters significantly increase the detection limit of the lowestresolution filters (wfc3/ir) providing color-magnitude diagrams that are up to2.5 magnitudes deeper when compared with color-magnitude diagrams from wfc3/irphotometry alone. we present extensive analysis of the data quality includingcomparisons of luminosity functions and repeat measurements, and we useartificial star tests to quantify photometric completeness, uncertainties andbiases. we find that largest sources of systematic error in the photometry aredue to spatial variations in the point spread function models and chargetransfer efficiency corrections. this stellar catalog is the largest everproduced for equidistant sources, and is publicly available for download by thecommunity.

1409.1630	delayed star formation in isolated dwarf galaxies: hst star formation  history of the aquarius dwarf irregular	we have obtained deep images of the highly isolated (d = 1 mpc) aquariusdwarf irregular galaxy (ddo 210) with the hubble space telescope (hst) advancedcamera for surveys (acs). the resulting color-magnitude diagram (cmd) reachesmore than a magnitude below the oldest main-sequence turnoff, allowing us toderive the star formation history (sfh) over the entire lifetime of the galaxywith a timing precision of ~10% of the lookback time. using a maximumlikelihood fit to the cmd we find that only ~10% of all star formation inaquarius took place more than 10 gyr ago (lookback time equivalent to redshiftz ~2). the star formation rate increased dramatically ~6-8 gyr ago (z ~0.7-1.1) and then declined until the present time. the only known galaxy with amore extreme confirmed delay in star formation is leo a, a galaxy of similarm(hi)/m(stellar), dynamical mass, mean metallicity, and degree of isolation.the delayed stellar mass growth in these galaxies does not track the mean darkmatter accretion rate from cdm simulations. the similarities between leo a andaquarius suggest that if gas is not removed from dwarf galaxies by interactionsor feedback, it can linger for several gigayears without cooling in sufficientquantity to form stars efficiently. we discuss possible causes for the delay instar formation including suppression by reionization and late-time mergers. wefind reasonable agreement between our measured sfhs and select cosmologicalsimulations of isolated dwarfs. because star formation and merger processes areboth stochastic in nature, delayed star formation in various degees ispredicted to be a characteristic (but not a universal) feature of isolatedsmall galaxies.

1409.4772	the very faint end of the uv luminosity function over cosmic time:  constraints from the local group fossil record	we present a new technique to estimate the evolution of the very faint end ofthe uv luminosity function (lf) out to $z\sim5$. measured star formationhistories (sfhs) from the fossil record of local group galaxies are used toreconstruct the lf down to m$_{uv}\sim-5$ at $z\sim5$ and m$_{uv}\sim-1.5$ at$z&lt;1$. such faint limits are well beyond the current observational limits andare likely to remain beyond the limits of next generation facilities. thereconstructed lfs, when combined with direct measurements of the lfs at higherluminosity, are well-fit by a standard schechter function with no evidence of abreak to the faintest limits probed by this technique. the derived faint endslope, $\alpha$, steepens from $\approx-1.2$ at $z&lt;1$ to $\approx-1.6$ at$4&lt;z&lt;5$. we test the effects of burstiness in the sfhs and find the recoveredlfs to be only modestly affected. incompleteness corrections for the faintestlocal group galaxies and the (unlikely) possibility of significantluminosity-dependent destruction of dwarf galaxies between high redshift andthe present epoch are important uncertainties. these and other uncertaintiescan be mitigated with more detailed modeling and future observations. thereconstructed faint end lf from the fossil record can therefore be a powerfuland complementary probe of the high redshift faint galaxies believed to play akey role in the reionization of the universe.

1410.0018	the supernova progenitor mass distributions of m31 and m33: further  evidence for an upper mass limit	using hubble space telescope (hst) photometry to measure star formationhistories, we age-date the stellar populations surrounding supernova remnants(snrs) in m31 and m33. we then apply stellar evolution models to the ages toinfer the corresponding masses for their supernova progenitor stars. we analyze33 m33 snr progenitors and 29 m31 snr progenitors in this work. we then combinethese measurements with 53 previously published m31 snr progenitor measurementsto bring our total number of progenitor mass estimates to 115. to quantify themass distributions, we fit power laws of the form $dn/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$.our new, larger sample of m31 progenitors follows a distribution with $\alpha =4.4\pm 0.4$, and the m33 sample follows a distribution with $\alpha =3.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. thus both samples are consistent within the uncertainties,and the full sample across both galaxies gives $\alpha = 4.2\pm 0.3$. both theindividual and full distributions display a paucity of massive stars whencompared to a salpeter initial mass function (imf), which we would expect toobserve if all massive stars exploded as sn that leave behind observable snr.if we instead fix $\alpha = 2.35$ and treat the maximum mass as a freeparameter, we find $m_{max} \sim 35-45m_{sun}$, indicative of a potentialmaximum cutoff mass for sn production. our results suggest that either snrsurveys are biased against finding objects in the youngest (&lt;10 myr old)regions, or the highest mass stars do not produce sne.

1502.03820	a clear age-velocity dispersion correlation in andromeda's stellar disk	the stellar kinematics of galactic disks are key to constraining diskformation and evolution processes. in this paper, for the first time, wemeasure the stellar age-velocity dispersion correlation in the inner 20 kpc(3.5 disk scale lengths) of m31 and show that it is dramatically different fromthat in the milky way. we use optical hubble space telescope/advanced camerafor surveys photometry of 5800 individual stars from the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) survey and keck/deimos radial velocity measurementsof the same stars from the spectroscopic and photometric landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey. we show that the averageline-of-sight velocity dispersion is a steadily increasing function of stellarage exterior to r=10 kpc, increasing from 30 km/s for the young upper mainsequence stars to 90 km/s for the old red giant branch stars. this monotonicincrease implies that a continuous or recurring process contributed to theevolution of the disk. both the slope and normalization of the dispersion vs.age relation are significantly larger than in the milky way, allowing for thepossibility that the disk of m31 has had a more violent history than the diskof the milky way, more in line with cosmological predictions. we also findevidence for an inhomogeneous distribution of stars from a second kinematicalcomponent in addition to the dominant disk component. one of the largest andhottest high-dispersion patches is present in all age bins, and may be thesignature of the end of the long bar.

1502.06621	the high-mass stellar initial mass function in m31 clusters	we have undertaken the largest systematic study of the high-mass stellarinitial mass function (imf) to date using the optical color-magnitude diagrams(cmds) of 85 resolved, young (4 myr &lt; t &lt; 25 myr), intermediate mass starclusters (10^3-10^4 msun), observed as part of the panchromatic hubbleandromeda treasury (phat) program. we fit each cluster's cmd to measure itsmass function (mf) slope for stars &gt;2 msun. for the ensemble of clusters, thedistribution of stellar mf slopes is best described by$\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. the dataalso imply no significant dependencies of the mf slope on cluster age, mass,and size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured mfrepresents the imf. this analysis implies that the high-mass imf slope in m31clusters is universal with a slope ($\gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that issteeper than the canonical kroupa (+1.30) and salpeter (+1.35) values. usingour inference model on select milky way (mw) and lmc high-mass imf studies fromthe literature, we find $\gamma_{\rm mw} \sim+1.15\pm0.1$ and $\gamma_{\rm lmc}\sim+1.3\pm0.1$, both with intrinsic scatter of ~0.3-0.4 dex. thus, while thehigh-mass imf in the local group may be universal, systematics in literatureimf studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations ofthe high-mass imf in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation.consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of thehigh-mass imf slope to date. we have grafted the m31 high-mass imf slope ontowidely used sub-solar mass kroupa and chabrier imfs and show that commonly useduv- and halpha-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of~1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses &gt;8 msun are ~25% fewer thanexpected for a salpeter/kroupa imf.

1503.05195	the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies iii.  characterizing quenching in low-mass galaxies	we explore the quenching of low-mass galaxies (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^8 msun) as afunction of lookback time using the star formation histories (sfhs) of 38 localgroup dwarf galaxies. the sfhs were derived from analyzing color-magnitudediagrams of resolved stellar populations in archival hubble spacetelescope/wide field planetary camera 2 imaging. we find: (1) lower massgalaxies quench earlier than higher mass galaxies; (2) inside of virial radiusthere is no correlation between a satellite's current proximity to a massivehost and its quenching epoch; (3) there are hints of systematic differences inquenching times of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites, although the samplesample size and uncertainties in the sfhs of m31 dwarfs prohibit definitiveconclusions. combined with literature results, we qualitatively consider theredshift evolution (z=0-1) of the quenched galaxy fraction over ~7 dex instellar mass (10^4 &lt; mstar &lt; 10^11.5 msun). the quenched fraction of allgalaxies generally increases toward the present, with both the lowest andhighest mass systems exhibiting the largest quenched fractions at allredshifts. in contrast, galaxies between mstar ~ 10^8-10^10 msun have thelowest quenched fractions. we suggest that such intermediate-mass galaxies arethe least efficient at quenching. finally, we compare our quenching times withpredictions for infall times of low-mass galaxies associated with the mw. wefind that some of the lowest-mass satellites (e.g., cvn ii, leo iv) may havebeen quenched before infall while higher mass satellites (e.g., leo i, fornax)typically quench ~1-4 gyr after infall.

1503.06799	rapid environmental quenching of satellite dwarf galaxies in the local  group	in the local group, nearly all of the dwarf galaxies (m_star &lt; 10^9 m_sun)that are satellites within 300 kpc (the virial radius) of the milky way (mw)and andromeda (m31) have quiescent star formation and little-to-no cold gas.this contrasts strongly with comparatively isolated dwarf galaxies, which arealmost all actively star-forming and gas-rich. this near dichotomy implies arapid transformation of satellite dwarf galaxies after falling into the halosof the mw or m31. we combine the observed quiescent fractions for satellites ofthe mw and m31 with the infall times of satellites from the exploring the localvolume in simulations (elvis) suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations todetermine the typical timescales over which environmental processes within themw/m31 halos remove gas and quench star formation in low-mass satellitegalaxies. the quenching timescales for satellites with m_star &lt; 10^8 m_sun areshort, &lt; 2 gyr, and quenching is more rapid at lower m_star. these satellitequenching timescales can be 1 - 2 gyr longer if one includes the time thatsatellites were environmentally preprocessed by low-mass groups prior to mw/m31infall. we compare with quenching timescales for more massive satellites fromprevious works to synthesize the nature of satellite galaxy quenching acrossthe observable range of m_star = 10^{3-11} m_sun. the satellite quenchingtimescale increases rapidly with satellite m_star, peaking at ~9.5 gyr form_star ~ 10^9 m_sun, and the timescale rapidly decreases at higher m_star to &lt;5 gyr at m_star &gt; 5 x 10^9 m_sun. overall, galaxies with m_star ~ 10^9 m_sun,similar to the magellanic clouds, exhibit the longest quenching timescales,regardless of environmental or internal mechanisms.

1504.03338	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury xi: the spatially-resolved  recent star formation history of m31	we measure the recent star formation history (sfh) across m31 using opticalimages taken with the \texit{hubble space telescope} as part of thepanchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat). we fit the color-magnitudediagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\times$ 100 pc in projected size,covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the nequadrant of m31. we show that the sfhs vary significantly on these smallspatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in thesfh back to ~500 myr, most notably in m31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. we findthat the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 myr old, showing ongoing star formationover the past ~500 myr. this indicates the presence of molecular gas in thering over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. we also find that thering's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at thelevel of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due todiffusion of stars into the disk. based on existing models of m31's ringfeatures, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purelycollisional ring origin highly unlikely. we find that the global sfr has beenfairly constant over the last ~500 myr, though it does show a small increase at50 myr that is 1.3 times the average sfr over the past 100 myr. during the last~500 myr, ~60% of all sf occurs in the 10-kpc ring. finally, we find that inthe past 100 myr, the average sfr over the phat survey area is $0.28\pm0.03$m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average deprojected intensity of $7.3 \times10^{-4}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, which yields a total sfr of ~0.7m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ when extrapolated to the entire area of m31's disk. thissfr is consistent with measurements from broadband estimates.

1504.06621	the local group as a time machine: studying the high-redshift universe  with nearby galaxies	we infer the uv luminosities of local group galaxies at early cosmic times($z \sim 2$ and $z \sim 7$) by combining stellar population synthesis modelingwith star formation histories derived from deep color-magnitude diagramsconstructed from hubble space telescope (hst) observations. our analysisprovides a basis for understanding high-$z$ galaxies - including those that maybe unobservable even with the james webb space telescope (jwst) - in thecontext of familiar, well-studied objects in the very low-$z$ universe. we findthat, at the epoch of reionization, all local group dwarfs were less luminousthan the faintest galaxies detectable in deep hst observations of blank fields.we predict that jwst will observe $z \sim 7$ progenitors of galaxies similar tothe large magellanic cloud today; however, the hst frontier fields initiativemay already be observing such galaxies, highlighting the power of gravitationallensing. consensus reionization models require an extrapolation of the observedblank-field luminosity function at $z \approx 7$ by at least two orders ofmagnitude in order to maintain reionization. this scenario requires theprogenitors of the fornax and sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies to becontributors to the ionizing background at $z \sim 7$. combined with numericalsimulations, our results argue for a break in the uv luminosity function from afaint-end slope of $\alpha \sim -2$ at $m_{\rm uv} &lt; -13$ to $\alpha \sim -1.2$at lower luminosities. applied to photometric samples at lower redshifts, ouranalysis suggests that hst observations in lensing fields at $z \sim 2$ arecapable of probing galaxies with luminosities comparable to the expectedprogenitor of fornax.

0805.1058	delving deeper into the tumultuous lives of galactic dwarfs: modeling  star formation histories	the paucity of observed dwarf galaxies in the local group relative to theabundance of predicted dark matter halos remains one of the greatest puzzles ofthe lcdm paradigm. solving this puzzle now requires not only matching thenumbers of objects but also understanding the details of their star formationhistories. we present a summary of such histories derived from the hst datausing the color-magnitude diagram fitting method. to reduce observationaluncertainties, we condense the data into five cumulative parameters -- thefractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1, 2, 5, and 10 gyr, and the meanstellar age. we interpret the new data with a phenomenological model based onthe mass assembly histories of dark matter halos and the schmidt law of starformation. the model correctly predicts the radial distribution of the dwarfsand the fractions of stars formed in the last 5 and 10 gyr. however, in orderto be consistent with the observations, the model requires a significant amountof recent star formation in the last 2 gyr. within the framework of our model,this prolonged star formation can be achieved by adding a stochastic variationin the density threshold of the star formation law. the model results are notsensitive to late gas accretion, the slope of the schmidt law, or the detailsof cosmic reionization. a few discrepancies still remain: our model typicallypredicts too large stellar masses, only a modest population of ultra-faintdwarfs, and a small number of dwarfs with anomalously young stellarpopulations. nevertheless, the observed star formation histories of local groupdwarfs are generally consistent the expected star formation in cold dark matterhalos.

1507.06687	a spectroscopic and photometric exploration of the c/m ratio in the disk  of m31	we explore the ratio (c/m) of carbon-rich to oxygen-rich thermally pulsingasymptotic giant branch(tp-agb) stars in the disk of m31 using a combination ofmoderate-resolution optical spectroscopy from the spectroscopic landscape ofandromeda's stellar halo (splash) survey and six-filter hubble space telescopephotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury (phat) survey.carbonstars were identified spectroscopically. oxygen-rich m-stars were identifedusing three different photometric definitions designed to mimic, and thusevaluate, selection techniques common in the literature. we calculate the c/mratio as a function of galactocentric radius, present-day gas-phase oxygenabundance, stellar metallicity, age (via proxy defined as the ratio of tp-agbstars to red giant branch, rgb, stars), and mean star formation rate over thelast 400 myr. we find statistically significant correlations between log(c/m)and all parameters. these trends are consistent across different m-starselection methods, though the fiducial values change. of particular note is ourobserved relationship between log(c/m) and stellar metallicity, which is fullyconsistent with the trend seen across local group satellite galaxies. the factthat this trend persists in stellar populations with very different starformation histories indicates that the c/m ratio is governed by stellarproperties alone.

1509.01250	push it to the limit: local group constraints on high-redshift stellar  mass functions for mstar &gt; 10^5 msun	we constrain the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function from 2 &lt; z &lt; 5for galaxies with stellar masses as low as 10^5 msun by combining starformation histories of milky way satellite galaxies derived from deep hubblespace telescope observations with merger trees from the elvis suite of n-bodysimulations. this approach extends our understanding more than two orders ofmagnitude lower in stellar mass than is currently possible by direct imaging.we find the faint end slopes of the mass functions to be alpha=-1.42(+0.07/-0.05) at z = 2 and alpha = -1.57^(+0.06/-0.06) at z = 5, and showthe slope only weakly evolves from z = 5 to z = 0. our findings are in starkcontrast to a number of direct detection studies that suggest slopes as steepas alpha = -1.9 at these epochs. such a steep slope would result in an order ofmagnitude too many luminous milky way satellites in a mass regime that isobservationally complete (mstar &gt; 2*10^5 msun at z = 0). the most recentstudies from zfourge and candels also suggest flatter faint end slopes that areconsistent with our results, but with a lower degree of precision. this workillustrates the strong connections between low and high-z observations whenviewed through the lens of lcdm numerical simulations.

1509.06988	the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury viii: a wide-area,  high-resolution map of dust extinction in m31	we map the distribution of dust in m31 at 25pc resolution, using stellarphotometry from the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury. we develop a newmapping technique that models the nir color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of redgiant branch (rgb) stars. the model cmds combine an unreddened foreground ofrgb stars with a reddened background population viewed through a log-normalcolumn density distribution of dust. fits to the model constrain the medianextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction ofreddened stars. the resulting extinction map has &gt;4 times better resolutionthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of thedust column. there is superb morphological agreement between the new map andmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by draine et al. 2014.however, the widely-used draine &amp; li (2007) dust models overpredict theobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that m31's true dust massis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed indraine et al. (2014). the discrepancy we identify is consistent with similarfindings in the milky way by the planck collaboration (2015), but has a morecomplex dependence on parameters from the draine &amp; li (2007) dust models. wealso show that the discrepancy with the draine et al. (2014) map is lowestwhere the interstellar radiation field has a harder spectrum than average. wediscuss possible improvements to the cmd dust mapping technique, and explorefurther applications.

1510.08533	a hubble space telescope study of the enigmatic milky way halo globular  cluster crater	we analyze the resolved stellar populations of the faint stellar system,crater, based on deep optical imaging taken with the hubble space telescope.the hst/acs-based color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of crater extends $\sim$4magnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, providing excellent leverageon crater's physical properties. structurally, crater has a half-light radiusof $\sim$20 pc and shows no evidence for tidal distortions. crater iswell-described by a simple stellar population with an age of $\sim$7.5 gyr,[m/h]$\sim-1.65$, a m$_{\star}\sim10^4$ m$_{\odot}$, m$_{\rm v}\sim -5.3$,located at a distance of d$\sim$ 145 kpc, with modest uncertainties in theseproperties due to differences in the underlying stellar evolution models. thesparse sampling of stars above the turnoff and sub-giant branch are likely tobe 1.0-1.4 m$_{\odot}$ binary star systems (blue stragglers) and their evolveddescendants, as opposed to intermediate age main sequence stars. confusion ofthese populations highlights a substantial challenge in accuratelycharacterizing sparsely populated stellar systems. our analysis shows thatcrater is not a dwarf galaxy, but instead is an unusually young cluster givenits location in the milky way's very outer stellar halo. crater is similar tosmc cluster lindsay 38, and its position and velocity are in good agreementwith observations and models of the magellanic stream debris, suggesting it mayhave accreted from the magellanic clouds. however, its age and metallicity arealso in agreement with the age-metallicity relationships of lower mass dwarfgalaxies such as leo i or carina. despite uncertainty over its progenitorsystem, crater appears to have been incorporated into the galaxy more recentlythan $z\sim1$ (8 gyr ago), providing an important new constraint on theaccretion history of the milky way.

astro-ph;0612766	the aptly named phoenix dwarf galaxy	the local group galaxy phoenix has the properties of a dwarf spheroidalgalaxy, but an adjacent hi cloud has been found to be at the same radialvelocity as the stars. the proximity suggests that this cloud is associatedwith the most recent ($\le 100$ myr) star formation in phoenix. we haveobtained relatively high sensitivity and high resolution hi imaging with thevla with the goal of distinguishing between different processes for displacingthe gas from the galaxy. due to the outer curvature of the hi cloud, it appearsthat expulsion from the galaxy by winds from supernovae is more likely thanram-pressure stripping. the isolation of the galaxy makes tidal strippinghighly unlikely. using a star formation history constructed from hst imaging,we construct a simple kinematic model which implies that the hi cloud is stillgravitationally bound to the galaxy. gas which is expelled from the centers ofdwarf galaxies but which remains gravitationally bound may explain the episodicstar formation observed in several dwarfs. in the specific case of phoenix,there may be future star formation in this currently dsph-like galaxy.

0809.5059	the recent star formation histories of m81 group dwarf irregular  galaxies	we present observations and analysis of nine dwarf irregular galaxies (dis)in the m81 group taken with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope. the nine galaxy sample (the garland, m81 dwarf a, ddo 53, hoix, ho i, ddo 165, ngc 2366, ho ii, and ic 2574) spans 6 magnitudes inluminosity, a factor of 1000 in current star formation rate, and 0.5 dex inmetallicity. here we use color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stellarpopulations to study the star formation histories (sfhs) of these galaxies. wedivide the sample into faint and bright galaxies, with a dividing line ofm_${b}$ = -15, and then analyze the similarities and differences in the sfhs,birthrate parameters, fraction of stars formed per time interval, and spatialdistribution of stellar components. comparing these parameters as a function ofluminosity, we find only minor differences in sf characteristics. we extend ourcomparison to select dis in the local group (lg), and find only minordifferences in sf parameters. the fraction of stars formed per time intervalfor an average m81 group and lg di is consistent with a constant sfh. however,individual galaxies can show significant departures from a constant sfh. thus,we find this result underlines the importance of stochastic sf in dis. we alsocompare possible formation scenarios of the less luminous and candidate tidaldwarfs in the m81 group. the sfhs and the lack of an overdensity of associatedred stars suggest that the garland and ho ix are not dis and are potentiallytidal dwarf galaxies. interestingly, a noteworthy difference between the lg andthe m81 group is the lack of tidal dwarf candidates in the lg.

0812.2036	triggered star formation and the creation of the supergiant hi shell in  ic 2574	based on deep imaging from the advanced camera for surveys aboard the hubblespace telescope, we present new evidence that stellar feedback created a ~ 1kpc supergiant hi shell (sgs) and triggered star formation (sf) around its rimin the m81 group dwarf irregular galaxy ic 2574. using photometry of theresolved stars from the hst images, we measure the star formation history of aregion including the sgs, focusing on the past 500 myr, and employ the uniqueproperties of blue helium burning stars to create a movie of sf in the sgs. wefind two significant episodes of sf inside the sgs from 200 - 300 myr and ~ 25myr ago. comparing the timing of the sf events to the dynamic age of the sgsand the energetics from the hi and sf, we find compelling evidence that stellarfeedback is responsible for creating the sgs and triggering secondary sf aroundits rim.
