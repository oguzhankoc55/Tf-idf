0901.2346	the population of barred galaxies in the local universe i. detection and  characterisation of bars	(abridge) bars are very common in the centre of the disc galaxies, and theydrive the evolution of their structure. a volume-limited sample of 2106 discgalaxies extracted from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 was studiedto derive the bar fraction, length, and strength as a function of themorphology, size, local galaxy density, light concentration, and colour of thehost galaxy. the bars were detected using the ellipse fitting method andfourier analysis method. the ellipse fitting method was found to be moreefficient in detecting bars in spiral galaxies. the fraction of barred galaxiesturned out to be 45%. a bar was found in 29% of the lenticular galaxies, in 55%and 54% of the early- and late-type spirals, respectively. the bar length(normalised by the galaxy size) of late-type spirals is shorter than inearly-type or lenticular ones. a correlation between the bar length and galaxysize was found with longer bars hosted by larger galaxies. the bars of thelenticular galaxies are weaker than those in spirals. moreover, the unimodaldistribution of the bar strength found for all the galaxy types argues againsta quick transition between the barred and unbarred statues. there is nodifference between the local galaxy density of barred and unbarred galaxies.besides, neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated with thelocal density of the galaxy neighbourhoods. in contrast, a statisticalsignificant difference between the central light concentration and colour ofbarred and unbarred galaxies was found. bars are mostly located in lessconcentrated and bluer galaxies. these results indicate that the properties ofbars are strongly related to those of their host galaxies, but do not depend onthe local environment.

0909.4048	the ultraviolet flare at the center of the elliptical galaxy ngc 4278	a large fraction of otherwise normal galaxies shows a weak nuclear activity.one of the signatures of the low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) isthe ultraviolet variability which was serendipitously discovered in the centerof some low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (liner) galaxies. there isa pressing need to acquire better statistics about uv flaring and variabilityin galaxy nuclei, both in terms of the number and monitoring of targets. thescience data archive of the hubble space telescope was queried to find all theelliptical galaxies with uv images obtained in different epochs with the widefield planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) and possibly with nuclear spectra obtainedwith the space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) in the region of thehalpha emission line. these data were found only for the elliptical radiogalaxyngc 4278. the uv flux of the nuclear source of ngc 4278 was measured by meansof aperture photometry on the wfpc2/f218w images obtained between june 1994 andjanuary 1995. the mass of the central supermassive black hole (sbh) wasestimated by measuring the broad components of the emission lines observed inthe stis/g750m spectrum and assuming that the gas is uniformly distributed in asphere. the nucleus of ngc 4278 hosts a barely resolved but strongly variableuv source. its uv luminosity increased by a factor of 1.6 in a period of 6months. the amplitude and scale time of the uv flare in ngc 4278 are remarkablysimilar to those of the brightest uv nuclear transients which were earlierfound in other llagns. the mass of the sbh was found to be in the range between7x10^7 and 2x10^9 m_sun. this is in agreement with previous findings based ondifferent assumptions about the gas distribution and with the predictions basedon the galaxy velocity dispersion.

1002.1245	direct measurements of bar pattern speeds	the dynamics of a barred galaxy depends on the angular velocity or patternspeed of its bar. indeed, it is related to the location of corotation wheregravitational and centrifugal forces cancel out in the rest frame of the bar.the only direct method for measuring the bar pattern speed is thetremaine-weinberg technique. this method is best suited to the analysis of thedistribution and kinematics of the stellar component in absence of significantstar formation and patchy dust obscuration. therefore, it has been mostly usedfor early-type barred galaxies. the main sources of uncertainties on thedirectly-measured bar pattern speeds are discussed. there are attempts toovercome the selection bias of the current sample of direct measurements byextending the application of the tremaine-weinberg method to the gaseouscomponent. furthermore, there is a variety of indirect methods which are basedon the analysis of the gas distribution and kinematics. they have been largelyused to measure the bar pattern speed in late-type barred galaxies. nearly allthe bars measured with direct and indirect methods end close to theircorotation radius, i.e., they are as rapidly rotating as they can be.

1004.2190	multiband photometric decomposition of nuclear stellar disks	small and bright stellar disks with scale lengths of few tens of parsec areknown to reside in the center of galaxies. they are believed to have formed ina dissipational process as the end result of star formation in gas eitheraccreted in a merging (or acquisition) event or piled up by the secularevolution of a nuclear bar. only few of them have been studied in detail todate. using archival hubble space telescope (hst) imaging, we investigated thephotometric parameters of the nuclear stellar disks hosted by three early-typegalaxies in the virgo cluster, ngc 4458, ngc4478, and ngc4570. we aimed atconstraining the process of formation of their stars. the central surfacebrightness, scale length, inclination, and position angle of the nuclear diskswere derived by adopting the photometric decomposition method introduced byscorza &amp; bender and assuming the disks to be infinitesimally thin andexponential. the location, orientation, and size of the nuclear disks is thesame in all the images obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 andadvanced camera for survey and available in the hst science archive. the scalelength, inclination, and position angle of each disk are constant within theerrors in the observed u, b, v, and i passbands, independently of their valuesand of the properties of the host spheroid. we interpret the absence of colorgradients in the stellar population of the nuclear disks as the signature thatstar formation homogeneously occurred all through their extension. a inside-outformation scenario is, instead, expected to produce color gradients andtherefore is ruled out.

1006.5449	structural properties of disk galaxies. ii. intrinsic shape of bulges	(abridged) the structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148unbarred s0-sb galaxies were analyzed to derive the intrinsic shape of theirbulges. we developed a new method to derive the intrinsic shape of bulges basedon the geometrical relationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes ofbulges and disks. the equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of bulgeswere obtained from the length of the apparent major and minor semi-axes of thebulge, twist angle between the apparent major axis of the bulge and the galaxyline of nodes, and galaxy inclination. we found that the intrinsic shape iswell constrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. alarge fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (b/a&lt;0.9).this fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or medianequatorial ellipticity, respectively. most are flattened along their polar axis(c&lt;(a+b)/2). the distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. thisbimodality is driven by bulges with sersic index n&gt;2, or equivalently, by thebulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio b/t&gt;0.3. in particular, bulgeswith n\leq2 and with b/t\leq0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, andfewer prolate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect tobulges with n&gt;2 and with b/t&gt;0.3, respectively. according to predictions of thenumerical simulations of bulge formation, bulges with n\leq2, which show a highfraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and haveb/t\leq0.3, could be the result of dissipational minor mergers. both majordissipational and dissipationless mergers seem to be required to explain thevariety of shapes found for bulges with n&gt;2 and b/t&gt;0.3.

1012.5757	the intrinsic shape of bulges	the structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred s0-sbgalaxies were derived using the gasp2d algorithm and then analyzed to derivethe intrinsic shape of their bulges. we developed a new method to derive theintrinsic shape of bulges based on photometric data and on the geometricalrelationships between the apparent and intrinsic shapes of bulges and disks.the method is conceived as completely independent of the studied class ofobjects, and it can be applied whenever a triaxial ellipsoid embedded in anaxisymmetric component is considered. we found that the intrinsic shape is wellconstrained for a subsample of 115 bulges with favorable viewing angles. alarge fraction of them is characterized by an elliptical section (b/a&lt;0.9).this fraction is 33%, 55%, and 43% if using their maximum, mean, or medianequatorial ellipticity, respectively. most of them are flattened along theirpolar axis. the distribution of triaxiality is strongly bimodal. thisbimodality is driven by bulges with sersic index n&gt;2, or equivalently, by thebulges of galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio b/t&gt;0.3. bulges with n&lt;2 andwith b/t&lt;0.3 follow a similar distribution, which is different from that ofbulges with n&gt;2 and with b/t&gt;0.3. in particular, bulges with n&lt;2 and withb/t&lt;0.3 show a larger fraction of oblate axisymmetric (or nearly axisymmetric)bulges, a smaller fraction of triaxial bulges, and fewer prolate axisymmetric(or nearly axisymmetric) bulges with respect to bulges with n&gt;2 and withb/t&gt;0.3, respectively. according to the numerical simulations of bulgeformation, bulges with n&lt;2, which show a high fraction of oblate axisymmetric(or nearly axisymmetric) shapes and have b/t&lt;0.3, could be the result ofdissipational minor mergers. both major dissipational and dissipationlessmergers seem to be required to explain the variety of shapes found for bulgeswith n&gt;2 and b/t&gt;0.3.

1101.2447	fossil groups origins: i. rx j105453.3+552102 a very massive and relaxed  system at z~0.5	the most accepted scenario for the origin of fossil groups (fgs) is that theyare galaxy associations in which the merging rate was fast and efficient. thesesystems have assembled half of their mass at early epoch of the universe,subsequently growing by minor mergers. they could contain a fossil record ofthe galaxy structure formation. we have started a project in order tocharacterize a large sample of fgs. in this paper we present the analysis ofthe fossil system rx j105453.3+552102. optical deep images were used forstudying the properties of the brightest group galaxy and for computing thephotometric luminosity function of the group. we have also performed a detaildynamical analysis of the system based on redshift data for 116 galaxies. thisgalaxy system is located at z=0.47, and shows a quite large line-of-sightvelocity dispersion \sigma_{v}~1000 km/s. assuming the dynamical equilibrium,we estimated a virial mass of m ~ 10^{15} h_{70} m_{\odot}. no evidence ofsubstructure was found within 1.4 mpc radius. we found a statisticallysignificant departure from gaussianity of the group members velocities in themost external regions of the group. this could indicate the presence ofgalaxies in radial orbits in the external region of the group. we also foundthat the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of m_{r}~ -19.5 galaxies. the brightest group galaxy shows low sersic parameter (n~2)and a small peculiar velocity. indeed, our accurate photometry shows that thedifference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies is 1.9 magin the r-band, while the classical definition of fgs is based on a magnitudegap of 2. we conclude that this fossil system does not follow the empiricaldefinition of fgs. nevertheless, it is a massive, old and undisturbed galaxysystem with little infall of l^{*} galaxies since its initial collapse.

1103.3414	dynamical masses of early-type galaxies: a comparison to lensing results  and implications for the stellar imf and the distribution of dark matter	this work aims to study the distribution of luminous and dark matter in comaearly-type galaxies. dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that massfollows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systemsof similar velocity dispersions. instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halosare in good agreement with lensing results. we derive mass-to-light ratios ofthe stellar populations from lick absorption line indices, reproducing well theobserved galaxy colours. even in dynamical models with dark matter halos theamount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxyvelocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function(imf). while galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a kroupa imf,the same imf underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~300 km/s by a factor of two and more. a systematic variation of the stellar imfwith galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a salpeter imffor the most massive galaxies. if the imf is instead constant, then some of thedark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatialdistribution very similar to that of the light. a combination of both, avarying imf and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possibleas well. for a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations we show thatthe tilt in the fundamental plane can be explained by systematic variations ofthe total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. we tested commonlyused mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30% level.

1110.0465	fossil groups origins ii. unveiling the formation of the brightest group  galaxies through their scaling relations	(abridged) fossil systems are galaxy associations dominated by a relativelyisolated, bright elliptical galaxy, surrounded by a group of smaller galaxieslacking l* objects. we analyzed the near-infrared photometric and structuralproperties of a sample of 20 bggs present in fgs in order to better understandtheir formation mechanisms. their surface-brightness distribution was fitted toa sersic profile using the gasp2d algorithm. then, the standard scalingrelations were derived for the first time for these galaxies and compared withthose of normal ellipticals and brightest cluster galaxies in non-fossilsystems. the bggs presented in this study represent a subset of the mostmassive galaxies in the universe. we found that their ellipticity profiles arecontinuously increasing with the galactocentric radius. our fossil bcgs followclosely the fundamental plane described by normal ellipticals. however, theydepart from both the log \sigma_0 vs. log l_{k_{s}} and log r_{\rm e} vs. logl_{k_{s}} relations described by intermediate mass ellipticals. this occurs inthe sense that our bggs have larger effective radii and smaller velocitydispersions than those predicted by these relations. we also found that moreelliptical galaxies systematically deviate from the previous relations whilemore rounder object do not. no similar correlation was found with the sersicindex. the derived scaling relations can be interpreted in terms of theformation scenario of the bggs. because our bggs follow the fundamental planetilt but they have larger effective radii than expected for intermediate massellipticals, we suggest that they only went through dissipational mergers in aearly stage of their evolution and then assembled the bulk of their massthrough subsequent dry mergers, contrary to previous claims that bggs in fgswere formed mainly by the merging of gas-rich galaxies.

1203.4284	structure and dynamics of galaxies with a low surface-brightness disc -  ii. stellar populations of bulges	the radial profiles of the hb, mg, and fe line-strength indices are presentedfor a sample of eight spiral galaxies with a low surface-brightness stellardisc and a bulge. the correlations between the central values of theline-strength indices and velocity dispersion are consistent to those known forearly-type galaxies and bulges of high surface-brightness galaxies. the age,metallicity, and alpha/fe enhancement of the stellar populations in thebulge-dominated region are obtained using stellar population models withvariable element abundance ratios. almost all the sample bulges arecharacterized by a young stellar population, on-going star formation, and asolar alpha/fe enhancement. their metallicity spans from high to sub-solarvalues. no significant gradient in age and alpha/fe enhancement is measured,whereas only in a few cases a negative metallicity gradient is found. theseproperties suggest that a pure dissipative collapse is not able to explainformation of all the sample bulges and that other phenomena, like mergers oracquisition events, need to be invoked. such a picture is also supported by thelack of a correlation between the central value and gradient of the metallicityin bulges with very low metallicity. the stellar populations of the bulgeshosted by low surface-brightness discs share many properties with those of highsurface-brightness galaxies. therefore, they are likely to have commonformation scenarios and evolution histories. a strong interplay between bulgesand discs is ruled out by the fact that in spite of being hosted by discs withextremely different properties, the bulges of low and high surface-brightnessdiscs are remarkably similar.

1304.6093	constraining the luminosity function of faint undetected i-dropout  galaxies	we present a new technique to quantify the light contribution coming from thefaint high redshift ($z\sim6$) galaxies below the detection threshold ofimaging data, set conventionally at s/n=4.5. we illustrate the technique withan application to hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images inthe f775w and f850lp filters of the ultra deep field parallel field nicp12. theaim of this analysis is to extend by a few magnitudes the faint end of theluminosity function at $z\sim6$. after masking all the detected sources in thefield we apply a fast fourier transform to obtain the spatial power spectrum ofthe background signal. the power spectrum permits us to separate the backgroundnoise signal, the residuals due to the data reduction of the wide field, andthe overall signal produced by faint galaxies. the ratio of the signal in thei_775 and z_850 bands is used to estimate the contribution of the fainti-dropout objects. we rely on extensive monte carlo simulations to characterizevarious sources of uncertainty and quantify the number of faint i-dropoutgalaxies in the field. the analysis allows us to put constraints on theluminosity function at $z\sim6$ down to z_850= 30 mag, 2.5 mag fainter thanwith standard techniques on the same data. the data are consistent with a faintend slope of the luminosity function of $\alpha = -1.9$. assuming a specificset of values for the clumping factor, escape fraction, and spectral energydistribution, we find that the $z\sim6$ undetected galaxies down to z_850=30mag could have driven cosmic reionization.

1305.1628	searching for nuclear stellar discs in simulations of star cluster  mergers	the nuclei of galaxies often host small stellar discs with scale-lengths of afew tens of parsecs and luminosities up to 10^7 lsun. to investigate theformation and properties of nuclear stellar discs (nsds), we look for theirpresence in a set of n-body simulations studying the dissipationless merging ofmultiple star clusters in galactic nuclei. a few tens of star clusters withsizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the milkyway are accreted onto a pre-existing nuclear stellar component: either amassive super star cluster or a rapidly rotating, compact disc with ascale-length of a few parsecs, mimicing the variety of observed nuclearstructures. images and kinematic maps of the simulation time-steps are thenbuilt and analysed as if they were real and at the distance of the virgocluster. we use the scorza-bender method to search for the presence of discstructures via photometric decomposition. in one case the merger remnant hasall the observed photometric and kinematic properties of nsds observed in realgalaxies. this shows that current observations are consistent with most of thensd mass being assembled from the migration and accretion of star clusters intothe galactic centre. in the other simulation instead, we detect an elongatedstructure from the unsharp masked image, that does not develop the photometricor kinematic signature of a nsd. thus, in the context of searches for a discstructure, the scorza-bender method is a robust and necessary tool.

1403.0588	fossil groups origins iii. characterization of the sample and  observational properties of fossil systems	(abridged) fossil systems are group- or cluster-sized objects whoseluminosity is dominated by a very massive central galaxy. in the current colddark matter scenario, these objects formed hierarchically at an early epoch ofthe universe and then slowly evolved until present day. that is the reason whythey are called {\it fossils}. we started an extensive observational program tocharacterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range ofphysical properties. deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate andoptical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\sim$ 1200 galaxies. thisnew dataset was completed with sdss dr7 archival data to obtain robust clustermembership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. for eachsystem, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies($\delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\delta m_{14}$)within 0.5 $r_{{\rm 200}}$. we consider fossil systems those with $\deltam_{12} \ge 2$ mag or $\delta m_{14} \ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. we findthat 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. their observationalproperties agree with those of non-fossil systems. both follow the samecorrelations, but fossils are always extreme cases. in particular, they hostthe brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosedin the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. finally,we confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. combining our results withothers in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systemsformed due to mergers of $l^\ast$ galaxies. the large magnitude gap is aconsequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore itis an evolutionary effect. moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate inour sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.

1403.0590	fossil groups origins iii. the relation between optical and x-ray  luminosities	this study is part of the fossil groups origin (fogo) project which aims atcarrying out a systematic and multiwavelength study of a large sample of fossilsystems. here we focus on the relation between the optical luminosity (lopt)and x-ray luminosity (lx). out of a sample of 28 candidate fossil systems, weconsider a sample of 12 systems whose fossil classification has been confirmedby a companion study. they are compared with the complementary sample of 16systems whose fossil nature is not confirmed and with a subsample of 102 galaxysystems from the rass-sdss galaxy cluster survey. fossil and normal systemsspan the same redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 and have the same lx distribution. foreach fossil system, the lx in the 0.1-2.4 kev band is computed using data fromthe rosat all sky survey. for each fossil and normal system we homogeneouslycompute lopt in the r-band within the characteristic cluster radius, using datafrom the sdss dr7. we sample the lx-lopt relation over two orders of magnitudein lx. our analysis shows that fossil systems are not statisticallydistinguishable from the normal systems both through the 2d ks test and the fitof the lx-lopt relation. the optical luminosity of the galaxy system doesstrongly correlate with the x-ray luminosity of the hot gas component,independently of whether the system is fossil or not. we conclude that ourresults are consistent with the classical "merging scenario" of the brightestgalaxy formed via merger/cannibalism of other group galaxies, with conservationof the optical light. we find no evidence for a peculiar state of the hotintracluster medium.

1409.2876	secular- and merger-built bulges in barred galaxies	(abridged) we study the incidence, as well as the nature, of composite bulgesin a sample of 10 face-on barred galaxies to constrain the formation andevolutionary processes of the central regions of disk galaxies. we analyze themorphological, photometric, and kinematic properties of each bulge. then, byusing a case-by-case analysis we identify composite bulges and classify everycomponent into a classical or pseudobulge. in addition, bar-related boxy/peanut(b/p) structures were also identified and characterised. we find only threegalaxies hosting a single-component bulge (two pseudobulges and one classicalbulge). we find evidence of composite bulges coming in two main types based ontheir formation: secular-built and merger- and secular-built. we callsecular-built to composite bulges made of entirely by structures associatedwith secular processes such as pseudo bulges, central disks, or b/p bulges. wefind four composite bulges of this kind in our sample. on the other hand,merger- and secular-built bulges are those where structures with differentformation paths coexist within the same galaxy, i.e., a classical bulgecoexisting with a secular-built structure (pseudobulge, central disk, or b/p).three bulges of this kind were found in the sample. we remark on the importanceof detecting kinematic structures such as sigma-drops to identify compositebulges. a large fraction (80%) of galaxies were found to host sigma-drops orsigma-plateaus in our sample revealing their high incidence in barred galaxies.the high frequency of composite bulges in barred galaxies points towards acomplex formation and evolutionary scenario. moreover, the evidence forcoexisting merger- and secular-built bulges reinforce this idea. we discuss howthe presence of different bulge types, with different formation histories andtimescales, can constrain current models of bulge formation.

1501.07178	stellar populations of the bulges of four spiral galaxies	key information to understand the formation and evolution of disk galaxiesare imprinted in the stellar populations of their bulges. this paper has thepurpose to make available new measurements of the stellar population propertiesof the bulges of four spiral galaxies. both the central values and radialprofiles of the line strength of some of the most common lick indices aremeasured along the major- and minor- axis of the bulge-dominated region of thesample galaxies. the corresponding age, metallicity, and {\alpha}/fe ratio arederived by using the simple stellar population synthesis model predictions. thecentral values and the gradients of the stellar population properties ofeso-lv1890070, eso-lv4460170, and eso-lv 5140100 are consistent with previousfindings for bulges of spiral galaxies. on the contrary, the bulge of eso-lv4500200 shows peculiar chemical properties possibly due to the presence of acentral kinematically-decoupled component. the negative metallicity gradientfound in our bulges sample indicates a relevant role for the dissipativecollapse in bulge formation. however, the shallow gradients found for the ageand {\alpha}/fe ratio suggests that merging can not be completely ruled out forthe sample bulges. this is confirmed by the properties of eso-lv 4500200 whichcan hardly be explained without invoking the capture of external material.

1506.03076	fossil group origins v. the dependence of the luminosity function on the  magnitude gap	in nature we observe galaxy aggregations that span a wide range of magnitudegaps between the two first-ranked galaxies of a system ($\delta m_{12}$). thereare systems with gaps close to zero (e.g., the coma cluster), and at the otherextreme of the distribution, the largest gaps are found among the so-calledfossil systems. fossil and non-fossil systems could have different galaxypopulations that should be reflected in their luminosity functions. in thiswork we study, for the first time, the dependence of the luminosity functionparameters on $\delta m_{12}$ using data obtained by the fossil group origins(fogo) project. we constructed a hybrid luminosity function for 102 groups andclusters at $z \le 0.25$. we stacked all the individual luminosity functions,dividing them into bins of $\delta m_{12}$, and studied their best-fitschechter parameters. we additionally computed a relative luminosity function,expressed as a function of the central galaxy luminosity, which boosts ourcapacity to detect differences, especially at the bright end. we find trends asa function of $\delta m_{12}$ at both the bright and faint ends of theluminosity function. in particular, at the bright end, the larger the magnitudegap, the fainter the characteristic magnitude $m^\ast$. we also finddifferences at the faint end. in this region, the larger the gap, the flatterthe faint-end slope $\alpha$. the differences found at the bright end support adissipationless, dynamical friction-driven merging model for the growth of thecentral galaxy in group- and cluster-sized halos. the differences in the faintend cannot be explained by this mechanism. other processes, such as enhancedtidal disruption due to early infall and/or prevalence of eccentric orbits, mayplay a role. however, a larger sample of systems with $\delta m_{12} &gt; 1.5$ isneeded to establish the differences at the faint end.

1506.05315	study of the stellar population properties in the discs of ten spiral  galaxies	we investigated the properties of the stellar populations in the discs of asample of ten spiral galaxies. our analysis focused on the galaxy region wherethe disc contributes more than 95 per cent of total surface brightness in orderto minimise the contamination of the bulge and bar. the luminosity-weighted ageand metallicity were obtained by fitting the galaxy spectra with a linearcombination of stellar population synthesis models, while the totaloverabundance of {\alpha}-elements over iron was derived by measuring theline-strength indices. most of the sample discs display a bimodal agedistribution and they are characterised by a total [{\alpha}/fe] enhancementranging from solar and supersolar. we interpreted the age bimodality as due tothe simultaneous presence of both a young (age$\,\leq\,4$ gyr) and an old(age$\,&gt;\,$4 gyr) stellar population. the old stellar component usuallydominates the disc surface brightness and its light contribution is almostconstant within the observed radial range. for this reason, no age gradient isobserved in half of the sample galaxies. the old component is slightly moremetal poor than the young one. the metallicity gradient is negative andslightly positive in the old and young components, respectively. these resultsare in agreement with an inside-out scenario of disc formation and suggest areduced impact of the radial migration on the stellar populations of the disc.the young component could be the result of a second burst of star formation ingas captured from the environment.

1511.02854	fossil group origins vii. galaxy substructures in fossil systems	fossil groups are expected to be the final product of galaxy merging withingalaxy groups. in simulations, they are predicted to assemble their mass athigh redshift. this early formation allows for the innermost $m^\ast$ galaxiesto merge into a massive central galaxy. then, they are expected to maintaintheir fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scalestructure. in this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightestgalaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status.as a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamicallyrelaxed. in order to examine the dynamical status of these systems, wesystematically analyze, for the first time, the presence of galaxysubstructures in a sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossil systems withredshift $z \le 0.25$. we apply a number of tests in order to investigate thesubstructure in fossil systems in the two-dimensional space of projectedpositions out to $r_{200}$. moreover, for a subsample of 5 systems with atleast 30 spectroscopically-confirmed members we also analyze the substructurein the velocity and in the three-dimensional velocity-position spaces.additionally, we look for signs of recent mergers in the regions around thecentral galaxies. we find that an important fraction of fossil systems showsubstructure. the fraction depends critically on the adopted test, since eachtest is more sensible to a particular type of substructure. our interpretationof the results is that fossil systems are not, in general, as relaxed asexpected from simulations. our sample of 12 spectroscopically-confirmed fossilsystems need to be extended in order to compute an accurate fraction, but ourconclusion is that it is similar to the fraction of substructure detected innon-fossil clusters. this abstract is truncated.

(i) ngc 4984, ngc 7213,and ngc 7377 show an overall velocity curve along the minor axis withoutzero-velocity points, out to the last measured radius, which is interpreted asdue to the warped structure of the gaseous disk. (ii) ngc 3885, ngc 4224, andngc 4586 are characterized by a velocity gradient along both major and minoraxis, although non-zero velocities along the minor axis are confined to thecentral regions. such gas kinematics have been explained as being due tonon-circular motions induced by a triaxial potential. (iii) ngc 2855 and ngc7049 show a change of slope of the velocity gradient measured along the majoraxis (which is shallower in the center and steeper away from the nucleus), aswell as non-zero gas velocities in the central regions of the minor axis. thishas been attributed to the presence of a kinematically-decoupled gaseouscomponent in orthogonal rotation with respect to the galaxy disk, namely aninner polar disk. the case and origin of inner polar disks are discussed andthe list of their host galaxies is presented.

0808.3573	early-type galaxies in the near-infrared: 1.5-2.4\mum spectroscopy	near-infrared (hereafter nir) data may provide complementary information tothe traditional optical population synthesis analysis of unresolved stellarpopulations because the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies in the1-2.5\mum range is dominated by different types of stars than at opticalwavelengths. furthermore, nir data are subjected to less absorption and hencecould constrain the stellar populations in dust-obscured galaxies. we want todevelop observational constraints on the stellar populations of unresolvedstellar systems in the nir. to achieve this goal we need a benchmark sample ofnir spectra of ``simple'' early-type galaxies, to be used for testing andcalibrating the outputs of population synthesis models. we obtainedlow-resolution (r~1000) long-slit spectra between 1.5 and 2.4\mum for 14 nearbyearly-type galaxies using sofi at ntt and higher resolution (r~3000) long-slitspectra, centered at the mgi at ~1.51\mum for a heterogeneous sample of 5nearby galaxies observed with isaac at vlt. we defined spectral indices for co,nai, cai and mgi features and measured the strengths of these features in thesample galaxies. we defined a new global nir metallicity index, suitable forabundance measurements in low-resolution spectra. finally, we present anaverage nir spectrum of an early-type galaxy, built from a homogenized subsetof our sample. the nir spectra of the sample galaxies show great similarity andthe strength of some features does correlate with the iron abundance [fe/h] andoptical metal features of the galaxies. the data suggest that the nir metalfeatures, in combination with a hydrogen absorption feature may be able tobreak the age-metallicity degeneracy just like the mg and fe features in theoptical wavelength range.

astro-ph;0404558	ionized gas and stellar kinematics of seventeen nearby spiral galaxies	ionized gas and stellar kinematics have been measured along the major axes ofseventeen nearby spiral galaxies of intermediate to late morphological type. wediscuss the properties of each sample galaxy distinguishing between thosecharacterized by regular or peculiar kinematics. in most of the observedgalaxies ionized gas rotates more rapidly than stars and have a lower velocitydispersion, as is to be expected if the gas is confined in the disc andsupported by rotation while the stars are mostly supported by dynamicalpressure. in a few objects, gas and stars show almost the same rotationalvelocity and low velocity dispersion, suggesting that their motion is dominatedby rotation.  incorporating the spiral galaxies studied by bertola et al. (1996), corsiniet al. (1999, 2003) and vega beltran et al. (2001) we have compiled a sample of50 s0/a-scd galaxies, for which the major-axis kinematics of the ionized gasand stars have been obtained with the same spatial (~1'') and spectral(~50km/s) resolution, and measured with the same analysis techniques. thisallowed us to address the frequency of counterrotation in spiral galaxies. itturns out that less than 12% and less than 8% (at the 95% confidence level) ofthe sample galaxies host a counterrotating gaseous and stellar disc,respectively. the comparison with s0 galaxies suggests that the retrogradeacquisition of small amounts of external gas gives rise to counterrotatinggaseous discs only in gas-poor s0s, while in gas-rich spirals the newlyacquired gas is swept away by the pre-existing gas. counterrotating gaseous andstellar discs in spirals are formed only from the retrograde acquisition oflarge amounts of gas exceeding that of pre-existing gas, and subsequent starformation, respectively.

astro-ph;0503649	on the relation between circular velocity and central velocity  dispersion in high and low surface brightness galaxies	in order to investigate the correlation between the circular velocity vc andthe central velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component sigma_c, weanalyzed these quantities for a sample of 40 high surface brightness discgalaxies (hereafter hsb), 8 giant low surface brightness spiral galaxies(hereafter lsb), and 24 elliptical galaxies characterized by flat rotationcurves. we find that the vc-sigma_c relation is descri ed by a linear law outto velocity dispersions as low as sigma_c~50km/s, while in previous works apower law was adopted for galaxies with sigma_c&gt;80k/ms.  elliptical galaxies with vc based on dynamical models or directly derivedfrom the hi rotation curves follow the same relation as the hsb galaxies in thevc-sigma_c plane. on the contrary, the lsb galaxies follow a differentrelation, since most of them show either higher vc (or lower sigma_c) withrespect to the hsb galaxies. this argues against the relevance of baryoncollapse in the radial density profile of the dark matter haloes of lsbgalaxies.

astro-ph;0504466	regularized orbit models unveiling the stellar structure and dark matter  halo of the coma elliptical ngc 4807	this is the second in a series of papers dedicated to unveil the massstructure and orbital content of a sample of flattened early-type galaxies inthe coma cluster. the ability of our orbit libraries to reconstruct internalstellar motions and the mass composition of a typical elliptical in the sampleis investigated by means of monte-carlo simulations of isotropic rotatormodels. the simulations allow a determination of the optimal amount ofregularization needed in the orbit superpositions. it is shown that underrealistic observational conditions and with the appropriate regularizationinternal velocity moments can be reconstructed to an accuracy of about 15 percent; the same accuracy can be achieved for the circular velocity and darkmatter fraction. in contrast, the flattening of the halo remains unconstrained.regularized orbit superpositions are applied to a first galaxy in our sample,ngc 4807, for which stellar kinematical observations extend to 3 reff. thegalaxy seems dark matter dominated outside 2 reff. logarithmic dark matterpotentials are consistent with the data, as well as nfw-profiles, mimickinglogarithmic potentials over the observationally sampled radial range. in bothcases, the derived stellar mass-to-light ratio agrees well with independentlyobtained mass-to-light ratios from stellar population analysis. kinematically,ngc 4807 is characterized by mild radial anisotropy outside r&gt;0.5 reff,becoming isotropic towards the center. our orbit models hint at either adistinct stellar component or weak triaxiality in the outer parts of thegalaxy.

0809.0766	the high-mass end of the black hole mass function: mass estimates in  brightest cluster galaxies	we present hubble space telescope imaging and spectroscopic observations ofthree brightest cluster galaxies, abell 1836-bcg, abell 2052-bcg, and abell3565-bcg, obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2, the advancedcamera for surveys and the space telescope imaging spectrograph. the dataprovide detailed information on the structure and mass profile of the stellarcomponent, the dust optical depth, and the spatial distribution and kinematicsof the ionized gas within the innermost region of each galaxy. dynamicalmodels, which account for the observed stellar mass profile and include thecontribution of a central supermassive black hole (sbh), are constructed toreproduce the kinematics derived from the halpha and [n ii](lambda 6548,6583)emission lines. secure sbh detection with m_bh=3.61(+0.41,-0.50)x10^9 m_sun andm_bh=1.34(+0.21,-0.19)x10^9 m_sun, respectively, are obtained for abell1836-bcg and abell 3565-bcg, which show regular rotation curves and strongcentral velocity gradients. in the case of abell 2052-bcg, the lack of anorderly rotational motion prevents a secure determination, although an upperlimit of m_bh &lt; 4.60x10^9 m_sun can be placed on the mass of the central sbh.these measurements represent an important step forward in the characterizationof the high-mass end of the sbh mass function.

astro-ph;0510034	ngc 7679: an anomalous, composite seyfert 1 galaxy whose, x-ray luminous  agn vanishes at optical wavelengths	morphological disturbances and gas kinematics of the sb0 galaxy ngc 7679=arp216 are investigated to get clues to the history of this highly compositeobject, where agn and starburst signatures dominate each other in the x-ray andoptical/ir regime, respectively. perturbations of the ionized gas velocityfield appear quite mild within 15'' (~5 kpc) from the center, so as it can bestraightforwardly modeled as a circularly rotating disk. on the contrary,outside that radius, significant disturbances show up. in particular, theeastern distorted arm as well as the huge neutral hydrogen bridge connectingngc 7679 with the nearby seyfert spiral ngc 7682 unambiguously represent thevestige of a close encounter of the two objects dating back ~500 myr ago. therelationship of such past event with the much more recent, centrally locatedstarburst (not older than 20 myr) cannot be easily established. altogether, theclassification of ngc 7679, turns out to be less extreme than that proposed inthe past, being simply a (disturbed) galaxy where starburst and agn activitycohexist with a starburst dominating the bolometric luminosity.

astro-ph;0512640	the relation between circular velocity and central velocity dispersion  in low surface brightness galaxies	we analyzed a sample of high and low surface brightness (hsb and lsb) discgalaxies and elliptical galaxies to investigate the correlation between thecircular velocity (vc) and the central velocity dispersion (sigma). we betterdefined the previous vc-sigma correlation for hsb and elliptical galaxies,especially at the lower end of the sigma values. elliptical galaxies with vcbased on dynamical models or directly derived from the hi rotation curvesfollow the same relation as the hsb galaxies in the v-sigma plane. on thecontrary, the lsb galaxies follow a different relation, since most of them showeither higher vc (or lower sigma) with respect to the hsb galaxies. this arguesagainst the relevance of baryon collapse in the radial density profile of thedark matter haloes of lsb galaxies. moreover, if the vc-sigma relation isequivalent to one between the mass of the dark matter halo and that of thesupermassive black hole, these results suggest that the lsb galaxies host asupermassive black hole with a smaller mass compared to hsb galaxies of equaldark matter halo. on the other hand, if the fundamental correlation of smbhmass is with the halo vc, then lsbs should have larger black hole masses forgiven bulge sigma.

astro-ph;0611426	ngc5719/13: interacting spirals forming a counter-rotating stellar disc	(context) when a galaxy acquires material from the outside, it is likely thatthe resulting angular momentum of the accreted material is decoupled from thatof the pre-existing galaxy. the presence of stars counter-rotating with respectto other stars and/or gas represents an extreme case of decoupling. (aims)ngc5719, an almost edge-on sab galaxy with a prominent skewed dust lane, showsa spectacular on-going interaction with its face-on sbc companion ngc5713.observations of such interacting systems provide insight into the processes atwork in assembling and reshaping galaxies. (methods) studies were made of thedistribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen in the ngc5719/13 galaxy pairand the ionised gas and stellar kinematics along the major axis of ngc5719.(results) two hi tidal bridges that loop around ngc5719 and connect to ngc5713,and two hi tidal tails departing westward from ngc5713 were detected. there isa correspondence between the hi condensations and the location of clumps ofyoung stars within and outside the disc of ngc5719. the low-mass satellitepgc135857 at the tip of the northern tail was detected in hi, and is likely aby-product of the interaction. the neutral and ionised hydrogen in the disc ofngc5719 are counter-rotating with respect to the main stellar disc. thecounter-rotating stellar disc contains about 20% of the stars in the system,and has the same radial extension as the main stellar disc. this is the firstinteracting system in which a counter-rotating stellar disc has been detected.(conclusions) the data support a scenario where hi from the large reservoiravailable in the galaxy's surroundings was accreted by ngc5719 onto aretrograde orbit and subsequently fuelled the in-situ formation of thecounter-rotating stellar disc.

astro-ph;9802309	mixed early and late-type properties in the bar of ngc 6221: evidence  for evolution along the hubble sequence?	rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles are presented for both thestellar and gaseous components along five different position angles (p.a.=5,50, 95, 125 and 155 degrees) of the nearby barred spiral ngc 6221. the observedkinematics extends out to about 80" from the nucleus. narrow and broad-bandimaging is also presented. the radial profiles of the fluxes ratio [nii]/halphareveal the presence of a ring-like structure of ionized gas, with a radius ofabout 9" and a deprojected circular velocity of about 280 km/s. the analysis ofthe dynamics of the bar indicates this ring is related to the presence of aninner lindblad resonance (ilr) at 1.3 kpc. ngc6221 is found to exhibitintermediate properties between those of the early-type barred galaxies: thepresence of a gaseous ring at an ilr, the bar edge located between the ilr'sand the corotation radius beyond the steep rising portion of the rotationcurve, the dust-lane pattern, and those of the late-type galaxies: an almostexponential surface brightness profile, the presence of halpha regions alongall the bar, the spiral-arm pattern. it is consistent with scenarios ofbar-induced evolution from later to earlier-type galaxies.

astro-ph;9802314	counterrotation in galaxies	the phenomenon of counterrotation is observed when two galaxy components havetheir angular momenta projected antiparallel onto the sky. it follows that ifthe two components rotate around the same axis, the counterrotation isintrinsic. on the contrary the counterrotation is only apparent if the rotationaxes are misaligned and the line-of-sight lies in between the two vectors ortheir antivectors. in the case of intrinsic counterrotation the two componentscan be superimposed or radially separated. as far as the two components areconcerned, stars are observed to counterrotate with respect to other stars orgas. the counterrotation of gas versus gas has been also detected. up to now,the number of galaxies exhibiting these phenomena are $\sim60$, themorphological type of which ranges from ellipticals to s0's and to spirals.  when a second event occurs in a galaxy, such as the acquisition of materialfrom outside, it is likely that the resulting angular momentum of the acquiredmaterial is decoupled from the angular momentum of the preexisting galaxy.counterrotation is therefore a general signature of material acquired fromoutside the main confines of the galaxy. good examples of such cases areellipticals with a dust lane or gaseous disk along the minor axis and polarring galaxies, where the angular momenta are perpendicular. it should be notedthat recently attempts have been made to explain special cases of stars versusstars counterrotation in disk galaxies as due to a self induced phenomenon innon-axisymmetric potentials. we discuss the phenomenon according to themorphological type and to the kind of counterrotation.

astro-ph;9903216	the kinematics and the origin of ionized gas in ngc 4036	we present the kinematics and photometry of the stars and of the ionized gasnear the centre of the s0 galaxy ngc4036. dynamical models based on the jeansequation have been constructed from the stellar data to determine thegravitational potential in which the ionized gas is expected to orbit. inside10'', the observed gas rotation curve falls well short of the predictedcircular velocity. over a comparable radial region the observed gas velocitydispersion is far higher than the one expected from thermal motions or smallscale turbulence, corroborating that the gas cannot be following thestreamlines of nearly closed orbits. we explore several avenues to understandthe dynamical state of the gas: (1) we treat the gas as a collisionlessensemble of cloudlets and apply the jeans equation to it; this modeling showsthat inside 4'' the gas velocity dispersion is just high enough to explainquantitatively the absence of rotation. (2) alternatively, we explore whetherthe gas may arise from the `just shed' mass-loss envelopes of the bulge stars,in which case their kinematics should simply mimic that of the stars. he latterapproach matches the data better than (1), but still fails to explain the lowvelocity dispersion and slow rotation velocity of the gas for 5''&lt;r&lt;10''. (3)finally, we explore, whether drag forces on the ionized gas may aid inexplaining its peculiar kinematics. while all these approaches provide a muchbetter description of the data than cold gas on closed orbits, we do not yethave a definitive model to describe the observed gas kinematics at all radii.

0809.3906	dark matter scaling relations and the assembly epoch of coma early-type  galaxies	axisymmetric, orbit-based dynamical models are used to derive dark matterscaling relations for coma early-type galaxies. from faint to bright galaxieshalo core-radii and asymptotic circular velocities increase. compared tospirals of the same brightness, the majority of coma early-types -- those withold stellar populations -- have similar halo core-radii but more than 2 timeslarger asymptotic halo velocities. the average dark matter density inside 2reff decreases with increasing luminosity and is 6.8 times larger than in diskgalaxies of the same b-band luminosity. compared at the same stellar mass, darkmatter densities in ellipticals are 13.5 times higher than in spirals.different baryon concentrations in ellipticals and spirals cannot explain thehigher dark matter density in ellipticals. instead, the assembly redshift (1+z)of coma early-type halos is likely about two times larger than of comparablybright spirals. assuming that local spirals typically assemble at a redshift ofone, the majority of bright coma early-type galaxy halos must have formedaround z = 2-3. for about half of our coma galaxies the assembly redshiftsmatch with constraints derived from stellar populations. we find dark matterdensities and estimated assembly redshifts of our observed coma galaxies inreasonable agreement with recent semi-analytic galaxy formation models.

astro-ph;9906349	correlation between kinematics and hubble sequence in disk galaxies?	we present a comparison between ionized gas and stellar kinematics for asample of 5 early-to-intermediate disc galaxies. we measured the major axis vand sigma radial profiles for both gas and stars, and the h3 and h4 radialprofiles of the stars. we also derived from the r-band surface photometry ofeach galaxy the light contribution of their bulges and discs.  in order to investigate the differences between the velocity fields of thesample galaxies we adopted the self-consistent dynamical model by pignatelli &amp;galletta (1999), which takes into account the asymmetric drift effects, theprojection effects along the line-of-sight and the non-gaussian shape of theline profiles due to the presence of different components with distinctdynamical behavior. we find for the stellar component a sizeable asymmetricdrift effect in the inner regions of all the sample galaxies, as it results bycomparing their stellar rotation curves with the circular velocity predicted bythe models.  the galaxy sample is not wide enough to draw general conclusions. however, wehave found a possible correlation between the presence of slowly-rising gasrotation curves and the ratio of the bulge/disc half luminosity radii, whilethere is no obvious correlation with the key parameter represented by themorphological classification, namely the bulge/disc luminosity ratio. systemswith a diffuse dynamically hot component (bulge or lens) with a scale lengthcomparable to that of the disc are characterized by slowly-rising gas rotationcurves. on the other hand, in systems with a small bulge the gas follows almostcircular motions, regardless of the luminosity of the bulge itself.

0809.5103	upper limits on the masses of 105 supermassive black holes from hubble  space telescope/space telescope imaging spectrograph archival data	based on the modeling of the central emission-line width measured oversub-arcsecond apertures with the hubble space telescope, we present stringentupper bounds on the mass of the central supermassive black hole, mbh, for asample of 105 nearby galaxies (d&lt;100mpc) spanning a wide range of hubble types(e-sc) and values of the central stellar velocity dispersion, sigma(58-419km/s). for the vast majority of the objects the derived mbh upper limitsrun parallel and above the well-known mbh-sigma relation independently of thegalaxy distance, suggesting that our nebular line-width measurements tracerather well the nuclear gravitational potential. for values of sigma between 90and 220km/s the 68% of our upper limits falls immediately above the mbh-sigmarelation without exceeding the expected mbh values by more than a factor 4.1.no systematic trends or offsets are observed in this sigma range as a functionof the galaxy hubble type or with respect to the presence of a bar. for 6 ofour 12 mbh upper limits with sigma&lt;90km/s our line-width measurements are moresensitive to the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential, eitherdue to the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster or because of a greaterdistance compared to the other galaxies at the low-sigma end of the mbh-sigmarelation. conversely, our mbh upper bounds appear to lie closer to the expectedmbh in the most massive elliptical galaxies with values of sigma above 220km/s.such a flattening of the mbh-sigma relation at its high-sigma end would appearconsistent with a coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies drivenby dry mergers, although better and more consistent measurements for sigma andk-band luminosity are needed for these kind of objects before systematiceffects can be ruled out.

0811.2130	the flattening and the orbital structure of early-type galaxies and  collisionless n-body binary disk mergers	we use oblate axisymmetric dynamical models including dark halos to determinethe orbital structure of intermediate mass to massive coma early-type galaxies.we find a large variety of orbital compositions. averaged over all samplegalaxies the unordered stellar kinetic energy in the azimuthal and the radialdirection are of the same order, but they can differ by up to 40 percent inindividual systems. in contrast, both for rotating and non-rotating galaxiesthe vertical kinetic energy is on average smaller than in the other twodirections. this implies that even most of the rotating ellipticals areflattened by an anisotropy in the stellar velocity dispersions. usingthree-integral axisymmetric toy models we show that flattening by stellaranisotropy maximises the entropy for a given density distribution.collisionless disk merger remnants are radially anisotropic. the apparent lackof strong radial anisotropy in observed early-type galaxies implies that theymay not have formed from mergers of disks unless the influence of dissipationalprocesses was significant.

0812.1494	could the fermi-lat detect gamma-rays from dark matter annihilation in  the dwarf galaxies of the local group?	the detection of gamma-rays from dark matter (dm) annihilation is among thescientific goals of the fermi large area telescope (formerly known as glast)and cherenkov telescopes. in this paper we investigate the existence ofrealistic chances of such a discovery selecting some nearby dwarf spheroidalgalaxies (dsph) as a target. we study the detectability with the fermi-lat ofthe gamma-ray flux from dm annihilation in draco, ursa minor, carina, andsextans, for which the state-of-art dm density profiles were available. weassume the dm is made of weakly interacting massive particles such as thelightest supersymmetric particle (lsp) and compute the expected gamma-ray fluxfor optimistic choices of the unknown underlying particle physics parameters.we then compute the boost factors due to the presence of dm clumps and of acentral supermassive black hole. finally, we compare our predictions with thefermi-lat sensitivity maps. we find that the dsph galaxies shine above thegalactic smooth halo: e.g., the galactic halo is brighter than the draco dsphonly for angles smaller than 2.3 degrees above the galactic center. we alsofind that the presence of a cusp or a constant density core in the dm massdensity profile does not produce any relevant effect in the gamma-ray flux dueto the fortunate combination of the geometrical acceptance of the fermi-latdetector and the distance of the galaxies and that no significant enhancementis given by the presence of a central black hole or a population ofsub-subhalos. we conclude that, even for the most optimistic scenario ofparticle physics, the gamma-ray flux from dm annihilation in the dsph galaxiesof the lg would be too low to be detected with the fermi-lat.
