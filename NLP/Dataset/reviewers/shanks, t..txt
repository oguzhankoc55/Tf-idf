0902.1098	photometric selection of emission line galaxies, clustering analysis and  a search for the isw effect	we investigate the use of simple colour cuts applied to the sdss opticalimaging to perform photometric selections of emission line galaxies out to z&lt;1.  from colour-cuts using the sdss g, r and i bands, we obtain mean photometricredshifts of z=0.32+-0.08, z=0.44+-0.12 and z=0.65+-0.21. we further calibrateour high redshift selection using spectroscopic observations with the aaomegaspectrograph on the 4m anglo-australian telescope (aat), observing ~50-200galaxy candidates in 4 separate fields. with just 1-hour of integration timeand with seeing of ~1.6", we successfully determined redshifts for ~65% of thetargeted candidates. we calculate the angular correlation functions of thesamples and find correlation lengths of r0=2.64 h-1 mpc, r0=3.62 h-1 mpc andr0=5.88 h-1 mpc for the low, mid and high redshift samples respectively.comparing these results with predicted dark matter clustering, we estimate thebias parameter for each sample to be b=0.70, b=0.92 and b=1.46. we calculatethe 2-point redshift-space correlation function at z~0.6 and find a clusteringamplitude of s0=6.4 h-1 mpc. finally, we use our photometric sample to searchfor the integrated sachs-wolfe signal in the wmap 5yr data. we cross-correlateour three redshift samples with the wmap w, v, q and k bands and find anoverall trend for a positive signal similar to that expected from models.however, the signal in each is relatively weak. combining all three galaxysamples we find a signal of wtg(&lt;100')=0.20+-0.12 microk in the wmap w-band, asignificance of 1.7sigma.

0911.1352	cross-correlating wmap5 with 1.5 million lrgs: a new test for the isw  effect	we present the cross-correlation of the density map of lrgs and thetemperature fluctuation in the cmb as measured by the wmap5 observations. thelrg samples were extracted from imaging data of the sdss based on two previousspectroscopic redshift surveys, the sdss-lrg and the 2slaq surveys at averageredshifts z~0.35 and z~0.55. in addition we have added a higher-redshiftphotometric lrg sample based on the selection of the aaomega lrg redshiftsurvey at z~0.7. the total lrg sample thus comprises 1.5 million galaxies,sampling a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 over ~7600 square degrees of thesky, probing a total cosmic volume of ~5.5 h^{-3} gpc^3. we find that the newlrg sample at z~0.7 shows very little positive evidence for the isw effect.indeed, the cross-correlation is negative out to ~1 deg. the standard lcdmmodel is rejected at ~2-3% significance by the new lrg data. we then performeda new test on the robustness of the lrg isw detections at z~0.35 and 0.55. wemade 8 rotations through 360deg of the cmb maps with respect to the lrg samplesaround the galactic pole. we find that in both cases there are stronger effectsat angles other than zero. this implies that the z~0.35 and 0.55 isw detectionsmay still be subject to systematic errors which combined with the knownsizeable statistical errors may leave these isw detections looking unreliable.we have further made the rotation test on several other samples where iswdetections have been claimed and find that they also show peaks when rotated.we conclude that in the samples we have tested the isw effect may be absent andwe argue that this result may not be in contradiction with previous results.

0912.0511	angular correlation function of 1.5 million lrgs: clustering evolution  and a search for bao	we present the angular correlation function measured from photometric samplescomprising 1,562,800 luminous red galaxies (lrgs). three lrg samples wereextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data, based oncolour-cut selections at redshifts, z ~ 0.35, 0.55 and 0.7 as calibrated by thespectroscopic surveys, sdss-lrg, 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq), and the aaomegalrg survey. the galaxy samples cover ~7600 s.q.deg of the sky, probing a totalcosmic volume of ~5.5 h^-3} gpc^3.  the small and intermediate scale correlation functions generally showsignificant deviations from a single power-law fit with a well-detected breakat ~1 h^-1 mpc, consistent with the transition scale between the 1- and 2-haloterms in halo occupation models. for galaxy separations 1-20 h^-1 mpc and atfixed luminosity, we see virtually no evolution of the clustering with redshiftand the data is consistent with a simple high peaks biasing model where thecomoving lrg space density is constant with z. at fixed z, the lrg clusteringamplitude increases with luminosity in accordance with the simple high peaksmodel, with a typical lrg dark matter halo mass 10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_sol. for r &lt;1 h^-1 mpc, the evolution is slightly faster and the clustering decreasestowards high redshift consistent with a virialised clustering model. however,assuming the hod and lcdm halo merger frameworks, ~2-3 per cent per gyr of thelrgs is required to merge in order to explain the small scales clusteringevolution, consistent with previous results [abridge].

1005.3028	the vlt lbg redshift survey i: clustering and dynamics of ~1000 galaxies  at z~3	we present the initial imaging and spectroscopic data acquired as part of thevlt vimos lyman-break galaxy survey. ubr (or ubvi) imaging covers five 36'x36'fields centred on bright z&gt;3 qsos, allowing ~21,000 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 galaxy candidatesto be selected using the lyman-break technique. we performed spectroscopicfollow-up using vimos, measuring redshifts for 1020 z&gt;2 lbgs and 10 z&gt;2 qsosfrom a total of 19 vimos pointings. from the galaxy spectra, we observe a625+-510 km/s velocity offset between the ism absorption and ly-alpha emissionline redshifts. using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we haveanalysed the galaxy clustering at z~3. in the photometric case, the angularcorrelation function, w(theta), is well fit by a double power-law withclustering scale-length, r_0 = 3.19+0.32-0.54 mpc/h for r &lt; 1 mpc/h and r_0 =4.59+0.31-0.33 mpc/h at larger scales. using the redshift sample we estimatethe semi-projected correlation function, w_p(sigma) and find r_0 =3.67+0.23-0.24 mpc/h for the vlt sample and r_0 = 3.98+0.14-0.15 mpc/h for acombined vlt+keck sample. from the z-space correlation functions and assumingthe above xi(r) models, we find that the combined vlt and keck surveys requirea galaxy velocity dispersion, &lt;w_z^2&gt;^1/2 ~ 700 km/s, higher than the ~400 km/sfound by previous authors. we also measure a value for the gravitational growthrate parameter of beta(z=3) = 0.48+-0.17, implying a low value for the bias ofb = 2.06+1.1-0.5. this value is consistent with the galaxy clustering amplitudewhich gives b = 2.22+-0.16, assuming the standard cosmology, implying that theevolution of the gravitational growth rate is also consistent with einsteingravity. we have compared our lbg clustering amplitudes with lower redshiftmeasurements and find that the clustering strength is not inconsistent withthat of low-redshift l* spirals for simple 'long-lived' galaxy models.

1006.4385	vlt lbg redshift survey ii: interactions between galaxies and the igm at  z ~3	we have measured redshifts for 243 z ~3 quasars in nine vlt vimos lbgredshift survey areas, each of which is centred on a known bright quasar. usingspectra of these quasars, we measure the cross-correlation between neutralhydrogen gas causing the lya forest and 1020 lyman-break galaxies at z ~3. wefind an increase in neutral hydrogen absorption within 5 h^-1 mpc of a galaxyin agreement with the results of adelberger et al. (2003, 2005). the lya-lbgcross-correlation can be described by a power-law on scales larger than 3 h^-1mpc. when galaxy velocity dispersions are taken into account our results atsmaller scales (&lt;2 h^-1 mpc) are also in good agreement with the results ofadelberger et al. (2005). there is little immediate indication of a region witha transmission spike above the mean igm value which might indicate the presenceof star-formation feedback. to measure the galaxy velocity dispersions, whichinclude both intrinsic lbg velocity dispersion and redshift errors, we haveused the lbg-lbg redshift space distortion measurements of bielby et al.(2010). we find that the redshift-space transmission spike implied in theresults of adelberger et al. (2003) is too narrow to be physical in thepresence of the likely lbg velocity dispersion and is likely to be astatistical fluke. nevertheless, neither our nor previous data can rule out thepresence of a narrow, real-space transmission spike, given the evidence of theincreased lya absorption surrounding lbgs which can mask the spike's presencewhen convolved with a realistic lbg velocity dispersion. finally, we identify176 civ systems in the quasar spectra and find an lbg-civ correlation strengthon scales of 10 h^-1 mpc consistent with the relation measured at ~mpc scales.

1105.2547	do all qsos have the same black hole mass?	qsos from sdss, 2qz and 2slaq covering an order of magnitude in luminosity atfixed redshift exhibit similar amplitudes of clustering. in addition, qsoclustering evolution at z&gt;0.5 is well fitted by a model that assumes a fixedhost halo mass, implying that qsos may occur in a relatively narrow range ofhalo and bh mass. we argue that the slow evolution of early-type galaxies outto z~1-2 may also provide support for a slow evolution of qso host bh masses.the result would mean that if high-z qsos radiate at eddington rates then low-zsyi must radiate at ~100x less than eddington. we conclude that models whereqsos radiate at l_edd require m_bh and m_halo to be decoupled to circumvent theclustering results. while single bh mass and flickering models fit the z&gt;0.5clustering results, they appear to be rejected by the z~0, m_bh-l relation fromreverberation mapping. we find that the inclusion of z&lt;0.5 qso clustering dataimproves the fit of a long-lived qso model and suggest that the predictions ofa ple model for qso bh masses agree reasonably with uv-bump and reverberationestimates (abridged).

1107.2654	testing the wmap cosmology via planck radio catalogues	the prime evidence underpinning the standard lcdm cosmological model is thecmb power spectrum as observed by wmap and other microwave experiments. butsawangwit &amp; shanks (2010) have recently shown that the wmap cmb power spectrumis highly sensitive to the beam profile of the wmap telescope. here, we use thesource catalogue from the planck early data release to test further the wmapbeam profiles. we confirm that stacked beam profiles at q, v and particularlyat w appear wider than expected when compared to the jupiter beam, normalisedeither directly to the radio source profiles or using planck fluxes. the sameresult is also found based on wmap-cmbfree source catalogues and nvss sources.the accuracy of our beam profile measurements is supported by analysis of cmbsky simulations. however the beam profiles from wmap7 at the w band arenarrower than previously found in wmap5 data and the rejection of the wmap beamis now only at the ~3sigma level. we also find that the wmap source fluxesdemonstrate possible non-linearity with planck fluxes. but includingground-based and planck data for the bright weiland et al (2011) sources maysuggest that the discrepancy is a linear offset rather than a non-linearity.additionally, we find that the stacked sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) decrements of~151 galaxy clusters observed by planck are in agreement with the wmap data. wefind that there is no evidence for a wmap sz deficit as has previously beenreported. in the particular case of coma we find evidence for the presence ofan ~0.1mk downwards cmb fluctuation. we conclude that beam profile systematicscan have significant effects on both the amplitude and position of the acousticpeaks, with potentially important implications for cosmology parameter fitting.

1107.5666	evolution in the clustering strength of radio galaxies	we cross match the nvss and first surveys with three large photometriccatalogues of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) to define radio-loud samples. thesehave median redshifts 0.35, 0.55 and 0.68 and, by matching rest-frame opticaland radio properties, we construct uniform samples across the three surveys.this paper is concerned with the clustering properties of these samples derivedfrom the angular correlation function. the primary aim is to characterise anyevolution in the clustering amplitude of radio galaxies bellow z~0.68.  we find no evidence for evolution in the large-scale (~1-50h^{-1}mpc)clustering amplitude. our radio galaxy autocorrelations are consistent withprevious findings indicating little-to-no evolution in the redshift range 0.68to 0 (~6gyr of time). we also cross correlate radio galaxies with the parentlrg samples to increase the precision of our results and again find no evidencefor evolution. our results are inconsistent with a long-lived model for theclustering evolution that assumes radio sources randomly sample the lrgpopulation. a model where the halo mass is constant with redshift is consistentwith the data. this is similar to qsos that have clustering amplitudesconsistent with a single halo mass at all redshifts. given that the brightestradio sources show stronger evolution in space density compared to fainterradio sources we restrict our samples to include only objects withl&gt;10^{26}w/hz and repeat the analysis. again we find no evidence for evolutionin the comoving correlation amplitude. these radio sources appear to inhabitthe same mass halos as fainter radio galaxies (~9x10^{13}h^{-1}m_\odot). thesehalos are ~twice as massive as those of the general lrg population and ~30times as massive as optical agn/qsos.

1108.3934	submillimetre observations of x-ray active galactic nuclei in the  william herschel deep field	we investigate the contribution made by active galactic nuclei (agn) to thehigh-redshift, luminous, submillimetre (submm) source population using deep (&lt;2 mjy/beam) large apex bolometer camera (laboca) 870 um observations within thewilliam herschel deep field (whdf). this submm data complements previouslyobtained chandra x-ray data of the field, from which agn have been identifiedwith the aid of follow-up optical spectra. from the laboca data, we detect 11submm sources (based on a detection threshold of 3.2 sigma) with estimatedfluxes of &gt; 3 mjy/beam. of the 11 identified submm sources, we find that 2coincide with observed agn and that, based on their hardness ratios, both ofthese agn appear to be heavily obscured. we perform a stacking of the submmdata around the agn, which we group by estimated column density, and find thatonly the obscured (n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^2) agn show significant associated submmemission. these observations support the previous findings of page et al andhill et al that obscured agn preferentially show submm emission. hill et alhave argued that, in this case, the contribution to the observed submm emission(and thus the submm background) from agn heating of the dust in these sourcesmay be higher than previously thought.

1204.3635	the vlt lbg redshift survey - iii. the clustering and dynamics of  lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 3	we present a catalogue of 2135 galaxy redshifts from the vlt lbg redshiftsurvey (vlrs), a spectroscopic survey of z ~ 3 galaxies in wide fields centredon background quasi-stellar objects. we have used deep optical imaging toselect galaxies via the lyman-break technique. spectroscopy of the lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) was then made using the visible multi-object spectrograph(vimos), giving a mean redshift of z=2.79. we analyse the clustering propertiesof the vlrs sample and also of the vlrs sample combined with the smaller areakeck-based survey of steidel et al. from the semiprojected correlationfunction, wp({\sigma}) we find that the results are well fit with a singlepower-law model, with clustering scale lengths of r0=3.46+-0.41 and 3.83+-0.24mpc/h, respectively. we note that the corresponding combined {\xi}(r) slope isflatter than for local galaxies at {\gamma} = 1.5-1.6 rather than {\gamma}=1.8.this flat slope is confirmed by the z-space correlation function, {\xi}(s), andin the range 10&lt;s&lt;100 mpc/h the vlrs shows ~2.5{\sigma} excess over the{\lambda} cold dark matter. this excess may be consistent with recent evidencefor non-gaussianity in clustering results at z~1. we then analyse the lbgz-space distortions using the 2d correlation function, {\xi}({\sigma}, {\pi}),finding for the combined sample a large-scale infall parameter of $\beta$ =0.38+-0.19 and a velocity dispersion of 420km/s. based on our measured {\beta},we are able to determine the gravitational growth rate, finding a value of f(z= 3)=0.99+-0.50 (or f{\sigma}8 = 0.26+-0.13), which is the highest redshiftmeasurement of the growth rate via galaxy clustering and is consistent with{\lambda}cdm. finally, we constrain the mean halo mass for the lbg population,finding that the vlrs and combined sample suggest mean halo masses oflog(mdm/msun) = 11.57+-0.15 and 11.73+-0.07, respectively.

1205.1401	composite reverberation mapping	reverberation mapping offers one of the best techniques for studying theinner regions of qsos. it is based on cross-correlating continuum andemission-line light curves. new time-resolved optical surveys will produce wellsampled light curves for many thousands of qsos. we explore the potential ofstacking samples to produce composite cross-correlations for groups of objectsthat have well sampled continuum light curves, but only a few (~2)emission-line measurements. this technique exploits current and futurewide-field optical monitoring surveys (e.g. pan-starrs, lsst) and themultiplexing capability of multi-object spectrographs (e.g. 2df, hectospec) tosignificantly reduce the observational expense of reverberation mapping, inparticular at high redshift (0.5 to 2.5).  we demonstrate the technique using simulated qso light curves and explore thebiases involved when stacking cross-correlations in some simplified situations.we show that stacked cross correlations have smaller amplitude peaks comparedto well sampled correlation functions as the mean flux of the emission lightcurve is poorly constrained. however, the position of the peak remains intact.we find there can be `kinks' in stacked correlation functions due to differentmeasurements contributing to different parts of the correlation function.  using the pan-starrs medium-deep survey (mds) as a template we show thatcross-correlation lags should be measurable in a sample size of 500 qsos thathave weekly photometric monitoring and two spectroscopic observations. finallywe apply the technique to a small sample (42) of qsos that have light curvesfrom the mds. we find no indication of a peak in the stacked cross-correlation.a larger spectroscopic sample is required to produce robust reverberation lags.

0704.3739	luminous red galaxy clustering at z~0.7 - first results using aaomega	we report on the aat-aaomega lrg pilot observing run to establish thefeasibility of a large spectroscopic survey using the new aaomega instrument.we have selected luminous red galaxies (lrgs) using single epoch sdssriz-photometry to i&lt;20.5 and z&lt;20.2. we have observed in 3 fields including thecosmos field and the combo-17 s11 field, obtaining a sample of ~600 redshiftz&gt;=0.5 lrgs. exposure times varied from 1 - 4 hours to determine the minimumexposure for aaomega to make an essentially complete lrg redshift survey inaverage conditions. we show that lrg redshifts to i&lt;20.5 can measured inapproximately 1.5hr exposures and present comparisons with 2slaq and combo-17(photo-)redshifts. crucially, the riz selection coupled with the 3-4 timesimproved aaomega throughput is shown to extend the lrg mean redshift fromz=0.55 for 2slaq to z=0.681+/- 0.005 for riz-selected lrgs. this extended rangeis vital for maximising the s/n for the detection of the baryon acousticoscillations (baos). furthermore, we show that the amplitude of lrg clusteringis s_0 = 9.9+/-0.7 h^-1 mpc, as high as that seen in the 2slaq lrg survey.consistent results for the real-space amplitude are found from projected andsemi-projected correlation functions. this high clustering amplitude isconsistent with a long-lived population whose bias evolves as predicted by asimple ``high-peaks'' model. we conclude that a redshift survey of 360 000 lrgsover 3000deg^2, with an effective volume some 4 times bigger than previouslyused to detect bao with lrgs, is possible with aaomega in 170 nights.

1304.4598	the vlt lbg redshift survey - iv. gas and galaxies at z ~ 3 in  observations and simulations	we use observations and simulation to study the relationship betweenstar-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium at z~3. the observed galaxysample is based on spectroscopic redshift data from a combination of the vltlbg redshift survey and keck observations in fields centred on bright z&gt;3 qsos,whilst the simulation data is taken from gimic. in the simulation, we find thatthe dominant peculiar velocities are in the form of large-scale coherentmotions of gas and galaxies. gravitational infall of galaxies towards oneanother is also seen. at smaller scales, the peculiar velocities in thesimulation over-predict the difference between the simulated real- and z-spacegalaxy correlation functions. peculiar velocity pairs separated by &lt;1mpc/h havea smaller dispersion and explain the z-space correlation function better. thely{\alpha} auto- and cross-correlation functions in the gimic simulation showinfall smaller than implied by previous work. this reduced infall may be due tothe galaxy wide outflows implemented in the simulation. the main challenge incomparing these simulated results with the observed correlation functions comesfrom the presence of velocity errors for the observed lbgs which dominate at~1mpc/h scales. when these are taken into account, the observed lbg correlationfunction is well matched by a simulated $m_*&gt;10^9m_\odot$ galaxy sample. thesimulated cross-correlation shows similar neutral gas densities around galaxiesas are seen in the observations. the simulated and observed ly{\alpha} z-spaceautocorrelation functions agree well with each other. our overall conclusion isthat gas and galaxy peculiar velocities are towards the low end of expectation.finally, little direct evidence is seen in either simulation or observationsfor high transmission near galaxies due to feedback.

1305.1803	stacked reverberation lags at high redshift	over the past 20years reverberation mapping has proved one of the mostsuccessful techniques for studying the local (&lt;1pc) environment ofsuper-massive black holes that drive active galactic nuclei. key successes ofreverberation mapping have been direct black hole mass estimates, theradius-luminosity relation for the hbeta line and the calibration ofsingle-epoch mass estimators commonly employed up to z~7. however, observingconstraints mean that few studies have been successful at z&gt;0.1, or for themore-luminous quasars that make up the majority of current spectroscopicsamples, or for the rest-frame ultra-violet emission lines available in opticalspectra of z&gt;0.5 objects.  previously we described a technique for stacking cross correlations to obtainreverberation mapping results at high z. here we present the first results froma campaign designed for this purpose. we construct stacked cross-correlationfunctions for the civ and mgii lines and find a clear peak in both. we find thepeak in the mgii correlation is at longer lags than civ consistent withprevious results at low redshift. for the civ sample we are able to bin byluminosity and find evidence for increasing lags for more-luminous objects.this civ radius-luminosity relation is consistent with previous studies butwith a fraction of the observational cost.

0801.1816	qso-lrg 2-point cross-correlation function and redshift-space distorions	we have measured the bias of qsos as a function of qso luminosity at fixedredshift (z&lt;1) by cross-correlating them with lrgs in the same spatial volume,hence breaking the degeneracy between qso luminosity and redshift. we use threeqso samples from 2slaq, 2qz and sdss covering a qso absolute magnitude range,-24.5&lt;m_{b_j}&lt;-21.5, and cross-correlate them with 2slaq (z~0.5) and aaomega(z~0.7) photometric and spectroscopic lrgs in the same redshift ranges. the 2-dand 3-d cross-clustering measurements are generally in good agreement. our(2slaq) qso-lrg clustering amplitude (r_0=6.8_{-0.3}^{+0.1}h^{-1}mpc) asmeasured from the semi-projected cross-correlation function appears similar tothe (2slaq) lrg-lrg auto-correlation amplitude (r_0=7.45\pm0.35h^{-1}mpc) andboth are higher than the (2qz+2slaq) qso-qso amplitude (r_0\simeq5.0h^{-1}mpc).our measurements show remarkably little qso-lrg cross-clustering dependence onqso luminosity. if anything, the results imply that brighter qsos may be lesshighly biased than faint qsos, the opposite direction expected from simple highpeaks biasing models. assuming a standard lcdm model and values for b_{lrg}measured from lrg autocorrelation analyses, we find b_q=1.45\pm0.11 atm_{b_j}\approx-24 and b_q=1.90\pm0.16 at m_{b_j}~-22. we also find consistentresults for the qso bias from a z-space distortion analysis of the qso-lrgcross-clustering at z~0.55. the dynamical infall results give \beta_q=0.55\pm0.10, implying b_q=1.4\pm0.2. thus both the z-space distortion andthe amplitude analyses yield b_q~1.5 at m_{b_j}~-23. the implied dm halo massinhabited by qsos at z~0.55 is \sim10^{13}h^{-1}m_{\sun}, again approximatelyindependent of qso luminosity.

1307.4405	the local hole revealed by galaxy counts and redshifts	the redshifts of ~250000 galaxies are used to study the local hole and itsassociated peculiar velocities. the sample, compiled from 6dfgs and sdssprovides wide sky coverage to a depth of ~300h-1mpc. we have therefore examinedk and r limited galaxy redshift distributions and number counts to map thelocal density field. comparing observed galaxy n(z) distributions tohomogeneous models in three large regions of the high latitude sky, we findevidence for under-densities ranging from ~4-40% in these regions to depths of~150h-1mpc with the deepest under-density being over the southern galactic cap.using the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey we then establish thenormalisation of galaxy counts at fainter magnitudes and thus confirm that theunderdensity over all three fields at k&lt;12.5 is ~15+-3%. finally, we furtheruse redshift catalogues to map peculiar velocities over the same areas usingthe average redshift - magnitude, zbar(m), technique of soneira (1979). afteraccounting for the direct effect of large-scale structure on zbar(m) we canthen search for peculiar velocities. taking all three regions intoconsideration the data reject at the ~4sigma level the idea that we haverecovered the cmb rest frame in the volume probed. there is therefore someconsistent evidence from counts and hubble diagram for a local ~150h-1mpcunderdensity that deeper counts and redshifts in the northern galactic capsuggest may extend to ~300h-1mpc.

1402.5502	a neutrino model fit to the cmb power spectrum	the standard cosmological model, lcdm, provides an excellent fit to cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) data. however, the model has well known problems.for example, the cosmological constant, is fine-tuned to 1 part in 10^100 andthe cold dark matter (cdm) particle is not yet detected in the laboratory.shanks previously investigated a model which assumed neither exotic particlesnor a cosmological constant but instead postulated a low hubble constant (h_0)to allow a baryon density compatible with inflation and zero spatial curvature.however, recent planck results make it more difficult to reconcile such a modelwith cmb power spectra. here we relax the previous assumptions to assess theeffects of assuming three active neutrinos of mass ~5ev. if we assume a lowh_0~45kms^-1mpc^-1 then, compared to the previous purely baryonic model, wefind a significantly improved fit to the first 3 peaks of the planck powerspectrum. nevertheless, the goodness-of-fit is still significantly worse thanfor lcdm and would require appeal to unknown systematic effects for the fitever to be considered acceptable. a further serious problem is that theamplitude of fluctuations is low (sigma_8~0.2) making it difficult to formgalaxies by the present day. this might then require seeds, perhaps from aprimordial magnetic field, to be invoked for galaxy formation. these and otherproblems demonstrate the difficulties faced by models other than lcdm infitting ever more precise cosmological data.

1403.3406	atlas lifts the cup: discovery of a new milky way satellite in crater	we announce the discovery of a new galactic companion found in data from theeso vst atlas survey, and followed up with deep imaging on the 4m williamherschel telescope. the satellite is located in the constellation of crater(the cup) at a distance of $\sim$ 170 kpc. its half-light radius is $r_h=30$ pcand its luminosity is $m_v=-5.5$. the bulk of its stellar population is old andmetal-poor. we would probably have classified the newly discovered satellite asan extended globular cluster were it not for the presence of a handful of blueloop stars and a sparsely populated red clump. the existence of the core heliumburning population implies that star-formation occurred in crater perhaps asrecently as 400 myr ago. no globular cluster has ever accomplished the feat ofprolonging its star-formation by several gyrs. therefore, if our hypothesisthat the blue bright stars in crater are blue loop giants is correct, the newsatellite should be classified as a dwarf galaxy with unusual properties. notethat only ten degrees to the north of crater, two ultra-faint galaxies leo ivand v orbit the galaxy at approximately the same distance. this hints that allthree satellites may once have been closely associated before falling togetherinto the milky way halo.

1502.05432	the vlt survey telescope atlas	the vlt survey telescope (vst) atlas is an optical ugriz survey aiming tocover ~4700deg^2 of the southern sky to similar depths as the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). from reduced images and object catalogues provided by thecambridge astronomical surveys unit we first find that the median seeing rangesfrom 0.8 arcsec fwhm in i to 1.0 arcsec in u, significantly better than the1.2-1.5 arcsec seeing for sdss. the 5 sigma magnitude limit for stellar sourcesis r_ab=22.7 and in all bands these limits are at least as faint as sdss. sdssand atlas are more equivalent for galaxy photometry except in the z band whereatlas has significantly higher throughput. we have improved the original esomagnitude zeropoints by comparing m&lt;16 star magnitudes with apass in gri, alsoextrapolating into u and z, resulting in zeropoints accurate to ~+-0.02 mag. wefinally compare star and galaxy number counts in a 250deg^2 area with sdss andother count data and find good agreement. atlas data products can be retrievedfrom the eso science archive, while support for survey science analyses isprovided by the omegacam science archive (osa), operated by the wide-fieldastronomy unit in edinburgh.

1502.07748	two bright z &gt; 6 quasars from vst atlas and a new method of optical plus  mid-infra-red colour selection	we present the discovery of two z &gt; 6 quasars, selected as i band dropouts inthe vst atlas survey. our first quasar has redshift, z = 6.31 \pm 0.03, z bandmagnitude, z_ab = 19.63 \pm 0.08 and rest frame 1450a absolute magnitude,m_1450 = -27.8 \pm 0.2, making it the joint second most luminous quasar knownat z &gt; 6. the second quasar has z = 6.02 \pm 0.03, z_ab = 19.54 \pm 0.08 andm_1450 = -27.0 \pm 0.1. we also recover a z = 5.86 quasar discovered byvenemans et al. (2015, in prep.). to select our quasars we use a new 3d colourspace, combining the atlas optical colours with mid-infra-red data from thewide-field infrared survey explorer (wise). we use i_ab - z_ab colour toexclude main sequence stars, galaxies and lower redshift quasars, w1 - w2 toexclude l dwarfs and z_ab - w2 to exclude t dwarfs. a restrictive set of colourcuts returns only our three high redshift quasars and no contaminants, albeitwith a sample completeness of ~50%. we discuss how our 3d colour space can beused to reject the majority of contaminants from samples of bright 5.7 &lt; z &lt;6.3 quasars, replacing follow-up near-infra-red photometry, whilst retaininghigh completeness.

1505.05653	counting quasar--radio source pairs to derive the millijansky radio  luminosity function and clustering strength to z=3.5	we apply a cross-correlation technique to infer the $s&gt;3$mjy radio luminosityfunction (rlf) from the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) to $z\sim3.5$. we measure$\sigma$ the over density of radio sources around spectroscopically confirmedquasars. $\sigma$ is related to the space density of radio sources at thedistance of the quasars and the clustering strength between the two samples,hence knowledge of one constrains the other. under simple assumptions we find$\phi\propto (1+z)^{3.7\pm0.7}$ out to $z\sim2$. above this redshift theevolution slows and we constrain the evolution exponent to $&lt;1.01$ ($2\sigma$).this behaviour is almost identical to that found by previous authors for thebright end of the rlf potentially indicating that we are looking at the samepopulation. this suggests that the nvss is dominated by a single population;most likely radio sources associated with high-excitation cold-mode accretion.inversely, by adopting a previously modelled rlf we can constrain theclustering of high-redshift radio sources and find a clustering strengthconsistent with $r_0=15.0\pm 2.5$ mpc up to $z\sim3.5$. this is inconsistentwith quasars at low redshift and some measurements of the clustering of brightfrii sources. this behaviour is more consistent with the clustering of lowerluminosity radio galaxies in the local universe. our results indicate that thehigh-excitation systems dominating our sample are hosted in the most massivegalaxies at all redshifts sampled.

0807.1155	constraining the quasar population with the broad-line width  distribution	we measure the width of the mgii $\lambda2799$ line in quasar spectra fromthe sdss, 2qz and 2slaq surveys and, by invoking an unnormalised virial massestimator, relate the scatter in line width to the scatter in mass in theunderlying black hole population. we find conclusive evidence for a trend suchthat there is less scatter in line width, and hence black hole mass, in moreluminous objects.  however, the most luminous objects in our sample show such a low degree ofscatter in line width that, when combined with measures for the intrinsicscatter in the radius-luminosity relation for the broad-line region in activegalaxies, an inconsistency arises in the virial technique for estimating blackhole masses. this analysis implies that, at least for the most luminousquasars, either there is little-to-no intrinsic scatter in theradius-luminosity relation or the mgii broad emission line region is nottotally dominated by virial velocities.  finally we exploit the measured scatter in line widths to constrain modelsfor the velocity field of the broad-line region. we show that the lack ofscatter in broad line-widths for luminous quasars is inconsistent with a pureplanar/disk-like geometry for the broad-line region...

astro-ph;0001179	a deep rosat survey xv. the average qso spectrum and its evolution	using a sample of 165 x-ray selected qsos from seven deep rosat fields weinvestigate the x-ray spectral properties of an ``average''radio-quiet broadline qso as a function of redshift. the qso stacked spectra, in the observers0.1-2 kev band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.2 apparentlyharden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seenin other qso samples. in contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 kev band show nosignificant variation in spectral index with redshift. this suggests thepresence of a spectral upturn at low energies (&lt;0.5 kev). indeed, while at highredshifts (z&gt;1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to thedata over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a secondcomponent at low energies, a `soft excess'. inclusion of a simple model for thesoft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kt~100 ev), results in a significantimprovement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for allredshift bins. this power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, withthose of nearby agn in the 2-10 kev band, suggesting that the same intrinsicpower-law slope may continue from 10 kev down to below 0.5 kev. we caution thatthere is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent areal physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a largedispersion in spectral indices. regardless of the origin of the soft excess,the average qso spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the x-raybackground: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift qso aresignificantly steeper than the spectrum of the x-ray background extending thespectral paradox into the soft 0.1-2 kev x-ray band.

astro-ph;0002521	distances to cepheid open clusters via optical and k-band imaging	we investigate the reddening and main sequence fitted distances to elevenyoung, galactic open clusters that contain cepheids. each cluster contains oris associated with at least one cepheid variable star. reddening to theclusters is estimated using the u-b:b-v colours of the ob stars and thedistance modulus to the cluster is estimated via b-v:v and v-k:vcolour-magnitude diagrams. by main-sequence fitting we proceed to calibrate thecepheid p-l relation and find m_v=-2.81xlogp-1.33 +/-0.32 andm_k=-3.44xlogp-2.20 +/-0.29 and a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.55+/-0.32in the v-band and 18.47+/-0.29 in the k-band giving an overall distance modulusto the lmc of 18.51+/-0.3.  in the case of two important clusters we find that the u-b:b-v diagram inthese clusters is not well fitted by the standard main sequence line. in onecase, ngc7790, we find that the f stars show a uv excess which if caused bymetallicity would imply fe/h ~ -1.5; this is anomalously low compared to whatis expected for young open clusters. in a second case, ngc6664, the u-b:b-vdiagram shows too red u-b colours for the f stars which in this case wouldimply a higher than solar metallicity. if these effects are due to metallicitythen it would imply that the cepheid pl(v) and pl(k) zeropoints depend onmetallicity according to delta(m)/delta(fe/h) ~0.66 in the sense that lowermetallicity cepheids are intrinsically fainter. medium-high resolutionspectroscopy for the main-sequence f stars in these two clusters is needed todetermine if metallicity really is the cause or whether some other explanationapplies.

astro-ph;0005368	the 2df qso redshift survey - i. the optical qso luminosity function	we present a determination of the optical qso luminosity function and itscosmological evolution with redshift for a sample of over 6000 qsos identifiedprimarily from the first observations of the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz). forqsos with -26 &lt; m_b &lt; -23 and 0.35 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, we find that pure luminosityevolution (ple) models provide an acceptable fit to the observed redshiftdependence of the luminosity function. the luminosity function is best fit by atwo-power-law function of the form. exponential luminosity evolution models,both as a function of look-back time, and as a general second-order polynomialwith redshift, were found to provide acceptable fits to the dataset comprisingthe 2qz and the large bright quasar survey. exponential evolution withlook-back time is prefered for q_0=0.05, while the polynomial evolution modelis prefered for q_0=0.5. the shape and evolution of the lf at low redshifts(z&lt;0.5) and/or high luminosities, not currently well sampled by the 2df qsosurvey, may show departures from pure luminosity evolution, but the resultspresented here show that over a significant range of redshift, ple is a gooddescription of qso evolution.

astro-ph;0007224	galaxy clustering in the herschel deep field	(abridged) we present a study of the angular correlation function as measuredin the william herschel deep field. this field covers 50 arcmin$^2$ and with itwe are able to investigate the scaling of the angular correlation function to$b\sim28$, $r, i\sim 26$,$k\sim20$ and $h\sim22.5$. we compare our measurementsto results obtained from the smaller hubble deep field. to interpret ourresults, we use a model which correctly predicts colours, number counts andredshift distributions for the faint galaxy population. we find that at fixedseparation the amplitude of $\omega(\theta)$ measured in $bri$ bandpasses islower than the predictions of a model containing with no luminosity evolutionand stable clustering growth in proper co-ordinates. however, in thenear-infrared bandpasses, our measurements are consistent with the predictionsof an essentially non-evolving $k-$ selected galaxy redshift distribution. inthe range $b\sim27-28$ we find that our correlation amplitudes are independentof magnitude, which is consistent with the observed flattening of the numbercount slope and correspondingly slower increase of the cosmological volumeelement expected at these magnitudes. our measurements in all bandpasses areconsistent with a rapid growth of galaxy clustering ($0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 2 $ in thenormal parametrisation) on the sub-mpc scales which our survey probes. wedemonstrate that this rapid growth of clustering is consistent with thepredictions of biased models of galaxy formation, which indicate that a rapidrate of clustering growth is expected for the intrinsically faint galaxieswhich dominate our survey.

astro-ph;0009387	the durham/ukst galaxy redshift survey - vii. redshift-space distortions  in the power spectrum	we investigate the effect of redshift-space distortions in the power spectrumparallel and perpendicular to the observer's line of sight, p(k_par,k_perp),using the optically selected durham/ukst galaxy redshift survey. on small,non-linear scales anisotropy in the power-spectrum is dominated by the galaxyvelocity dispersion; the `finger of god' effect. on larger, linear scalescoherent peculiar velocities due to the infall of galaxies into overdenseregions are the main cause of anisotropy. according to gravitationalinstability theory these distortions depend only on the density and biasparameters via beta. geometrical distortions also occur if the wrong cosmologyis assumed, although these would be relatively small given the low redshift ofthe survey. to quantify these effects, we assume the real-space power spectrumof the apm galaxy survey, and fit a simple model for the redshift-space andgeometrical distortions. assuming a flat omega = 1 universe, we find values forthe one-dimensional pairwise velocity dispersion of sigma_p = 410 +- 170 km/s,and beta = 0.38 +- 0.17. an open omega = 0.3, and a flat omega = 0.3, lambda =0.7 universe yield sigma_p = 420 km/s, beta = 0.40, and sigma_p = 440 km/s,beta = 0.45 respectively, with comparable errors. these results are consistentwith estimates using the two-point galaxy correlation function, xi(sigma,pi),and favour either a low-density universe with omega ~ 0.3 if galaxies trace theunderlying mass distribution, or a bias factor of b ~ 2.5 if omega = 1.

astro-ph;0010483	starburst activity in a rosat narrow emission-line galaxy	we present multiwaveband photometric and optical spectropolarimetricobservations of the r=15.9 narrow emission line galaxy r117_a which lies on theedge of the error circle of the rosat x-ray source r117 (from mchardy et al1998). the overall spectral energy distribution of the galaxy is well modelledby a combination of a normal spiral galaxy and a moderate-strength burst ofstar formation. the far infra-red and radio emission is extended along themajor axis of the galaxy, indicating an extended starburst.  on positional grounds, the galaxy is a good candidate for the identificationof r117 and the observed x-ray flux is very close to what would be expectedfrom a starburst of the observed far infra-red and radio fluxes. although anobscured high redshift qso cannot be entirely ruled out as contributing somefraction of the x-ray flux, we find no candidates to k=20.8 within the x-rayerrorbox and so conclude that r117_a is responsible for a large fraction, ifnot all, of the x-ray emission from r117.  searches for indicators of an obscured agn in r117_a have so far provennegative; deep spectropolarimetric observations show no signs of broad lines toa limit of one per cent and, for the observed far infra-red and radio emission,we would expect a ten times greater x-ray flux if the overall emission werepowered by an agn. we therefore conclude that the x-ray emission from r117 isdominated by starburst emission from the galaxy r117_a.

astro-ph;0011400	evidence for galaxy formation at high redshift	we have shown previously that galaxy counts from the uv to the near-ir arewell-fitted by simple evolutionary models where the space density of galaxiesremains constant with look-back time while the star-formation rate risesexponentially. we now extend these results, first by using data from theherschel deep field to show that these same models give detailed fits to thefaint galaxy r-i:b-r colour-colour diagram. we then use these models to predictthe number counts of high redshift galaxies detected by the lyman breaktechnique. at z~3 there is almost exact agreement between ou r prediction andthe data, suggesting that the space density of galaxies at z~3 may be close toits local value. at z~4 the space density of bright galaxies remains unchanged;however, the space density of dwarf galaxies is significantly lower than it islocally, suggesting that we have detected an epoch of dwarf galaxy formation atz~4. finally, significant numbers of lyman-break galaxy candidates are alsodetected at z~6 in the hubble and herschel deep fields; taking this observationtogether with a number of recent detections of spectroscopically confirmed z~6galaxies suggests that the space density of bright galaxies at z~6 remainscomparable to the local space density and thus that the epoch of formation ofbright galaxies may lie at yet higher redshift.

astro-ph;0012375	the 2df qso redshift survey - ii. structure and evolution at high  redshift	we present a clustering analysis of qsos over the redshift range z=0.3-2.9.we use a sample of 10558 qsos taken from the preliminary catalogue of the 2dfqso redshift survey (2qz). the two-point redshift-space correlation function ofqsos is shown to follow a power law on scales s~1-35h-1mpc. fitting a power lawto qso clustering averaged over the redshift interval 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.9 we finds_0=3.99+0.28-0.34h-1mpc and gamma=1.58+0.10-0.09 for an einstein-de sittercosmology (eds). with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 the power law extends tos~60h-1mpc with a best fit of s_0=5.69+0.42-0.50h-1mpc andgamma=1.56+0.10-0.09. these values, measured at a mean redshift of z=1.49, arecomparable to the clustering of local optically selected galaxies. we measurethe evolution of qso clustering as a function of redshift. for an eds cosmologythere is no evolution in comoving coordinates over the redshift range of the2qz. for omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 qso clustering shows a marginal increaseat high redshift. although the clustering of qsos is measured on large scaleswhere linear theory should apply, the evolution of qso clustering does notfollow the linear theory predictions for growth via gravitational instability(rejected at the &gt;99 per cent confidence level). a redshift dependent bias isrequired to reconcile qso clustering observations with theory. a simple biasingmodel, in which qsos have cosmologically long lifetimes (or alternatively formin peaks above a constant threshold in the density field) is acceptable in aneds cosmology, but is only marginally acceptable if omega_0=0.3 andlambda_0=0.7. biasing models which assume qsos form over a range in redshift,based on the press-schechter formalism are approximately consistent with qsoclustering evolution (abridged).

astro-ph;0106012	the 2df qso redshift survey - vi. measuring lambda and beta from  redshift-space distortions in the power spectrum	when the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) is complete, a powerful geometric testfor the cosmological constant will be available. by comparing the clusteringalong and across the line of sight and modelling the effects of peculiarvelocities and bulk motions in redshift space, geometric distortions, whichoccur if the wrong cosmology is assumed, can be detected.  in this paper we investigate the effect of geometric and redshift-spacedistortions in the power spectrum parallel and perpendicular to the observer'sline of sight. ballinger et al. developed a model to estimate the cosmologicalconstant, $\lambda$, and the important parameter $\beta \approx\omega_m^{0.6}/b$ from these distortions. we apply this model to a detailedsimulation of the final 25k 2qz, produced using the virgo consortium's huge{\it hubble volume} n-body $\lambda$-cdm light cone simulation. we confirm theconclusions of ballinger et al.; the shape of the redshift-space and geometricdistortions are very similar. when all the uncertainties are taken into accountwe find that only a joint $\lambda - \beta$ constraint is possible.  by combining this result with a second constraint based on mass clusteringevolution, however, we can make significant progress. we predict that thismethod should allow us to constrain $\beta$ to approximately $\pm0.1$, and$\omega_{m}$ to $\pm0.25$ using the final catalogue. we apply the method to the2qz catalogue of 10000 qsos and find that this incomplete catalogue marginallyfavours a $\lambda$ cosmology.

astro-ph;0107348	the 2df qso redshift survey - vii. constraining cosmology from redshift  space distortions via xi(sigma,pi)	we describe a method from which cosmology may be constrained from the 2qzsurvey. by comparing clustering properties parallel and perpendicular to theline of sight and by modeling the effects of redshift space distortions, we areable to study geometric distortions in the clustering pattern which occur if awrong cosmology is assumed when translating redshifts into comoving distances.  using mock 2qz catalogues, drawn from the hubble volume simulation, we find,that there is a degeneracy between the geometric and the redshift-spacedistortions that makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous estimate ofomega_{m}(0) from the geometric tests alone. however, we demonstrate a newmethod to determine the cosmology which works by combining the above geometrictest with a test based on the evolution of the qso clustering amplitude. wefind that we are able to break the degeneracy and that independent constraintsto +-20% (1 sigma) accuracy on omega_{m}(0) and +-10% (1 sigma) accuracy onbeta_{qso}(z) should be possible in the full 2qz survey.  finally we apply the method to the 10k catalogue of 2qz qsos. the smallernumber of qsos and the current status of the survey mean that a strong resulton cosmology is not possible but we do constrain beta_{qso}(z) to 0.35+-0.2. bycombining this constraint with the further constraint available from theamplitude of qso clustering, we find tentative evidence favouring a model withnon-zero omega_{lambda}(0), although an omega_{m}(0)=1 model provides only amarginally less good fit. a model with omega_{lambda}(0)=1 is ruled out. theresults are in agreement with those found by outram et al. using a similaranalysis in fourier space.

astro-ph;0205036	the 2df qso redshift survey - ix. a measurement of the luminosity  dependence of qso clustering	in this paper we present a clustering analysis of qsos as a function ofluminosity over the redshift range z=0.3-2.9. we use a sample of 10566 qsostaken from the preliminary data release catalogue of the 2df qso redshiftsurvey (2qz). we analyse qso clustering as a function of apparent magnitude.the strong luminosity evolution of qsos means that this is approximatelyequivalent to analysing the data as a function of absolute magnitude relativeto m* over the redshift range that the 2qz probes. over the relatively narrowrange in apparent magnitude of the 2qz we find no significant (&gt;2sigma)variation in the strength of clustering, however, there is marginal evidencefor qsos with brighter apparent magnitudes having a stronger clusteringamplitude. qsos with 18.25&lt;bj&lt;19.80 show a correlation scale lengths_0=5.50+-0.79h-1mpc in an einstein-de sitter (eds) universe ands_0=8.37+-1.17h-1mpc in a universe with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 (lambda),while the best fit values for the full magnitude interval (18.25&lt;bj&lt;20.85) overthe same spatial scales are s_0=4.29+-0.30h-1mpc (eds) and s_0=6.35+-0.45h-1mpc(lambda). we can therefore determine that the bias of the brightest sub-sampleis a factor 1.22+-0.15 (eds) or 1.24+-0.15 (lambda) larger than that of thefull data set. an increase in clustering with luminosity, if confirmed, wouldbe in qualitative agreement with models in which the luminosity of a qso iscorrelated to the mass of the dark halo in which it resides, implying that themass of the host plays at least some part in determining a qso's formation andevolution. these models predict that the clustering in brighter qso data sets,such as sloan digital sky survey qso sample or the bright extension of the 2qzshould show a higher clustering amplitude than the 2qz.

astro-ph;0205039	clustering in the 2df qso redshift survey	we present clustering results from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) whichcurrently contains over 20,000 qsos at z&lt;3. the two-point correlation functionof qsos averaged over the entire survey (&lt;z&gt;~1.5) is found to be similar tothat of local galaxies. when sub-dividing the sample as a function of redshift,we find that for an einstein-de sitter universe qso clustering is constant (incomoving coordinates) over the entire redshift range probed by the 2qz, whilein a universe with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 there is a marginal increase inclustering with redshift. sub-dividing the 2qz on the basis of apparentmagnitude we find only a slight difference between the clustering of qsos ofdifferent apparent brightness, with the brightest qsos having marginallystronger clustering. we have made a first measurement of the redshift spacedistortion of qso clustering, with the goal of determining the value ofcosmological parameters (in partcular lambda_0) from geometric distortions. thecurrent data do not allow us to discriminate between models, however, incombination with constraints from the evolution of mass clustering we findomega_0=1-lambda_0=0.23 +0.44-0.13 and beta(z~1.4)=0.39 +0.18-0.17. the full2qz data set will provide further cosmological constraints.

astro-ph;0207571	the correlation of line strength with luminosity and redshift from  composite qso spectra	we have generated a series of composite qso spectra using over 22000individual low resolution (~8a) qso spectra obtained from the 2df(18.25&lt;bj&lt;20.85) and 6df (16&lt;bj&lt;18.25) qso redshift surveys. the large size ofthe catalogue has enabled us to construct composite spectra in narrow redshift(dz=0.25) and absolute magnitude (dmb=0.5) bins. the median number of qsos ineach composite is ~200, yielding typical s/n of ~100. for a given redshiftinterval, the composite spectra cover a factor of over 25 in luminosity. usingthe composite spectra we have measured the equivalent widths (ews) of the majorbroad and narrow emission lines, and the caii k absorption feature due to thehost galaxy of the agn. assuming a fixed host galaxy spectral energydistribution (sed), the correlation between caii k ew and luminosity implieslgal proportional to lqso**{0.42+-0.05}. we find strong anti-correlations withluminosity for the ews of [oii] and [nev]. these provide hints to the generalfading of the nlr in high luminosity sources which we attribute to the nlrdimensions becoming larger than the host galaxy. if average agn host galaxieshave seds similar to average galaxies, then the observed narrow [oii] emissioncould be solely due to the host galaxy at low luminosities (m_b~-20). wemeasure highly significant baldwin effects for most broad emission lines (civ,ciii], mgii, hbeta, hgamma) and show that they are predominantly due tocorrelations with luminosity, not redshift. we find that the hbeta and hgammabalmer lines show an inverse baldwin effect and are positively correlated withluminosity, unlike the broad uv lines. we postulate that this previouslyunknown effect is due to a luminosity dependent change in the the ratio of diskto non-disk continuum components (abridged).

astro-ph;0211624	the 2df qso redshift survey - x. lensing of background qsos by galaxy  groups	we cross-correlate qsos from the 2df survey with galaxy groups. the galaxysamples are limited to b &lt; 20.5. we use an objective algorithm to detect galaxygroups. a 3sigma anti-correlation is observed between qsos and galaxy groups.this paucity of faint qsos around groups is neither a selection effect nor dueto restrictions on the placement of 2df fibres. by observing the colours ofqsos on the scales of the anti-correlation, we limit dust in galaxy groups,finding a maximum reddening of e(b_j-r) &lt; 0.012 at the 95% level. the smallamount of dust thus inferred is insufficient to cause the anti-correlation,supporting the suggestion by croom &amp; shanks that the signal is due togravitational lensing. the possibility remains that tailored dust models, suchas grey dust, heavy patches of dust or a combination of dust and lensing, couldexplain the anti-correlation. assuming the signal is caused by lensing ratherthan dust, we measure the average velocity dispersion of a singular isothermalsphere that would cause the anti-correlation as around 1150 km/s. simulationsreject 600 km/s at the 5% significance level. we also model foreground lensesas nfw haloes and measure the typical mass within 1.5 mpc/h of the halo centreas m_{1.5} = (1.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^{15} solarmasses/h. regardless of whether weutilise a sis or nfw dark matter profile, our model favours more mass in groupsthan accounted for in a universe with density parameter omega_m = 0.3. detailedsimulations and galaxy group redshifts will significantly reduce the currentsystematic uncertainties in these $\omega_m$ estimates. reducing the remaininguncertainty will require larger qso and galaxy group surveys (abridged).

astro-ph;0302280	the 2df qso redshift survey - xi. the qso power spectrum	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df qso redshift surveycatalogue containing 22652 qsos. utilising the huge volume probed by the qsos,we can accurately measure power out to scales of ~500mpc and derive newconstraints, at z~1.4, on the matter and baryonic contents of the universe.importantly, these new cosmological constraints are derived at an intermediateepoch between the cmb observations at z~1000, and local (z~0) studies oflarge-scale structure; the average qso redshift corresponds to a look-back timeof approximately two-thirds of the age of the universe. we find that theamplitude of clustering of the qsos at z~1.4 is similar to that of present daygalaxies. the power spectra of the qsos at high and low redshift are comparedand we find little evidence for any evolution in the amplitude. assuming alambda cosmology to derive the comoving distances, r(z), to the qsos, the powerspectrum derived can be well described by a model with shape parametergamma=0.13+-0.02. if an einstein-de sitter model r(z) is instead assumed, aslightly higher value of gamma=0.16+-0.03 is obtained. a comparison with thehubble volume lcdm simulation shows very good agreement over the whole range ofscales considered. a standard (omega_m=1) cdm model, however, predicts a muchhigher value of gamma than is observed, and it is difficult to reconcile such amodel with these data. we fit cdm model power spectra (assuming scale-invariantinitial fluctuations), convolved with the survey window function, and correctedfor redshift space distortions, and find that models with baryon oscillationsare slightly preferred, with the baryon fraction omega_b/omega_m=0.18+-0.10.the overall shape of the power spectrum provides a strong constraint onomega_m*h (where h is the hubble parameter), with omega_m*h=0.19+-0.05.

astro-ph;0302331	the local hole in the galaxy distribution: evidence from 2mass	using the bright galaxy counts from the 2 micron all sky survey (2mass)second incremental release, two techniques for probing large-scale structure atdistances of ~150 h-1 mpc are investigated. first, we study the counts from twosets of six 5 degree by ~80 degree strips in the two galactic caps. in the sixsouthern strips a deficit of ~30% was found relative to a predicted homogeneousdistribution at k~11. these strips were also in good agreement with a modelincorporating the radial density function of the southern 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs), which shows a deep underdensity between ~90 and 180 h-1 mpc.these results indicate a very large `local hole' in the southern galactic cap(sgc) to &gt;150 h-1 mpc with a linear size across the sky of ~200 h-1 mpc, butwith a significantly lower mean underdensity of ~30% than that suggested by thebright apm sgc counts. the counts in the northern set of strips are low overallbut indicate a more varied pattern. when all the available 2mass data with|b|&gt;30 were aggregated, they indicated underdensities of ~18% and ~30% at k~11for the northern and southern areas respectively. our second method uses theratio of the counts with 11.38&lt;k&lt;12.38 to 12.88&lt;k&lt;13.38 binned in 25 degreesquared areas; the counts from these areas provide a smoothed map over the skyof the slope in the counts between k=11.38 and 13.38. the resulting map picksout known rich clusters, demonstrating usefulness as a probe of lss atdistances of &lt;150 h-1 mpc. interestingly, the map also shows large regions,\~100 degrees across, of steep counts in both hemispheres. thus, the present2mass data suggest the presence of a potentially huge contiguous voidstretching from south to north, indicating the possible presence of significantpower on scales of &gt;300 h-1 mpc in the galaxy power spectrum.

astro-ph;0304290	ghosts of the milky way: a search for topology in new quasar catalogues	we revisit the possibility that we inhabit a compact multi-connected flat, ornearly-flat, universe. analysis of cobe data has shown that, for such a case,the size of the fundamental domain must be a substantial fraction of thehorizon size. nevertheless, there could be several copies of the universewithin the horizon. if the milky way was once a quasar we might detect its`ghost' images. using new large quasar catalogues we repeat the search byfagundes &amp; wichoski for antipodal quasar pairs. by applying linear theory toaccount for the peculiar velocity of the local group, we are able to narrow thesearch radius to 134 arcsec. we find seven candidate antipodal quasar pairswithin this search radius. however, a similar number would be expected bychance. we argue that, even with larger quasar catalogues, and more accuratevalues of the cosmological parameters, it is unlikely to be possible toidentify putative ghost pairs unambiguously, because of the uncertainty of thecorrection for peculiar motion of the milky way.

astro-ph;0304541	emission line widths and qso black hole mass estimates from the 2df qso  redshift survey	we have used composite spectra generated from more than 22000 qsos observedin the course of the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys to investigate therelationship between the velocity width of emission lines and qso luminosity.we find that the velocity width of the broad emission lines hbeta, hgamma,mgii, ciii] and civ are correlated with the continuum luminosity, with asignificance of more than 99 per cent. of the major narrow emission lines([oiii] 5007, [oii] 3727, neiii 3870 and nev 3426) only [oiii] exhibits asignificant correlation between line width and luminosity. assuming that thegas is moving in keplerian orbits and that the radius of the broad line regionis related to the qso continuum luminosity, we use the velocity widths of thebroad lines to derive average black hole masses for the qsos contributing tothe composite spectra. the resultant qso mass-luminosity relationship isconsistent with m ~ l^0.97+-0.16. we find that the correlation between linewidth and redshift, if present, must be weak, and only civ shows significantevidence of evolution. this enables us to constrain the redshift evolution ofthe black hole mass-luminosity ratio to be ~(1+z)^beta with beta ~&lt; 1, muchless than the ~(1+z)^3 evolution seen in qso luminosity evolution. assumingthat the motion of the broad line region gas is keplerian and that its radiusdepends on the qso luminosity, our models indicate that the observed weakredshift dependence is too small for the observed qso luminosity function to bedue to the evolution of a single long-lived population of sources.

astro-ph;0305278	the xmm-newton/2df survey i: x-ray properties of normal galaxies	this paper explores the x-ray properties of `normal' galaxies using a shallowxmm-newton survey covering an area of ~1.5deg2. the x-ray survey overlaps withthe 2df galaxy redshift survey. compared with previous studies this has theadvantage of high quality spectra and spectral classifications to bj=19.4.moreover, sources with optical spectra revealing powerful agns can easily bediscarded from the normal galaxy sample used here. in particular, we presentstacking analysis results for 200 galaxies from the 2dfgrs at &lt;z&gt;=0.1. wedetect a strong signal for the whole sample (~6sigma) in the soft 0.5-2kev bandcorresponding to a flux of ~7*10^-16cgs and a luminosity of ~2*10^40cgs. astatistically significant signal is also detected for both the early and lategalaxy sub-samples with x-ray luminosities of ~3*10^40 and ~5*10^39cgsrespectively. in contrast, no signal is detected in the hard 2-8kev band forany of the above samples. the mean l_x/l_b ratio of the spiral galaxy sample isconsistent with both local (&lt;100mpc) and distant (z~1) samples suggestinglittle or no evolution of the x-ray emission mechanisms relative to theoptical. the 0.5-2kev xrb contribution of the spiral galaxy sub-sample at z~0.1is estimated to be 0.4% in broad agreement with the xrb fractions estimated inprevious studies.assuming that star-forming galaxies evolve with redshift as(1+z)^{k} the present data combined with previous studies suggest k&lt;3. the kvalues are constrained by the relatively low fraction of the soft x-raybackground that remains unresolved by deep surveys (6-26%). the mean x-rayemissivity of spiral galaxies at z~0.1 is also estimated and is found to beconsistent within the uncertainties with that of local hii galaxy samples.

astro-ph;0306180	evidence for an extended sz effect in wmap data	we have cross-correlated the wmap data with several surveys of extragalacticsources and find evidence for temperature decrements associated with galaxyclusters and groups detected in the apm galaxy survey survey and the acocatalogue. we interpret this as evidence for the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz)effect from the clusters. most interestingly, the signal may extend to ~1 degaround both groups and clusters and we suggest that this may be due to hot`supercluster' gas. we have further cross-correlated the wmap data withclusters identified in the 2mass galaxy catalogue and also find evidence fortemperature decrements there. from the apm group data we estimate the meancompton parameter as y(z&lt;0.2)=7x10^(-7). we have further estimated the gas massassociated with the galaxy group and cluster haloes. assuming temperatures of 5kev for aco clusters and 1 kev for apm groups and clusters, we derive averagegas masses. using the space density of apm groups we then estimate omega_gas.for an sz extent of theta_max=20', kt=1 kev and h=0.7, this value ofomega_gas=0.04 is consistent with the standard value of omega_baryon=0.044 butif the indications we have found for a more extended sz effect out to theta=60'are confirmed, then higher values of omega_gas will be implied. finally, thecontribution to the wmap temperature power spectrum from the extended sz effectaround the z&lt;0.2 apm+aco groups and clusters is 1-2 orders of magnitude lowerthan the l=220 first acoustic peak. but if a similar sz effect arises from moredistant clusters then this contribution could increase by a factor &gt;10 and thencould seriously affect the wmap cosmological fits.

astro-ph;0401409	problems with the current cosmological paradigm	we note that the standard lcdm cosmological model continues to facefundamental problems. first, the model continues to depend wholly on two piecesof undiscovered physics, namely dark energy and cold dark matter. then, theimplied dark energy density is so small that it is unstable to quantumcorrection and its size is fine-tuned to the almost impossible level of onepart in ~10^102; it is also difficult to explain the coincidence between thedark energy, dark matter and baryon densities at the present day. moreover, anymodel with a positive cosmological constant also creates fundamentaldifficulties for superstring theories of quantum gravity. we also review thesignificant number of astrophysical observations which are now in contradictionwith the lcdm model. on the grounds that the snia hubble diagram is prone toevolutionary corrections and also that the cmb power spectrum may becontaminated by the effects of foreground ionised gas, we argue that theexistence of such systematics could still allow more satisfactory, alternative,models to appear. we suggest that if h_0&lt;50kms^-1mpc^-1 then a simpler,inflationary model with omega_baryon=1 might still be allowed with no need fordark energy or cold dark matter.

astro-ph;0408011	the large local hole in the galaxy distribution: the 2mass galaxy  angular power spectrum	we present new evidence for a large deficiency in the local galaxydistribution situated in the 4000 sq.deg. apm survey area. we use models guidedby the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) n(z) as a probe of the underlyinglss. we first check the usefulness of this technique by comparing the 2dfgrsn(z) model prediction with the k-band and b-band number counts extracted fromthe 2mass and 2dfgrs parent catalogues over the 2dfgrs northern and southerndeclination strips, before turning to a comparison with the apm counts. we findthat the apm counts in both the b and k-bands indicate a deficiency in thelocal galaxy distribution of approx. 30% to z=0.1 over the entire apm surveyarea. we examine the implied significance of such a large local hole,considering several possible forms for the real-space correlation function. wefind that such a deficiency in the apm survey area indicates an excess of powerat large scales over what is expected from the correlation function observed inthe 2dfgrs correlation function or predicted from $\lambda$cdm hubble volumemock catalogues. in order to check further the clustering at large scales inthe 2mass data, we have calculated the angular power spectrum for 2massgalaxies. although in the linear regime (l&lt;30), lcdm models can give a good fitto the 2mass angular power spectrum, over a wider range (l&lt;100) the powerspectrum from hubble volume mock catalogues suggests that scale-dependent biasmay be needed for lcdm to fit. however, the modest increase in large-scalepower observed in the 2mass angular power spectrum is still not enough toexplain the local hole.

astro-ph;0411204	2mass constraints on the local large-scale structure: a challenge to  lcdm?	we investigate the large-scale structure of the local galaxy distributionusing the recently completed 2 micron all sky survey (2mass). first, wedetermine the k-band number counts over the 4000 sq.deg. apm survey area whereevidence for a large-scale `local hole' has previously been detected andcompare them to a homogeneous prediction. considering a lcdm form for the2-point angular correlation function, the observed deficiency represents a 5sigma fluctuation in the galaxy distribution. we check the model normalisationusing faint k-band data compiled from the literature; the normalisation used inthis paper is in excellent agreement, and the observed counts over the apmsurvey area would require the model to be lowered by 3.8 sigma. however, theissue is complicated by the b&gt;20 and b&lt;-20 2mass counts which lie below thebest-fit model normalisation. second, since the k-band counts over the apmsurvey area continue to suggest the possible presence of excess clustering overthe lcdm prediction, we next probe the power at large scales by comparing the2mass and lcdm mock galaxy angular power spectra. we find a 3 sigma excess inthe 2mass catalogue over the lcdm prediction at large scales (l&lt;30). however,this excess is not enough to account for the low counts over the apm surveyarea. finally, we apply a counts in cells analysis to the 2mass data and mockcatalogues; on the assumption that the 2mass catalogue at |b|&gt;20 isrepresentative, we find excellent agreement between the biased lcdm mocks andthe 2mass catalogue to 30 deg. the crux of the interpretation of these resultsappears to be whether the 2mass volume is yet big enough to constitute a fairsample of the universe.

astro-ph;0502481	on statistical lensing and the anti-correlation between 2df qsos and  foreground galaxies	we cross-correlate apm and sdss galaxies with background qsos from the 2dfqso redshift survey, and detect a significant (2.8sigma) anti-correlation. thelack of a signal between 2df stars and our galaxy samples suggests theanti-correlation is not due to a systematic error. the possibility that dust inthe foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginallyrejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of qso colours. it ispossible that dust that obscures qsos without reddening them, or preferentiallydiscards reddened qsos from the 2qz sample, could produce such ananti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive qso-galaxycorrelations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. our detection of agalaxy-qso anti-correlation is consistent with statistical lensing theory. whencombined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-qsocorrelation, a consistent, compelling picture emerges that spans faint andbright qso samples showing positive or negative correlations according to theqso n(m) slope. we find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales.we consider two models that use different descriptions of the lensing matterand find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on0.1mpc/h scales of b~0.1 (for lcdm). whilst the slope of our power-law fit tothe qso-galaxy cross-correlation does not rule out linear bias, when we compareour measurement of b on 100 kpc/h scales to independent methods that determineb~1 on mpc/h scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, isscale-dependent. these results indicate more mass, at least on the 100 kpc/hscales probed, than predicted by simple lcdm biasing prescriptions, and canthus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.

astro-ph;0504300	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the z&lt;2.1 quasar luminosity function  from 5645 quasars to g=21.85	we have used the 2df instrument on the aat to obtain redshifts of a sample ofz&lt;3, 18.0&lt;g&lt;21.85 quasars selected from sdss imaging. these data are part of alarger joint programme: the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey (2slaq). we describethe quasar selection algorithm and present the resulting luminosity function of5645 quasars in 105.7 deg^2. the bright end number counts and luminosityfunction agree well with determinations from the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz)data to g\sim20.2. however, at the faint end the 2slaq number counts andluminosity function are steeper than the final 2qz results from croom et al.(2004), but are consistent with the preliminary 2qz results from boyle et al.(2000). using the functional form adopted for the 2qz analysis, we find a faintend slope of beta=-1.78+/-0.03 if we allow all of the parameters to vary andbeta=-1.45+/-0.03 if we allow only the faint end slope and normalization tovary. our maximum likelihood fit to the data yields 32% more quasars than thefinal 2qz parameterization, but is not inconsistent with other g&gt;21 deepsurveys. the 2slaq data exhibit no well defined ``break'' but do clearlyflatten with increasing magnitude. the shape of the quasar luminosity functionderived from 2slaq is in good agreement with that derived from type i quasarsfound in hard x-ray surveys.

astro-ph;0504438	the 2df qso redshift survey - xv. correlation analysis of redshift-space  distortions	we analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of qso clustering in the2df qso redshift survey (2qz). to interpret the z-space correlation function,xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the qso real-space correlationfunction, xi(r). although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projectedcorrelation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat tooshallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),at larger scales &gt; 20 h^(-1) mpc. motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and in standard lcdm predictions, we use adouble power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).the model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1&lt;r&lt;10 h^(-1) mpc andgamma=2.30 for 10&lt;r&lt;40 h^(-1) mpc. as found for 2dfgrs, the value of betadetermined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form ofxi(r) assumed. with our double power-law form for xi(r), we measurebeta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). assuming the same model for xi(r) we thenanalyse the z-space distortions in the 2qz xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints onthe values of omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the methodof hoyle et al. the constraints we derive are omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results atthe ~1 sigma level.

astro-ph;0505469	constraining beta(z) and omega_m from redshift-space distortions in z~3  galaxy surveys	we use sample of 813 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) with 2.6&lt;z&lt;3.4 to perform adetailed analysis of the redshift-space (z-space) distortions in theirclustering pattern and from them derive confidence levels in the[omega_m,beta(z=3)] plane. we model the z-space distortions in the shape of thecorrelation function measured in orthogonal directions, xi(sigma,pi). thismodeling requires an accurate description of the real-space correlationfunction to be given as an input. from the projection of xi(sigma,pi) in theangular direction, w_p(sigma), we derive the best fitting amplitude and slopefor the lbg real-space correlation function: r_0=4.48(+0.17)(-0.18) h(-1) mpcand gamma=1.76(+0.08)(-0.09) (xi(r)= (r/r_0)^-gamma). a comparison between theshape of xi(s) and w_p(sigma) suggests that xi(r) deviates from a simplepower-law model, with a break at ~9 h(-1) mpc. this model is consistent withthe observed projected correlation function. however, due to the limited sizeof the fields used, the w_p(sigma) results are limited to sigma &lt; 10 h(-1) mpc.assuming this double power-law model, and by analysing the shape distortions inxi(sigma,pi), we find the following constraints: beta(z=3) = 0.15(+0.20)(-0.15), omega_m = 0.35 (+0.65)(-0.22). combining these results withorthogonal constraints from linear evolution of density perturbations, we findthat beta(z=3) = 0.25 (+0.05)(-0.06), omega_m = 0.55 (+0.45)(-0.16).

astro-ph;0507215	the 2mass galaxy angular power spectrum: probing the galaxy distribution  to gigaparsec scales	we present an angular power spectrum analysis of the 2mass full releaseextended source catalogue. the main sample used includes 518,576 galaxies belowan extinction-corrected magnitude of k=13.5 and limited to |b|&gt;20. the powerspectrum results provide an estimate of the galaxy density fluctuations atextremely large scales, r&lt;1000 mpc. we compare this with mock predictionsconstructed from the lcdm hubble volume mock catalogue. we find that over therange 1&lt;l&lt;100 the 2mass c_l is steeper than that for the hubble volume model.however, in the linear regime (l&lt;30) there is good agreement between the two.we investigate in detail the effects of possible sources of systematic error.converting linear power spectrum predictions for the form of thethree-dimensional matter power spectrum, p(k), and assuming a flat cdmcosmology, a primordial n_s=1 spectrum and negligible neutrino mass, we performfits to the galaxy angular power spectrum at large linear scales (l&lt;30,corresponding to r&gt;50 mpc). we obtain constraints on the galaxy power spectrumshape of gamma=0.14+/-0.02, in good agreement with previous estimates inferredat smaller scales. we also constrain the galaxy power spectrum normalisation to(sigma_8 b_k)^2=1.36+/-0.10; in combination with previous constraints onsigma_8 we infer a k-band bias of b_k=1.39+/-0.12. we are also able to provideweak constraints on omega_m h and omega_b/omega_m. these results are based onthe usual assumption that the errors derived from the hubble volume mocks areapplicable to all other models. if we instead assume that the error isproportional to the c_l amplitude then the constraints weaken; for example itbecomes more difficult to reject cosmologies with lower gamma.

astro-ph;0507704	high-order 2mass galaxy correlation functions: probing the primordial  density field and the linearity of galaxy bias	we use the 2mass extended source catalogue to determine angular correlationfunctions, w_p, to high orders (p&lt;=9). the main sample contains 650,745galaxies and represents an order of magnitude increase in solid angle overprevious samples used in such analysis. the high-order correlation functionsare used to determine the projected and real space hierarchical amplitudes, s_pand s_p. in contrast to recent results, for p&lt;=6 these parameters are found tobe quite constant over a wide range of scales to r=40 mpc, consistent with agaussian form to the primordial distribution of density fluctuations which hasevolved under the action of gravitational instability. we test the sensitivityof our results to the presence of rare fluctuations in the local galaxydistribution by cutting various regions of over-density from the main sample;unlike previous analyses, we find that our results are relatively robust to theremoval of the largest superclusters. we use our constraints on the k-band s_pparameters in two ways. first, we examine their consistency with non-gaussianinitial conditions; we are able to rule out strong non-gaussianity in theprimordial density field, as might be seeded by topological defects such ascosmic strings or global textures at the 2.5 sigma confidence level. second, weinvestigate the way in which galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution.we find evidence for a non-zero quadratic contribution to the galaxy bias,parameterised by c_2=0.57+/-0.33. this positive result represents a significantdifference from the negative values found previously; we examine a possibleexplanation in the light of recent observations which universally providenegative values for c_2.

astro-ph;0509540	an h-band survey of the herschel deep field	we present h-band infra-red galaxy data to a 3 sigma limit of h=22.9 andoptical-infra-red colours of galaxies on the william herschel deep field. thesedata were taken from a 7'x 7' area observed for 14 hours with the omega primecamera on the 3.5-m calar alto telescope. we derive h-band number counts,colour-magnitude diagrams and colour histograms. we review our pure luminosityevolution galaxy count models based on the spectral synthesis models of bruzual&amp; charlot. these ple models give an excellent fit to the our h band count datato h&lt;22.5 and hdf count data to h&lt;28. however, ple models with a salpeter imffor early-type galaxies overestimate the average galaxy redshift in k&lt;20 galaxyredshift surveys. models that assume a steep x=3 imf give better agreementdata, although they do show an unobserved peak in b-h and i-h colourdistributions at faint h magnitudes corresponding to z&gt;1 early-type galaxies.this feature may simply reflect a larger scatter in optical-infra-red coloursthan in the b-r colour of early-type galaxies at this redshift. this scatter isobvious in optical-ir colour-colour diagrams and may be explained by on-goingstar-formation in an intermediate sub-population of early-type galaxies. thenumbers of eros detected are a factor of 2-3 lower than predicted by theearly-type models that assume the salpeter imf and in better agreement withthose that assume the x=3 imf. the tight sequence of early-type galaxies alsoshows a sub-class which is simultaneously redder in infrared bands and bluer inthe bluer bands than the classical, passive early-type galaxy; this sub-classappears at relatively low redshifts and may constitute an intermediate age,early-type population.

astro-ph;0509875	new h-band galaxy number counts: a large local hole in the galaxy  distribution?	we examine h-band number counts determined using new photometry over 0.30sq.deg. to h=19, as well as h&lt;14 counts from 2mass. first, we examine 2masscounts extracted for the 4000 sq.deg. apm survey area and find a deficiency of25% at h=13, in line with previous results. in addition the |b|&gt;20 countsdisplay a relatively constant deficit in the counts of 15-20%. we investigatevarious possible causes for these results: in order to address the issue of themodel normalisation, we examine faint number counts for the new faintphotometry presented in this work and also for the lcirs. in each case azeropoint is chosen to match that of the 2mass photometry at bright magnitudes.we find a large offset between 2mass and the lcirs data of 0.28+/-0.01magnitudes. applying a consistent zeropoint, the combined faint data is in goodagreement with the homogeneous model prediction used previously. we examinepossible effects arising from unexpected galaxy evolution and photometricerrors and find no evidence for a significant contribution from either.however, incompleteness in the 2mass catalogue and in the faint data may have asignificant contribution. addressing the contribution from large-scalestructure, we estimate the cosmic variance in the bright counts over the apmsurvey area and for |b|&gt;20 expected in a lcdm cosmology using 27 lcdm mock2mass catalogues. accounting for the model normalisation uncertainty and takingan upper limit for the incompleteness, the apm survey area bright counts are inline with a rare fluctuation in the local galaxy distribution of 2.5 sigma.however, the |b|&gt;20 counts represent a 4.0 sigma fluctuation, and imply a localhole which extends over the entire local galaxy distribution and is at oddswith lcdm.

astro-ph;0607629	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the luminosity function of  luminous red galaxies to z=0.6	we present new measurements of the luminosity function (lf) of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) survey. we have carefully quantified, and corrected for,uncertainties in the k and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colourselection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we arestudying the same galaxy population in both surveys. using a limited subset of6326 sdss lrgs (with 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.24) and 1725 2slaq lrgs (with 0.5 &lt;z&lt;0.6), forwhich the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence forany additional evolution in the lrg lf, over this redshift range, beyond thatexpected from a simple passive evolution model. this lack of additionalevolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of sdss and 2slaqlrgs, brighter than m_r - 5logh = -22.5, which are 2.51+/-0.03 x 10^-7 l_sunmpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 l_sun mpc^-3 respectively (&lt;10% uncertainty). wecompare our lfs to the combo-17 data and find excellent agreement over the sameredshift range. together, these surveys show no evidence for additionalevolution (beyond passive) in the lf of lrgs brighter than m_r - 5logh = -21(or brighter than l*). we test our sdss and 2slaq lfs against a simple ``drymerger'' model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at leasthalf of the lrgs at z=0.2 must already have been well-assembled (with more thanhalf their stellar mass) by z=0.6. this limit is barely consistent with recentresults from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.

(2005) based on measurements of qsoclustering. this enables us to trace the mbh-mdh relation over the redshiftrange z=0.5 to 2.5. we calculate the mean zero-point of the mbh-mdh relation tobe mbh=10^(8.4+/-0.2)msun for an mdh=10^(12.5)msun. these data are thencompared with several models connecting mbh and mdh as well as recenthydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution. we note that the flux limitednature of qso samples can cause a malmquist-type bias in the measuredzero-point of the mbh-mdh relation. the magnitude of this bias depends on thescatter in the mbh-mdh relation, and we reevaluate the zero-point assumingthree published values for this scatter.

astro-ph;0609339	the effect of lensing on the large-scale cmb anisotropy	we first compare the cmb lensing model of seljak (1996) with the empiricalmodel of lieu &amp; mittaz (2005) to determine if the latter approach implies alarger effect on the cmb power-spectrum. we find that the empirical model givessignificantly higher results for the magnification dispersion, assumingstandard cosmological parameters. however, when the empirical foreground modelis modelled via correlation functions and used in the seljak formalism, theagreement is considerably improved. thus we conclude that the main differencemay be in the assumed foregrounds. we then discuss a foreground massdistribution which gives a lensing dispersion which is constant with angle. inseljak's formalism, we show this can lead to a smoothing of the cmbpower-spectrum which may be able to move the first acoustic peak to smaller l,if the mass clustering amplitude is high enough. evidence for such a highamplitude comes from the qso magnification results of myers et al (2003, 2005)who suggest that foreground galaxy groups may be more massive than expected,implying that omega_m ~ 1 and strong galaxy anti-bias. we then show that aninflationary model with neither cdm nor a cosmological constant and thatpredicts a primordial first peak at l=330 may fit the first acoustic peak ofthe wmap data. this fit may be regarded as somewhat contrived since it alsorequires high redshift reionisation at the upper limit of what is allowed bythe wmap results. but given the finely-tuned nature of the standard lcdm model,the contrivance may be small in comparison and certainly the effect of lensingand other foregrounds may still have a considerable influence on thecosmological interpretation of the cmb.

astro-ph;0612400	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the lrg 2-point correlation function  and redshift-space distortions	we present a clustering analysis of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) using nearly9 000 objects from the final catalogue of the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq)survey. we measure the redshift-space two-point correlation function, xi(s), atthe mean lrg redshift of z=0.55. a single power-law fits the deprojectedcorrelation function, xi(r), with a correlation length of r_0=7.45+-0.35 mpcand a power-law slope of gamma=1.72+-0.06 in the 0.4&lt;r&lt;50 mpc range. but it isin the lrg angular correlation function that the strongest evidence fornon-power-law features is found where a slope of gamma=-2.17+-0.07 is seen at1&lt;r&lt;10 mpc with a flatter gamma=-1.67+-0.03 slope apparent at r&lt;~1 mpc scales.we use the simple power-law fit to the galaxy xi(r) to model the redshift spacedistortions in the 2-d redshift-space correlation function, xi(sigma,pi). wefit for the lrg velocity dispersion, w_z, omega_m and beta, wherebeta=omega_m^0.6/b and b is the linear bias parameter. we find values ofw_z=330kms^-1, omega_m= 0.10+0.35-0.10 and beta=0.40+-0.05. these high redshiftresults, which incorporate the alcock-paczynski effect and the effects ofdynamical infall, start to break the degeneracy between omega_m and beta foundin low-redshift galaxy surveys. this degeneracy is further broken byintroducing an additional external constraint, the value of beta(z=0.1)=0.45from 2dfgrs, and then considering the evolution of clustering from z~0 toz_lrg~0.55. with these combined methods we find omega_m(z=0)=0.30+-0.15 andbeta(z=0.55)=0.45+-0.05. assuming these values, we find a value forb(z=0.55)=1.66+-0.35. we show that this is consistent with a simple ``highpeaks'' bias prescription which assumes that lrgs have a constant co-movingdensity and their clustering evolves purely under gravity.

astro-ph;0701870	qso lensing magnification: a comparison of 2qz and sdss results	the lensing of background qsos by foreground galaxies is a powerful probe ofthe mass density of the universe and the power spectrum of mass clustering.however, the 2df qso survey suggested that a strong anticorrelation effect atg&lt;21 was seen for both galaxies and clusters which implied that galaxies areanti-biased (b~0.1) on small scales at a higher level than predicted by thestandard cosmology (myers et al., 2003, 2005) whereas results from sdsssuggested that the effect was much smaller (b~0.6) and in line with standardexpectations (scranton et al., 2005). we first cross-correlate the sdssphoto-z, g&lt;21, 1.0&lt;z_p&lt;2.2 qsos with g&lt;21 galaxies and clusters in the sameareas. these results are somewhat less negative than the results based on the2qz qsos found by myers et al. but contamination of the qsos by low-z nelgs andqsos can cause underestimation of the anticorrelation lensing signal. when acorrection is applied to the photo-z qso sample of scranton et al. theanticorrelation increases and the agreement with the results of myers et al. isimproved. when we also take into account the fainter r&lt;21 galaxy limit ofscranton et al. as opposed to g&lt;21 for myers et al., the two observationalresults appear to be in very good agreement. this therefore leaves open thequestion of why the theoretical interpretations are so different for theseanalyses. we note that the results of guimaraes, myers &amp; shanks based on mockcatalogues from the lcdm hubble volume strongly suggest that qso lensing at thelevels detected by both myers et al. and now scranton et al. is incompatiblewith a galaxy bias of b~1 in the standard cosmological model. if the qsolensing results are correct then the consequences for cosmology may besignificant (see shanks 2006).

astro-ph;9704147	asca observations of deep rosat fields i. the nature of the x-ray source  populations	we present asca gis observations (total exposure 100-200 ksec) of threefields which form part of our deep rosat survey. we detect 26 sources down to alimiting flux (2-10 kev) of 5x10^{-14} erg cm-2 s-1. sources down to this fluxlevel contribute 30 per cent of the 2-10 kev x-ray background. the number-countdistribution, logn-logs, is a factor of three above the rosat counts, assuminga photon spectral index of 2 for the rosat sources. this suggests the presenceat hard energies of a population other than the broad-line agn which contributeto the rosat counts. this is supported by spectroscopic observations that showa large fraction of sources that are not obvious broad-line agn. the average1-10 kev spectral index of these sources is flat (0.92+-0.16), significantlydifferent than that of the broad-line agn (1.78+-0.16). although some of thenarrow emission line galaxies which are detected with rosat are also detectedhere, the nature of the flat spectrum sources remains as yet unclear.

astro-ph;9710002	asca observations of deep rosat fields - ii. the 2-10kev agn luminosity  function	we present additional optical spectroscopic identifications of sourcesidentified in three deep asca gis fields which also form part of a deep rosatsurvey. in total, 26 asca sources have been detected down to a 2-10kev fluxlimit of s = 5e-14 erg/cm/s. ldss observations have increased the spectroscopiccompleteness of the survey to between 65 and 85 per cent, with identificationsfor up to 13 qsos with broad emission lines and 6 objects with narrow emissionlines. combining these objects with the agn identified in the lma/heao-1 sampleby grossan, we find evidence for significant cosmological evolution in the2-10kev band (&lt;v_e/v_a&gt;=0.63+/-0.03), fit by a pure luminosity evolution model;l \propto (1+z)^k, k=2.04^{+0.16}_{-0.22}$. the present-epoch 2-10kev agn x-rayluminosity function, \phi(l_x), is best represented by a two power lawfunction: \phi(l_x) \propto l^{-3.0}, l*&gt;10^{44.1}erg/s; $\phi (l_x) \proptol^{-1.9}$, l*&lt;10^{44.1}erg/s. depending on the extent to which we extrapolatethe z=0 agn luminosity function, we predict a total contribution to the 2-10kevx-ray background from qsos and narrow-emission-line galaxies which ranges from48 per cent (for agn with l&gt;10^{42}erg/s) to 80 per cent (l&gt;10^{39}erg/s).

astro-ph;9810170	radio-quiet qso environments - i. the correlation of qsos and bj&lt;23  galaxies	in this paper we present results of an analysis of radio-quiet qsoenvironments. the aim is to determine the relation between qsos and galaxies asa function of redshift. we cross-correlate a sample of ~150 qsos from opticallyand x-ray selected catalogues with faint, bj&lt;23, galaxies. these data allow usto probe the galaxy clustering environment of qsos out to z~1.0-1.5. far fromgiving a positive correlation, at z&lt;1.5 the qso-galaxy cross-correlationfunction is marginally negative, with w(theta&lt;120'')=-0.027+-0.020. colourinformation suggests that the anti-correlation is most significant between theqsos and the red galaxy population.  we have constructed models to predict the qso-galaxy cross-correlation, usingthe known form of the galaxy n(z) at bj&lt;23, and assuming a variety ofclustering evolution rates. cases in which qsos exist in rich clusterenvironments are comfortably ruled out at more than 5sigma and the results aremore consistent with a `normal' galaxy environment for radio-quiet qsos. if thesmall anti-correlation is interpreted as an effect of gravitational lensing,this conclusion is not altered. in this case, the data are only ~1sigma belowthe low clustering amplitude models, while the high amplitude models are stillcomfortably rejected. we therefore conclude that these qsos may not be muchmore highly biased than optically selected galaxies.

astro-ph;9810413	asca observations of deep rosat fields iv.ir and hard x-ray observations  of an obscured high-redshift qso	we use ukirt and asca observations to determine the nature of a high redshift(z=2.35) narrow-line agn, previously discovered by almaini et al. (1995). theukirt observations show a broad halpha line while no hbeta line is detected.this together with the red colour (b-k=5.4) suggest that our object is amoderately obscured qso (av&gt;3), in optical wavelengths. the asca data suggest ahard spectrum, probably due to a large obscuring column, with a photon index of1.93 (+0.62, -0.46), nh~10^23. the combined asca and rosat data again suggest aheavily obscured spectrum (nh~10^23 or av~100). in this picture, the rosat softx-ray emission may arise from electron scattering, in a similar fashion tolocal seyfert 1.9. then, there is a large discrepancy between the moderatereddening witnessed by the ir and the large x-ray absorbing column. this couldbe possibly explained on the basis of e.g. high gas metallicities or assumingthat the x-ray absorbing column is inside the dust sublimation radius. analternative explanation can be obtained when we allow for variability betweenthe rosat and asca observations. then the best fit spectrum is still flat, 1.35(+0.16, -0.14), but with low intrinsic absorption in better agreement with their data, while the rosat normalization is a factor of two below the ascanormalization. this object may be one of the bright examples of a type-ii qsopopulation at high redshift, previously undetected in optical surveys. the hardx-ray spectrum of this object suggests that such a population could make asubstantial contribution to the x-ray background.

astro-ph;9812137	the durham/ukst galaxy redshift survey - vi. power spectrum analysis of  clustering	we present the power spectrum analysis of clustering in the durham/ukstgalaxy redshift survey, which covers 1450 square degrees and consists of 2501galaxy redshifts sampled at a rate of 1 in 3 to b_j = 17. the fluctuations thatwe measure can be expressed as sigma_{8} = 1.01 +/- 0.17 . we find remarkablygood agreement between the power spectrum measured for the durham/ukst surveyand those from other optical studies, in spite of the very different samplingrates, magnitude limits and survey geometries employed, on scales up to lambda= (2 pi)/k = 80/h mpc. on scales larger than this we find good agreement withthe power measured from the stromlo-apm survey (tadros &amp; efstathiou), but findmore power than estimated from the las campanas redshift survey (lin et al). weapply a simple model for redshift space distortions to the real space apmgalaxy survey power spectrum and find a shape and amplitude that is in verygood agreement with the power spectrum of the durham/ukst survey. this impliesbeta=omega^{0.6}/b=0.60 +/- 0.35, where omega is the density parameter and b isthe bias between fluctuations in the galaxy and mass distributions, and alsosuggests a one dimensional velocity dispersion of sigma = 320 +/-140 km/s. wefind that for any choice of normalisation, the standard cdm model has a shapethat cannot be reconciled with the durham/ukst survey power spectrum, unlesseither unacceptably high values of the one dimensional velocity dispersion areadopted or the assumption that bias is constant is invalid on scales greaterthan 20/h mpc. over the range of wavenumbers for which we have a robustmeasurement of the power spectrum, we find the best agreement is obtained for acritical density cdm model in which the shape of the power spectrum ismodified.

astro-ph;9901335	a test of tully-fisher distance estimates using cepheids and type ia  supernovae	we update and extend the results of shanks (1997, mnras, 290, l77) by makinga direct test of tully-fisher distance estimates to thirteen spiral galaxieswith hst cepheid distances and to ten spiral galaxies with type ia supernova(snia) distances. the results show that the tully-fisher distance moduli aretoo short with respect to the cepheid distances by 0.46+-0.11mag and too shortwith respect to the snia distances by 0.49+-0.18mag. combining the hst cepheidand the best snia data suggests that, overall, previous tully-fisher distancesat v~1000 kms-1 were too short by 0.43+-0.09mag, a result which is significantat the 4.6 sigma level. these data therefore indicate that previoustully-fisher distances should be revised upwards by 22+-5% implying, forexample, a virgo distance of 19.0+-1.8mpc. the value of ho from tully-fisherestimates is correspondingly revised downwards from ho=84+-10kms-1mpc-1 toho=69+-8kms-1mpc-1. there is evidence that the tully-fisher relation at largedistances is affected by malmquist bias. in this case, we argue thatho&lt;50kms-1mpc-1 cannot be ruled out by tully-fisher considerations.

astro-ph;9904014	galaxy number counts- iv. surveying the herschel deep field in the  near-infrared	(abridged) we present results from two new near-infrared imaging surveys. onecovers 47.2 arcmin^2 to k(3\sigma)&lt;20 whilst a second, deeper survey covers asub-area of 1.8 arcmin^2 to k(3\sigma)&lt;22.75. over the entire area we haveextremely deep ubri photometry. our k- counts are consistent with thepredictions of non-evolving models with 0 &lt; q0 &lt;0.5. the k-selected (b-k)galaxy colour distributions move sharply bluewards fainter than k~20 and at atbrighter magnitudes (k&lt;20) our observed colour distributions indicate adeficiency of red, early-type galaxies at z~1 in comparison with passivelyevolving models. this implies either a pure luminosity evolution (ple) modelwith a low level of continuing star-formation following an an initial burst, ordynamical merging. at fainter magnitudes, the continuing bluewards trendobserved in (b-k) can be explained purely in terms of passively evolving plemodels. our observed numbers of (i-k)&gt;4 galaxies at k&lt;20 exhibit the samedeficiency, suggesting that at least part of the larger deficit observed in(b-k) at k&lt;20 may be due to star-formation rather than dynamical merging.finally, as we and others have noted, the number-redshift distribution at18&lt;k&lt;19 of recent, deep k- selected redshift surveys is well fitted bynon-evolving models; passively evolving models with a salpeter or scalo initialmass functions overpredict the numbers of galaxies with z&gt;1. dynamical mergingis one possible solution to reduce the numbers of these galaxies but adwarf-dominated imf for early-type galaxies could offer an alternativeexplanation; we show that this model reproduces both the optical-infraredcolour distributions and the k- band galaxy counts.

astro-ph;9905249	statistical lensing of faint qsos by galaxy clusters	we investigate the anti-correlation between faint high redshift qsos and lowredshift galaxy groups found by boyle, fong &amp; shanks (1988), on the assumptionthat it is caused by gravitational lensing of a flat qso number count, ratherthan any other systematic effect (e.g dust). an isothermal sphere lens model,requires a velocity dispersion of 1286+72-91 km/s. addition of a constantdensity plane reduces this to 1143+109-153 km/s, while the plane density is0.081+-0.032h g/cm**2. both these values are considerably larger than the400-600km/s expected for poor clusters and groups and imply that the massassociated with such groups is ~4 times larger than inferred from virialanalyses. if due to lensing, this measurement clearly tends to favour highvalues of omega_0. we demonstrate how an estimate of omega_0 may be obtained,finding omega_0=1.3(n/3x10^-4h^3mpc^-3)(r/1mpc)(sigma/1286km/s)^2. systematicuncertainties in r, the extent of the anti-correlation, and n, the group spacedensity, currently dominate this determination, but this will be a route toestimating omega_0 in improved galaxy-qso datasets where systematics can bebetter controlled. we compared our result to that of williams &amp; irwin (1998)who find a positive correlation between bright lbqs qsos and apm galaxies.adapting the analysis of williams &amp; irwin to our use of galaxy groups, we findagreement between the amplitude of the positive cross-correlation found forbright qsos and the negative cross-correlation found for faint qsos. thisanalysis leads to a common estimate of omega_0*sigma_8~3-4. this, however, issignificantly higher than indicated from several other analyses. further testsof the accuracy of galaxy-qso cross-correlations and their implications foromega_0 and sigma_8 will soon be available from the new 2df qso catalogue.

astro-ph;9909089	implications of an obscured agn model for the x-ray background at sub-mm  and far infra-red wavelengths	models invoking large populations of obscured agn are known to provide goodfits to the spectrum of the x-ray background and the observed soft and hardx-ray number counts. an important consequence of these models is thatsignificant quantities of dust are required in order to provide the obscuringmedium, which will be heated by the nuclear radiation from the agn, and willradiate in the thermal infra-red. we therefore model the properties of thedust, and predict the contribution of obscured agn to the intensity of the farinfra-red background and the sub-mm source counts and redshift distribution, inorder to ascertain whether our models are constrained further by the dataavailable at these wavelengths. our conservative models predict a contributionof between 5 and 15 per cent of the far infra-red background intensity, whereasif we use more extreme values for several parameters, this value may reach 33per cent. this suggests that agn may only form a significant minority of sub-mmsources, in agreement with the results of spectroscopic follow-up. our modelsthus show that there is no inconsistency between obscured agn models for thex-ray background and either sub-mm source counts or the intensity of the farinfra-red background. we further propose that obscured agn may explain thesub-mm emission associated with extremely red objects (eros). finally, we makepredictions for the redshift distribution of agn sources detected in faintsub-mm surveys, which should allow future tests of this obscured agn model.
