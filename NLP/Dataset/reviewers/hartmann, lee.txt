0902.4469	the differential rotation of fu ori	the emission of fu orionis objects in outburst has been identified as arisingin rapidly accreting protoplanetary disks, based on a number of observationalproperties. a fundamental test of the accretion disk scenario is that thedifferentially rotating disk spectrum should produce a variation of rotationalvelocity with the wavelength of observation, as spectra taken at longerwavelengths probe outer, more slowly rotating disk regions. previousobservations of fu ori have shown smaller rotation at near-infrared (~ 2.2micron) wavelengths than observed at optical (~ 0.6 micron) wavelengthsconsistent with the assumption of keplerian rotation. here we report a spectrumfrom the phoenix instrument on gemini south which shows that differential(slower) rotation continues to be observed out to ~ 5 micron. the observedspectrum is well matched by the prediction of our accretion disk modelpreviously constructed to match the observed spectral energy distribution andthe differential rotation at wavelengths &lt; 2.2 micron. this kinematic resultallows us to confirm our previous inference of a large outer radius (~ 1 au)for the rapidly accreting region of the fu ori disk, which presentsdifficulties for outburst models relying purely on thermal instability. whilesome optical spectra have been interpreted to pose problems for the diskinterpretation of fu ori, we show that the adjustment of the maximum effectivetemperature of the disk model, proposed in a previous paper, greatly reducesthese difficulties.

0707.0019	probing the dust and gas in the transitional disk of cs cha with spitzer	here we present the spitzer irs spectrum of cs cha, a member of the ~2 myrold chamaeleon star-forming region, which reveals an optically thickcircumstellar disk truncated at ~43 au, the largest hole modeled in atransitional disk to date. within this inner hole, ~5x10^-5 lunar masses ofdust are located in a small optically thin inner region which extends from 0.1to 1 au. in addition, the disk of cs cha has bigger grain sizes and moresettling than the previously modeled transitional disks dm tau, gm aur, andcoku tau/4, suggesting that cs cha is in a more advanced state of dustevolution. the spitzer irs spectrum also shows [ne ii] 12.81 micronfine-structure emission with a luminosity of 1.3x10^29 ergs s^-1, indicatingthat optically thin gas is present in this ~43 au hole, in agreement withh_alpha measurements and a uv excess which indicate that cs cha is stillaccreting 1.2x10^-8 m_sun yr^-1. we do not find a correlation of the [ne ii]flux with l_x, however, there is a possible correlation with mass accretionrate, which if confirmed would suggest that euv fluxes due to accretion are themain agent for formation of the [ne ii] line.

0909.0688	far-ultraviolet h2 emission from circumstellar disks	we analyze the far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectra of 33 classical t tauri stars(ctts), including 20 new spectra obtained with the advanced camera for surveyssolar blind channel (acs/sbc) on the hubble space telescope. of the sources, 28are in the ~1 myr old taurus-auriga complex or orion molecular cloud, 4 in the8-10 myr old orion ob1a complex and one, tw hya, in the 10 myr old tw hydraeassociation. we also obtained fuv acs/sbc spectra of 10 non-accreting sourcessurrounded by debris disks with ages between 10 and 125 myr. we use a featurein the fuv spectra due mostly to electron impact excitation of \h2 to study theevolution of the gas in the inner disk. we find that the \h2 feature is absentin non-accreting sources, but is detected in the spectra of ctts and correlateswith accretion luminosity. since all young stars have active chromosphereswhich produce strong x-ray and uv emission capable of exciting \h2 in the disk,the fact that the non-accreting sources show no \h2 emission implies that the\h2 gas in the inner disk has dissipated in the non-accreting sources, althoughdust (and possibly gas) remains at larger radii. using the flux at 1600 {\aa},we estimate that the column density of \h2 left in the inner regions of thedebris disks in our sample is less than ~ 3x10^-6 g cm^-2, nine orders ofmagnitude below the surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 au.

0909.2018	gravitational collapse and filament formation: comparison with the pipe  nebula	recent models of molecular cloud formation and evolution suggest that suchclouds are dynamic and generally exhibit gravitational collapse. we present asimple analytic model of global collapse onto a filament and compare this withour numerical simulations of the flow-driven formation of an isolated molecularcloud to illustrate the supersonic motions and infall ram pressures expected inmodels of gravity-driven cloud evolution. we apply our results to observationsof the pipe nebula, an especially suitable object for our purposes as its lowstar formation activity implies insignifcant perturbations from stellarfeedback. we show that our collapsing cloud model can explain the magnitude ofthe velocity dispersions seen in the $^{13}$co filamentary structure by onishiet al. and the ram pressures required by lada et al. to confine the lower-masscores in the pipe nebula. we further conjecture that higher-resolutionsimulations will show small velocity dispersions in the densest core gas, asobserved, but which are infall motions and not supporting turbulence. ourresults point out the inevitability of ram pressures as boundary conditions formolecular cloud filaments, and the possibility that especially lower-mass coresstill can be accreting mass at significant rates, as suggested by observations.

0704.1518	crystalline silicates and dust processing in the protoplanetary disks of  the taurus young cluster	we characterize the crystalline silicate content and spatial distribution ofsmall dust grains in a large sample of protoplanetary disks in thetaurus-auriga young cluster, using spitzer space telescope mid-infraredspectra. in turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure andcomposition of these 1-2 myr-old disks around solar- and later-type youngstars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in theconversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. we find strong evidenceof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of thestructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fractionis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. we also confirm thatthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r &lt; 10 au. however, wesee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar massor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, aswould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based uponphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,accretion-heating-driven annealing at r &lt; 1 au, or spiral-shock heating at r &lt;10 au, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. either anothergrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must beat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. we propose oneof each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely x-ray heatingand annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure bygiant-planetary formation and migration.

0912.4527	probing the protostellar envelope around l1157: the dust and gas  connection	we present observations of the class 0 protostar l1157-mm using the combinedarray for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma) in 3 mm dust continuumand n2h+ line emission. in the n2h+ line, we detect a large-scale envelopeextended over a linear size of ~20,000au flattened in the directionperpendicular to the outflow. this n2h+ feature coincides with the outerenvelope seen in the 8 micron extinction by looney et al. meanwhile, the dustcontinuum traces the compact, nearly spherical structure of the inner envelope,where n2h+ becomes depleted. this highly flattened n2h+ envelope also showsdynamical signatures consistent with gravitational infall in the inner region,but a slow, solid-body rotation at large scales. this flattened structure isnot a rotationally supported circumstellar disk; instead, it resembles aprestellar core both morphologically and kinematically, representing the earlyphase of a class 0 system. in this paper, we construct a simple model tointerpret both the dust continuum and n2h+ emission and suggest a possibledynamical scenario for the overall properties of the envelope.

0707.3429	the hot inner disk of fu ori	we have constructed a detailed radiative transfer disk model which reproducesthe main features of the spectrum of the outbursting young stellar object fuorionis from ~ 4000 angstrom, to ~ 8 micron. using an estimated visualextinction av~1.5, a steady disk model with a central star mass ~0.3 msun and amass accretion rate ~ 2e-4 msun/yr, we can reproduce the spectral energydistribution of fu ori quite well. with the mid-infrared spectrum obtained bythe infrared spectrograph (irs) on board the spitzer space telescope, weestimate that the outer radius of the hot, rapidly accreting inner disk is ~ 1au using disk models truncated at this outer radius. inclusion of radiationfrom a cooler irradiated outer disk might reduce the outer limit of the hotinner disk to ~ 0.5 au. in either case, the radius is inconsistent with a purethermal instability model for the outburst. our radiative transfer modelimplies that the central disk temperature tc &gt; 1000 k out to ~ 0.5 - 1 au,suggesting that the magnetorotational instability (mri) can be supported out tothat distance. assuming that the ~ 100 yr decay timescale in brightness of fuori represents the viscous timescale of the hot inner disk, we estimate theviscosity parameter (alpha) to be ~ 0.2 - 0.02 in the outburst state,consistent with numerical simulations of mri in disks. the radial extent of thehigh mass accretion region is inconsistent with the model of bell &amp; lin, butmay be consistent with theories incorporating both gravitational instabilityand mri.

1001.3026	accretion in evolved and transitional disks in cep ob2: looking for the  origin of the inner holes	we present accretion rates for a large number of solar-type stars in the cepob2 region, based on u band observations. our study comprises 95 members of the~4 myr-old cluster tr 37 (including 20 "transition" objects; to), as well asthe only ctts in the ~12 myr-old cluster ngc 7160. the stars show differentdisk morphologies, with the majority of them having evolved and flatteneddisks. the typical accretion rates are about one order of magnitude lower thanin regions aged 1-2 myr, and we find no strong correlation between diskmorphology and accretion rates. although half of the to are not accreting, themedian accretion rates of normal ctts and accreting "transition" disks aresimilar (~3 10^{-9} and 2 10^{-9} msun/yr, respectively). comparison with otherregions suggests that the to observed at different ages do not necessarilyrepresent the same type of objects, which is consistent with the fact that thedifferent processes that can lead to reduced ir excess/inner disk clearing(e.g., binarity, dust coagulation/settling, photoevaporation, giant planetformation) do not operate on the same timescales. accreting to in tr 37 areprobably suffering strong dust coagulation/settling. regarding the equallylarge number of non-accreting to in the region, other processes, likephotoevaporation, the presence of stellar/substellar companions, and/or giantplanet formation may account for their "transitional" seds and negligibleaccretion rates.

1002.2362	complex structure in class 0 protostellar envelopes	we use archived irac images from the spitzer space telescope to show thatmany class 0 protostars exhibit complex, irregular, and non-axisymmetricstructure within their dusty envelopes. our 8 $\mu$m extinction maps probe someof the densest regions in these protostellar envelopes. many of the systems areobserved to have highly irregular and non-axisymmetric morphologies on scales&gt;= 1000 au, with a quarter of the sample exhibiting filamentary or flatteneddense structures. complex envelope structure is observed in regions spatiallydistinct from outflow cavities, and the densest structures often show nosystematic alignment perpendicular to the cavities. these results indicate thatmass ejection is not responsible for much of the irregular morphologies wedetect; rather, we suggest that the observed envelope complexity is mostly theresult of collapse from protostellar cores with initially non-equilibriumstructures. the striking non-axisymmetry in many envelopes could providefavorable conditions for the formation of binary systems. we also note thatprotostars in the sample appear to be formed preferentially near the edges ofclouds or bends in filaments, suggesting formation by gravitational focusing.

1003.1756	long-term evolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks. ii.  layered accretion with infall	we use one-dimensional two-zone time-dependent accretion disk models to studythe long-term evolution of protostellar disks subject to mass addition from thecollapse of a rotating cloud core. our model consists of a constant surfacedensity magnetically coupled active layer, with transport and dissipation ininactive regions only via gravitational instability. we start our simulationsafter a central protostar has formed, containing ~ 10% of the mass of theprotostellar cloud. subsequent evolution depends on the angular momentum of theaccreting envelope. we find that disk accretion matches the infall rate earlyin the disk evolution because much of the inner disk is hot enough to couple tothe magnetic field. later infall reaches the disk beyond ~10 au, and the diskundergoes outbursts of accretion in fu ori-like events as described in zhu etal. 2009c. if the initial cloud core is moderately rotating most of the centralstar's mass is built up by these outburst events. our results suggest that theprotostellar "luminosity problem" is eased by accretion during these fuori-like outbursts. after infall stops the disk enters the t tauri phase. anouter, viscously evolving disk has structure that is in reasonable agreementwith recent submillimeter studies and its surface density evolves from $\sigma\propto r^{-1}$ to $r^{-1.5}$. an inner, massive belt of material-- the "deadzone" -- would not have been observed yet but should be seen in future highangular resolution observations by evla and alma. this high surface densitybelt is a generic consequence of low angular momentum transport efficiency atradii where the disk is magnetically decoupled, and would strongly affectplanet formation and migration.

1003.1759	long-term evolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks. i.  outbursts	as an initial investigation into the long-term evolution of protostellardisks, we explore the conditions required to explain the large outbursts ofdisk accretion seen in some young stellar objects. we use one-dimensionaltime-dependent disk models with a phenomenological treatment of themagnetorotational instability (mri) and gravitational torques to follow diskevolution over long timescales. comparison with our previous two-dimensionaldisk model calculations (zhu et al. 2009b, z2009b) indicates that the neglectof radial effects and two-dimensional disk structure in the one-dimensionalcase makes only modest differences in the results; this allows us to use thesimpler models to explore parameter space efficiently. we find that the massinfall rates typically estimated for low-mass protostars generally result inau-scale disk accretion outbursts, as predicted by our previous analysis (zhuet al. 2009a,z2009a). we also confirm quasi-steady accretion behavior for highmass infall rates if the values of $\alpha$-parameter for the magnetorotationalinstability is small, while at this high accretion rate convection from thethermal instability may lead to some variations. we further constrain thecombinations of the $\alpha$-parameter and the mri critical temperature, whichcan reproduce observed outburst behavior. our results suggest that dustsublimation may be connected with full activation of the mri. this isconsistent with the idea that small dust captures ions and electrons tosuppress the mri. in a later paper we will explore both long-term outburst anddisk evolution with this model, allowing for infall from protostellar envelopeswith differing angular momenta.

1008.3335	competitive accretion in sheet geometry and the stellar imf	we report a set of numerical experiments aimed at addressing theapplicability of competitive accretion to explain the high-mass end of thestellar initial mass function in a sheet geometry with shallow gravitationalpotential, in contrast to most previous simulations which have assumedformation in a cluster gravitational potential. our flat cloud geometry ismotivated by models of molecular cloud formation due to large-scale flows inthe interstellar medium. the experiments consisted of sph simulations of gasaccretion onto sink particles formed rapidly from jeans-unstable dense clumpsplaced randomly in the finite sheet. these simplifications allow us to studyaccretion with a minimum of free parameters, and to develop better statisticson the resulting mass spectra. we considered both clumps of equal mass andgaussian distributions of masses, and either uniform or spatially-varying gasdensities. in all cases, the sink mass function develops a power law tail athigh masses, with $dn/dlog m \propto m^{-\gamma}$. the accretion rates ofindividual sinks follow $\dot{m} \propto m^2$ at high masses; this results in acontinual flattening of the slope of the mass function towards an asymptoticform $\gamma \sim 1$ (where the salpeter slope is $\gamma = 1.35$). theasymptotic limit is most rapidly reached when starting from a relatively broaddistribution of initial sink masses. in general the resulting upper mass slopeis correlated with the maximum sink mass; higher sink masses are found insimulations with flatter upper mass slopes. although these simulations are of ahighly idealized situation, the results suggest that competitive accretion maybe relevant in a wider variety of environments than previously considered, andin particular that the upper mass distribution may generally evolve towards alimiting value of $\gamma \sim 1$.

1012.4395	transitional and pre-transitional disks: gap opening by multiple  planets?	we use 2d hydrodynamic simulations of viscous disks to examine whetherdynamically-interacting multiple giant planets can explain the large gaps(spanning over one order of magnitude in radius) inferred for the transitionaland pre-transitional disks around t tauri stars. in the absence of inner diskdust depletion, we find that it requires three to four giant planets to open uplarge enough gaps to be consistent with inferences from spectral energydistributions, because the gap width is limited by the tendency of the planetsto be driven together into 2:1 resonances. with very strong tidal torquesand/or rapid planetary accretion, fewer planets can also generate a largecavity interior to the locally formed gap(s) by preventing outer disk materialfrom moving in. in these cases, however, the reduction of surface densityproduces a corresponding reduction in the inner disk accretion rate onto thestar; this makes it difficult to explain the observed accretion rates of thepre/transitional disks. we find that even with four planets in disks,additional substantial dust depletion is required to explain observed diskgaps/holes. substantial dust settling and growth, with consequent significantreductions in optical depths, is inferred for typical t tauri disks in anycase, and an earlier history of dust growth is consistent with the hypothesisthat pre/transitional disks are explained by the presence of giant planets. weconclude that the depths and widths of gaps, and disk accretion rates inpre/transitional disks cannot be reproduced by a planet-induced gap openingscenario alone. significant dust depletion is also required within thegaps/holes. order of magnitude estimates suggest the mass of small dustparticles (&lt;1 micron) relative to the gas must be depleted to 1e-5 -- 1e-2 ofthe interstellar medium value, implying a very efficient mechanism of smalldust removal or dust growth.

1102.0956	evolution of x-ray and fuv disk-dispersing radiation fields	we present new x-ray and far ultraviolet (fuv) observations of t tauri starscovering the age range 1 to 10 myr. our goals are to observationally constrainthe intensity of radiation fields responsible for evaporating gas from thecircumstellar disk and to assess the feasibility of current photoevaporationmodels, focusing on x-ray and uv radiation. we greatly increase the number of7-10 myr old t tauri stars observed in the x-rays by including observations ofthe well populated 25 ori aggregate in the orion ob1a subassociation. withthese new 7-10 myr objects, we confirm that x-ray emission remains constantfrom 1-10 myr. we also show, for the first time, observational evidence for theevolution of fuv radiation fields with a sample of 56 accreting andnon-accreting young stars spanning 1 myr to 1 gyr. we find that the fuvemission decreases on timescales consistent with the decline of accretion inclassical t tauri stars until reaching the chromospheric level in weak t tauristars and debris disks. overall, we find that the observed strength of highenergy radiation is consistent with that required by photoevaporation models todissipate the disks in timescales of approximately 10 myr. finally, we findthat the high energy fields that affect gas evolution are not similarlyaffecting dust evolution; in particular, we find that disks with innerclearings, the transitional disks, have similar levels of fuv emission as fulldisks.

1106.3343	on rapid disk accretion and initial conditions in protostellar evolution	low-mass protostars may accrete most of their material through short-livedepisodes of rapid disk accretion; yet until recently evolutionary tracks forthese protostars assumed only constant or slowly-varying accretion. importantinitial steps toward examining the potential effects of rapid accretion wererecently made by baraffe, chabrier, &amp; gallardo, who showed that in the limit oflow-temperature ("cold") accretion, protostars may have much smaller radii thanfound in previous treatments. such small radii at the end of protostellaraccretion would have the effect of making some young stars appear much older -perhaps as much as 10 myr - than they really are. however, we argue that veryrapid disk accretion is unlikely to be cold, because observations of thebest-studied pre-main sequence disks with rapid disk accretion outbursts - thefu ori objects - have spectral energy distributions which imply large, notsmall, protostellar radii. in addition, theory indicates models that at highaccretion rates, protostellar disks become internally hot and geometricallythick, making it much more likely that hot material is added to the star. inaddition, the very large luminosity of the accretion disk is likely toirradiate the central star strongly, heating up the outer layers andpotentially expanding them. nevertheless, the baraffe et al. calculationsemphasize the importance of initial protostellar radii for subsequentevolution.

1107.4361	complex structure in class 0 protostellar envelopes ii: kinematic  structure from single-dish and interferometric molecular line mapping	we present a study of dense molecular gas kinematics in seventeen nearbyprotostellar systems using single-dish and interferometric molecular lineobservations. the non-axisymmetric envelopes around a sample of class 0/iprotostars were mapped in the n2h+ (j=1-0) tracer with the iram 30m, carma andpdbi as well as nh3 (1,1) with the vla. the molecular line emission is used toconstruct line-center velocity and linewidth maps for all sources to examinethe kinematic structure in the envelopes on spatial scales from 0.1 pc to ~1000au. the direction of the large-scale velocity gradients from single-dishmapping is within 45 degrees of normal to the outflow axis in more than halfthe sample. furthermore, the velocity gradients are often quite substantial,the average being ~2.3 km\s\pc. the interferometric data often revealsmall-scale velocity structure, departing from the more gradual large-scalevelocity gradients. in some cases, this likely indicates accelerating infalland/or rotational spin-up in the inner envelope; the median velocity gradientfrom the interferometric data is ~10.7 km/s/pc. in two systems, we detecthigh-velocity hco+ (j=1-0) emission inside the highest-velocity \nthp\emission. this enables us to study the infall and rotation close to the diskand estimate the central object masses. the velocity fields observed on largeand small-scales are more complex than would be expected from rotation alone,suggesting that complex envelope structure enables other dynamical processes(i.e. infall) to affect the velocity field.

1111.2582	rapid star formation and global gravitational collapse	most young stars in nearby molecular clouds have estimated ages of 1-2 myr,suggesting that star formation is rapid. however, small numbers of stars inthese regions with inferred ages of &gt;= 5-10 myr have been cited to argue thatstar formation is instead a slow, quasi-static process. when considering thesealternative pictures it is important to recognize that the age spread in agiven star-forming cloud is necessarily an upper limit to the timescales oflocal collapse, as not all spatially-distinct regions will start contracting atprecisely the same instant. moreover, star-forming clouds may dynamicallyevolve on timescales of a few myr; in particular, global gravitationalcontraction will tend to yield increasing star formation rates with time due togenerally increasing local gas densities. we show that two different numericalsimulations of dynamic, flow-driven molecular cloud formation and evolution 1)predict age spreads for the main stellar population roughly consistent withobservations, and 2) raise the possibility of forming small numbers of starsearly in cloud evolution, before global contraction concentrates the gas andthe bulk of the stellar population is produced. in general, the existence of asmall number of older stars among a generally much-younger population isconsistent with the picture of dynamic star formation, and may even provideclues to the time evolution of star-forming clouds.

1111.6943	challenges in forming planets by gravitational instability: disk  irradiation and clump migration, accretion &amp; tidal destructio	we present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitatingprotostellar disks subject to axisymmetric infall from envelopes andirradiation from the central star, to explore disk fragmentation due togravitational instability (gi), and the fragmented clump evolution. we assumethat the disk is built gradually and smoothly by the infall, resulting in goodnumerical convergence. we confirm that for disks around solar-mass stars,infall at high rates at radii beyond ~50 au leads to disk fragmentation. atlower infall rates &lt;1e-5 msun/yr, however, irradiation suppressesfragmentation. we find that, once formed, the fragments or clumps migrateinward on typical type-i time scales of ~2e3 yr initially, but later migrationdeviates from the type-i time scale when the clump becomes more massive thanthe local disk mass, and/or when they starts to open gaps. as they migrate, theclumps accrete from the disk at a rate 1e-3 to 1e-1 mjupiter/yr, consistentwith analytic estimates that assume a 1-2 hill radii cross section. most clumpscan grow to their isolation masses &gt;0.1 msun quickly. the eventual fates ofthese clumps, however, diverges depending on the migration speed: 3 out of 13clumps become massive enough (brown dwarf mass) to open gaps in the disk andessentially stop migrating; 4 are tidally destroyed during inward migration; 6migrate across the inner simulated disk boundary. a simple analytic model forclump evolution is derived to explain these different fates. overall, ourresults indicate that fast migration, accretion, and tidal destruction of theclumps pose challenges to the scenario of giant planet formation by gi in situ,but may provide a formation mechanism for close binary systems.

1204.1969	on the nature of the herbig b[e] star binary system v921 scorpii:  geometry and kinematics of the circumprimary disk on sub-au scales	v921 scorpii is a close binary system (separation 0.025") showing theb[e]-phenomenon. the system is surrounded by an enigmatic bipolar nebula, whichmight have been shaped by episodic mass-loss events, possibly triggered bydynamical interactions between the companion and the circumprimary disk (krauset al. 2012a). in this paper, we investigate the spatial structure andkinematics of the circumprimary disk, with the aim to obtain new insights intothe still strongly debated evolutionary stage. for this purpose, we combine,for the first time, infrared spectro-interferometry (vlti/amber, r=12,000) andspectro-astrometry (vlt/crires, r=100,000), which allows us to study theau-scale distribution of circumstellar gas and dust with an unprecedentedvelocity resolution of 3 km*s^-1. using a model-independent photocenteranalysis technique, we find that the br-gamma-line emission rotates in the sameplane as the dust disk. we can reproduce the wavelength-differentialvisibilities and phases and the double-peaked line profile using akeplerian-rotating disk model. the derived mass of the central star is5.4+/-0.4 m_sun*(d/1150 pc), which is considerably lower than expected from thespectral classification, suggesting that v921 sco might be more distant (dapprox 2kpc) than commonly assumed. using the geometric information provided byour br-gamma spectro-interferometric data and paschen, brackett, and pfund linedecrement measurements in 61 hydrogen recombination line transitions, we derivethe density of the line-emitting gas (n_e=2...6*10^19 m^-3). given that ourmeasurements can be reproduced with a keplerian velocity field withoutoutflowing velocity component and the non-detection of age-indicatingspectroscopic diagnostics, our study provides new evidence for thepre-main-sequence nature of v921 sco.

1204.3704	the low-mass stellar population in l1641: evidence for environmental  dependence of the stellar initial mass function	we present results from an optical photometric and spectroscopic survey ofthe young stellar population in l1641, the low-density star-forming region ofthe orion a cloud south of the orion nebula cluster (onc). our goal is todetermine whether l1641 has a large enough low-mass population to make theknown lack of high-mass stars a statistically-significant demonstration ofenvironmental dependence of the upper mass stellar initial mass function (imf).our spectroscopic sample consists of ir-excess objects selected from thespitzer/irac survey and non-excess objects selected from optical photometry. wehave spectral confirmation of 864 members, with another 98 probable members; ofthe confirmed members, 406 have infrared excesses and 458 do not. assuming thesame ratio of stars with and without ir excesses in the highly-extinctedregions, l1641 may contain as many as ~1600 stars down to ~0.1 solar mass,comparable within a factor of two to the the onc. compared to the standardmodels of the imf, l1641 is deficient in o and early b stars to a 3-4 sigmasignificance level, assuming that we know of all the massive stars in l1641.  with a forthcoming survey of the intermediate-mass stars, we will be in abetter position to make a direct comparison with the neighboring, dense onc,which should yield a stronger test of the dependence of the high-mass end ofthe stellar initial mass function upon environment.

1205.5042	dust filtration by planet-induced gap edges: implications for  transitional disks	by carrying out two-dimensional two-fluid global simulations, we have studiedthe response of dust to gap formation by a single planet in the gaseouscomponent of a protoplanetary disk - the so-called "dust filtration" mechanism.we have found that a gap opened by a giant planet at 20 au in a \alpha=0.01,\dot{m}=10^{-8} msun/yr disk can effectively stop dust particles larger than0.1 mm drifting inwards, leaving a sub-millimeter dust cavity/hole. however,smaller particles are difficult to filter by a planet-induced gap due to 1)dust diffusion, and 2) a high gas accretion velocity at the gap edge. ananalytic model is also derived to understand what size particles can befiltered by the gap edge. finally, with our updated understanding of dustfiltration, we have computed monte-carlo radiative transfer models withvariable dust size distributions to generate the spectral energy distributions(seds) of disks with gaps. by comparing with transitional disk observations(e.g. gm aur), we have found that dust filtration alone has difficulties todeplete small particles sufficiently to explain the near-ir deficit oftransitional disks, except under some extreme circumstances. the scenario ofgap opening by multiple planets studied previously suffers the same difficulty.one possible solution is by invoking both dust filtration and dust growth inthe inner disk. in this scenario, a planet induced gap filters large dustparticles in the disk, and the remaining small dust particles passing to theinner disk can grow efficiently without replenishment from fragmentation oflarge grains. predictions for alma have also been made based on all thesescenarios. we conclude that dust filtration with planet(s) in the disk is apromising mechanism to explain submm observations of transitional disks but itmay need to be combined with other processes (e.g. dust growth) to explain thenear-ir deficit.

1212.0861	a 0.2 solar mass protostar with a keplerian disk in the very young l1527  irs system	in their earliest stages, protostars accrete mass from their surroundingenvelopes through circumstellar disks. until now, the smallest observedprotostar/envelope mass ratio was ~2.1. the protostar l1527 irs is thought tobe in the earliest stages of star formation. its envelope contains ~1 solarmass of material within a ~0.05 pc radius, and earlier observations suggestedthe presence of an edge-on disk. here we report observations of dust continuumemission and 13co (j=2-1) line emission from the disk around l1527, from whichwe determine a protostellar mass of m = 0.19 +/- 0.04 solar masses and aprotostar/envelope mass ratio of ~0.2. we conclude that most of the luminosityis generated through the accretion process, with an accretion rate of ~6.6 x10^-7 solar masses per year. if it has been accreting at that rate through muchof its life, its age is ~300,000 yr, though theory suggests larger accretionrates earlier, so it may be younger. the presence of a rotationally--supporteddisk is confirmed and significantly more mass may be added to itsplanet-forming region as well as the protostar itself.

1212.1171	evidence for environmental dependence of the upper stellar initial mass  function in orion a	we extend our previous study of the stellar population of l1641, thelower-density star-forming region of the orion a cloud south of the dense orionnebula cluster (onc), with the goal of testing whether there is a statisticallysignificant deficiency of high-mass stars in low-density regions. previously,we compared the observed ratio of low-mass stars to high-mass stars withtheoretical models of the stellar initial mass function (imf) to infer adeficiency of the highest-mass stars in l1641. we expand our population studyto identify the intermediate mass (late b to g) l1641 members in an attempt tomake a more direct comparison with the mass function of the nearby onc. thespectral type distribution and the k-band luminosity function of l1641 aresimilar to those of the onc (hillenbrand 1997; muench et al. 2002), butproblems of incompleteness and contamination prevent us from making a detailedtest for differences. we limit our analysis to statistical tests of the ratioof high-mass to low-mass stars, which indicate a probability of only 3% thatthe onc and the southern region of l1641 were drawn from the same population,supporting the hypothesis that the upper mass end of the imf is dependent onenvironmental density.

1212.4543	the dependence of star formation efficiency on gas surface density	studies by lada (2010) and heiderman (2010) have suggested that starformation mostly occurs above a threshold in gas surface density sigma ofsigma_c = 120 msun pc^{-2} (a_k = 0.8). heiderman infer a threshold bycombining low-mass star-forming regions, which show a steep increase in thestar formation rate per unit area sigma_sfr with increasing sigma, and massivecores forming luminous stars which show a linear relation. we argue that theseobservations do not require a particular density threshold. the steepdependence of sigma_sfr, approaching unity at protostellar core densities, is anatural result of the increasing importance of self-gravity at high densitiesalong with the corresponding decrease in evolutionary timescales. the linearbehavior of sigma_sfr vs. sigma in massive cores is consistent with probingdense gas in gravitational collapse, forming stars at a characteristicfree-fall timescale given by the use of a particular molecular tracer. thelow-mass and high-mass regions show different correlations between gas surfacedensity and the area a spanned at that density, with a=sigma^{-3} for low-massregions and a=sigma^{-1} for the massive cores; this difference, along with theuse of differing techniques to measure gas surface density and star formation,suggests that connecting the low-mass regions with massive cores isproblematic. we show that the approximately linear relationship between densegas mass and stellar mass used by lada similarly does not demand a particularthreshold for star formation, and requires continuing formation of dense gas.our results are consistent with molecular clouds forming by galactichydrodynamic flows with subsequent gravitational collapse.

1212.6454	variable accretion outbursts in protostellar evolution	we extend the one-dimensional, two-zone models of long-term protostellar diskevolution with infall of zhu et al. to consider the potential effects of afinite viscosity in regions where the ionization is too low for themagnetorotational instability (mri) to operate (the "dead zone"). we find thatthe presence of a small but finite dead zone viscosity, as suggested bysimulations of stratified disks with mri-active outer layers, can triggerinside-out bursts of accretion, starting at or near the inner edge of the disk,instead of the previously-found outside-in bursts with zero dead zoneviscosity, which originate at a few au in radius. these inside-out bursts ofaccretion bear a qualitative resemblance to the outburst behavior of one fu oriobject, v1515 cyg, in contrast to the outside-in burst models which moreclosely resemble the accretion events in fu ori and v1057 cyg. our resultssuggest that the type and frequency of outbursts are potentially a probe oftransport efficiency in the dead zone. simulations must treat the inner diskregions, $r \lesssim 0.5$ au, to show the detailed time evolution of accretionoutbursts in general and to observe the inside-out bursts in particular.

1301.1655	resolved depletion zones and spatial differentiation of n2h+ and n2d+	we present a study on the spatial distribution of n2d+ and n2h+ in thirteenprotostellar systems. eight of thirteen objects observed with the iram 30mtelescope show relative offsets between the peak n2d+ (j=2-1) and n2h+ (j=1-0)emission. we highlight the case of l1157 using interferometric observationsfrom the submillimeter array and plateau de bure interferometer of the n2d+(j=3-2) and n2h+ (j=1-0) transitions respectively. depletion of n2d+ in l1157is clearly observed inside a radius of ~2000 au (7") and the n2h+ emission isresolved into two peaks at radii of ~1000 au (3.5"), inside the depletionregion of n2d+. chemical models predict a depletion zone in n2h+ and n2d+ dueto destruction of h2d+ at t ~ 20 k and the evaporation of co off dust grains atthe same temperature. however, the abundance offsets of 1000 au between the twospecies are not reproduced by chemical models, including a model that followsthe infall of the protostellar envelope. the average abundance ratios of n2d+to n2h+ have been shown to decrease as protostars evolve by emprechtinger etal., but this is the first time depletion zones of n2d+ have been spatiallyresolved. we suggest that the difference in depletion zone radii for n2h+ andn2d+ is caused by either the co evaporation temperature being above 20 k or anh2 ortho-to-para ratio gradient in the inner envelope.

1302.1203	a herschel and apex census of the reddest sources in orion: searching  for the youngest protostars	we perform a census of the reddest, and potentially youngest, protostars inthe orion molecular clouds using data obtained with the pacs instrument onboardthe herschel space observatory and the laboca and saboca instruments on apex aspart of the herschel orion protostar survey (hops). a total of 55 new protostarcandidates are detected at 70 um and 160 um that are either too faint (m24 &gt; 7mag) to be reliably classified as protostars or undetected in the spitzer/mips24 um band. we find that the 11 reddest protostar candidates with log (lambdaf_lambda 70) / (lambda f_lambda 24) &gt; 1.65 are free of contamination and canthus be reliably explained as protostars. the remaining 44 sources have lessextreme 70/24 colors, fainter 70 um fluxes, and higher levels of contamination.taking the previously known sample of spitzer protostars and the new sampletogether, we find 18 sources that have log (lambda f_lambda 70) / (lambdaf_lambda 24) &gt; 1.65; we name these sources "pacs bright red sources", or pbrs.our analysis reveals that the pbrs sample is composed of class 0 like sourcescharacterized by very red seds (t_bol &lt; 45 k) and large values ofsub-millimeter fluxes (l_smm/l_bol &gt; 0.6%). modified black-body fits to theseds provide lower limits to the envelope masses of 0.2 m_sun to 2 m_sun andluminosities of 0.7 l_sun to 10 l_sun. based on these properties, and acomparison of the seds with radiative transfer models of protostars, weconclude that the pbrs are most likely extreme class 0 objects distinguished byhigher than typical envelope densities and hence, high mass infall rates.

1305.3604	modeling the resolved disk around the class 0 protostar l1527	we present high-resolution sub/millimeter interferometric imaging of theclass 0 protostar l1527 irs (iras 04368+2557) at 870 micron and 3.4 mm from thesubmillimeter array (sma) and combined array for research in millimeterastronomy (carma). we detect the signature of an edge-on disk surrounding theprotostar with an observed diameter of 180 au in the sub/millimeter images. themass of the disk is estimated to be 0.007 m_sun, assuming optically thin,isothermal dust emission. the millimeter spectral index is observed to be quiteshallow at all the spatial scales probed; alpha ~ 2, implying a dust opacityspectral index beta ~ 0. we model the emission from the disk and surroundingenvelope using monte carlo radiative transfer codes, simultaneously fitting thesub/millimeter visibility amplitudes, sub/millimeter images, resolved l\arcmin\image, spectral energy distribution, and mid-infrared spectrum. the bestfitting model has a disk radius of r = 125 au, is highly flared (h ~ r^1.3),has a radial density profile rho ~ r^-2.5, and has a mass of 0.0075 m_sun. thescale height at 100 au is 48 au, about a factor of two greater than verticalhydrostatic equilibrium. the resolved millimeter observations indicate thatdisks may grow rapidly throughout the class 0 phase. the mass and radius of theyoung disk around l1527 is comparable to disks around pre-main sequence stars;however, the disk is considerably more vertically extended, possibly due to acombination of lower protostellar mass, infall onto the disk upper layers, andlittle settling of ~1 micron-sized dust grains.

1307.2585	long-term evolution of photoevaporating protoplanetary disks	we perform calculations of our one-dimensional, two-zone disk model to studythe long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk. in particular, we adoptpublished photoevaporation prescriptions and examine whether thephotoevaporative loss alone, coupled with a range of initial angular momenta ofthe protostellar cloud, can explain the observed decline of the frequency ofoptically-thick dusty disks with increasing age. in the parameter space weexplore, disks have accreting and/or non-accreting transitional phases lastingof $\lesssim20 %$ of their lifetime, which is in reasonable agreement withobserved statistics. assuming that photoevaporation controls disk clearing, wefind that initial angular momentum distribution of clouds needs to be weightedin favor of slowly rotating protostellar cloud cores. again, assuming innerdisk dispersal by photoevaporation, we conjecture that this skewed angularmomentum distribution is a result of fragmentation into binary or multiplestellar systems in rapidly-rotating cores. accreting and non-accretingtransitional disks show different evolutionary paths on the $\dot{m}-r_{\rmwall}$ plane, which possibly explains the different observed properties betweenthe two populations. however, we further find that scaling the photoevaporationrates downward by a factor of 10 makes it difficult to clear the disks on theobserved timescales, showing that the precise value of the photoevaporativeloss is crucial to setting the clearing times. while our results apply only topure photoevaporative loss (plus disk accretion), there may be implications formodels in which planets clear disks preferentially at radii of order 10 au.

1409.3891	accretion outbursts in self-gravitating protoplanetary disks	we improve on our previous treatments of long-term evolution of protostellardisks by explicitly solving disk self-gravity in two dimensions. the currentmodel is an extension of the one-dimensional layered accretion disk model ofbae et al. we find that gravitational instability (gi)-induced spiral densitywaves heat disks via compressional heating (i.e. $p\rm{d}v$ work), and cantrigger accretion outbursts by activating the magnetorotational instability(mri) in the magnetically inert disk dead-zone. the gi-induced spiral wavespropagate well inside of gravitationally unstable region before they triggeroutbursts at $r \lesssim 1$ au where gi cannot be sustained. this long-rangepropagation of waves cannot be reproduced with the previously used local$\alpha$ treatments for gi. in our standard model where zero dead-zone residualviscosity ($\alpha_{\rm rd}$) is assumed, the gi-induced stress measured at theonset of outbursts is locally as large as $0.01$ in terms of the generic$\alpha$ parameter. however, as suggested in our previous one-dimensionalcalculations, we confirm that the presence of a small but finite $\alpha_{\rmrd}$ triggers thermally-driven bursts of accretion instead of the gi +mri-driven outbursts that are observed when $\alpha_{\rm rd}=0$. the inclusionof non-zero residual viscosity in the dead-zone decreases the importance of gisoon after mass feeding from the envelope cloud ceases. during the infall phasewhile the central protostar is still embedded, our models stay in a quiescentaccretion phase with $\dot{m}_{acc}\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}~m_{\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$over $60~\%$ of the time and spend less than $15~\%$ of the infall phase inaccretion outbursts.

1411.1026	characterizing the youngest herschel-detected protostars i. envelope  structure revealed by carma dust continuum observations	we present carma 2.9 mm dust continuum emission observations of a sample of14 herschel-detected class 0 protostars in the orion a and b molecular clouds,drawn from the pacs bright red sources (pbrs) sample (stutz et al.). theseobjects are characterized by very red 24 \micron\ to 70 \micron\ colors andprominent submillimeter emission, suggesting that they are very young class 0protostars embedded in dense envelopes. we detect all of the pbrs in 2.9 mmcontinuum emission and emission from 4 protostars and 1 starless core in thefields toward the pbrs; we also report 1 new pbrs source. the ratio of 2.9 mmluminosity to bolometric luminosity is higher by a factor of $\sim$5 onaverage, compared to other well-studied protostars in the perseus and ophiuchusclouds. the 2.9 mm visibility amplitudes for 6 of the 14 pbrs are very flat asa function of uv-distance, with more than 50\% of the source emission arisingfrom radii $&lt;$ 1500 au. these flat visibility amplitudes are most consistentwith spherically symmetric envelope density profiles with$\rho$~$\propto$~r$^{-2.5}$. alternatively, there could be a massive unresolvedstructure like a disk or a high-density inner envelope departing from a smoothpower-law. the large amount of mass on scales $&lt;$ 1500 au (implying highaverage central densities) leads us to suggest that that the pbrs with flatvisibility amplitude profiles are the youngest pbrs and may be undergoing abrief phase of high mass infall/accretion and are possibly among the youngestclass 0 protostars. the pbrs with more rapidly declining visibility amplitudesstill have large envelope masses, but could be slightly more evolved.

0804.1795	a large-scale optical-near infrared survey for brown dwarfs and very  low-mass stars in the orion ob1 association	we report the initial results of a large-scale optical-near infrared surveyto extend the known young population of the entire orion star-forming regiondown to the substellar domain. using deep optical i-band photometry and datafrom the 2mass survey, we selected candidates across ~14.8 deg^2 in the ~8 myrold ori ob1a subassociation and over ~6.7 deg^2 in the ori ob1b subassociation(age ~3), with completeness down to 0.05mo and 0.072mo respectively. weobtained low resolution optical spectra for a subsample of 4 candidates in oriob1a and 26 in ori ob1b; as a result we confirmed 3 new members in ori ob1a,one of which is substellar, and 19 new members in ori ob1b, out of which 7 areat the substellar limit and 5 are substellar. we looked into the presence ofaccretion signatures by measuring the strength of the ha line in emission.accordingly, we classified the new members as having classical t-tauri star(ctts) or weak lined t tauri star-like (wtts) nature. we found that all the newmembers confirmed in ori ob1a are wttss, while 39 +25/-22 % of the new membersin ori ob1b exhibit ctts-like behavior, suggestive of ongoing accretion from acircum(sub)stellar disk. additionally we found that none of the membersconfirmed in ob1a show near-ir color excess while 38 +26/-21 % of ob1b membersshow h-k color excess. these results are consistent with recent findings forlow mass young stars in orion ob1. the similarity in ctts-like properties andnear-ir excess across the substellar boundary gives support to the idea of acommon formation mechanism for low mass stars and at least the most massivebrown dwarfs. finally, we remark the discovery of two new members classified ascttss, both exhibiting w(ha) &lt; -140 a, suggesting significant ongoingaccretion.

1501.06609	csi 2264: characterizing young stars in ngc 2264 with short-duration,  periodic flux dips in their light curves	we identify nine young stellar objects (ysos) in the ngc 2264 star-formingregion with optical {\em corot} light curves exhibiting short-duration,shallow, periodic flux dips. all of these stars have infrared (ir) excessesthat are consistent with their having inner disk walls near the keplerianco-rotation radius. the repeating photometric dips have fwhm generally lessthan one day, depths almost always less than 15%, and periods (3&lt;p&lt;11 days)consistent with dust near the keplerian co-rotation period. the flux dips varyconsiderably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist forseveral weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected on successiveyears. for several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotationperiod and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted bystandard "disk-locking" models. we attribute these flux dips to clumps ofmaterial in or near the inner disk wall, passing through our line of sight tothe stellar photosphere. in some cases, these dips are also present insimultaneous {\em spitzer} irac light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. wecharacterize the properties of these dips, and compare the stars with lightcurves exhibiting this behavior to other classes of yso in ngc 2264. a numberof physical mechanisms could locally increase the dust scale height near theinner disk wall, and we discuss several of those mechanisms; the most plausiblemechanisms are either a disk warp due to interaction with the stellar magneticfield or dust entrained in funnel-flow accretion columns arising near the innerdisk wall.

1503.02694	are protoplanetary disks born with vortices? -- rossby wave instability  driven by protostellar infall	we carry out two-fluid, two-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations totest whether protostellar infall can trigger rossby wave instability (rwi) inprotoplanetry disks. our results show that infall can trigger the rwi andgenerate vortices near the outer edge of the mass landing on the disk (i.e.centrifugal radius). we find that the rwi is triggered under a variety ofconditions, although the details depend on the disk parameters and the infallpattern. the common key feature of triggering the rwi is the steep radialgradient of the azimuthal velocity induced by the local increase in density atthe outer edge of the infall region. vortices form when the instability entersthe nonlinear regime. in our standard model where self-gravity is neglected,vortices merge together to a single vortex within $\sim 20$ local orbitaltimes, and the merged vortex survives for the remaining duration of thecalculation ($&gt; 170$ local orbital times). the vortex takes part in outwardangular momentum transport, with a reynolds stress of $\lesssim10^{-2}$. ourtwo-fluid calculations show that vortices efficiently trap dust particles withstopping times of the order of the orbital time, locally enhancing the dust togas ratio for particles of the appropriate size by a factor of $\sim 40$ in ourstandard model. when self-gravity is considered, however, vortices tend to beimpeded from merging and may eventually dissipate. we conclude it may well havethat protoplanetary disks have favorable conditions for vortex formation duringthe protostellar infall phase, which might enhance early planetary coreformation.

1510.08478	signatures of star cluster formation by cold collapse	sub-virial gravitational collapse is one mechanism by which star clusters mayform. here we investigate whether this mechanism can be inferred fromobservations of young clusters. to address this question, we have computed sphsimulations of the initial formation and evolution of a dynamically young starcluster through cold (sub-virial) collapse, starting with an ellipsoidal,turbulently seeded distribution of gas, and forming sink particles representing(proto)stars. while the initial density distributions of the clouds do not havelarge initial mass concentrations, gravitational focusing due to the globalmorphology leads to cluster formation. we use the resulting structures toextract observable morphological and kinematic signatures for the case ofsub-virial collapse. we find that the signatures of the initial conditions canbe erased rapidly as the gas and stars collapse, suggesting that kinematicobservations need to be made either early in cluster formation and/or at largerscales, away from the growing cluster core. our results emphasize that adynamically young system is inherently evolving on short timescales, so that itcan be highly misleading to use current-epoch conditions to study aspects suchas star formation rates as a function of local density. our simulations serveas a starting point for further studies of collapse including other factorssuch as magnetic fields and stellar feedback.

0806.2639	a spitzer view of protoplanetary disks in the gamma velorum cluster	we present new spitzer space telescope observations of stars in the young ~5myr gamma velorum stellar cluster. combining optical and 2mass photometry, wehave selected 579 stars as candidate members of the cluster. with the additionof the spitzer mid-infrared data, we have identified 5 debris disks arounda-type stars, and 5-6 debris disks around solar-type stars, indicating that thestrong radiation field in the cluster does not completely suppress theproduction of planetesimals in the disks of cluster members. however, we findsome evidence that the frequency of circumstellar primordial disks is lower,and the ir flux excesses are smaller than for disks around stellar populationswith similar ages. this could be evidence for a relatively fast dissipation ofcircumstellar dust by the strong radiation field from the highest mass star(s)in the cluster. another possibility is that gamma velorum stellar cluster isslightly older than reported ages and the the low frequency of primordial disksreflects the fast disk dissipation observed at ~5 myr.

0806.3715	long-wavelength excesses of fu orionis objects: flared outer disks or  infalling envelopes?	the mid- to far-infrared emission of the outbursting fu orionis objects hasbeen attributed either to a flared outer disk or to an infalling envelope. werevisit this issue using detailed radiative transfer calculations to model therecent, high signal-to-noise data from the irs instrument on the {spitzer spacetelescope}. in the case of fu ori, we find that a physically-plausible flareddisk irradiated by the central accretion disk matches the observations.building on our previous work, our accretion disk model with outer diskirradiation by the inner disk reproduces the spectral energy distributionbetween ~4000 angstroms to ~40 microns. our model is consistent withnear-infrared interferometry but there are some inconsistencies withmid-infared interferometric results. including the outer disk allows us torefine our estimate of the outer radius of the outbursting, high mass accretionrate disk in fu ori as ~ 0.5 au, which is a crucial parameter in assessingtheories of the fu orionis phenomenon. we are able to place an upper limit onthe mass infall rate of any remnant envelope infall rate to ~ 7e-7 msun/yrassuming a centrifugal radius of 200 au. the fuor bbw 76 is also well modelledby a 0.6 au inner disk and a flared outer disk. however, v1515 cyg requires anenvelope with an outflow cavity to adequately reproduce the irs spectrum. incontrast with the suggestion by green et al., we do not require a flattenedenvelope to match the observations; the inferred cavity shape is qualitativelyconsistent with typical protostellar envelopes. this variety of dustystructures suggests that the fu orionis phase can be present at either early orlate stages of protostellar evolution.

0808.1078	rapid molecular cloud and star formation: mechanisms and movies	we demonstrate that the observationally inferred rapid onset of starformation after parental molecular clouds have assembled can be achieved byflow-driven cloud formation of atomic gas, using our previous three-dimensionalnumerical simulations. we post-process these simulations to approximate coformation, which allows us to investigate the times at which co becomesabundant relative to the onset of cloud collapse. we find that global gravityin a finite cloud has two crucial effects on cloud evolution. (a) lateralcollapse (perpendicular to the flows sweeping up the cloud) leads to rapidlyincreasing column densities above the accumulation from the one-dimensionalflow. this in turn allows fast formation of co, allowing the molecular cloud to``appear'' rapidly. (b) global gravity is required to drive the dense gas tothe high pressures necessary to form solar-mass cores, in support of recentanalytical models of cloud fragmentation. while the clouds still appear``supersonically turbulent'', this turbulence is relegated to playing asecondary role, in that it is to some extent a consequence of gravitationalforces.

astro-ph;0010051	infall models of class 0 protostars	we have carried out radiative transfer calculations of infalling, dustyenvelopes surrounding embedded protostars to understand the observed propertiesof the recently identified ``class 0'' sources. to match the far-infrared peaksin the spectral energy distributions of objects such as the prototype class 0source vla 1623, pure collapse models require mass infall rates$\sim10^{-4}\msun$yr$^{-1}$. the radial intensity distributions predicted bysuch infall models are inconsistent with observations of vla 1623 at sub-mmwavelengths, in agreement with the results of andre et al. (1993) who found adensity profile of $\rho \propto r^{-1/2}$ rather than the expected $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ gradient. to resolve this conflict, while still invokinginfall to produce the outflow source at the center of vla 1623, we suggest thatthe observed sub-mm intensity distribution is the sum of two components: aninner infall zone, plus an outer, more nearly constant-density region. thisexplanation of the observations requires that roughly half the total massobserved within 2000 au radius of the source lies in a region external to theinfall zone. the column densities for this external region are comparable tothose found in the larger oph a cloud within which vla 1623 is embedded. theextreme environments of class 0 sources lead us to suggest an alternative oradditional interpretation of these objects: rather than simply concluding withandre et al. that class 0 objects only represent the earliest phases ofprotostellar collapse, and ultimately evolve into older ``class i'' protostars,we suggest that many class 0 sources could be the protostars of very denseregions.

astro-ph;0108023	rapid formation of molecular clouds and stars in the solar neighborhood	observations of both star-forming regions and young, gas-free stellarassociations indicate that most nearby molecular clouds form stars only over ashort time span before dispersal; large-scale flows in the diffuse interstellarmedium have the potential for forming clouds sufficiently rapidly, and forproducing stellar populations with ages much less than the lateral crossingtimes of their host molecular clouds. we identify four important factors forunderstanding rapid star formation and short cloud lifetimes. first, much ofthe accumulation and dispersal of clouds near the solar circle might occur inthe atomic phase; only the high-density portion of a cloud's lifecycle is spentin the molecular phase, thus helping to limit molecular cloud ``lifetimes''.second, once a cloud achieves a high enough column density to form $\h2$ andco, gravitational forces become larger than typical interstellar pressureforces; thus star formation can follow rapidly upon molecular gas formation andturbulent dissipation in limited areas of each cloud complex. third, typicalmagnetic fields are not strong enough to prevent rapid cloud formation andgravitational collapse. fourth, rapid dispersal of gas by newly-formed stars,and reduction of shielding by a small expansion of the cloud after the firstevents of star formation, might limit the length of the star formation epochand the lifetime of a cloud in its molecular state. this picture emphasizes theimportance of large-scale boundary conditions for understanding molecular cloudformation, and implies that star formation is a highly dynamic, rather thanquasi-static, process.

astro-ph;0201425	evidence for a developing gap in a 10 myr old protoplanetary disk	we have developed a self-consistent model of the disk around the nearby 10myr old star tw hya which matches the observed spectral energy distribution and7mm images of the disk. the model requires a significant dust size evolutionand a partially-evacuated inner disk region, as predicted by theories of planetformation. the outer disk, which extends to at least 140 au in radius, is veryoptically thick at ir wavelengths and quite massive ~0.06 msun for therelatively advanced age of this t tauri star. this implies long viscous anddust evolution timescales, although dust must have grown to sizes of order ~1cmto explain the sub-mm and mm spectral slopes. in contrast, the negligiblenear-infrared excess emission of this system requires that the disk beoptically thin inside ~4 au.this inner region cannot be completely evacuated;we need ~0.5 lunar mass of ~1 micron particles remaining to produce theobserved 10 micron silicate emission. our model requires a distinct transitionin disk properties at ~4 au, separating the inner and outer disk. the inneredge of the optically-thick outer disk must be heated almost frontally by thestar to account for the excess flux at mid-ir wavelengths. we speculate thatthis truncation of the outer disk may be the signpost of a developing gap dueto the effects of a growing protoplanet; the gap is still presumably evolvingbecause material still resides in it, as indicated by the silicate emission,the molecular hydrogen emission, and by the continued accretion onto thecentral star (albeit at a much lower rate than typical of younger t tauristars). tw hya thus may become the rosetta stone for our understanding of theevolution and dissipation of protoplanetary disks.

astro-ph;0207216	flows, fragmentation, and star formation. i. low-mass stars in taurus	the remarkably filamentary spatial distribution of young stars in the taurusmolecular cloud has significant implications for understanding low-mass starformation in relatively quiescent conditions. the large scale and regularspacing of the filaments suggests that small-scale turbulence is of limitedimportance, which could be consistent with driving on large scales by flowswhich produced the cloud. the small spatial dispersion of stars from gaseousfilaments indicates that the low-mass stars are generally born with smallvelocity dispersions relative to their natal gas, of order the sound speed orless. the spatial distribution of the stars exhibits a mean separation of about0.25 pc, comparable to the estimated jeans length in the densest gaseousfilaments, and is consistent with roughly uniform density along the filaments.the efficiency of star formation in filaments is much higher than elsewhere,with an associated higher frequency of protostars and accreting t tauri stars.the protostellar cores generally are aligned with the filaments, suggestingthat they are produced by gravitational fragmentation, resulting in initiallyquasi-prolate cores. given the absence of massive stars which could stronglydominate cloud dynamics, taurus provides important tests of theories ofdispersed low-mass star formation and numerical simulations of molecular cloudstructure and evolution.

astro-ph;0209498	viscous diffusion and photoevaporation of stellar disks	the evolution of a stellar disk under the influence of viscous evolution,photoevaporation from the central source, and photoevaporation by externalstars is studied. we take the typical parameters of ttss and the trapeziumcluster conditions. the photoionizing flux from the central source is assumedto arise both from the quiescent star and accretion shocks at the base ofstellar magnetospheric columns, along which material from the disk accretes.the accretion flux is calculated self-consistently from the accretion mass lossrate. we find that the disk cannot be entirely removed using only viscousevolution and photoionization from the disk-star accretion shock. however, whenfuv photoevaporation by external massive stars is included the disk is removedin 10^6 -10^7yr; and when euv photoevaporation by external massive stars isincluded the disk is removed in 10^5 - 10^6yr.  an intriguing feature of photoevaporation by the central star is theformation of a gap in the disk at late stages of the disk evolution. as the gapstarts forming, viscous spreading and photoevaporation work in resonance.  there is no gap formation for disks nearby external massive stars because theouter annuli are quickly removed by the dominant euv flux. on the other hand,at larger, more typical distances (d&gt;&gt;0.03pc) from the external stars the fluxis fuv dominated. as a consequence, the disk is efficiently evaporated at twodifferent locations; forming a gap during the last stages of the diskevolution.

astro-ph;0304531	the spatial distribution of fluorescent h$_2$ near t tau	new subarcsecond fuv observations of t tau with hst/stis show spatiallyresolved structures in the 2"x2" area around the star. the structures show inmultiline emission of fluorescent h_2 pumped by lyman alpha. one emissionstructure follows the cavity walls observed around t tau n in scattered lightin the optical. a temperature greater or equal to 1000k is required to haveenough population in the h_2 to produce the observed fluorescent lines; in thecool environment of the t tau system, shock heating is required to achieve thistemperature at distances of a few tens of au. fluorescent h_2 along the cavitywall represents the best evidence to date for the action of low-density,wide-opening-angle outflows driving cavities into the molecular medium atscales smaller than 100 au. a southern region of emission consists of two arcs,with shape and orientation similar to the arcs of h_2 2.12 microns andforbidden line emission crossing the outflow associated with the embeddedsystem t tau s. this region is located near the centroid of forbidden lineemission at the blueshifted lobe of the n-s outflow.

astro-ph;0310067	unveiling the inner disk structure of t tauri stars	we present near-infrared spectra of the excess continuum emission from theinnermost regions of classical t tauri disks. in almost all cases, the shape ofthe excess is consistent with that of a single-temperature blackbody with t ~1400 k, similar to the expected dust sublimation temperature for typical dustcompositions. the amount of excess flux roughly correlates with the accretionluminosity in objects with similar stellar properties. we compare ourobservations with the predictions of simple disk models having an inner rimlocated at the dust sublimation radius, including irradiation heating of thedust from both the stellar and accretion luminosities. the models yield innerrim radii in the range 0.07-0.54 au, increasing with higher stellar andaccretion luminosities. using typical parameters which fit our observed sample,we predict a rim radius ~ 0.2 au for the t tauri star dg tau, which agrees withrecent keck near-infrared interferometric measurements. for large massaccretion rates, the inner rim lies beyond the corotation radius at (or within)which magnetospheric accretion flows are launched, which implies that puregaseous disks must extend inside the dust rim. thus, for a significant fractionof young stars, dust cannot exist in the innermost disk, calling into questiontheories in which solid particles are ejected by a wind originating at themagnetospheric radius.

astro-ph;0409680	collapse and fragmentation in finite sheets	we present two-dimensional simulations of finite, self-gravitating gaseoussheets. unlike the case of infinite sheets, such configurations do notconstitute equilibrium states but instead are subject to global collapse unlesscountered by pressure forces or rotation. the initial effect of finite geometryis to promote concentrations of material at the edges of the sheet. if thesheet is not perfectly circular, gravitational focussing results in enhancedconcentrations of mass. in the second-most simple geometry, that of anelliptical outer boundary, the general result is collapse to a filamentarystructure with the densest concentrations of mass at the ends of the filament.we suggest that these simple calculations have interesting implications for thegravitational evolution of overall molecular cloud structure, envisioning thatsuch clouds might originate as roughly sheetlike sections of gas accumulated asa result of large-scale flows in the local interstellar medium. we show someexamples of local clouds with overall filamentary shape and denserconcentrations of mass and star clusters near the ends of the overall extendedstructure, suggestive of our simple ellipse collapse calculations. we suggestthat cluster-forming gas is often concentrated as a result of gravity acting onirregular boundaries; this mechanism can result in very rapid infall of gaswhich may be of importance to the formation of massive stars. this picturesuggests that much of the supersonic ``turbulence'' observed in molecularclouds might be gravitationally-generated. our results may provide impetus forfurther theoretical explorations of global gravitational effects in molecularclouds and their implications for generating the substructure needed forfragmentation into stars and clusters.

astro-ph;0410494	herbig ae/be stars in nearby ob associations	we have carried out a study of the early type stars in nearby ob associationsspanning an age range of $\sim$ 3 to 16 myr, with the aim of determining thefraction of stars which belong to the herbig ae/be class. we studied the b, a,and f stars in the nearby ($\le 500$ pc) ob associations upper scorpius,perseus ob2, lacerta ob1, and orion ob1, with membership determined fromhipparcos data. we obtained spectra for 440 hipparcos stars in theseassociations, from which we determined accurate spectral types, visualextinctions, effective temperatures, luminosities and masses, using hipparcosphotometry. using colors corrected for reddening, we find that the herbig ae/bestars and the classical be stars (cbe) occupy clearly different regions in thejhk diagram. thus, we use the location on the jhk diagram, as well as thepresence of emission lines and of strong 12 microns flux relative to the visualto identify the herbig ae/be stars in the associations. we find that the herbigae/be stars constitute a small fraction of the early type stellar populationeven in the younger associations. comparing the data from associations withdifferent ages and assuming that the near-infrared excess in the herbig ae/bestars arises from optically thick dusty inner disks, we determined theevolution of the inner disk frequency with age. we find that the inner diskfrequency in the age range 3 - 10 myr in intermediate mass stars is lower thanthat in the low mass stars (&lt; 1msun). this indicates that the time-scales fordisk evolution are much shorter in the intermediate mass stars, which could bea consequence of more efficient mechanisms of inner disk dispersal (viscousevolution, dust growth and settling toward the midplane).

astro-ph;0411522	the truncated disk of coku tau/4	we present a model of a dusty disk with an inner hole which accounts for thespitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph observations of the low-masspre-main sequence star coku tau/4. we have modeled the mid-ir spectrum (between8 and 25 mic) as arising from the inner wall of a disk. our model disk has anevacuated inner zone of radius ~ 10 au, with a dusty inner ``wall'', ofhalf-height ~ 2 au, that is illuminated at normal incidence by the centralstar. the radiative equilibrium temperature decreases from the inner disk edgeoutward through the optically-thick disk; this temperature gradient isresponsible for the emission of the silicate bands at 10 and 20 mic. theobserved spectrum is consistent with being produced by fe-mg amorphous glassyolivine and/or pyroxene, with no evidence of a crystalline component. themid-infrared spectrum of coku tau/4 is reminiscent of that of the much olderstar tw hya, where it has been suggested that the significant clearing of itsinner disk is due to planet formation. however, no inner disk remains in cokutau/4, consistent with the star being a weak-emission (non-accreting) t tauristar. the relative youth of coku tau/4 (~ 1 myr) may indicate much more rapidplanet formation than typically assumed.

astro-ph;0505323	irac observations of taurus pre-main sequence stars	we present infrared photometry obtained with the irac camera on the spitzerspace telescope of a sample of 82 pre-main sequence stars and brown dwarfs inthe taurus star-forming region. we find a clear separation in some iraccolor-color diagrams between objects with and without disks. a few``transition'' objects are noted, which correspond to systems in which theinner disk has been evacuated of small dust. separating pure disk systems fromobjects with remnant protostellar envelopes is more difficult at iracwavelengths, especially for objects with infall at low rates and large angularmomenta. our results generally confirm the irac color classification schemeused in previous papers by allen et al. and megeath et al. to distinguishbetween protostars, t tauri stars with disks, and young stars without (inner)disks. the observed irac colors are in good agreement with recent improved diskmodels, and in general accord with models for protostellar envelopes derivedfrom analyzing a larger wavelength region. we also comment on a few taurusobjects of special interest. our results should be useful for interpreting iracresults in other, less well-studied star-forming regions.

astro-ph;0506159	wide-angle wind driven bipolar outflows: high resolution models with  application to source i of the becklin-neugebauer / kleinmann-low omc-i  region	we carry out high resolution simulations of the inner regions of a wide anglewind driven bipolar outflow using an adaptive mesh refinement code. our codefollows h-he gas with molecular, atomic and ionic components and the associatedtime dependent molecular chemistry and ionization dynamics with radiativecooling. our simulations explore the nature of the outflow when a sphericalwind expands into a rotating, collapsing envelope. we compare with keyobservational properties of the outflow system of source i in the bn/kl region.  our calculations show that the wind evacuates a bipolar outflow cavity in theinfalling envelope. we find the head of the outflow to be unstable and that itrapidly fragments into clumps. we resolve the dynamics of the strong shearlayer which defines the side walls of the cavity. we conjecture that this layeris the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotationalproperties. the shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edgeretains its angular momentum. this rotation is roughly consistent with thatobserved in the source i sio maser spots. the observed proper motions andline-of-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. the cavityshell at the base of the flow assumes an x-shaped morphology which is alsoconsistent with source i. we conclude that the wide opening angle of theoutflow is evidence that a wide-angle wind drives the source i outflow and nota collimated jet.

astro-ph;0511564	effects of dust growth and settling in t tauri disks	we present self-consistent disk models for t tauri stars which include aparameterized treatment of dust settling and grain growth, building ontechniques developed in a series of papers by d'alessio etal. the modelsincorporate depleted distributions of dust in upper disk layers along withlarger-sized particles near the disk midplane, as expected theoretically and aswe suggested earlier is necessary to account for mm-wave emission, seds,scattered light images, and silicate emission features simultaneously. bycomparing the models with recent mid- and near-ir observations, we find thatthe dust to gas mass ratio of small grains at the upper layers should be &lt; 10 %of the standard value. the grains that have disappeared from the upper layersincrease the dust to gas mass ratio of the disk interior; if those grains growto maximum sizes of the order of mm during the settling process, then both themillimeter-wave fluxes and spectral slopes can be consistently explained.depletion and growth of grains can also enhance the ionization of upper layers,enhancing the possibility of the magnetorotational instability for driving diskaccretion.

astro-ph;0605294	why do t tauri disks accrete?	observations of t tauri stars and young brown dwarfs suggest that theaccretion rates of their disks scale strongly with the central stellar mass,approximately $\mdot \propto m_*^2$. no dependence of accretion rate on stellarmass is predicted by the simplest version of the layered disk model of gammie(1996), in which non-thermal ionization of upper disk layers allows accretionto occur via the magnetorotational instability. we show that a minormodification of gammie's model to include heating by irradiation from thecentral star yields a modest dependence of $\mdot$ upon the mass of the centralstar. a purely viscous disk model could provide a strong dependence ofaccretion rate on stellar mass if the initial disk radius (before much viscousevolution has occurred) has a strong dependence on stellar mass. however, it isfar from clear that at least the most massive pre-main sequence disks can betotally magnetically activated by x-rays or cosmic rays. we suggest that acombination of effects are responsible for the observed dependence, with thelowest-mass stars having the lowest mass disks, which can be thoroughlymagnetically active, while the higher-mass stars have higher mass disks whichhave layered accretion and relatively inactive or ``dead'' central zones atsome radii. in such dead zones, we suggest that gravitational instabilities mayplay a role in allowing accretion to proceed. in this connection, we emphasizethe uncertainty in disk masses derived from dust emission, and argue that ttauri disk masses have been systematically underestimated by conventionalanalyses. further study of accretion rates, especially in the lowest-massstars, would help to clarify the mechanisms of accretion in t tauri stars.

astro-ph;0609679	on the structure of the orion a cloud and the formation of the orion  nebula cluster	we suggest that the orion a cloud is gravitationally collapsing on largescales, and is producing the orion nebula cluster due to the focusing effectsof gravity acting within a finite cloud geometry. in support of thissuggestion, we show how an elliptical rotating sheet of gas with a modestdensity gradient along the major axis can collapse to produce a structurequalitatively resembling orion a, with a fan-shaped structure at one end,ridges or filaments along the fan, and a narrow curved filament at the otherend reminiscent of the famous integral-shaped filament. the model produces alocal concentration of mass within the narrow filament which in principle couldform a dense cluster of stars like that of the orion nebula. we suggest thatglobal gravitational contraction might be a more common feature of molecularclouds than previously recognized, and that the formation of star clusters is adynamic process resulting from the focusing effects of gravity acting upon thegeometry of finite clouds.

0706.0279	hubble and spitzer observations of an edge-on circumstellar disk around  a brown dwarf	we present observations of a circumstellar disk that is inclined close toedge-on around a young brown dwarf in the taurus star-forming region. usingdata obtained with spex at the nasa infrared telescope facility, we find thatthe slope of the 0.8-2.5 um spectrum of the brown dwarf 2mass j04381486+2611399cannot be reproduced with a photosphere reddened by normal extinction. instead,the slope is consistent with scattered light, indicating that circumstellarmaterial is occulting the brown dwarf. by combining the spex data with mid-irphotometry and spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope and previouslypublished millimeter data from scholz and coworkers, we construct the spectralenergy distribution for 2mass j04381486+2611399 and model it in terms of ayoung brown dwarf surrounded by an irradiated accretion disk. the presence ofboth silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrains theinclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 deg from edge-on. additionalevidence of the high inclination of this disk is provided by our detection ofasymmetric bipolar extended emission surrounding 2mass j04381486+2611399 inhigh-resolution optical images obtained with the hubble space telescope.according to our modeling for the sed and images of this system, the diskcontains a large inner hole that is indicative of a transition disk (r_in~58r_star~0.275 au) and is somewhat larger than expected from embryo ejectionmodels (r_out=20-40 au vs. r_out&lt;10-20 au).

0811.1762	non-steady accretion in protostars	observations indicate that mass accretion rates onto low-mass protostars aregenerally lower than the rates of infall to their disks; this suggests thatmuch of the protostellar mass must be accreted during rare, short outbursts ofrapid accretion. we explore when protostellar disk accretion is likely to behighly variable. while constant $\alpha$ disks can in principle adjust theiraccretion rates to match infall rates, protostellar disks are unlikely to haveconstant $\alpha$. in particular we show that neither models with angularmomentum ransport due solely to the magnetorotational instability (mri) norravitational instability (gi) are likely to transport disk mass at rotostellarinfall rates over the large range of radii needed to move infalling envelopematerial down to the central protostar. we show that the mri and gi are likelyto combine to produce outbursts of rapid accretion starting at a few au. ouranalysis is consistent with the time-dependent models of armitage, livio, &amp;pringle (2001) and agrees with our observational study of the outburstingobject fu ori.
