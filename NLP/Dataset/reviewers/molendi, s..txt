0902.4857	galaxy clusters and the cosmic cycle of baryons across cosmic times	we discuss the central role played by the x-ray study of hot baryons withingalaxy clusters to reconstruct the assembly of cosmic structures and to tracethe past history of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes(bhs). we shortly review the progress in this field contributed by the currentgeneration of x-ray telescopes. then, we focus on the outstanding scientificquestions that have been opened by observations carried out in the last yearsand that represent the legacy of chandra and xmm: (a) when and how is entropyinjected into the inter-galactic medium (igm)? (b) what is the history of metalenrichment of the igm? (c) what physical mechanisms determine the presence ofcool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) how is the appearance of proto-clusters atz~2 related to the peak of star formation activity and bh accretion? we showthat a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is tocarry out a large-area x-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to thatof deep chandra and xmm pointings, but extending over several thousands ofsquare degrees. a similar survey can only be carried out with a wide-fieldx-ray telescope (wfxt), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp psfacross the entire fov. we emphasize the important synergies that wfxt will havewith a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from theradio to the x-ray bands. finally, we discuss the immense legacy value thatsuch a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at large.

0909.1224	metal abundances in the cool-cores of galaxy clusters	we use xmm-newton data to carry out a detailed study of the si, fe and niabundances in the cool cores of a representative sample of 26 local clusters.we have performed a careful evaluation of the systematic uncertainties relatedto the instruments, the plasma codes and the spectral modeling finding that themajor source of uncertainty is in the plasma codes. our si, fe, ni, si/fe andni/fe distributions feature only moderate spreads (from 20% to 30%) aroundtheir mean values strongly suggesting similar enrichment processes at work inall our cluster cores. our sample averaged si/fe ratio is comparable to thosemeasured in samples of groups and high luminosity ellipticals implying that theenrichment process in ellipticals, dominant galaxies in groups and bcgs inclusters is quite similar. although our si/fe and ni/fe abundance ratios arefairly well constrained, the large uncertainties in the supernovae yieldsprevent us from making a firm assessment of the relative contribution of typeia and core-collapsed supernovae to the enrichment process. all that can reallybe said with some certainty is that both contribute to the enrichment ofcluster cores.

0910.4900	cool core remnants in galaxy clusters	x ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "cool core" (cc)and "non cool core" (ncc) objects, on the basis of the observational propertiesof their central regions. recent results have shown that the cluster populationis bimodal (cavagnolo et al. 2009). we want to understand whether the observeddistribution of clusters is due to a primordial division into two distinctclasses rather than to differences in how these systems evolve across cosmictime. we systematically search the icm of ncc clusters in a subsample of theb55 flux limited sample of clusters for regions which have some characteristicstypical of cool cores, namely low entropy gas and high metal abundance we findthat most ncc clusters in our sample host regions reminiscent of cc, i. e.characterized by relative low entropy gas (albeit not as low as in cc systems)and a metal abundance excess. we have dubbed these structures "cool coreremnants", since we interpret them as what remains of a cool core after aheating event (agn giant outbursts in a few cases and more commonly mergers).we infer that most ncc clusters have undergone a cool core phase during theirlife. the fact that most cool core remnants are found in dynamically activeobjects provides strong support to scenarios where cluster core properties arenot fixed "ab initio" but evolve across cosmic time.

1009.3266	mass profiles and concentration-dark matter relation in x-ray luminous  galaxy clusters	(abriged) assuming that the hydrostatic equilibrium holds between theintracluster medium and the gravitational potential, we constrain the nfwprofiles in a sample of 44 x-ray luminous galaxy clusters observed withxmm-newton in the redshift range 0.1-0.3. we evaluate several systematicuncertainties that affect our reconstruction of the x-ray masses. we measurethe concentration c200, the dark mass m200 and the gas mass fraction withinr500 in all the objects of our sample, providing the largest dataset of massparameters for galaxy clusters in this redshift range. we confirm that a tightcorrelation between c200 and m200 is present and in good agreement with thepredictions from numerical simulations and previous observations. when weconsider a subsample of relaxed clusters that host a low-entropy-core (lec), wemeasure a flatter c-m relation with a total scatter that is lower by 40 percent. from the distribution of the estimates of c200 and m200, with associatedstatistical (15-25%) and systematic (5-15%) errors, we use the predicted valuesfrom semi-analytic prescriptions calibrated through n-body numerical runs andmeasure sigma_8*omega_m^(0.60+-0.03)= 0.45+-0.01 (at 2 sigma level, statisticalonly) for the subsample of the clusters where the mass reconstruction has beenobtained more robustly, and sigma_8*omega_m^(0.56+-0.04) = 0.39+-0.02 for thesubsample of the 11 more relaxed lec objects. with the further constraint fromthe fgas distribution in our sample, we break the degeneracy in thesigma_8-omega_m plane and obtain the best-fit values sigma_8~1.0+-0.2(0.75+-0.18 when the subsample of the more relaxed objects is considered) andomega_m = 0.26+-0.01.

1011.3302	the cool-core bias in x-ray galaxy cluster samples i: method and  application to hiflugcs	when selecting flux-limited cluster samples, the detection efficiency ofx-ray instruments is not the same for centrally-peaked and flat objects, whichintroduces a bias in flux-limited cluster samples. we quantify this effect inthe case of a well-known cluster sample, hiflugcs. we simulate a population ofx-ray clusters with various surface-brightness profiles, and use theinstrumental characteristics of the rosat all-sky survey (rass) to selectflux-limited samples similar to the hiflugcs sample and predict the expectedbias. for comparison, we also estimate observationally the bias in the hiflugcssample using xmm-newton and rosat data. we find that the selection of x-raycluster samples is significantly biased ($\sim29%$) in favor of the peaked,cool-core (cc) objects, with respect to non-cool-core (ncc) systems.interestingly, we find that the bias affects the low-mass, nearby objects(groups, poor clusters) much more than the more luminous objects (i.e massiveclusters). we also note a moderate increase of the bias for the more distantsystems. observationally, we propose to select the objects according to theirflux in a well-defined physical range excluding the cores,$0.2r_{500}-r_{500}$, to get rid of the bias. from the fluxes in this range, wereject 13 clusters out of the 64 in the hiflugcs sample, none of which appearsto be ncc. as a result, we estimate that less than half (35-37%) of the galaxyclusters in the local universe are strong cc. in the paradigm where the ccobjects trace relaxed clusters as opposed to unrelaxed, merging objects, thisimplies that to the present day the majority of the objects are not in arelaxed state. from this result, we estimate a rate of heating events of$\sim1/3$ gyr$^{-1}$ per dark-matter halo.

1012.4793	gas temperature profiles in galaxy clusters with swift xrt: observations  and capabilities to map near r200	we investigate the possibility of using the x-ray telescope (xrt) on boardthe swift satellite to improve the current accuracy of the icm temperaturemeasurements in the region close to the virial radius of nearby clusters. wepresent the spectral analysis of the swift xrt observations of 6 galaxyclusters and their temperature profiles in the regions within 0.2-0.6 r200.four of them are nearby famous and very well studied objects (coma, abell 1795,abell 2029 and pks0745-19). the remaining two, swj1557+35 and swj0847+13, atredshift z=0.16 and z=0.36, were serendipitously observed by swift-xrt. weaccurately quantify the temperature uncertainties, with particular focus on theimpact of the background scatter (both instrumental and cosmic). we extrapolatethese results and simulate a deep observation of the external region of abell1795 which is assumed here as a case study. in particular we calculate theexpected uncertainties in the temperature measurement as far as r200. we findthat, with a fairly deep observation (300 ks), the swift xrt would be able tomeasure the icm temperature profiles in the external regions as far as thevirial radius, significantly improving the best accuracy among the previousmeasurements. this can be achieved thanks to the unprecedented combination ofgood psf over the full field of view and very accurate control of theinstrumental background. somehow unexpectedly we conclude that, among currentlyoperating telescope, the swift-xrt is the only potentially able to improve thecurrent accuracy in plasma temperature measurement at the edges of the clusterpotential. this will be true until a newgeneration of low-background and largefield of view telescopes, aimed to the study of galaxy clusters, will operate.these observations would be of great importance in developing the observingstrategy for suchmissions.

1103.2455	x-ray observations of pks 0745-191 at the virial radius: are we there  yet?	we wish to reassess the properties of the icm at large radii in the galaxycluster pks 0745-191 in light of the recent suzaku measurements. we analyze anarchival 10.5 ksec rosat/pspc observation to extract the surface-brightnessprofile of pks 0745-191 and infer the deprojected density profile. we thencompare the rosat surface-brightness profile with the suzaku result. we performa mass analysis combining the rosat density profile and the publishedtemperature profiles from different instruments. we find that the rosatsurface-brightness profile is statistically inconsistent (7.7 sigma) with thesuzaku result around and beyond the value of r200 estimated by suzaku. we arguethat, thanks to its large field of view and low background, rosat/pspc is tothe present day the most sensitive instrument to low surface-brightness x-rayemission in the 0.4-2.0 kev band. we also note that the suzaku temperature andmass profiles are at odds with the results from at least two other satellites(xmm-newton and swift). the difference in surface brightness between rosat andsuzaku is most likely explained by the existence of additional foregroundcomponents at the low galactic latitude of the source, which were not takeninto account in the suzaku background modeling. in light of our mass analysis,we conclude that any estimate of the fraction of the virial radius reached byx-ray measures is affected by systematic errors of the order of 25%. as aresult, the properties of the icm at the virial radius are still uncertain, andthe suzaku results should be considered with caution.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1106.4563	back and forth from cool core to non-cool core: clues from radio-halos	x-ray astronomers often divide galaxy clusters into two classes: "cool core"(cc) and "non-cool core" (ncc) objects. the origin of this dichotomy has beenthe subject of debate in recent years, between "evolutionary" models (whereclusters can evolve from cc to ncc, mainly through mergers) and "primordial"models (where the state of the cluster is fixed "ab initio" by early mergers orpre-heating). we found that in a well-defined sample (clusters in the gmrtradio halo survey with available chandra or xmm-newton data), none of theobjects hosting a giant radio halo can be classified as a cool core. thisresult suggests that the main mechanisms which can start a large scalesynchrotron emission (most likely mergers) are the same that can destroy cc andtherefore strongly supports "evolutionary" models of the cc-ncc dichotomy.moreover combining the number of objects in the cc and ncc state with thenumber of objects with and without a radio-halo, we estimated that the timescale over which a ncc cluster relaxes to the cc state, should be larger thanthe typical life-time of radio-halos and likely shorter than about 3 gyr. thissuggests that ncc transform into cc more rapidly than predicted from thecooling time, which is about 10 gyr in ncc systems, allowing the possibility ofa cyclical evolution between the cc and ncc states.

1111.0020	the gas distribution in the outer regions of galaxy clusters	we present the analysis of a local (z = 0.04 - 0.2) sample of 31 galaxyclusters with the aim of measuring the density of the x-ray emitting gas incluster outskirts. we compare our results with numerical simulations to setconstraints on the azimuthal symmetry and gas clumping in the outer regions ofgalaxy clusters. we exploit the large field-of-view and low instrumentalbackground of rosat/pspc to trace the density of the intracluster gas out tothe virial radius. we perform a stacking of the density profiles to detect asignal beyond r200 and measure the typical density and scatter in clusteroutskirts. we also compute the azimuthal scatter of the profiles with respectto the mean value to look for deviations from spherical symmetry. finally, wecompare our average density and scatter profiles with the results of numericalsimulations. as opposed to some recent suzaku results, and confirming previousevidence from rosat and chandra, we observe a steepening of the densityprofiles beyond \sim r500. comparing our density profiles with simulations, wefind that non-radiative runs predict too steep density profiles, whereas runsincluding additional physics and/or treating gas clumping are in betteragreement with the observed gas distribution. we report for the first time thehigh-confidence detection of a systematic difference between cool-core andnon-cool core clusters beyond \sim 0.3r200, which we explain by a differentdistribution of the gas in the two classes. beyond \sim r500, galaxy clustersdeviate significantly from spherical symmetry, with only little differencesbetween relaxed and disturbed systems. we find good agreement between theobserved and predicted scatter profiles, but only when the 1% densest clumpsare filtered out in the simulations.

1306.2319	the hot and energetic universe: the evolution of galaxy groups and  clusters	major astrophysical questions related to the formation and evolution ofstructures, and more specifically of galaxy groups and clusters, will still beopen in the coming decade and beyond: what is the interplay of galaxy,supermassive black hole, and intergalactic gas evolution in the most massiveobjects in the universe - galaxy groups and clusters? what are the processesdriving the evolution of chemical enrichment of the hot diffuse gas inlarge-scale structures? how and when did the first galaxy groups in theuniverse, massive enough to bind more than 10^7 k gas, form? focussing on theperiod when groups and clusters assembled (0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5), we show that, due to thecontinuum and line emission of this hot intergalactic gas at x-ray wavelengths,athena+, combining high sensitivity with excellent spectral and spatialresolution, will deliver breakthrough observations in view of theaforementioned issues. indeed, the physical and chemical properties of the hotintra-cluster gas, and their evolution across time, are a key to understand theco-evolution of galaxy and supermassive black hole within their environments.

1306.2322	the hot and energetic universe: the astrophysics of galaxy groups and  clusters	as the nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies trace the large-scaledistribution of matter in the universe. they are thus privileged sites in whichto investigate the complex physics of structure formation. however, thecomplete story of how these structures grow, and how they dissipate thegravitational and non-thermal components of their energy budget over cosmictime, is still beyond our grasp. fundamental questions such as how do hotdiffuse baryons accrete and dynamically evolve in dark matter potentials? howand when was the energy that we observe in the icm generated and distributed?where and when are heavy elements produced and how are they circulated? arestill unanswered. most of the cluster baryons exists in the form of a diffuse,hot, metal-enriched plasma that radiates primarily in the x-ray band (theintracluster medium, icm), allowing the x-ray observations of the evolvingcluster population to provide a unique opportunity to address these topics.athena+ with its large collecting area and unprecedented combination of highspectral and angular resolution offers the only way to make major advances inanswering these questions. athena+ will show how the baryonic gas evolves inthe dark matter potential wells by studying the motions and turbulence in theicm. athena+ will be able to resolve the accreting region both spatially andspectroscopically, probing the true nature and physical state of the x-rayemitting plasma. athena+ has the capabilities to permit a definitiveunderstanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structurethrough the study of the cluster population.

1310.8389	gas clumping in galaxy clusters	the reconstruction of galaxy cluster's gas density profiles is usuallyperformed by assuming spherical symmetry and averaging the observed x-rayemission in circular annuli. in the case of a very inhomogeneous and asymmetricgas distribution, this method has been shown to return biased results innumerical simulations because of the $n^2$ dependence of the x-ray emissivity.we propose a method to recover the true density profiles in the presence ofinhomogeneities, based on the derivation of the azimuthal median of the surfacebrightness in concentric annuli. we demonstrate the performance of this methodwith numerical simulations, and apply it to a sample of 31 galaxy clusters inthe redshift range 0.04-0.2 observed with rosat/pspc. the clumping factorsrecovered by comparing the mean and the median are mild and show a slight trendof increasing bias with radius. for $r&lt;r_{500}$, we measure a clumping factor$\sqrt{c}&lt;1.1$, which indicates that the thermodynamic properties andhydrostatic masses measured in this radial range are only mildly affected bythis effect. comparing our results with three sets of hydrodynamical numericalsimulations, we found that non-radiative simulations significantly overestimatethe level of inhomogeneities in the icm, while the runs including cooling, starformation, and agn feedback reproduce the observed trends closely. our resultsindicate that most of the accretion of x-ray emitting gas is taking place inthe diffuse, large-scale accretion patterns rather than in compact structures.

1408.1394	the stripping of a galaxy group diving into the massive cluster a2142	structure formation in the current universe operates through the accretion ofgroup-scale systems onto massive clusters. the detection and study of suchaccreting systems is crucial to understand the build-up of the most massivevirialized structures we see today. we report the discovery with xmm-newton ofan irregular x-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy clusterabell 2142. the tip of the x-ray emission coincides with a concentration ofgalaxies. the bulk of the x-ray emission of this substructure appears to belagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800kpc. the temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 kev, which is a factor of~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma ofa galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13m_sun. for this reason, we interpretthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the maindark-matter halo. the x-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gasstripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through theintracluster medium (icm). this is the longest x-ray trail reported to date.for an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas hasbeen surviving in the presence of the hot icm for at least 600 myr, whichexceeds the spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of &gt;~400.such a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangledmagnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.the long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that theinfalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.

1504.02107	the evolution of the spatially-resolved metal abundance in galaxy  clusters up to z=1.4	we present the combined analysis of the metal content of 83 objects in theredshift range 0.09-1.39, and spatially-resolved in the 3 bins (0-0.15,0.15-0.4, &gt;0.4) r500, as obtained with similar analysis using xmm-newton datain leccardi &amp; molendi (2008) and baldi et al. (2012). we use the pseudo-entropyratio to separate the cool-core (cc) cluster population, where the central gasdensity tends to be relatively higher, cooler and more metal rich, from thenon-cool-core systems. the average, redshift-independent, metal abundancemeasured in the 3 radial bins decrease moving outwards, with a mean metallicityin the core that is even 3 (two) times higher than the value of 0.16 times thesolar abundance in anders &amp; grevesse (1989) estimated at r&gt;0.4 r500 in cc (ncc)objects. we find that the values of the emission-weighted metallicity arewell-fitted by the relation $z(z) = z_0 (1+z)^{-\gamma}$ at given radius. asignificant scatter, intrinsic to the observed distribution and of the order of0.05-0.15, is observed below 0.4 r500. the nominal best-fit value of $\gamma$is significantly different from zero in the inner cluster regions ($\gamma =1.6 \pm 0.2$) and in cc clusters only. these results are confirmed also with abootstrap analysis, which provides a still significant negative evolution inthe core of cc systems (p&gt;99.9 per cent). no redshift-evolution is observedwhen regions above the core (r &gt; 0.15 r500) are considered. a reasonable goodfit of both the radial and redshift dependence is provided from the functionalform $z(r,z)=z_0 (1+(r/0.15 r500)^2)^{-\beta} (1+z)^{-\gamma}$, with $(z_0,\beta, \gamma) = (0.83 \pm 0.13, 0.55 \pm 0.07, 1.7 \pm 0.6)$ in cc clustersand $(0.39 \pm 0.04, 0.37 \pm 0.15, 0.5 \pm 0.5)$ for ncc systems. our resultsrepresent the most extensive study of the spatially-resolved metal distributionin the cluster plasma as function of redshift.

(1997) sample of 23 optically selected pgquasars with redshift &lt;0.4 and low galactic absorption along the line of sight.significant spectral curvature is detected for the 6 quasars with the highestsignal to noise ratio in their low energy spectra. the average curvature can beparameterized as a flattening of the underlying power law by delta_alpha ~ 0.5above ~1 kev. we find that quasars with a steeper soft x-ray (0.1-2 kev)spectrum tend to be steeper also at higher (2-10 kev) energies. thedistribution of the best fit 2-10 kev slopes is similar to that found for otherradio-quiet agn and characterized by a large dispersion around the mean:alpha_e ~ 1.0+/-0.3. iron k_alpha lines are detected in 4 quasars. in thenarrow-line quasar pg 1115+407, the rest frame line energy (6.69+/-0.11 kev)and equivalent width (580+/-280 ev) are consistent with those found in a fewlow redshift narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (nlsy1). this, together with thesimilarity of the 0.1-10 kev x-ray continuum, suggests that this quasar is thehigher redshift and luminosity analog of a nlsy1. in the broad line quasar pg0947+396, the rest-frame line energy suggests fluorescence from cold iron. theline equivalent width (&gt; 400 ev) is however about 2-3 times higher than thatusually found in seyfert 1 galaxies. the high energy power-law slopes and theiron line emission properties seem to be unrelated to the x-ray luminosity.

astro-ph;0011244	the central region of m31 observed with xmm-newton (i. group properties  and diffuse emission)	we present the results of a study based on an xmm-newton performanceverification observation of the central 30 arcmin of the nearby spiral galaxym31. in the 34-ks european photon imaging camera (epic) exposure, we detect 116sources down to a limiting luminosity of 6 x 10^35 erg/s (0.3--12 kev, d = 760kpc). the luminosity distribution of the sources detected with xmm-newtonflattens at luminosities below ~ 2.5 x 10^37 erg/s. we make use of hardnessratios for the detected sources in order to distinguish between classes ofobjects such as super-soft sources and intrinsically hard or highly absorbedsources. we demonstrate that the spectrum of the unresolved emission in thebulge of m31 contains a soft excess which can be fitted with a ~ 0.35-kevoptically-thin thermal-plasma component clearly distinct from the compositepoint-source spectrum. we suggest that this may represent diffuse gas in thecentre of m31, and we illustrate its extent in a wavelet-deconvolved image.

astro-ph;0209399	abell 3560, a galaxy cluster at the edge of a major merging event	in this paper we study a3560, a rich cluster at the southern periphery of thea3558 complex, a chain of interacting clusters in the central part of theshapley concentration supercluster.  from a rosat-pspc map we find that the x-ray surface brightness distributionof a3560 is well described by two components, an elliptical king law and a morepeaked and fainter structure, which has been modeled with a gaussian. the maincomponent, corresponding to the cluster, is elongated with the major axispointing toward the a3558 complex. the second component, centered on thedumb-bell galaxy which dominates the cluster, appears significantly offset (byabout 0.15 mpc) from the cluster x-ray centroid.  from a beppo-sax observation we derive the radial temperature profile,finding that the temperature is constant (at kt~3.7 kev) up to 8 arcmin,corresponding to 0.3 mpc: for larger distances, the temperature significantlydrops to kt~1.7 kev. we analyze also temperature maps, dividing the cluster in4 sectors and deriving the temperature profiles in each sector: we find thatthe temperature drop is more sudden in the sectors which point towards thea3558 complex.  from vla radio data, at 20 and 6 cm, we find a peculiar bright extended radiosource (j1332-3308), composed by a core (centered on the northern component ofthe dumb-bell galaxy), two lobes, a "filament" and a diffuse component. themorphology of the source could be interpreted either with a strong interactionof the radio source with the intracluster medium or with the model ofintermittency of the central engine.

astro-ph;0304016	smaug: a new technique for the deprojection of galaxy clusters	this paper presents a new technique for reconstructing the spatialdistributions of hydrogen, temperature and metal abundance of a galaxy cluster.these quantities are worked out from the x-ray spectrum, modeled starting fromfew analytical functions describing their spatial distributions. thesefunctions depend upon some parameters, determined by fitting the model to theobserved spectrum. we have implemented this technique as a new model in thexspec software analysis package. we describe the details of the method, andapply it to work out the structure of the cluster a1795. we combine theobservation of three satellites, exploiting the high spatial resolution ofchandra for the cluster core, the wide collecting area of xmm-newton for theintermediate regions and the large field of view of beppo-sax for the outerregions. we also test the validity and precision of our method by i) comparingits results with those from a geometrical deprojection, ii) examining thespectral residuals at different radii of the cluster and iii) reprojecting theunfolded profiles and comparing them directly to the measured quantities. ouranalytical method yields the parameters defining the spatial functions directlyfrom the spectra. their explicit knowledge allows a straightforward derivationof other indirect physical quantities like the gravitating mass, as well as afast and easy estimate of the profiles uncertainties.

astro-ph;9612041	on the soft x-ray spectra of gamma-loud blazars	rosat observations of a large sample of bright gamma-ray (e &gt; 100 mev)blazars are presented. results of a detailed spectral analysis in the soft$\sim$ 0.1-2.0 kev energy range are discussed in relation to the overall energydistribution with particular emphasis on the relation between x-ray andgamma-ray properties. a significant anti-correlation between x-ray andgamma-ray spectral shapes of flat radio spectrum quasars (fsrq) and bl lacs hasbeen discovered. a different shape in the overall energy distributions fromradio to gamma-ray energies between fsrq and bl lacs is also implied by thecorrelation of their broad-band spectral indices $\alpha_{ro}$ and $\alpha_{x\gamma}$. both the above correlations can be explained if both the ir to uvemission and the hard x-ray to gamma-ray emission originate from the sameelectron population, via, respectively, the synchrotron process and the inversecompton mechanism. we suggest that a key parameter for understanding theoverall energy distributions of both classes of objects is the energy at whichthe synchrotron emission peaks in a $\nu-\nu f(\nu)$ representation.

astro-ph;9706155	the steepness ratio technique: a new method to analyze rosat all-sky  survey extended sources	in this first paper of a series we develop a new technique to analyzeclusters of galaxies observed during the rosat all-sky survey (rass). we callthis method the steepness ratio technique (srt). the srt uses the convolutionbetween the real rass point-spread function and the cluster emission profileassumed to be a beta-model with the beta parameter fixed to the value of 2/3.from the convolved source emission profile the srt extracts total flux andextension (i.e., core radius) for each cluster. using the steepness ratio (sr)and a control sample of rass pointlike sources we are able to assign to eachrass source a model-independent probability of extension. potential biasesarising from the hypotheses of a beta-model emission profile and from a fixedbeta value are quantified. tests with control samples of optically identifiedsources extracted from both the rosat survey database and from the rosat-pspcpointed observations archive are performed to check the srt output. we findthat the source properties derived using the srt on rass data are consistentwith those determined from rosat-pspc pointed observations.

astro-ph;9710355	evidence for a late-time outburst of the x-ray afterglow of gb970508  from bepposax	the gamma-ray burst gb970508 was observed simultaneously by the gamma rayburst monitor (grbm) and one of the x-ray wide field cameras (wfc) aboardbepposax. the latter provided a position within 1.9' radius. a series offollow-up observations with the narrow field intruments (nfi) was thenperformed in a period from 6 hours to 6 days after the main event. a previouslyunknown source, which we associate with the afterglow of the grb, wasdiscovered in the error box. we find that, after the initial burst, x-rayemission is still present and decays as t^(-1.1) up to 6 times 10^4 s. this isfollowed by a burst of activity with a duration 10^5 s. the energy produced inthis event is a substantial fraction of the total energy of the grb, whichmeans that the afterglow is not a remnant of the initial burst (the grb) thatfades away smoothly. our results support the idea that the processes generatingthe grb and its afterglow are the same.

astro-ph;9802067	how abundant is iron in the core of the perseus cluster?	the analysis of perseus data collected with the medium energy concentratorspectrometer (mecs) on board beppo-sax shows that the ratio of the flux of the8 kev line complex (dominated by fe k$_{\beta}$ emission) over the 6.8 kev linecomplex (dominated by fe k$_{\alpha}$ emission) is significantly larger thanpredicted by standard thermal emission codes. moreover the analysis ofspatially resolved spectra shows that the above ratio decreases with increasingcluster radius. we find that, amongst the various explanations we consider, themost likely requires the plasma to be optically thick for resonant scatteringat the energy of the fe k$_{\alpha}$ line. we argue that if this is the case,then measures of the iron abundance made using standard thermal emission codes,that assume optically thin emission, can significantly underestimate the trueiron abundance. in the case of the core of perseus we estimate the trueabundance to be $\sim$ 0.9 solar in a circular region with radius of $\sim 60$kpc and centered on ngc 1275. finally we speculate that similar results mayhold for the core of other rich clusters.

astro-ph;9807314	gamma-ray burst 980329 and its x-ray afterglow	grb 980329 is the brightest gamma-ray burst detected so far with the widefield cameras aboard bepposax, both in gamma-rays and x-rays. with respect toits fluence (2.6 x 10**-5 erg/s/cm**2 in 50 to 300 kev) it would be in the top4% of gamma-ray bursts in the 4b catalog (meegan et al. 1998). thetime-averaged burst spectrum from 2 to 20 and 70 to 650 kev can be welldescribed by the empirical model of band et al. (1993). the resulting photonindex above the break energy is exceptionally hard at -1.32 +/- 0.03. an x-rayafterglow was detected with the narrow-field instruments aboard bepposax 7 hafter the event within the error box as determined with the wide field cameras.its peak flux is (1.4 +/- 0.2) x 10**-12 erg/s/cm**2 (2 to 10 kev). theafterglow decayed according to a power law function with an index of -1.35 +/-0.03. grb 980329 is characterized by being bright and hard, and lacking strongspectral evolution.

astro-ph;9808009	1h0419-577: a "two-state" soft x-ray seyfert galaxy	in this paper we report on the first simultaneous optical and x-ray(beppo-sax) observations of the radio-quiet agn 1h0419-577. the opticalspectrum clearly leads us to classify this source as a seyfert 1. the x-rayspectrum is, however, somewhat at odds with this classification: a simple flat(gamma ~ 1.55) and featureless power--law is a good description of the whole1.8-40 kev spectrum, even if the upper limit to a broad iron line is not verytight. an analysis of a still unpublished rosat observation of the same targetreveals that the soft x-ray spectrum has undergone a transition from a steep(gamma ~ 2.5) to a flat (gamma ~ 1.55) state, at least in the 0.7-2 kev band.if this difference is due to a remarkably variable soft excess, it is unlikelythat a single component is responsible for the optical/uv/soft x-ray spectraldistribution. the hypothesis that the difference is due to a change in theprimary x-ray continuum and its implications for current comptonization modelsare discussed.

astro-ph;9812423	the x-ray luminosity function of bright clusters in the local universe	we present the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) for clusters of galaxiesderived from the rass1 bright sample. the sample, selected from the rosatall-sky survey in a region of 2.5 sr within the southern galactic cap, contains130 clusters with flux limits in the range ~ 3-4 x 10^-12 ergs/cm^2/s in the0.5-2.0 kev band. a maximum-likelihood fit with a schechter function of the xlfover the entire range of luminosities (0.045 - 28. x 10^44 ergs/s), gives alpha= 1.52 +/- 0.11, l_* = 3.80 +0.70 -0.55 x 10^44 ergs/s, and a = 5.07 +/- 0.45 x10^-7 mpc^-3 (10^44 ergs/s)^(\alpha-1). we investigate possible evolutionaryeffects within the sample, out to our redshift limit (z ~ 0.3), finding noevidence for evolution. our results are in good agreement with other localestimates of the xlf, implying that this statistic for the local universe isnow well determined. comparison with xlfs for distant clusters (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.6),shows that no evolution is present for l_x &lt; 10^{44} ergs/s. however, we detectdifferences at the 3 sigma level, between our local xlf and the distant oneestimated by henry et al. for the emss sample. this difference is still presentwhen considering the emss sample revised by nichol et al.

astro-ph;9902067	a flux-limited sample of bright clusters of galaxies from the southern  part of the rosat all-sky survey: the catalog and the logn-logs	we describe the selection of an x-ray flux-limited sample of bright clustersof galaxies in the southern hemisphere, based on the first analysis of therosat all-sky survey data (rass1). the sample is constructed starting from anidentification of candidate clusters in rass1, and their x-ray fluxes areremeasured using the steepness ratio technique. this method is better suitedthan the rass1 standard algorithm for measuring flux from extended sources. thefinal sample is count-rate-limited in the rosat hard band (0.5-2.0 kev), sothat due to the distribution of nh, its effective flux limit varies betweenabout 3-4 x 10**-12 ergs cm**-2 s**-1 over the selected area. this covers thedecl&lt;2.5 deg part of the south galactic cap region (b&lt;-20 deg) - with theexclusion of patches of low rass1 exposure time and of the magellanic cloudsarea - for a total of 8235 deg**2. 130 candidate sources fulfill our selectioncriteria for bonafide clusters of galaxies in this area. of these, 101 areabell/aco clusters, while 29 do not have a counterpart in these catalogs. ofthese clusters, 126 (97%) clusters have a redshift and for these we compute anx-ray luminosity. 20% of the cluster redshifts come from new observations, aspart of the eso key program reflex cluster survey that is under completion.considering the intrinsic biases and incompletenesses introduced by the fluxselection and source identification processes, we estimate the overallcompleteness to be better than 90%. the observed number count distribution,logn-logs, is well fitted by a power law with slope alpha = 1.34 +/- 0.15 andnormalization a = 11.87 +/- 1.04 sr**-1 (10**-11 ergs cm**-2 s**-1)**alpha, ingood agreement with other measurements.

astro-ph;9908312	diffuse thermal emission from very hot gas in starburst galaxies	bepposax observations of the nearby archetypical starburst galaxies ngc253and m82 are presented. spectral analysis shows that the 2-10 kev spectra ofboth galaxies, extracted from the central 4' regions, are best fitted by athermal emission model with kt~6-9 kev and metal abundances ~ 0.1-0.3 solar.the spatial analysis yields clear evidence that this emission is extended inngc 253, and possibly also in m82. these results clearly rule out a llagn asthe {\it main} origin of the x-ray emission in ngc 253. for m82, the presenceof an fe-k line at ~ 6.7 kev, and the convex profile of its 2-10 kev continuum,indicate a significant thermal component. contributions from point sources(e.g. x-ray binaries, supernova remnants, and/or a llagn) and compton emissionare also likely. altogether, bepposax results provide compelling evidence forthe existence of a hot interstellar plasma in both galaxies, possibly in theform of superwind outflows from the disks of these galaxies. order-of-magnitudeestimates and some implications, such as the expelled mass and the energeticsof the outflowing gas of this superwind scenario, are discussed. these newresults also suggest some similarity between the x-ray emission from thesegalaxies and that from the galactic ridge.

astro-ph;9909228	the bepposax view of the hot cluster abell 2319	we present results from a bepposax observation of the rich cluster abell2319. the broad band spectrum (2-50 kev) of the cluster can be adequatelyrepresented by an optically thin thermal emission model with a temperature of9.6+/-0.3 kev and a metal abundance of 0.25+/-0.03 in solar units, and with noevidence of a hard x-ray excess in the pds spectrum. from the upper limit tothe hard tail component we derive a lower limit of ~0.04 \mug for thevolume-averaged intracluster magnetic field. by performing spatially resolvedspectroscopy in the medium energy band (2-10 kev), we find that the projectedradial temperature and metal abundance profiles are constant out to a radius of16 arcmin (1.4 mpc). a reduction of the temperature of 1/3, when going from thecluster core out to 16 arcmin, can be excluded in the present data at the 99%confidence level. from the analysis of the temperature and abundance maps wefind evidence of a temperature enhancement and of an abundance decrement in aregion localized 6 arcmin--8 arcmin ne of the core, where a merger event may betaking place. finally, the temperature map indicates that the subclusterlocated nw of the main cluster may be somewhat cooler than the rest of thecluster.
