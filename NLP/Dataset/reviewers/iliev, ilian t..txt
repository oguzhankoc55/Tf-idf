0905.2920	cosmological radiative transfer comparison project ii: the  radiation-hydrodynamic tests	the development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to followgas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution ofmany problems in numerical astrophysics. such fluid flows are highly complex,rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against whichnumerical codes can be tested. an alternative validation procedure is tocompare different methods against each other on common problems, in order toassess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for themethods. previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiativetransfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). this is thesecond paper of the cosmological radiative transfer (rt) comparison project, inwhich we compare 9 independent rt codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of anh ii region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (i-front) in a 1/r^2density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniformdense clump. results show a broad agreement between the different methods andno big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certainlevel of maturity and reliability. however, many details still do differ, andvirtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in onerespect or another, with the majority of the results. this underscores the factthat no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particularfeatures which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

0906.4552	the cosmic near infrared background ii: fluctuations	the near infrared background (nirb) is one of a few methods that can be usedto observe the redshifted light from early stars at a redshift of six andabove. fluctuations of the nirb can provide information on the firststructures, such as halos and their surrounding ionized regions in the igm. wecombine, for the first time, n-body simulations, radiative transfer code, andanalytic calculations of luminosity of early structures to predict the angularpower spectrum (c_l) of fluctuations in the nirb. we study the effects ofvarious assumptions about the stellar mass, the initial mass spectrum of stars,metallicity, the star formation efficiency (f_*), the escape fraction ofionizing photons (f_esc), and the star formation timescale (t_sf), on theamplitude as well as the shape of c_l. the power spectrum of nirb fluctuationsis maximized when f_* is the largest (as c_l ~ (f_*)^2) and f_esc is thesmallest. a significant uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of c_l existsdue to our lack of knowledge of t_sf of these galaxies, which is equivalent toour lack of knowledge of the mass-to-light ratio. we do not see a turnover inthe nirb angular power spectrum of the halo contribution and explain this asthe effect of high levels of non-linear bias. this is partly due to our choiceof the minimum mass of halos contributing to nirb, and a smaller minimum mass,which has a smaller non-linear bias, may still exhibit a turn over. therefore,both the amplitude and shape of the nirb power spectrum provide importantinformation regarding the nature of sources contributing to the cosmicreionization. the angular power spectrum of the igm, in most cases, is muchsmaller than the halo angular power spectrum. in addition, low levels of theobserved mean background intensity tend to rule out high values of f_* &gt; 0.2.

0906.5159	a physical model of lyman alpha emitters	we present a simple physical model for populating dark matter halos withlyman alpha emiiters(laes) and predict the physical properties of laes atz~3-7. the central tenet of this model is that the ly-alpha luminosity isproportional to the star formation rate (sfr) which is directly related to thehalo mass accretion rate. the only free parameter in our model is then thestar-formation efficiency (sfe). an efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit tothe ly-alpha luminosity function (lf) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this sfe toconstruct ly-alpha lfs at other redshifts. our model reproduce the ly-alphalfs, stellar ages, sfr ~1-10; msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 msun and theclustering properties of laes at z~3-7. we find the spatial correlation lengthsro ~ 3-6 mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. finally, we estimate thefield-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,again consistent with observations. our results suggest that the starformation, and hence ly-alpha emission in laes is powered by the accretion ofnew material, and that the physical properties of laes do not evolvesignificantly over a wide range of redshifts. relating the accreted mass,rather than the total mass of halos, to the ly-alpha luminosity of laesnaturally gives rise to the duty cycle of laes.

1005.3139	reionization of the local group of galaxies	we present the first detailed structure formation and radiative transfersimulations of the reionization history of our cosmic neighbourhood. to thisend, we follow the formation of the local group of galaxies and nearby clustersby means of constrained simulations, which use the available observationalconstraints to construct a representation of those structures which reproducestheir actual positions and properties at the present time. we find that thereionization history of the local group is strongly dependent on the assumedphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorlyconstrained. if sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is'photon-rich', the local group is primarily ionized externally by the nearbyclusters. alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is'photon-poor' the local group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications forthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxypopulations and primordial stellar populations. this therefore provides animportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies ofour nearby structures.

1006.2016	topology and sizes of hii regions during cosmic reionization	we use the results of large-scale simulations of reionization to exploremethods for characterizing the topology and sizes of hii regions duringreionization. we use four independent methods for characterizing the sizes ofionized regions. three of them give us a full size distribution: thefriends-of-friends (fof) method, the spherical average method (spa) and thepower spectrum (ps) of the ionized fraction. these latter three methods arecomplementary: while the fof method captures the size distribution of the smallscale h ii regions, which contribute only a small amount to the totalionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measurefor the average size of the h ii regions constituting the main contribution tothe ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining moredetails on the size distribution. our fourth method for characterizing thesizes of the h ii regions is the average size which results if we divide thetotal volume of the h ii regions by their total surface area, (i.e. 3v/a),computed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding minkowski functionals ofthe ionized fraction field. to characterize the topology of the ionizedregions, we calculate the evolution of the euler characteristic. we find thatthe evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization isconsistent with inside-out reionization of a gaussian density field. we usethese techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on somebasic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibilityof haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass forsources to form. we find that suppression of ionizing sources within ionizedregions slows the growth of h ii regions, and also changes their sizedistribution. additionally, the topology of simulations including suppressionis more complex.

1008.3914	2d genus topology of 21-cm differential brightness temperature during  cosmic reionization	a novel method to characterize the topology of the early-universeintergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic reionization is presented. the21-cm radiation background from high redshift is analyzed through thecalculation of the 2-dimensional (2d) genus. the radiative transfer ofhydrogen-ionizing photons and ionization-rate equations are calculated in asuite of numerical simulations under various input parameters. the 2d genus iscalculated from the mock 21-cm images of the high-redshift universe. weconstruct the 2d genus curve by varying the threshold differential brightnesstemperature, and compare this to the 2d genus curve of the underlying densityfield. we find that (1) the 2d genus curve reflects the evolutionary track ofcosmic reionization and (2) the 2d genus curve can discriminate between certainreionization scenarios and thus indirectly probe the properties ofradiation-sources. choosing the right beam shape of a radio antenna is crucialfor this analysis. to this end, the square kilometre array (ska) is found to bea suitable apparatus for this analysis in terms of sensitivity, even thoughsome deterioration of the data for this purpose is unavoidable under theplanned size of the antenna core.

1104.2094	redshift space distortion of the 21cm background from the epoch of  reionization i: methodology re-examined	the peculiar velocity of the intergalactic gas responsible for the cosmic21cm background from the epoch of reionization and beyond introduces ananisotropy in the three-dimensional power spectrum of brightness temperaturefluctuations. measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is apromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. however,previous attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity oronly approximated it crudely. this paper re-examines the effects of peculiarvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment andaddressing several issues for the first time. (1) we show that properlyaccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the igm found by previouswork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) theapproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightnesstemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the powerspectrum on all scales. (3) the observed power spectrum in redshift-spaceremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properlyaccounts for the redshift-space distortion. however, results that take fullaccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accuratein the limit of high spin temperature. (4) the linear theory for redshift-spacedistortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumberrange, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) we describe and test two numerical schemesto calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporatepeculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately. oneis particle-based, the other grid-based, and while the former is most accurate,we demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and canachieve sufficient accuracy.

1107.4772	can 21-cm observations discriminate between high-mass and low-mass  galaxies as reionization sources?	the prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on theintergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leadsus to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing whichtypes of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. we attempt to answerthis by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations ofreionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningfulpredictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving allatomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 m_solar. we focus here on predictions ofthe 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable ofdistinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one inwhich both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how theseresults depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. we find that 21-cmfluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation eor/21-cm radiointerferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization byhigh-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.some reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolutionand thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization historyand 21-cm pdf distributions. we find that the skewness of the 21-cm pdfdistribution smoothed over lofar-like window shows a clear feature correlatedwith the rise of the rms due to patchiness. measurements of the meanphotoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions beingstudied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases.

1109.1284	light cone effect on the reionization 21-cm power spectrum	observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen during theepoch of reionization (eor) are considered to constitute the most promisingtool to probe that epoch. one of the major goals of the first generation of lowfrequency radio telescopes is to measure the 3d 21-cm power spectrum. however,the 21-cm signal could evolve substantially along the line of sight (los)direction of an observed 3d volume, since the received signal from differentplanes transverse to the los originated from different look-back times andcould therefore be statistically different. using numerical simulations weinvestigate this so-called light cone effect on the spherically averaged 3d21-cm power spectrum. for this version of the power spectrum, we find that theeffect mostly `averages out' and observe a smaller change in the power spectrumcompared to the amount of evolution in the mean 21-cm signal and its rmsvariations along the los direction. nevertheless, changes up to 50% at largescales are possible. in general the power is enhanced/suppressed at large/smallscales when the effect is included. the cross-over mode below/above which thepower is enhanced/suppressed moves toward larger scales as reionizationproceeds. when considering the 3d power spectrum we find it to be anisotropicat the late stages of reionization and on large scales. the effect is dominatedby the evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen during reionization andincluding peculiar velocities hardly changes these conclusions. we presentsimple analytical models which explain qualitatively all the features we see inthe simulations.

1112.2064	the cosmic near infrared background iii: fluctuations, reionization and  the effects of minimum mass and self-regulation	current observations suggest that the universe was reionized sometime beforez~6. one way to observe this epoch of the universe is through the near infraredbackground (nirb), which contains information about galaxies which may be toofaint to be observed individually. we calculate the angular power spectrum(c_l) of the nirb fluctuations caused by the distribution of these galaxies.assuming a complete subtraction of any post-reionization component, c_l will bedominated by galaxies responsible for completing reionization (e.g., z~6). theshape of c_l at high l is sensitive to the amount of non-linear bias of darkmatter halos hosting galaxies. as the non-linear bias depends on the mass ofthese halos, we can use the shape of c_l to infer typical masses of dark matterhalos responsible for completing reionization. we extend our previous study byusing a higher-resolution n-body simulation, which can resolve halos down to10^8 m_sun. we also include improved radiative transfer, which allows for thesuppression of star formation in small-mass halos due to photo-ionizationheating. as the non-linear bias enhances the dark-matter-halo power spectrum onsmall scales, we find that c_l is steeper for the case with a completesuppression of small sources or partial suppression of star formation in smallhalos (the minimum galaxy mass is m_min=10^9 m_sun in ionized regions andm_min=10^8 m_sun in neutral regions) than the case in which these small haloswere unsuppressed. in all cases, we do not see a turn-over toward high l in theshape of l^2 c_l.

1201.0602	radiative transfer of energetic photons: x-rays and helium ionization in  c2-ray	we present an extension to the short-characteristic ray-tracing andnon-equilibrium photon-ionization code c2ray. the new version includes theeffects of helium and improved multi-frequency heating. the motivation for thiswork is to be able to deal with harder ionizing spectra, such as for examplefrom quasar-like sources during cosmic reionization. we review the basicalgorithmic ingredients of c2-ray before describing the changes implemented,which include a treatment of the full on the spot (ots) approximation,secondary ionization, and multi-frequency photo-ionization and heating. weperformed a series of tests against equilibrium solutions from cloudy as wellas comparisons to the hydrogen only solutions by c2-ray in the extensive codecomparison in iliev et al. (2006). we show that the full, coupled otsapproximation is more accurate than the simplified, uncoupled one. we find thatalso with helium and a multi-frequency set up, long timesteps (up to ~10% ofthe recombination time) still give accurate results for the ionizationfractions. on the other hand, accurate results for the temperature set strongconstrains on the timestep. the details of these constraints depend however onthe optical depth of the cells. we use the new version of the code to confirmthat the assumption made in many reionization simulations, namely that heliumis singly ionized everywhere were hydrogen is, is indeed valid when the sourceshave stellar-like spectra.

1203.0517	prospects of observing a quasar hii region during the epoch of  reionization with redshifted 21cm	we present a study of the impact of a bright quasar on the redshifted 21cmsignal during the epoch of reionization (eor). using three differentcosmological radiative transfer simulations, we investigate if quasars arecapable of substantially changing the size and morphology of the h ii regionsthey are born in. we choose stellar and quasar luminosities in a way that isfavourable to seeing such an effect. we find that even the most luminous of ourquasar models is not able to increase the size of its native h ii regionsubstantially beyond those of large h ii regions produced by clustered stellarsources alone. however, the quasar h ii region is found to be more spherical.we next investigate the prospects of detecting such h ii regions in theredshifted 21cm data from the low frequency array (lofar) by means of a matchedfilter technique. we find that h ii regions with radii ~ 25 comoving mpc orlarger should have a sufficiently high detection probability for 1200 hours ofintegration time. although the matched filter can in principle distinguishbetween more and less spherical regions, we find that when including realisticsystem noise this distinction can no longer be made. the strong foregrounds arefound not to pose a problem for the matched filter technique. we alsodemonstrate that when the quasar position is known, the redshifted 21cm datacan still be used to set upper limits on the ionizing photon rate of thequasar. if both the quasar position and its luminosity are known, theredshifted 21 cm data can set new constrains on quasar lifetimes.

1206.4028	on the use of ly-alpha emitters as probes of reionization	we use numerical simulations to study the effects of the patchiness of apartly reionized intergalactic medium (igm) on the observability of ly-alphaemitters (laes) at high redshifts (z ~ 6). we present a new model that dividesthe ly-alpha radiative transfer into a (circum-)galactic and an extragalactic(igm) part, and investigate how the choice of intrinsic line model affects theigm transmission results. we use our model to study the impact of neutralhydrogen on statistical observables such as the ly-alpha restframe equivalentwidth (rew) distribution, the lae luminosity function and the two-pointcorrelation function. we find that if the observed changes in lae luminosityfunctions and equivalent width distributions between z ~ 6 and z ~ 7 are to beexplained by an increased igm neutral fraction alone, we require an extremelylate and rapid reionization scenario, where the universe was ~ 40 % ionized atz = 7, ~ 50 % ionized at z = 6.5 and ~ 100 % ionized at z = 6. this is inconflict with other observations, suggesting that intrinsic lae evolution at z&gt; 6 cannot be completely neglected. we show how the two-point correlationfunction can provide more robust constraints once future observations obtainlarger lae samples, and provide predictions for the sample sizes needed to telldifferent reionization scenarios apart.

1206.4934	a novel approach to constrain the escape fraction and dust content at  high redshift using the cosmic infrared background fractional anisotropy	the cosmic infrared background (cib) provides an opportunity to constrainmany properties of the high redshift (z&gt;6) stellar population as a whole. thisbackground, specifically, from 1 to 200 microns, will contain any informationabout the era of reionization and the stars responsible for producing theseionizing photons. in this paper, we look at the fractional anisotropy delta i/iof this high redshift population, which is the ratio of the magnitude of thefluctuations (delta i) and the mean intensity (i). we show that this can beused to constrain the escape fraction of the population as a whole. themagnitude of the fluctuations of the cib depend on the escape fraction, whilethe mean intensity does not. this results in lower values of the escapefraction producing higher values of the fractional anisotropy. this differenceis predicted to be larger at the longer wavelengths bands (above 10 microns),albeit it is also much harder to observe in that range. we show that thefractional anisotropy can also be used to separate a dusty from a dust-freepopulation. finally, we discuss the constraints provided by currentobservations on the cib fractional anisotropy.

1206.5007	detecting the rise and fall of the first stars by their impact on cosmic  reionization	the intergalactic medium was reionized before redshift z~6, most likely bystarlight which escaped from early galaxies. the very first stars formed whenhydrogen molecules (h2) cooled gas inside the smallest galaxies, minihalos ofmass between 10^5 and 10^8 solar masses. although the very first stars beganforming inside these minihalos before redshift z~40, their contribution has, todate, been ignored in large-scale simulations of this cosmic reionization. herewe report results from the first reionization simulations to include thesefirst stars and the radiative feedback that limited their formation, in avolume large enough to follow the crucial spatial variations that influencedthe process and its observability. we show that, while minihalo stars stoppedfar short of fully ionizing the universe, reionization began much earlier withminihalo sources than without, and was greatly extended, which boosts theintergalactic electron-scattering optical depth and the large-anglepolarization fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background significantly.although within current wmap uncertainties, this boost should be readilydetectable by planck. if reionization ended as late as z_ov&lt;~7, as suggested byother observations, planck will thereby see the signature of the first stars athigh redshift, currently undetectable by other probes.

0711.2944	effect of the intergalactic environment on the observability of ly-alpha  emitters during reionization	observations of high-redshift ly-alpha sources are a major tool for studyingthe high-redshift universe. we discuss the effect of the reionizingintergalactic medium on the observability of ly-alpha sources based on largesimulations of early structure formation with radiative transfer. this takesinto account self-consistently the reionization history, density, velocity andionization structures and nonlinear source clustering. we find that all fieldsare highly anisotropic and as a consequence there are very large variations inopacity among the different lines-of-sight. the velocity effects, from bothinfall and source peculiar velocity are most important for the luminoussources, affecting the line profile and depressing the bright end of theluminosity function. the line profiles are generally asymmetric and the linecenters of the luminous sources are always absorbed due to the high density ofthe local igm. for both luminous and average sources the damping wing effectsare of similar magnitude and remain significant until fairly late.  the ionizing flux in the ionized patch surrounding a high density peak isgenerally strongly dominated, particularly at late times, by the cluster offaint sources, rather than the central massive galaxy. the igm absorption doesnot change appreciably the correlation function of sources at high redshift.our derived luminosity function assuming constant mass-to-light ratio providesan excellent match to the shape of the observed luminosity function at z=6.6with faint-end slope of alpha=-1.5. the resulting mass-to-light ratio impliesthat the majority of sources responsible for reionization are too faint to beobserved by the current surveys.

1209.6069	the inhomogenous reionization of the inter-galactic medium by metal-poor  globular clusters	we present detailed radiative transfer simulations of the reionizationhistory of the milky way by metal-poor globular clusters. we identify potentialmetal-poor globular cluster candidates within the aquarius simulation usingdark matter halo velocity dispersions. we calculate the local ionization fieldsvia a photon-conserving, three dimensional non-equilibrium chemistry code andallow the model to propagate through to the present day. the key feature of themodel is that globular cluster formation is suppressed if the local gas isionized.  we find that our spatial treatment of the ionization field leads todrastically different numbers and spatial distributions when compared to modelswhere globular cluster formation is simply truncated at a given redshift. wefind that it is possible for metal-poor globular clusters to have formed viathe dark matter halo formation channel as our secondary model (delayedformation) combined with truncation at z = 10 produces radial distributionsstatistically consistent with that of the milky way metal-poor globularclusters.  if globular clusters do indeed form within high-redshift dark matter halos,if only in-part, their contributions to the reionization of the local (i.e. 2^3h^-3 mpc^3 centred on the host galaxy) volume and mass by redshift 10 could beas high as 98% and 90%, respectively. in our photon poorest model, thiscontribution drops to 60% and 50%. the surviving clusters in all models have anarrow average age range (mean = 13.34 gyr, \sigma = 0.04 gyr) consistent withcurrent ages estimates of the milky way metal-poor globular clusters.  we also test a simple dynamical destruction model and estimate that ~60% ofall metal-poor globular clusters formed at high redshift have since beendestroyed via tidal interactions with the host galaxy.

1212.0095	the halo mass function through the cosmic ages	in this paper we investigate how the halo mass function evolves withredshift, based on a suite of very large (with n_p = 3072^3 - 6000^3 particles)cosmological n-body simulations. our halo catalogue data spans a redshift rangeof z = 0-30, allowing us to probe the mass function from the dark ages to thepresent. we utilise both the friends-of-friends (fof) and spherical overdensity(so) halofinding methods to directly compare the mass function derived usingthese commonly used halo definitions. the mass function from so haloes exhibitsa clear evolution with redshift, especially during the recent era of darkenergy dominance (z &lt; 1). we provide a redshift-parameterised fit for the somass function valid for the entire redshift range to within ~20% as well as ascheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities.the fof mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. we provide a`universal' fit for the fof mass function, fitted to data across the entireredshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our dataversus this fit. the relative evolution of the mass functions derived via thetwo methods is compared and we find that the mass functions most closely matchat z=0. the disparity at z=0 between the fof and so mass functions resides intheir high mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in so haloes is ~80%of that in fof haloes. this difference grows with redshift so that, by z&gt;20,the so algorithm finds a ~50-80% lower collapsed fraction in high mass haloesthan does the fof algorithm, due in part to the significant over-linkingeffects known to affect the fof method.

1301.3607	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect as a probe of the physics of  cosmic reionization: the effect of self-regulated reionization	we calculate the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) temperature fluctuations induced by the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect from the epoch of reionization (eor). we use detailed n-body+radiativetransfer simulations to follow inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalacticmedium (igm). for the first time we take into account the "self-regulation" ofreionization: star formation in low-mass dwarf galaxies (10^8 m_\sun \lesssim m\lesssim 10^9 m_\sun) or minihalos (10^5 m_\sun \lesssim m \lesssim 10^8m_\sun) is suppressed if these halos form in the regions that were alreadyionized or lyman-werner dissociated. some previous work suggested that theamplitude of the ksz power spectrum from the eor can be described by atwo-parameter family: the epoch of half ionization and the duration ofreionization. however, we argue that this picture applies only to simple formsof the reionization history which are roughly symmetric about thehalf-ionization epoch. in self-regulated reionization, the universe begins tobe ionized early, maintains a low level of ionization for an extended period,and then finishes reionization as soon as high-mass atomically-cooling halosdominate. while inclusion of self-regulation affects the amplitude of the kszpower spectrum only modestly (\sim 10 %), it can change the duration ofreionization by a factor of more than two. we conclude that the simpletwo-parameter family does not capture the effect of a physical, yet complex,reionization history caused by self-regulation. when added to thepost-reionization ksz contribution, our prediction for the total ksz powerspectrum is below the current upper bound from the south pole telescope.therefore, the current upper bound on the ksz effect from the eor is consistentwith our understanding of the physics of reionization.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

0705.0530	dependence of the local reionization history on halo mass and  environment: did virgo reionize the local group?	the reionization of the universe has profound effects on the way galaxiesform and on their observed properties at later times. of particular importanceis the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its haloassembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in thatregion, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globularcluster population and its satellite galaxies. we distinguish two basic casesfor the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the starsforming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, wherebythe progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its ownstars are able to form in sufficient numbers. we use a set of large-scaleradiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologiesderived from both wmap 1-year and wmap 3-year data, to evaluate the meanreionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionizationfor local group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cd galaxies inclusters. we find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on theunderlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on thehalo mass. there is a rapid transition between predominantly external andpredominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 msun(corresponding roughly to l*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this beingreionized preferentially from distant sources. we provide a fit for thereionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful toparameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation oncosmological scales. we find no statistical correlation between thereionization history of field galaxies and their environment.

1310.7463	simulating cosmic reionization: how large a volume is large enough?	we present the largest-volume (425 mpc/h=607 mpc on a side) full radiativetransfer simulation of cosmic reionization to date. we show that there issignificant additional power in density fluctuations at very large scales. wesystematically investigate the effects this additional power has on theprogress, duration and features of reionization, as well as on selectedreionization observables. we find that comoving simulation volume of ~100 mpc/hper side is sufficient for deriving a convergent mean reionization history, butthat the reionization patchiness is significantly underestimated. we usejackknife splitting to quantify the convergence of reionization properties withsimulation volume for both mean-density and variable-density sub-regions. wefind that sub-volumes of ~100 mpc/h per side or larger yield convergentreionization histories, except for the earliest times, but smaller volumes of~50 mpc/h or less are not well converged at any redshift. reionization historymilestones show significant scatter between the sub-volumes, of delta z=0.6-1for ~50 mpc/h volumes, decreasing to delta z=0.3-0.5 for ~100 mpc/h volumes,and $\delta z$~0.1 for ~200 mpc/h volumes. if we only consider mean-densitysub-regions the scatter decreases, but remains at delta z~0.1-0.2 for thedifferent size sub-volumes. consequently, many potential reionizationobservables like 21-cm rms, 21-cm pdf skewness and kurtosis all show goodconvergence for volumes of ~200 mpc/h, but retain considerable scatter forsmaller volumes. in contrast, the three-dimensional 21-cm power spectra atlarge scales (k&lt;0.25 h/mpc) do not fully converge for any sub-volume size.these additional large-scale fluctuations significantly enhance the 21-cmfluctuations, which should improve the prospects of detection considerably,given the lower foregrounds and greater interferometer sensitivity at higherfrequencies.

1312.0276	cosmic variance of the local hubble flow in large-scale cosmological  simulations	the increasing precision in the determination of the hubble parameter hasreached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced byinhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. here we uselarge-scale cosmological n-body simulations to study statistical properties ofthe local hubble parameter as measured by local observers. we show that thedistribution of the local hubble parameter depends not only on the scale ofinhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in thecosmic web and what reference frame is used. observers located in random darkmatter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at randompositions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect isstronger from the halo rest frames compared to the cmb rest frame. we comparethe predictions for the local hubble parameter with observational constraintsbased on type ia supernovae (snia) and cmb observations. due to cosmicvariance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the hubbleconstant determined from nearby snia may differ from that measured from the cmbby 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. this scatter is too smallto significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between currentmeasurements assuming a flat lcdm model. however, for observers located in thecentres of the largest voids permitted by the standard lcdm model, we find thathubble constant measurements from snia would be biased high by 5 per cent,rendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case.

1312.3549	stars and reionization: the cross-correlation of the 21cm line and the  near infrared background	with improving telescopes, it may now be possible to observe the epoch ofreionization in multiple ways. we examine two of these observables - the excesslight in the near-infrared background that may be due to high redshift starsand ionized hii bubbles, and the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen. becausethese two forms of emission should result from different, mutually exclusiveregions, an anticorrelation should exist between them. we discuss the strengthsof using cross-correlations between these observations to learn more about highredshift star formation and reionization history. in particular, we createsimulated maps of emission from both the near-infrared background and 21 cmemission. we find that these observations are anticorrelated, with thestrongest anticorrelation originating from times when the universe is halfionized. this result is robust and does not depend on the properties of thestars themselves. rather, it depends on the ionization history.cross-correlations can provide redshift information, which the near-infraredbackground cannot provide alone. in addition, cross-correlations can helpseparate foreground emission from the true high redshift component, making itpossible to say with greater certainty that we are indeed witnessing the epochof reionization.

1402.0508	light cone effect on the reionization 21-cm signal ii: evolution,  anisotropies and observational implications	measurements of the hi 21-cm power spectra from the reionization epoch willbe influenced by the evolution of the signal along the line-of-sight directionof any observed volume. we use numerical as well as semi-numerical simulationsof reionization in a cubic volume of 607 mpc across to study this so-calledlight cone effect on the hi 21-cm power spectrum. we find that the light coneeffect has the largest impact at two different stages of reionization: one whenreionization is $\sim 20\%$ and other when it is $\sim 80\%$ completed. we finda factor of $\sim 4$ amplification of the power spectrum at the largest scaleavailable in our simulations. we do not find any significant anisotropy in the21-cm power spectrum due to the light cone effect. we argue that for the powerspectrum to become anisotropic, the light cone effect would have to make theionized bubbles significantly elongated or compressed along the line-of-sight,which would require extreme reionization scenarios. we also calculate thetwo-point correlation functions parallel and perpendicular to the line-of-sightand find them to differ. finally, we calculate an optimum frequency bandwidthbelow which the light cone effect can be neglected when extracting powerspectra from observations. we find that if one is willing to accept a $10 \%$error due to the light cone effect, the optimum frequency bandwidth for $k=0.056 \, \rm{mpc}^{-1}$ is $\sim 7.5$ mhz. for $k = 0.15$ and $0.41 \,\rm{mpc}^{-1}$ the optimum bandwidth is $\sim 11$ and $\sim 16$ mhzrespectively.

1407.2637	nonlinear bias of cosmological halo formation in the early universe	we present estimates of the nonlinear bias of cosmological halo formation,spanning a wide range in the halo mass from $\sim 10^{5} m_\odot$ to $\sim10^{12} m_\odot$, based upon both a suite of high-resolution cosmologicaln-body simulations and theoretical predictions. the halo bias is expressed interms of the mean bias and stochasticity as a function of local overdensity($\delta$), under different filtering scales, which is realized as the densityof individual cells in uniform grids. the sampled overdensities span a rangewide enough to provide the fully nonlinear bias effect on the formation ofhaloes. a strong correlation between $\delta$ and halo population overdensity$\delta_h$ is found, along with sizable stochasticity. we find that theempirical mean halo bias matches, with good accuracy, the prediction by thepeak-background split method based on the excursion set formalism, as long asthe empirical, globally-averaged halo mass function is used. consequently, thisbias formalism is insensitive to uncertainties caused by varying haloidentification schemes, and can be applied generically. we also find that theprobability distribution function of biased halo numbers has wider distributionthan the pure poisson shot noise, which is attributed to the sub-cell scalehalo correlation. we explicitly calculate this correlation function and showthat both overdense and underdense regions have positive correlation, leadingto stochasticity larger than the poisson shot noise in the range of haloes andhalo-collapse epochs we study.

1509.02277	the wedge bias in reionization 21-cm power spectrum measurements	a proposed method for dealing with foreground emission in upcoming 21-cmobservations from the epoch of reionization is to limit observations to anuncontaminated window in fourier space. foreground emission can be avoided inthis way, since it is limited to a wedge-shaped region in $k_{\parallel},k_{\perp}$ space. however, the power spectrum is anisotropic owing toredshift-space distortions from peculiar velocities. consequently, the 21-cmpower spectrum measured in the foreground avoidance window---which samples onlya limited range of angles close to the line-of-sight direction---differs fromthe full spherically-averaged power spectrum which requires an average over\emph{all} angles. in this paper, we calculate the magnitude of this "wedgebias" for the first time. we find that the bias is strongest at high redshifts,where measurements using foreground avoidance will over-estimate the powerspectrum by around 100 per cent, possibly obscuring the distinctive rise andfall signature that is anticipated for the spherically-averaged 21-cm powerspectrum. in the later stages of reionization, the bias becomes negative, andsmaller in magnitude ($\lesssim 20$ per cent). the effect shows only a weakdependence on spatial scale and reionization topology.

1509.03464	predictions for the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum observable with  lofar and subaru	the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum is expected to be one of the promisingprobes of the epoch of reionization (eor), as it could offer information aboutthe progress of reionization and the typical scale of ionized regions atdifferent redshifts. with upcoming observations of 21cm emission from the eorwith the low frequency array (lofar), and of high redshift lyalpha emitters(laes) with subaru's hyper suprime cam (hsc), we investigate the observabilityof such cross-power spectrum with these two instruments, which are bothplanning to observe the elais-n1 field at z=6.6. in this paper we use n-body +radiative transfer (both for continuum and lyalpha photons) simulations atredshift 6.68, 7.06 and 7.3 to compute the 3d theoretical 21cm-galaxycross-power spectrum, as well as to predict the 2d 21cm-galaxy cross-powerspectrum expected to be observed by lofar and hsc. once noise and projectioneffects are accounted for, our predictions of the 21cm-galaxy cross-powerspectrum show clear anti-correlation on scales larger than ~ 60 h$^{-1}$ mpc(corresponding to k ~ 0.1 h mpc$^{-1}$), with levels of significance p=0.04 atz=6.6 and p=0.048 at z=7.3. on smaller scales, instead, the signal iscompletely contaminated.

1509.07518	effects of the sources of reionization on 21-cm redshift-space  distortions	the observed 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization will be distortedalong the line-of-sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. theseredshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will alsomake it anisotropic. this anisotropy contains information about thecross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogenfield, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about thesources of reionization. in this paper, we study a collection of simulatedreionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources ofreionization. we show that the 21-cm anisotropy is best measured by thequadrupole moment of the power spectrum. we find that, unless the properties ofthe reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolvesvery predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. this predictabilityimplies that redshift-space distortions are not a very sensitive tool fordistinguishing between reionization sources. however, the quadrupole moment canbe used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history.we show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generationinstruments such as lofar, while the ska should be able to measure thereionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to greataccuracy.

astro-ph;0209216	nonlinear clustering during the cosmic dark ages and its effect on the  21-cm background from minihalos	hydrogen atoms inside virialized minihalos generate a radiation backgroundfrom redshifted 21-cm line emission whose angular fluctuations reflectclustering during before and during reionization. we have shown elsewhere thatthis emission may be detectable with the planned low frequency array (lofar)and square kilometer array (ska) in a flat lambdacdm. this is a direct probe ofstructure during the ``dark ages'' at redshifts z&gt;6 and down to smaller scalesthan have previously been constrained. in our original calculation, we used astandard approximation known as the ``linear bias'' [e.g. mo &amp; white (1996)].here we improve upon that treatment by considering the effect of nonlinearclustering. to accomplish this, we develop a new analytical method forcalculating the nonlinear eulerian bias of halos, which should be useful forother applications as well. predictions of this method are compared with theresults of lambdacdm n-body simulations, showing significantly better agreementthan the standard linear bias approximation. when applied to the 21-cmbackground from minihalos, our formalism predicts fluctuations that differ fromour original predictions by up to 30% at low frequencies and small scales.however, within the range of frequencies and angular scales at which the signalcould be observable by lofar and ska as currently planned, the differences aresmall and our original predictions prove robust. our results indicate thatwhile a smaller frequency bandwidth of observation leads to a higher signalthat is more sensitive to nonlinear effects, this effect is counteracted by thelowered sensitivity of the radio arrays. we calculate the best frequencybandwidth for these observations to be delta nu~2 mhz.(abbreviated)

astro-ph;0408408	minihalo photoevaporation during cosmic reionization: evaporation times  and photon consumption rates	the weak, r-type ionization fronts (i-fronts) which swept across theintergalactic medium (igm) during the reionization of the universe often foundtheir paths blocked by cosmological minihaloes. when this happened, the neutralgas which filled each minihalo was photoevaporated; as the i-front burned itsway through the halo, decelerating from r-type to d-type, all the gas was blownback into the igm as an ionized, supersonic wind. in a previous paper (shapiro,iliev and raga 2004), we described this process and presented our results ofthe first simulations of it by numerical gas dynamics with radiation transportin detail. for illustration we focused on the particular case of a 10^7 solarmasses minihalo overrun at z=9 by an intergalactic i-front caused by a distantsource of ionizing radiation, for different source spectra (either stellar frommassive pop. ii or iii stars, or qso-like) and a flux level typical of thatexpected during reionization. in a lambdacdm universe, minihaloes formed inabundance before and during reionization and, thus, their photoevaporation isan important, possibly dominant, feature of reionization, which slowed it downand wasted ionizing photons. we have now performed a larger set ofhigh-resolution simulations to determine and quantify the dependence ofminihalo photoevaporation times and photon consumption rates on halo mass,redshift, ionizing flux level and spectrum. we find that the average number ofionizing photons each minihalo atom absorbs during its photoevaporation istypically in the range 2-10. for the collapsed fraction in minihaloes expectedduring reionization, this can add about 1 photon per total atom to therequirements for completing reionization, potentially doubling the minimumnumber of photons required to reionize the universe.

astro-ph;0409173	the equilibrium structure of cdm halos	dark-matter halos are the scaffolding around which galaxies and clusters arebuilt. they form when the gravitational instability of primordial densityfluctuations causes regions which are denser than average to slow their cosmicexpansion, recollapse, and virialize. understanding the equilibrium structureof these halos is thus a prerequisite for understanding galaxy and clusterformation. numerical n-body simulations of structure formation fromgaussian-random-noise initial conditions in the cdm universe find a universalinternal structure for halos. objects as different in size and mass as dwarfspheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters are predicted to have halos with thesame basic structure when properly rescaled, independent of halo mass, of theshape of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, and of thecosmological background parameters. this remarkable universality is afundamental prediction of the cdm model, but our knowledge is limited to the``empirical'' n-body simulation results, with little analytical understanding.we summarize here our attempts to fill this gap, in an effort to derive andgive physical insight to the numerical results and extend them beyond the rangeof numerical simulation: (1) simulated halos which form from highly simplifiedinitial conditions involving gravitational instability in a cosmologicalpancake show that many of the universal properties of cdm halos are generic tocosmological gravitational collapse and do not require gaussian-random-noisedensity fluctuations or hierarchical clustering.

astro-ph;0411035	the impact of small-scale structure on cosmological ionization fronts  and reionization	the propagation of cosmological ionization fronts during the reionization ofthe universe is strongly influenced by small-scale gas inhomogeneities due tostructure formation. these inhomogeneities include both collapsed minihalos,which are generally self-shielding, and lower-density structures, which arenot. the minihalos are dense and sufficiently optically-thick to trapintergalactic ionization fronts, blocking their path and robbing them ofionizing photons until the minihalo gas is expelled as an evaporative wind. thelower-density structures do not trap these fronts, but they can slow them downby increasing the overall recombination rate in the intergalactic medium. inthis paper we study the effects of both types of inhomogeneities, includingnonlinear clustering effects, and we find that both igm clumping and collapsedminihalos have significant yet qualitatively different impacts on reionization.while the number density of minihalos on average increases strongly with time,the density of minihalos inside h ii regions around ionizing sources is largelyconstant. thus the impact of minihalos is essentially to decrease the number ofionizing photons available to the igm at all epochs, which is equivalent to areduction in the luminosity of each source. on the other hand, the effect ofigm clumping increases strongly with time, slowing down reionization andextending it. thus while the impact of minihalos is largely degenerate with theunknown source efficiency, igm clumping can help significantly in reconcilingthe recent observations of cosmic microwave background polarization with quasarabsorption spectra at z~6, which together point to an early but extendedreionization epoch.

astro-ph;0505135	ionization fronts and their interaction with density fluctuations:  implications for reionization	the propagation of cosmological ionization fronts (i-fronts) duringreionization is strongly influenced by small-scale structure. here we summarizeour recent attemps to understand the effect of this small-scale structure. wepresent high resolution cosmological n-body simulations at high-z (z&gt;6) whichresolve a wide range of halo mass, from minihalos to clusters of large, rarehalos. we also study how minihalos affect i-fronts, through simulations ofminihalo photoevaporation. furthermore, we modify the i-front propagationequations to account for evolving small-scale structure, and incorporate theseresults into a semi-analytical reionization model. when intergalactic mediumclumping and minihalo clustering around sources are included, small-scalestructure affects reionization by slowing it down and extending it in time.this helps to explain observations by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe,which imply an early and extended reionization epoch. we also study how sourceclustering affects the evolution and size of h ii regions, finding, inagreement with simulations, that h ii regions usually expand, rarely shrinking.hence, "relic h ii regions'' are an exception, rather than the rule. when thesuppression of small-mass sources in already-ionized regions by jeans-massfiltering is accounted for, h ii regions are smaller, delaying overlap. we alsopresent a new numerical method for radiative transfer which is fast, efficient,and easily coupled to hydrodynamics and n-body codes, along with sample testsand applications.

astro-ph;0508416	c^2-ray: a new method for photon-conserving transport of ionizing  radiation	we present a new numerical method for calculating the transfer of ionizingradiation, called c^2-ray=conservative, causal ray-tracing method. the methodis explicitly photon-conserving, so the depletion of ionizing photons bybound-free opacity is guaranteed to equal the photoionizations these photonscaused. as a result, grid cells can be large and very optically-thick withoutloss of accuracy. the method also uses an analytical relaxation solution forthe ionization rate equations for each time step which can accommodate timesteps which greatly exceed the characteristic ionization and ionization frontcrossing times. together, these features make it possible to integrate theequation of transfer along a ray with many fewer cells and time steps thanprevious methods. for multi-dimensional calculations, the code utilizesshort-characteristics ray tracing. c^2-ray is well-suited for couplingradiative transfer to gas and n-body dynamics methods, on both fixed andadaptive grids, without imposing additional limitations on the time step andgrid spacing. we present several tests of the code involving propagation ofionization fronts in one and three dimensions, in both homogeneous andinhomogeneous density fields. we compare to analytical solutions for theionization front position and velocity, some of which we derive here for thefirst time.

astro-ph;0509261	fate of clumps in damped ly$\alpha$ systems	recent observations have revealed that damped ly$\alpha$ clouds (dlas) hoststar formation activity. in order to examine if such star formation activitycan be triggered by ionization fronts, we perform high-resolution hydrodynamicsand radiative transfer simulations of the effect of radiative feedback frompropagating ionization fronts on high-density clumps. we examine two sources ofultraviolet (uv) radiation field to which high-redshift (z ~ 3) galaxies couldbe exposed: one corresponding to the uv radiation originating from stars withinthe dla, itself, and the other corresponding to the uv background radiation. wefind that, for larger clouds, the propagating i-fronts created by local stellarsources can trigger cooling instability and collapse of significant part, up to85%, of the cloud, creating conditions for star formation in a timescale of afew myr. the passage of the i-front also triggers collapse of smaller clumps(with radii below ~4 pc), but in these cases the resulting cold and dense gasdoes not reach conditions conducive to star formation. assuming that 85% of thegas initially in the clump is converted into stars, we obtain a star formationrate of $\sim 0.25 m_\odot {yr}^{-1} {kpc}^{-2}$. this is somewhat higher thanthe value derived from recent observations. on the other hand, the backgrounduv radiation which has harder spectrum fails to trigger cooling and collapse.instead, the hard photons which have long mean-free-path heat the dense clumps,which as a result expand and essentially dissolve in the ambient medium.therefore, the star formation activity in dlas is strongly regulated by theradiative feedback, both from the external uv background and internal stellarsources and we predict quiescent evolution of dlas (not starburst-likeevolution).

astro-ph;0604447	implications of wmap 3 year data for the sources of reionization	new results on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) andits polarization based on the first 3 years of data from the wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe (wmap) have revised the electron scattering opticaldepth downward from tau_es=0.17+0.08-0.07 to tau_es=0.09+/-0.03. this implies ashift of the effective reionization redshift from z_r~17 to z_r~11. previousattempts to explain the high redshift of reionization inferred from the wmap 1year data have led to widespread speculation that the sources of reionizationmust have been much more efficient than those associated with the starformation observed at low redshift. this is consistent, for example, with thesuggestion that early star formation involved massive, population iii starsthat early on produced most of the ionizing radiation escaping from halos. itis therefore tempting to interpret the new wmap results as implying that we cannow relax those previous high demands on the efficiency of the sources ofreionization and perhaps even turn the argument around as evidence against suchhigh efficiency. we show that this is not the case, however. the new wmapresults also find that the primordial density fluctuation power spectrum has alower amplitude, sigma_8, and departs substantially from the scale-invariantspectrum. we show that these effects combine to cancel the impact of the laterreionization implied by the new value of tau_es on the required ionizingefficiency per collapsed baryon. the delay of reionization is surprisingly wellmatched by a comparable delay (by a factor of ~1.4 in scale factor) in theformation of the halos responsible for reionization.

astro-ph;0607517	self-regulated reionization	recently, we have presented the first large-scale radiative transfersimulations of reionization. here we present new simulations which extend thesource halo mass range downward to 10^8m_solar, to capture the full range ofhalo masses thought to be primarily responsible for reionization by their starformation following atomic hydrogen radiative cooling and gravitationalcollapse. haloes below about 10^9m_solar, however, are subject to jeans-massfiltering in the ionized regions, which suppresses their baryonic content andtheir ability to release ionizing radiation. by including these smaller-masshaloes but accounting for their suppression, too, we find that reionization is``self-regulating,'' as follows. as the mean ionized fraction rises, so doesthe fraction of the volume within which suppression occurs. hence, the degreeof suppression is related to the mean ionized fraction. since low-mass haloeswith high emissivity achieve a given mean ionized fraction earlier than dothose with low efficiency, jeans-mass filtering compensates for the differencein the emissivity of the suppressible haloes in these two cases. as a result,in the presence of lower-mass source haloes, reionization begins earlier, butthe later stages of reionization and the time of overlap are dictated by theefficiency of the higher-mass haloes, independent of the efficiency of thesuppressible, lower-mass haloes. reionization histories consistent with currentobservational constraints are shown to be achievable with standard stellarsources in haloes above 10^8m_solar. neither minihalos nor exotic sources arerequired, and the phenomenon of ``double reionization'' previously suggesteddoes not occur.

0811.2748	scale-dependent bias induced by local non-gaussianity: a comparison to  n-body simulations	we investigate the effect of primordial non-gaussianity of the local f_nltype on the auto- and cross-power spectrum of dark matter haloes usingsimulations of the lcdm cosmology. we perform a series of large n-bodysimulations of both positive and negative f_nl, spanning the range between 10and 100. theoretical models predict a scale-dependent bias correction \deltab(k,f_nl) that depends on the linear halo bias b(m). we measure the powerspectra for a range of halo mass and redshifts covering the relevant range ofexisting galaxy and quasar populations. we show that auto and cross-correlationanalyses of bias are consistent with each other. we find that for lowwavenumbers with k&lt;0.03 h/mpc the theory and the simulations agree well witheach other for biased haloes with b(m)&gt;1.5. we show that a scale-independentbias correction improves the comparison between theory and simulations onsmaller scales, where the scale-dependent effect rapidly becomes negligible.the current limits on f_nl from slosar et al. (2008) come mostly from verylarge scales k&lt;0.01 h/mpc and, therefore, remain valid. for the halo sampleswith b(m)&lt;1.5-2 we find that the scale- dependent bias from non-gaussianityactually exceeds the theoretical predictions. our results are consistent withthe bias correction scaling linearly with f_nl.
