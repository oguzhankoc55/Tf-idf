0901.1138	the acs fornax cluster survey. v. measurement and recalibration of  surface brightness fluctuations and a precise value of the fornax--virgo  relative distance	we present g-z color and z-band surface brightness fluctuations (sbf)measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster imaged withhst/acs. these are combined with measurements for virgo cluster galaxies toderive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z-band sbf absolute magnitude asa function of g-z. in all, we tabulate recalibrated sbf distances for 134galaxies in virgo, fornax, the virgo w' group, and ngc4697 in the virgosouthern extension. the calibration procedure yields a precise relativedistance modulus for fornax with respect to virgo of 0.42+/-0.03 mag, or adistance ratio 1.214 +/- 0.017. the resulting fornax distance modulus is 31.51+/-0.03 +/-0.15 mag, 20.0 +/-0.3 +/-1.4 mpc, where the second set of error barsreflects systematic uncertainty from our assumed virgo distance of 16.5 mpc.the rms distance scatter for the early-type fornax galaxies is0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.15} mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky.this translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or "cosmic",scatter sigma_cosmic in the sbf calibration, unlike in virgo. as a result, weare able to place the first tight constraints on the value of sigma_cosmic,finding 0.06 +/- 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of sigma_cosmic&lt;0.08 mag, atleast for galaxies with g-z&gt;1.02. we also present an alternative sbfcalibration based on the `fluctuation count' parameter nbar, a proxy for galaxymass, which gives a consistent relative distance. finally, we find no evidencefor systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g.,no current infall); the fornax cluster appears both compact and wellvirialized.[abridged]

1003.3450	the acs fornax cluster survey vii. half-light radii of globular clusters  in early-type galaxies	we measure the half-light radii of globular clusters (gcs) in 43 galaxiesfrom the acs fornax cluster survey (acsfcs). we use these data to extendprevious work in which the environmental dependencies of the half-light radiiof gcs in early type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey (acsvcs) werestudied, and a corrected mean half-light radius (corrected for the observedenvironmental trends) was suggested as a reliable distance indicator. this workboth increases the sample size for the study of the environmental dependencies,and adds leverage to the study of the corrected half-light radius as a possibledistance indicator (since fornax lies at a larger distance than the virgocluster). we study the environmental dependencies of the size of gcs using botha principal component analysis as well as 2d scaling relations. we largelyconfirm the environmental dependencies shown in jordan et al. (2005), but findevidence that there is a residual correlation in the mean half-light radius ofgc systems with galaxy magnitude, and subtle differences in the othercorrelations - so there may not be a universal correction for the half-lightradii of lower luminosity galaxy gc systems. the main factor determining thesize of a gc in an early type galaxy is the gc color. red gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; =2.8+/-0.3 pc, while blue gcs have &lt;r_h&gt; = 3.4+/-0.3 pc. we show that for brightearly-type galaxies (m_b &lt; -19 mag), the uncorrected mean half-light radius ofthe gc system is by itself an excellent distance indicator (with error ~11%),having the potential to reach cosmologically interesting distances in the eraof high angular resolution adaptive optics on large optical telescopes.

1004.2883	the acs fornax cluster survey. viii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in virgo and fornax early-type galaxies and its use as a distance  indicator	we use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globularcluster luminosity function (gclf). the globular cluster system of each galaxywas studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic gclfafter accounting for contamination and completeness effects. the resultspresented here update our virgo measurements and confirm our previous resultsshowing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the gclf and the absolutemagnitude of the parent galaxy. regarding the use of the gclf as a standardcandle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the virgo andfornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distanceestimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived fromsurface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. fromnumerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the valueof the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsicdispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for virgo and fornaxrespectively. all in all, our study shows that the gclf properties varysystematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy betweengiant and dwarf early-type galaxies. these properties may be influenced by thecluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.

1009.3270	surface brightness fluctuations in the hubble space telescope acs/wfc  f814w bandpass and an update on galaxy distances	we measure surface brightness fluctuation (sbf) magnitudes in the f814wfilter and g-i colors for nine bright early-type fornax cluster galaxies imagedwith the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs). the goal isto achieve the first systematic sbf calibration for the acs/f814w bandpass.because of its much higher throughput, f814w is more efficient for sbf studiesof distant galaxies than the acs/f850lp bandpass that has been used to studynearby systems. over the color range spanned by the sample galaxies,1.06&lt;g-i&lt;1.32 (ab mag), the dependence of sbf magnitude mbar_i on g-i is linearto a good approximation, with slope $\sim2$. when the f850lp sbf distancemeasurements from the acs fornax cluster survey are used to derive absolutembar_i magnitudes, the dependence on g-i becomes extremely tight, with a slopeof $1.8\pm0.2$ and scatter of 0.03 mag. the small observed scatter indicatesboth that the estimated random errors are correct, and that the intrinsicdeviations from the sbf-color relation are strongly correlated between thef814w and f850lp bandpasses, as expected. the agreement with predictions fromstellar population models is good, both in slope and zero point, indicatingthat our mean fornax distance of 20 mpc is accurate. the models predictcurvature in the relation beyond the color limits of our sample; thus, thelinear calibration should not be extrapolated naively. in the appendices, wereconsider the tonry ground-based and jensen nicmos sbf distance catalogues; weprovide a correction formula to ameliorate the small apparent bias in theformer, and the offset needed to make the latter consistent with other sbfstudies. we also tabulate two new sbf distances to galaxies observed in the acsvirgo cluster survey.

1012.0306	the acs fornax cluster survey. iv. deprojection of the surface  brightness profiles of early-type galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters:  investigating the "core/power-law dichotomy"	although early observations with the hubble space telescope (hst) pointed toa sharp dichotomy among early-type galaxies in terms of the logarithmic slopegamma' of their central surface brightness profiles, several studies in thepast few years have called this finding into question. in particular, recentimaging surveys of 143 early-type galaxies belonging to the virgo and fornaxclusters using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on board hst have notfound a dichotomy in gamma', but instead a systematic progression from centralluminosity deficit to excess relative to the inward extrapolation of thebest-fitting global sersic model. given that earlier studies also found thatthe dichotomy persisted when analyzing the deprojected density profile slopes,we investigate the distribution of the three-dimensional luminosity densityprofiles of the acs virgo and fornax cluster survey galaxies. having fitted thesurface brightness profiles with modified sersic models, we then deproject thegalaxies using an abel integral and measure the inner slopes gamma_3d of theresulting luminosity density profiles at various fractions of the effectiveradius r_e. we find no evidence of a dichotomy, but rather, a continuousvariation in the central luminosity profiles as a function of galaxy magnitude.we introduce a parameter, delta_3d, that measures the central deviation of thedeprojected luminosity profiles from the global sersic fit, showing that thisparameter varies smoothly and systematically along the luminosity function.

1012.2634	the acs fornax cluster survey. x. color gradients of globular cluster  systems in early-type galaxies	we use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (gcs), drawn fromthe acsvcs and acsfcs, to investigate the color gradients of gc systems in 76early-type galaxies. we find that most gc systems possess an obvious negativegradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). for gc systems displaying colorbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor gc subpopulations present shallowerbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these twosubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. the fov of acs mainly restrictsus to measuring the inner gradients of gc systems. these gradients, however,can introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of gcsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. inferred correctionsto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the meancolor of metal-poor gcs and their host galaxy luminosity. the gc colorgradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens areweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarfgalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar massof m_stellar~10^10m_sun. we also measure color gradients for field stars in thehost galaxies. we find that gc color gradients are systematically steeper thanfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is thesame for both. if gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse andweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner gcsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidlywith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. the lack ofstrong gradients in the gc systems of dwarfs, which probably have notexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos wereinefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of gc formation.

1105.6043	size evolution of spheroids in a hierarchical universe	we present basic predictions of an updated version of the munichsemi-analytic hierarchical galaxy formation model that grows bulges via mergersand disk instabilities. overall, we find that while spheroids below ms ~ 10^11msun grow their sizes via a mixture of disk instability and mergers, galaxiesabove it mainly evolve via mergers. including gas dissipation in major mergers,efficiently shrinks galaxies, especially those with final mass ms &lt; 10^11 msunthat are the most gas-rich, improving the match with different observables. wefind that the predicted scatter in sizes at fixed stellar mass is still largerthan the observed one by up to &lt;40%. spheroids are, on average, more compact athigher redshifts at fixed stellar mass, and at fixed redshift and stellar masslarger galaxies tend to be more starforming. more specifically, while forbulge-dominated galaxies the model envisages a nearly mass-independent decreasein sizes, the predicted size evolution for intermediate-mass galaxies is morecomplex. the z=2 progenitors of massive galaxies with mass around ms andb/t&gt;0.7 at z=0, are found to be mostly disc-dominated galaxies with a medianb/t ~ 0.3, with only ~20% remaining bulge-dominated. the model also predictsthat central spheroids living in more massive haloes tend to have larger sizesat fixed stellar mass. including host halo mass dependence in computingvelocity dispersions, allows the model to properly reproduce the correlationswith stellar mass. we also discuss the fundamental plane, the correlations withgalaxy age, the structural properties of pseudobulges, and the correlationswith central black holes.

1109.6040	galaxies in x-ray groups i: robust membership assignment and the impact  of group environments on quenching	understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxieswith redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formationrates than field populations remains an important problem. as most candidateprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations ofthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a rangein halo mass and redshift are needed. in this work, we present and test arigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based onprecise photometric redshifts and x-ray selected groups drawn from the cosmosfield. the groups have masses in the range 10^13 &lt; m_200c/m_sun &lt; 10^14 andspan redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. we characterize our selection algorithm via tests onspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the vlt, and byapplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. we find that our group membergalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 r200c. wemeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on thequality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as wellas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. as a first application of our newgroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that membergalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixedstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between starformation and environment at group scales. we also address the suggestion thatdusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrumof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannotexplain the low power seen in recent sz measurements.

1205.1785	early-type galaxies at z = 1.3. i. the lynx supercluster: cluster and  groups at z=1.3. morphology and color-magnitude relation	we confirm the detection of 3 groups in the lynx supercluster, at z~1.3, andgive their redshifts and masses. we study the properties of the group galaxiesas compared to the central clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453, selecting89 galaxies in the clusters and 74 galaxies in the groups. we morphologicallyclassify galaxies by visual inspection, noting that our early-type galaxy (etg)sample would have been contaminated at the 30% -40% level by simple automatedclassification methods (e.g. based on sersic index). in luminosity selectedsamples, both clusters and groups show high fractions of sa galaxies. the etgfractions never rise above ~50% in the clusters, which is low compared to thefractions observed in clusters at z~1. however, etg plus sa fractions aresimilar to those observed for etgs in clusters at z~1. bulge-dominated galaxiesvisually classified as sas might also be etgs with tidal features or mergerremnants. they are mainly red and passive, and span a large range inluminosity. their star formation seems to have been quenched beforeexperiencing a morphological transformation. because their fraction is smallerat lower redshifts, they might be the spiral population that evolves into etgs.for mass-selected samples, the etg fraction show no significant evolution withrespect to local clusters, suggesting that morphological transformations occurat lower masses and densities. the etg mass-size relation shows evolutiontowards smaller sizes at higher redshift in both clusters and groups, while thelate-type mass-size relation matches that observed locally. the group etg redsequence shows lower zero points and larger scatters than in clusters, bothexpected to be an indication of a younger galaxy population. the estimated agedifference is small when compared to the difference in age at different galaxymasses.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1207.5793	the evolution of the mass-size relation for early type galaxies from z~1  to the present: dependence on environment, mass-range and detailed morphology	[abridged] we study the dependence of the galaxy size evolution onmorphology, stellar mass and large scale environment for a sample of 298 groupand 384 field quiescent early-type galaxies from the cosmos survey, selectedfrom z~1 to the present, and with masses $log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.5$.  the galaxy size growth depends on galaxy mass and early-type galaxymorphology, e.g., elliptical galaxies evolve differently than lenticulargalaxies. at the low mass end -$10.5&lt;log(m/m_\odot)&lt;11$, ellipticals do notshow strong size growth from $z\sim1$ to the present (10% to 30% depending onthe morphological classification). on the other end, massive ellipticals-log(m/m_\odot)&gt;11.2$- approximately doubled their size. interestingly,lenticular galaxies display different behavior: they appear more compact onaverage and they do show a size growth of \sim60% since z=1 independent ofstellar mass. we compare our results with state-of-the art semi-analyticmodels.  while major and minor mergers can account for most of the galaxy size growth,we find that with present data and the theoretical uncertainties in themodeling we cannot state clear evidence favoring either merger or mass loss viaquasar and/or stellar winds as the primary mechanism driving the evolution.  the galaxy mass--size relation and the size growth do not depend onenvironment in the halo mass range explored in this work (field to group mass$log(m_h/m_\odot)&lt;14$), i.e., group and field galaxies follow the same trends,which is at variance with predictions from current hierarchical models thatshow a clear dependence of size growth on halo mass for massive ellipticals-$log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11.2$.

1208.0338	the acs fornax cluster survey. vi. the nuclei of early-type galaxies in  the fornax cluster	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) fornax cluster survey is a hubble spacetelescope program to image 43 early-type galaxies in the fornax cluster, usingthe f475w and f850lp bandpasses of the acs. we employ both 1d and 2d techniquesto characterize the properties of the stellar nuclei in these galaxies, definedas the central "luminosity excesses" relative to a sersic model fitted to theunderlying host. we find 72+/-13% of our sample (31 galaxies) to be nucleated,with only three of the nuclei offset by more than 0.5" from their galaxyphotocenter, and with the majority of nuclei having colors bluer than theirhosts. the nuclei are observed to be larger, and brighter, than typical fornaxglobular clusters, and to follow different structural scaling relations. acomparison of our results to those from the acs virgo cluster survey revealsstriking similarities in the properties of the nuclei belonging to thesedifferent environments. we briefly review a variety of proposed formationmodels and conclude that, for the low-mass galaxies in our sample, the mostimportant mechanism for nucleus growth is probably infall of star clustersthrough dynamical friction, while for higher mass galaxies, gas accretiontriggered by mergers, accretions and tidal torques is likely to dominate, withthe relative importance of these two processes varying smoothly as a functionof galaxy mass. some intermediate-mass galaxies in our sample show a complexityin their inner structure that may be the signature of "hybrid nuclei" thatarose through parallel formation channels.

1212.4143	no evidence for a dependence of the mass size relation of early-type  galaxies on environment in the local universe	the early--type galaxy (etg) mass--size relation has been largely studied tounderstand how these galaxies have assembled their mass. one key observationalresult of the last years is that massive galaxies increased their size by afactor of a few at fixed stellar mass from $z\sim2$. hierarchical models favorminor mergers as a plausible driver of this size growth. some of these models,predict a significant environmental dependence in the sense that galaxiesresiding in more massive halos tend to be larger than galaxies in lower masshalos, at fixed stellar mass and redshift. at present, observational results ofthis environmental dependence have been contradictory. in this paper we revisitthis issue in the local universe, by investigating how the sizes of massiveetgs depend on large-scale environment using an updated and accurate sample ofetgs in different environments - field, group, clusters - from the sloandigital sky survey dr7. our analysis does not show any significantenvironmental dependence of the sizes of central and satellites etgs at fixedstellar mass at $z\sim0$. the size-mass relation of early-type galaxies at$z\sim0$ seems to be universal, i.e., independent of the mass of the host haloand of the position of the galaxy in that halo (central or satellite). theresult is robust to different galaxy selections based on star formation,morphology or central density. in fact, considering our observational errorsand the size of the sample, any size ratio larger than $30-40%$ between massivegalaxies ($log(m_*/m_\odot)&gt;11$) living in clusters and in the field can beruled out at $3\sigma$ level.

1304.0824	the acs virgo cluster survey. xvii. the spatial alignment of globular  cluster systems with early-type host galaxies	we study the azimuthal distribution of globular clusters (gcs) in early-typegalaxies and compare them to their host galaxies using data from the acs virgocluster survey. we find that in host galaxies with visible elongation (epsilon&gt; 0.2) and intermediate to high luminosities (m_z&lt;-19), the gcs arepreferentially aligned along the major axis of the stellar light. the red(metal-rich) gc subpopulations show strong alignment with the major axis of thehost galaxy, which supports the notion that these gcs are associated withmetal-rich field stars. the metal-rich gcs in lenticular galaxies show signs ofbeing more strongly associated with disks rather than bulges. surprisingly, wefind that the blue (metal-poor) gcs can also show the same correlation. if themetal-poor gcs are part of the early formation of the halo and built up throughmergers, then our results support a picture where halo formation and mergingoccur anisotropically, and where the present day major axis is an indicator ofthe preferred merging axis.

1407.2263	the next generation virgo cluster survey. v. modelling the dynamics of  m87 with the made-to-measure method	we study the dynamics of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 from the central tothe outermost regions with the made-to-measure (m2m) method. we use a newcatalogue of 922 globular cluster line-of- sight velocities extending to aprojected radius of 180 kpc (equivalent to 25 m87 effective radii), and sauronintegral field unit data within the central 2.4 kpc. 263 globular clusters,mainly located beyond 40 kpc, are newly observed by the next generation virgosurvey (ngvs). for the m2m modelling, the gravitational potential is taken as acombination of a luminous matter potential with a constant stellarmass-to-light ratio and a dark matter potential modelled as a logarithmicpotential. our best dynamical model returns a stellar mass-to-light ratio inthe i band of m/li = 6.0(+ -0.3) m_sun/l_sun with a dark matter potential scalevelocity of 591(+ -50) km/s and scale radius of 42(+ -10) kpc. we determine thetotal mass of m87 within 180 kpc to be (1.5 + - 0.2) 10^13 m_sun. the masswithin 40 kpc is smaller than previous estimates determined using globularcluster kinematics that did not extend beyond 45 kpc. with our new globularcluster velocities at much larger radii, we see that globular clusters around40 kpc show an anomalously large velocity dispersion which affected previousresults. the mass we derived is in good agreement with that inferred from rosatx-ray observation out to 180 kpc. within 30 kpc our mass is also consistentwith that inferred from chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations, while within120 kpc it is about 20% smaller. the model velocity dispersion anisotropy betaparameter for the globular clusters in m87 is small, varying from -0.2 at thecentre to 0.2 at 40 kpc, and gradually decreasing to zero at 120 kpc.

1408.2821	the next generation virgo cluster survey. viii. the spatial distribution  of globular clusters in the virgo cluster	we report on a large-scale study of the distribution of globular clusters(gcs) throughout the virgo cluster, based on photometry from the nextgeneration virgo cluster survey, a large imaging survey covering virgo'sprimary subclusters to their virial radii. using the g', (g'-i')color-magnitude diagram of unresolved and marginally-resolved sources, weconstructed 2-d maps of the gc distribution. we present the clearest evidenceto date showing the difference in concentration between red and blue gcs overthe extent of the cluster, where the red (metal-rich) gcs are largely locatedaround the massive early-type galaxies, whilst the blue (metal-poor) gcs have amore extended spatial distribution, with significant populations present beyond83' (215 kpc) along the major axes of m49 and m87. the gc distribution aroundm87 and m49 shows remarkable agreement with the shape, ellipticity and boxinessof the diffuse light surrounding both galaxies. we find evidence for spatialenhancements of gcs surrounding m87 that may be indicative of recentinteractions or an ongoing merger history. we compare the gc map to thelocations of virgo galaxies and the intracluster x-ray gas, and find goodagreement between these baryonic structures. the virgo cluster contains a totalpopulation of 67300$\pm$14400 gcs, of which 35% are located in m87 and m49alone. we compute a cluster-wide specific frequency s_n,cl=$2.8\pm0.7$,including virgo's diffuse light. the gc-to-baryonic mass fraction ise_b=$5.7\pm1.1\times10^{-4} $and the gc-to-total cluster mass formationefficiency is e_t=$2.9\pm0.5\times10^{-5}$, values slightly lower than, butconsistent with, those derived for individual galactic halos. our results showthat the production of the complex structures in the unrelaxed virgo clustercore (including the diffuse intracluster light) is an ongoingprocess.(abridged)

1410.7402	understanding the unique assembly history of central group galaxies	central galaxies (cgs) in massive halos live in unique environments withformation histories closely linked to that of the host halo. in local clustersthey have larger sizes ($r_e$) and lower velocity dispersions (sigma) at fixedstellar mass m_star, and much larger r_e at a fixed $\sigma$ than field andsatellite galaxies (non-cgs). using spectroscopic observations of groupgalaxies selected from the cosmos survey, we compare the dynamical scalingrelations of early-type cgs and non-cgs at z~0.6, to distinguish possiblemechanisms that produce the required evolution. cgs are systematically offsettowards larger r_e at fixed $\sigma$ compared to non-cgs with similar m_star.the cg r_e-m_star relation also shows differences, primarily driven by asub-population (~15%) of galaxies with large $r_e$, while the m_star-sigmarelations are indistinguishable. these results are accentuated when doublesersic profiles, which better fit light in the outer regions of galaxies, areadopted. they suggest that even group-scale cgs can develop extended componentsby these redshifts that can increase total $r_e$ and m_star estimates byfactors of ~2. to probe the evolutionary link between our sample and clustercgs, we also analyze two cluster samples at z~0.6 and z~0. we find similarresults for the more massive halos at comparable z, but much more distinct cgscaling relations at low-z. thus, the rapid, late-time accretion of outercomponents, perhaps via the stripping and accretion of satellites, would appearto be a key feature that distinguishes the evolutionary history of cgs.

1501.02800	avoiding progenitor bias: the structural and mass evolution of brightest  group and cluster galaxies in hierarchical models since z~1	the mass and structural evolution of massive galaxies is one of the hottesttopics in galaxy formation. this is because it may reveal invaluable insightsinto the still debated evolutionary processes governing the growth and assemblyof spheroids. however, direct comparison between models and observations isusually prevented by the so-called "progenitor bias", i.e., new galaxiesentering the observational selection at later epochs, thus eluding a precisestudy of how pre-existing galaxies actually evolve in size. to limit thiseffect, we here gather data on high-redshift brightest group and clustergalaxies, evolve their (mean) host halo masses down to z=0 along their mainprogenitors, and assign as their "descendants" local sdss central galaxiesmatched in host halo mass. at face value, the comparison between high redshiftand local data suggests a noticeable increase in stellar mass of a factor of &gt;2since z~1, and of &gt;2.5 in mean effective radius. we then compare the inferredstellar mass and size growth with those predicted by hierarchical models forcentral galaxies, selected at high redshifts to closely match the halo andstellar mass bins as in the data. only hierarchical models characterized byvery limited satellite stellar stripping and parabolic orbits are capable ofbroadly reproducing the stellar mass and size increase of a factor ~2-4observed in cluster galaxies since z ~1. the predicted, average (major) mergerrate since z~1 is in good agreement with the latest observational estimates.

1501.04726	the science case for multi-object spectroscopy on the european elt	this white paper presents the scientific motivations for a multi-objectspectrograph (mos) on the european extremely large telescope (e-elt). the moscase draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,to the study of the halo of the milky way and its satellites, and from resolvedstellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised universe. the materialpresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over thepast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a commonstrategy toward realising a mos capability on the e-elt. the cases have beendistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define themosaic instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and'high definition'). when combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of thee-elt, mosaic will be the world's leading mos facility. in analysing therequirements we also identify a high-multiplex mos for the longer-term plansfor the e-elt, with an even greater multiplex (&gt;1000 targets) to enable studiesof large-scale structures in the high-redshift universe. following the greenlight for the construction of the e-elt the mos community, structured throughthe mosaic consortium, is eager to realise a mos on the e-elt as soon aspossible. we argue that several of the most compelling cases for elt science,in highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. forexample, mos observations in the early stages of e-elt operations will beessential for follow-up of sources identified by the james webb space telescope(jwst). in particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate skysubtraction with fibres have both recently been demonstrated on sky, makingfast-track development of mosaic feasible.

1503.01113	i. apples to apples $a^2$: realistic galaxy simulated catalogs and  photometric redshift predictions for next-generation surveys	we present new mock catalogues for two of the largest stage-ivnext-generation surveys in the optical and infrared: lsst and euclid, based onan n-body simulation+semi-analytical cone with a posterior modification with\texttt{photreal}. this technique modifies the original photometry by using anempirical library of spectral templates to make it more realistic. thereliability of the catalogues is confirmed by comparing the obtainedcolor-magnitude relation, the luminosity and mass function and the angularcorrelation function with those of real data.  consistent comparisons between the expected photometric redshifts fordifferent surveys are also provided. very deep near infrared surveys such aseuclid will provide very good performance ($\delta z/(1+z) \sim 0.025-0.053$)down to $h\sim24$ ab mag and up to $z\sim3$ depending on the opticalobservations available from the ground whereas extremely deep optical surveyssuch as lsst will obtain an overall lower photometric redshift resolution($\delta z/(1+z) \sim 0.045$) down to $i\sim27.5$ ab mag, being considerablyimproved ($\delta z/(1+z) \sim 0.035$) if we restrict the sample down toi$\sim$24 ab mag. those numbers can be substantially upgraded by selecting asubsample of galaxies with the best quality photometric redshifts. we finallydiscuss the impact that these surveys will have for the community in terms ofphotometric redshift legacy.  this is the first of a series of papers where we set a framework forcomparability between mock catalogues and observations with a particular focuson cluster surveys. the euclid and lsst mocks are made publicly available inthe following link: http://photmocks.obspm.fr/.

1505.05421	a gemini/gmos study of intermediate luminosity early-type virgo cluster  galaxies. i. globular cluster and stellar kinematics	we present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster systems and diffusestellar light of four intermediate luminosity (sub-$l^{\ast}$) early-typegalaxies in the virgo cluster based on gemini/gmos data. our galaxy sample isfainter ($-23.8&lt;m_k&lt;-22.7$) than most previous studies, nearly doubling thenumber of galaxies in this magnitude range that now have gc kinematics. thedata for the diffuse light extends to $4r_e$, and the data for the globularclusters reaches 8--$12r_e$. we find that the kinematics in these outer regionsare all different despite the fact that these four galaxies have similarphotometric properties, and are uniformly classified as "fast rotators" fromtheir stellar kinematics within $1r_e$. the globular cluster systems exhibit awide range of kinematic morphology. the rotation axis and amplitude can changebetween the inner and outer regions, including a case of counter-rotation. thisdifference shows the importance of wide-field kinematic studies, and shows thatstellar and gc kinematics can change significantly as one moves beyond theinner regions of galaxies. moreover, the kinematics of the globular clustersystems can differ from that of the stars, suggesting that the formation of thetwo populations are also distinct.

1506.03084	the morphologies of massive galaxies from z~3 - witnessing the 2  channels of bulge growth	[abridged] we quantify the morphological evolution of z~0 massive galaxies($m*/m_\odot\sim10^{11}$) from z~3 in the 5 candels fields. the progenitors areselected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth.the morphologies strongly evolve from z~3. at z&lt;1, the population matches themassive end of the hubble sequence, with 30% of spheroids, 50% of galaxies withequally dominant disk and bulge components and 20% of disks. at z~2-3 there isa majority of irregular systems (~60-70%) with still 30% of spheroids.  we then analyze the sfrs, gas fractions and structural properties for thedifferent morphologies independently. our results suggest two distinct channelsfor the growth of bulges in massive galaxies.  around 30-40% were already bulges at z~2.5, with low average sfrs andgas-fractions (10-15%), high sersic indices (n&gt;3-4) and small effective radii($r_e$~1 kpc) pointing towards an early formation through gas-rich mergers orvdi. between z~ 2.5 and z~0, they rapidly increase their size by a factor of~4-5, become all passive but their global morphology remains unaltered. thestructural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it isdriven by ex-situ events.  the remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, fromclumpy disks to more regular bulge+disks systems, essentially happening at z&gt;1.it results in the growth of a significant bulge component (n~3) for 2/3 of thesystems possibly through the migration of clumps while the remaining 1/3 keepsa rather small bulge (n~1.5-2). the transition phase between disturbed andrelaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease ofthe star formation activity and the gas fractions. the growth of the effectiveradii scales roughly with $h(z)^{-1}$ and it is therefore consistent with theexpected growth of disks in galaxy haloes.

1507.02737	the next generation virgo cluster survey. ix. estimating the efficiency  of galaxy formation on the lowest-mass scales	the next generation virgo cluster survey has recently determined theluminosity function of galaxies in the core of the virgo cluster down tounprecedented magnitude and surface brightness limits. comparing simulations ofcluster formation to the derived central stellar mass function, we attempt toestimate the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio (shmr) for dwarf galaxies, as it wouldhave been before they fell into the cluster. this approach ignores severaldetails and complications, e.g., the contribution of ongoing star formation tothe present-day stellar mass of cluster members, and the effects of adiabaticcontraction and/or violent feedback on the subhalo and cluster potentials. thefinal results are startlingly simple, however; we find that the trends in theshmr determined previously for bright galaxies appear to extend down in ascale-invariant way to the faintest objects detected in the survey. theseresults extend measurements of the formation efficiency of field galaxies bytwo decades in halo mass, or five decades in stellar mass, down to some of theleast massive dwarf galaxies known, with stellar masses of $\sim 10^5 m_\odot$.

1508.07334	the next generation virgo cluster survey. x. properties of ultra-compact  dwarfs in the m87, m49 and m60 regions	we use imaging from the next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) topresent a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (ucd) galaxies associatedwith three prominent virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive,red-sequence galaxies m87, m49 and m60. we show how ucds can be selected withhigh completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location incolor-color diagrams ($u^*ik_s$ or $u^*gz$). although the central galaxies ineach of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellarmasses, we find large differences in the sizes of their ucd populations, withm87 containing ~3.5 and 7.8 times more ucds than m49 and m60, respectively. therelative abundance of ucds in the three regions scales in proportion tosub-cluster mass, as traced by x-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, numberof globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. we find that the ucds arepredominantly blue in color, with ~85% of the ucds having colors similar toblue gcs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. we present evidence that ucdssurrounding m87 and m49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by theprominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately mergingwith the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominencecorrelates with distance from either galaxy. our analysis provides evidencethat tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in theformation of ucds.

astro-ph;0405188	the acs virgo cluster survey iii. chandra and hst observations of  low-mass x-ray binaries and globular clusters in m87	the acis instrument on board the chandra x-ray observatory has been used tocarry out the first systematic study of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in m87.we identify 174 x-ray point-sources, of which ~150 are likely lmxbs. this lmxbcatalog is combined with deep f475w and f850lp images taken with acs on hst toexamine the connection between lmxbs and globular clusters in m87. of the 1688globular clusters in our catalog, f_x = 3.6 +- 0.5% contain a lmxb and we findthat the metal-rich clusters are 3 +- 1 times more likely to harbor a lmxb thantheir metal-poor counterparts. in agreement with previous findings for othergalaxies, we find that brighter, more metal-rich clusters are more likely tocontain a lmxb. for the first time, however, we are able to demonstrate thatthe probability, p_x, that a given cluster will contain a lmxb dependssensitively on the dynamical properties of the host cluster. specifically, weuse the hst images to measure the half-light radius, concentration index andcentral density, \rho_0, for each globular, and define a parameter, \gamma,which is related to the tidal capture and binary-neutron star exchange rate.our preferred form for p_x is then p_x \propto \gamma \rho_0^{-0.42\pm0.11}(z/z_{\odot})^{0.33\pm0.1}. we argue that if the form of p_x is determined bydynamical processes, then the observed metallicity dependence is a consequenceof an increased number of neutron stars per unit mass in metal-rich globularclusters. finally, we find no compelling evidence for a break in the luminositydistribution of resolved x-ray point sources. instead, the lmxb luminosityfunction is well described by a power law with an upper cutoff at l_x ~ 10^39erg/s.

astro-ph;0501325	the acs virgo cluster survey iv: data reduction procedures for surface  brightness fluctuation measurements with the advanced camera for surveys	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) virgo cluster survey is a large programto image 100 early-type virgo galaxies using the f475w and f850lp bandpasses ofthe wide field channel of the acs instrument on the hubble space telescope(hst). the scientific goals of this survey include an exploration of thethree-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster and a critical examination ofthe usefulness of the globular cluster luminosity function as a distanceindicator. both of these issues require accurate distances for the full sampleof 100 program galaxies. in this paper, we describe our data reductionprocedures and examine the feasibility of accurate distance measurements usingthe method of surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) applied to the acs virgocluster survey f850lp imaging. the acs exhibits significant geometricaldistortions due to its off-axis location in the hst focal plane; correcting forthese distortions by resampling the pixel values onto an undistorted frameresults in pixel correlations that depend on the nature of the interpolationkernel used for the resampling. this poses a major challenge for the sbftechnique, which normally assumes a flat power spectrum for the noise. weinvestigate a number of different interpolation kernels and show through ananalysis of simulated galaxy images having realistic noise properties that itis possible, depending on the kernel, to measure sbf distances usingdistortion-corrected acs images without introducing significant additionalerror from the resampling. we conclude by showing examples of real image powerspectra from our survey.

astro-ph;0503566	the acs virgo cluster survey. vii. resolving the connection between  globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	we investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compactdwarf galaxies (ucds) by examining the properties of several compact objectsassociated with m87, all of which were previously classified as globularclusters. combining imaging from the hubble space telescope with ground-basedkeck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocitydispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictionsof population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately20pc, and have v-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. these objects,which we consider to be ucds, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticalgalaxies in virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities andcolors. these ucds are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations ofgalaxies more closely than those of galactic globular clusters. there appearsto be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of abouttwo million solar masses. if the ucds are gravitationally bound, then wesuggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental propertydistinguishing globular clusters from ucds. more than half of the ucdcandidates uncovered in the acs virgo cluster survey are associated with asingle galaxy -- m87 -- which suggests that proximity to the virgo center maybe of critical importance for the formation of these objects. these resultsshow that distinguishing bonafide ucds from bright globular clusters requires acareful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,particularly their mass-to-light ratios.

astro-ph;0506314	the acs virgo cluster survey v: sbf calibration for giant and dwarf  early-type galaxies	as part of the advanced camera for survey (acs) virgo cluster survey, we havemeasured surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 100 early-typevirgo galaxies. distances derived from these measurements are needed to explorethe three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster, study the intrinsicparameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, andcompare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosityfunctions. our sbf measurements have been performed in the f850lp bandpass ofthe wide field channel of the acs on the hubble space telescope. these are thefirst measurements of this kind, and we present the first sbf calibration forthis bandpass. the measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar populationvariations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 andz_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the f475w and f850lp acsfilters. we derive the following calibration for the absolute sbf magnitudem_850: m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in therange 1.3 &lt;(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.6, and m_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 &lt;=(g_475-z_850)_0 &lt;= 1.3. physically,the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giantellipticals and s0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. forthe first time in sbf studies, we are able to provide a firm empiricalcalibration of sbf in early-type dwarf galaxies. our results agree with stellarpopulation model predictions from bruzual &amp; charlot (2003).

astro-ph;0507699	detection of radial surface brightness fluctuation and color gradients  in elliptical galaxies with acs	we study surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) in a sample of 8 ellipticalgalaxies using advanced camera for surveys (acs) wide field channel (wfc) datadrawn from the hubble space telescope (hst) archive. sbf magnitudes in thef814w bandpass, and galaxy colors from f814w, f435w, and f606w images -- whenavailable -- are presented. galaxy surface brightness profiles are determinedas well. we present the first sbf--broadband color calibration for the acs/wfcf814w bandpass, and (relative) distance moduli estimates for 7 of our galaxies.  we detect and study in detail the sbf variations within individual galaxiesas a probe of possible changes in the underlying stellar populations.inspecting both the sbf and color gradients in comparison to model predictions,we argue that sbf, and sbf-gradients, can in principle be used for unravelingthe different evolutionary paths taken by galaxies, though a more comprehensivestudy of this issue would be required. we confirm that the radial variation ofgalaxy stellar population properties should be mainly connected to the presenceof radial chemical abundance gradients, with the outer galaxy regions beingmore metal poor than the inner ones.

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0602297	the acs virgo cluster survey. vi. isophotal analysis and the structure  of early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the morphology, isophotalparameters and surface brightness profiles for 100 early-type members of thevirgo cluster, from dwarfs (m_b = -15.1 mag) to giants (m_b = -21.8 mag). eachgalaxy has been imaged in two filters, closely resembling the sloan g and zpassbands, using the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope.  dust and complex morphological structures are common, with kiloparsec-scalestellar disks, bars, and nuclear stellar disks seen in 60% of galaxies withintermediate luminosity (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -17), and dust seen in 42% of galaxiesbrighter than m_b = -18.9 mag. dust morphologies range from faint wisps andpatches on tens of parsec scales, to regular, highly organized kpc-scale dustdisks, often showing evidence of recent star formation.  surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters are derived typicallywithin 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for thefaintest systems, with a resolution (fwhm) of 7 pc. based on a parametrizationof the surface brightness profiles in terms of a sersic or core-sersic model,we find that 1) there is no evidence of a bimodal behavior of the slope, gamma,of the profile in the innermost regions; 2) although the brightest galaxieshave shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles (lowest gamma values) arefound in faint dwarf systems; 3) the widely adopted separation of early-typegalaxies between "core" and "power-law" types, which had originally beenprompted by the claim of a clear bimodal distribution of gamma values, isuntenable; and 4) there is no evidence of a structural dichothomy between dwarfand regular ellipticals.

astro-ph;0603252	the acs virgo cluster survey. viii. the nuclei of early-type galaxies	(abridged) the acs virgo cluster survey is an hst program to obtainhigh-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the virgocluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. based on this large,homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency ofnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -15 (66 &lt; f_n &lt; 82%), andfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center ofvirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. resolved stellar nuclei are notpresent in galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -20.5, however, there is no clearevidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence ofnucleation, for a change at m_b ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point betweendwarf and giant galaxies. on average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than atypical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. nuclearluminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than m_b ~-17.6, nuclear colors. comparing the nuclei to the "nuclear clusters" found inlate-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosityand overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is ratherinsensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. the meannuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the meansbh-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detectedsupermassive black holes (sbhs). we argue that compact stellar nuclei might bethe low-mass counterparts of the sbhs detected in the bright galaxies, and thatone should think in terms of "central massive objects" -- either sbhs orcompact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-typegalaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.

astro-ph;0603840	a fundamental relation between compact stellar nuclei, supermassive  black holes, and their host galaxies	imaging surveys with the hubble space telescope (hst) have shown that roughly50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellarnucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. wecombine hst imaging for early-type galaxies from the acs virgo cluster surveywith ground-based long-slit spectra from kpno to show that the masses ofcompact stellar nuclei in virgo cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation withthe masses of the host galaxies. the same correlation is obeyed by thesupermassive black holes (sbhs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. thecompact stellar nuclei in the local group galaxies m33 and ngc205 are alsofound to fall along this same scaling relation. these results indicate that ageneric by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a central massiveobject (cmo) -- either a sbh or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains amean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. in galaxies with massesgreater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, sbhs appear to be the dominantmode of cmo formation.

astro-ph;0604082	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  early-type galaxies in the lynx supercluster at z~1.26	color-magnitude relations have been derived in the clusters rx j0849+4452 andrx j0848+4453 at z~1.26. the color-magnitude relation was determined fromadvanced camera for surveys imaging in the wfc f775w (i_775) and f850lp (z_850)filters combined with ground-based spectroscopy. early-type cluster candidateshave been identified according to the postman et al. morphologicalclassification. in both clusters the bright red early-type population defines atight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusterspresent different x-ray luminosities and shapes, with rx j0849+4452 being threetimes more x-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two timeshigher. the elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (cmr) in rx j0849+4452and rx j0848+4453 show an intrinsic (i_775-z_850) color scatter of 0.026 +/-0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (~1mpc atz=1.26) from the cluster x-ray emission centers. simple modeling of thescatters using stellar population models from bruzual and charlot, gives a meanluminosity-weighted age t &gt; 2.5 gyr (z_f &gt; 2.75). s0 galaxies follow theelliptical cmr; they show larger scatters about the cmr.  the intrinsic scatter decreases and the cmr slopes are steeper at smallerradii, within both clusters. we conclude that old stellar populations incluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the moreevolved cluster rx j0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion rx j0848+4453.even at a lookback time of 9 gyr, in the early merging and buildup of massiveclusters, the bulk of the stellar content of the bright elliptical galaxypopulation was in place - apparently formed some 2.5~gyr earlier at z~3

astro-ph;0609079	the acs virgo cluster survey. xiv. analysis of color-magnitude relations  in globular cluster systems	we examine the correlation between globular cluster (gc) color and magnitudeusing hst/acs imaging for a sample of 79 early-type galaxies (-21.7&lt;m_b&lt;-15.2mag) with accurate sbf distances from the acs virgo cluster survey. using thekmm mixture modeling algorithm, we find a highly significant correlation,d(g-z)/dz = -0.037 +- 0.004, between color and magnitude for the subpopulationof blue gcs in the co-added gc color-magnitude diagram of the three brightestvirgo galaxies (m49, m87 and m60): brighter gcs are redder than their faintercounterparts. for the single gc systems of m87 and m60, we find similarcorrelations; m49 does not appear to show a significant trend. there is nocorrelation between (g-z) and m_z for gcs of the red subpopulation. thecorrelation d(g-z)/dg for the blue subpopulation is much weaker than d(g-z)/dz.using monte carlo simulations, we attribute this to the fact that the bluesubpopulation in m_g extends to higher luminosities than the red subpopulation,which biases the kmm fits. the correlation between color and m_z thus is a realeffect. this conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same colordistributions. we identify two environmental dependencies of thecolor-magnitude relation: (1) the slope decreases in significance withdecreasing galaxy luminosity; and (2) the slope is stronger for gcs at smallergalactocentric distances. we examine several mechanisms that might give rise tothe observed color-magnitude relation: (1) presence of contaminators; (2)accretion of gcs from low-mass galaxies; (3) stochastic effects; (4) capture offield stars by individual gcs; and (5) gc self-enrichment. we conclude thatself-enrichment and field-star capture, or a combination of these processes,offer the most promising means of explaining our observations.

astro-ph;0609371	trends in the globular cluster luminosity function of early-type  galaxies	we present results from a study of the globular cluster luminosity function(gclf) in a sample of 89 early-type galaxies observed as part of the acs virgocluster survey. using a gaussian parametrization of the gclf, we find a highlysignificant correlation between the gclf dispersion, sigma, and the galaxyluminosity, m_b, in the sense that the gc systems in fainter galaxies havenarrower luminosity functions. the gclf dispersions in the milky way and m31are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation betweensigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions thatgclf shape is a function of galaxy hubble type. we show that the sigma - m_brelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)cluster masses in fainter galaxies. we further show that this behavior ismirrored by a steepening of the gc mass function for relatively high masses, m&gt;~ 3 x 10^5 m_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the gclf is not stronglyaffected by dynamical evolution over a hubble time. we argue that this trendarises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation bytheories of cluster formation. finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, thegclf "turns over" at the canonical mass scale of m_to ~ 2 x 10^5 m_sun.however, we find that m_to scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 m_sun) ingalaxies fainter than m_b &gt;~ -18.5, an important consideration if the gclf isto be used as a distance indicator for dwarf ellipticals.

astro-ph;0611237	the low-mass x-ray binary and globular cluster connection in virgo  cluster early-type galaxies: optical properties	(abridged) chandra and hubble acs observations of 11 early-type galaxiesprobe the low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb) - globular cluster (gc) connection. weexplore the optical properties of 270 gcs with lmxbs and 6,488 gcs withoutlmxbs. more massive, redder, and more compact gcs are more likely to containlmxbs. unlike galactic gcs, a large number of gcs with lmxbs have half-massrelaxation times &gt; 2.5 gyr. we fit the dependence of the expected number oflmxbs per gc, \lambda_t, on the gc mass m, color (g-z), and half-mass radiusr_{h,cor}, and find that \lambda_t \propto m^{1.24\pm0.08}10^{0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1} (g-z)} r_{h,cor}^{-2.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}}. our fit rules outthat the number of lmxbs per gc is linearly proportional to gc mass and thatmost gcs with high x-ray luminosities contain a single lmxb. the detaileddependence of \lambda_t on gc properties appears essentially equivalent to adependence on the encounter rate \gamma_h and the metallicity z, \lambda_t\propto \gamma_h^{0.82\pm0.05} z^{0.39\pm0.07}. our analysis provides strongevidence that dynamical formation and metallicity play the primary roles indetermining the presence of an lmxb in extragalactic gcs. the shallower thanlinear dependence for our sample requires an explanation by theories ofdynamical binary formation. the abundance dependence is consistent with ametallicity-dependent variation in the number o neutron stars and black holesper unit mass gc, effects from irradiation induced winds or suppression ofmagnetic braking in metal-poor stars.

astro-ph;0612139	the inner workings of early-type galaxies: cores, nuclei and  supermassive black holes (including a critical comparison of nuker and  core-sersic/sersic models)	recent years have seen dramatic progress in the study of the core and nuclearproperties of galaxies. the structure of the cores has been shown to varymethodically with global and nuclear properties, as cores respond to themechanisms by which galaxies form/evolve. the dynamical centers of galaxieshave been found capable of hosting two seemingly disparate objects:supermassive black holes (sbhs) and compact stellar nuclei. in a drasticdeparture from previous beliefs, it has been discovered that both structuresare common: galaxies lacking sbhs and/or stellar nuclei are the exception,rather than the norm. this review explores the connection between cores, sbhsand stellar nuclei in early-type galaxies, as revealed by the acs virgo clustersurvey. we find that, from parsec to kiloparsec scales, the surface brightnessprofiles of early-type galaxies are well described by a sersic model -- aparametrization that is shown to be preferable to the so called `nuker' model.relative to the inward extrapolation of the best fitting sersic model, theprofiles within the inner few tens of parsecs transition from luminosity`deficits', in the brightest (m_b &lt; ~-20) galaxies, to luminosity `excesses' inthe faintest. the compact stellar nuclei responsible for such luminosityexcesses comprise approximatively 0.2% of the total galactic mass. remarkably,this is the same fraction believed to reside in the sbhs, which arepredominantly found in the brightest galaxies showing luminosity deficits.

astro-ph;0702320	the acs fornax cluster survey. i. introduction to the survey and data  reduction procedures	the fornax cluster is a conspicuous cluster of galaxies in the southernhemisphere and the second largest collection of early-type galaxies within &lt;~20 mpc after the virgo cluster. in this paper,we present a brief introductionto the acs fornax cluster survey - a program to image, in the f475w (g_475) andf850lp (z_850) bandpasses, 43 early-type galaxies in fornax using the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope. combined with acompanion survey of virgo, the acs virgo cluster survey, this represents themost comprehensive imaging survey to date of early-type galaxies in clusterenvironments in terms of depth, spatial resolution, sample size andhomogeneity. we describe the selection of the program galaxies, their basicproperties, and the main science objectives of the survey which include themeasurement of luminosities, colors and structural parameters for globularclusters associated with these galaxies, an analysis of their isophotalproperties and surface brightness profiles, and an accurate calibration of thesurface brightness fluctuation distance indicator. finally, we discuss the datareduction procedures adopted for the survey.

astro-ph;0702496	the acs virgo cluster survey. xii. the luminosity function of globular  clusters in early type galaxies	we analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (gcs) belongingto the early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. we haveobtained estimates for a gaussian representation of the gc luminosity function(gclf) for 89 galaxies. we have also fit the gclfs with an "evolved schechterfunction", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-massgcs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initialschechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. we find asignificant trend of the gclf dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sensethat smaller galaxies have narrower gclfs. we show that this narrowing of thegclf in a gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the gc massfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. weargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the gc mass function is mostlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster massfunction. the gclf turnover mass m_to is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5m_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with m_b &gt;~ -18.we show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamicalfriction timescales in smaller galaxies. we probe the variation of the gclf toprojected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the virgo giants m49 and m87,finding that m_to is essentially constant over these spatial scales. our fitsof evolved schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (delta) overa hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 &lt;~ (delta/m_sun) &lt; 10^6 per gc.we agree with previous suggestions that if the full gclf is to be understood inmore detail gclf models will have to include self-consistent treatments ofdynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.

astro-ph;0702510	the acs virgo cluster survey. xiii. sbf distance catalog and the  three-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster	the acs virgo cluster survey consists of hst acs imaging for 100 early-typegalaxies in the virgo cluster, observed in the f475w and f850lp filters. wederive distances for 84 of these galaxies using the method of surfacebrightness fluctuations (sbfs), present the sbf distance catalog, and use thisdatabase to examine the three-dimensional distribution of early-type galaxiesin the virgo cluster. the sbf distance moduli have a mean (random) measurementerror of 0.07 mag (0.5 mpc), or roughly 3 times better than previous sbfmeasurements for virgo cluster galaxies. five galaxies lie at a distance of ~23mpc and are members of the w' cloud. the remaining 79 galaxies have a narrowdistribution around our adopted mean distance of 16.5+/-0.1 (random mean error)+/-1.1 mpc (systematic). the rms distance scatter of this sample is 0.6+/-0.1mpc, with little dependence on morphological type or luminosity class (i.e.,0.7+/-0.1 and 0.5+/-0.1 mpc for the giants and dwarfs, respectively). theback-to-front depth of the cluster measured from our sample of galaxies is2.4+/-0.4 mpc (i.e., +/-2sigma of the intrinsic distance distribution). the m87(cluster a) and m49 (cluster b) subclusters are found to lie at distances of16.7+/-0.2 and 16.4+/-0.2 mpc, respectively. there may be a third subclusterassociated with m86. a weak correlation between velocity and line-of-sightdistance may be a faint echo of the cluster velocity distribution not havingyet completely virialized. in three dimensions, virgo's early-type galaxiesappear to define a slightly triaxial distribution, with axis ratios of(1:0.7:0.5). the principal axis of the best-fit ellipsoid is inclined ~20-40deg. from the line of sight, while the galaxies belonging to the w' cloud lieon an axis inclined by ~10-15 deg.

0810.1917	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters at z ~1  from the acs intermediate redshift cluster survey	we apply detailed observations of the color-magnitude relation (cmr) with theacs/hst to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z~1. the early-type redsequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similarcmrs. we analyze cmr parameters as a function of redshift, galaxy propertiesand cluster mass. for bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -21mag), the cmr scatter of theelliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the s0population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes. while thebright s0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals,the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. if weinterpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxiesin cluster cores are on average older than s0 galaxies and peripheralelliptical galaxies (by about 0.5gyr). cmr zero point, slope, and scatter inthe (u-b)_z=0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~1.3nor significant dependence on cluster mass. two of our clusters display cmrzero points that are redder (by ~2sigma) than the average (u-b)_z=0 of oursample. we also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find that, while in the majority of theclusters most (80% to 90%) of the cmr population is composed of early-typegalaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster of our sample, the cmrlate-type/early-type fractions are similar (~50%), with most of the late-typepopulation composed of galaxies classified as s0/a. this trend is notcorrelated with the cluster's x-ray luminosity, nor with its velocitydispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift.
