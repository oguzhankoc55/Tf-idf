0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0901.2144	a spectacular giant arc in the massive cluster lens macsj1206.2-0847	we discuss the x-ray and optical properties of the massive galaxy clustermacsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.4385), discovered in the massive cluster survey (macs).our chandra observation of the system yields a total x-ray luminosity of 2.4 x10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 kev) and a global gas temperature of (11.6 +/- 0.7) kev,very high values typical of macs clusters. in both optical and x-ray imagesmacsj1206 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced x-ray peakat the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg); we interpret thisfeature as the remnant of a cold core. a spectacular giant gravitational arc,15" in length, bright (v~21) and unusually red (r-k=4.3), is seen 20" west ofthe bcg; we measure a redshift of z=1.036 for the lensed galaxy. from our hstimage of the cluster we identify the giant arc and its counter image as aseven-fold imaged system. an excess of x-ray emission in the direction of thearc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of aminor merger with a group of galaxies. we derive estimates of the total clustermass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using x-ray, dynamical, andgravitational-lensing techniques. for the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r&lt;119kpc) our strong-lensing analysis based on hst imaging yields a very high valueof 1.1 x 10^14 m_sun, inconsistent with the much lower x-ray estimate of 0.5 x10^14 m_sun. similarly, the virial estimate of 4 x 10^15 m_sun for the totalcluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy of 38 cluster members, issignificantly higher than the corresponding x-ray estimate of 1.7 x 10^15m_sun. we take the discrepant mass estimates to be indicative of substructurealong the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation thatis supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km/s.

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0906.1807	the zcosmos survey. the dependence of clustering on luminosity and  stellar mass at z=0.2-1	we study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar massat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zcosmos 10k sample.  we measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and itsprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass andredshift ranges. we quantify in detail the observational selection biases andwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles ofsemi-analytic mock catalogues. we finally compare our measurements to thecosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.  at odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxyclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. a mild dependence onstellar mass is instead observed. at z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power onlarge scales. we interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominatingthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular tothe line-of-sight. we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of theamplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.  the clustering measured in the zcosmos data at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 for galaxies withlog(m/m_\odot)&gt;=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mocksurveys. on scales larger than ~2 h^-1 mpc, the observed clustering amplitudeis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. thus, if the power spectrum of matteris lcdm with standard normalization and the bias has no unnaturalscale-dependence, this result indicates that cosmos has picked up aparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1mpc^3. these findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z~1 universeto appropriately characterize the level of structure at this epoch.

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0909.1968	k+a galaxies in the zcosmos survey: physical properties of systems in  their post-starburst phase	the identities of the main processes triggering and quenching star-formationin galaxies remain unclear. a key stage in evolution, however, appears to berepresented by post-starburst galaxies. to investigate their impact on galaxyevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectralfeatures in the cosmos field. we examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxiesat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zcosmos sample. k+a galaxies occupy thebrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. they are as massive as quiescentgalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (orstellar mass) distribution. a small percentage (&lt;8%) of these galaxies haveradio and/or x-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the sfr of~8msun/yr). over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxiesis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence ofbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. this distribution does not vary with thestrength of the hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a wayreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. although k+a galaxiesare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in asimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of~2-8mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratiosimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. with the current data set, we do notfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/massdensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the localvalues, or the spectral properties. those galaxies, which are affected by asudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellarmass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0910.5824	the optical spectra of spitzer 24 micron galaxies in the cosmos field:  ii. faint infrared sources in the zcosmos-bright 10k catalogue	we have used the zcosmos-bright 10k sample to identify 3244 spitzer/mips24-micron-selected galaxies with 0.06&lt; s(24um)&lt; 0.50 mjy and i(ab)&lt;22.5, over1.5 deg^2 of the cosmos field, and studied different spectral properties,depending on redshift. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3, we found that different reddening laws ofcommon use in the literature explain the dust extinction properties of around80% of our infrared (ir) sources, within the error bars. for up to 16% ofobjects, instead, the halpha/hbeta ratios are too high for their ir/uvattenuations, which is probably a consequence of inhomogenous dustdistributions. in only a few of our galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3 the ir emission couldbe mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. besides, theline ratios of ~22% of our galaxies suggest that they might bestar-formation/nuclear-activity composite systems. at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.7, we estimatedgalaxy metallicities for 301 galaxies: at least 12% of them are securely belowthe upper-branch mass-metallicity trend, which is consistent with the localrelation. finally, we performed a combined analysis of the hdeltaequivalent-width versus dn(4000) diagram for 1722 faint and bright 24umgalaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0, spanning two decades in mid-ir luminosity. we foundthat, while secondary bursts of star formation are necessary to explain theposition of the most luminous ir galaxies in that diagram, quiescent,exponentially-declining star formation histories can well reproduce thespectral properties of ~40% of the less luminous sources. our results suggest atransition in the possible modes of star formation at total ir luminositiesl(tir)=(3 +/-2)x10^11 lsun.

0911.2252	the zcosmos-bright survey: the clustering of early and late galaxy  morphological types since z~1	we measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of theirmorphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey withfull morphological information. this is obtained by combining high-resolutionhst imaging and vlt spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to i_ab=22.5 withaccurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos-bright redshift survey. atthis epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly strongerclustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. a comparison to thesdss at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early andlate morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at smallseparations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution sincez~0.8. this suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed inintermediate and dense environments at this epoch. our results are consistentwith a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphologicaltypes between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in themorphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-drivenevolution.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

0709.2046	eros found behind lensing clusters: ii.empirical properties,  classification, and sed modelling based on multi-wavelength observations	we study the properties and nature of extremely red galaxies (ero, r-k&gt;5.6)found behind two lensing clusters and compare them with other known galaxypopulations. new hst/acs observations, spitzer irac and mips, and chandra/acisobservations of the two lensing clusters abell 1835 and ac114 contemplate ourearlier optical and near-ir observations and have been used to study extremelyred objects (eros) in these deep fields. we have found 6 and 9 eros in abell1835 and ac114. several (7) of these objects are undetected up to the i and/orz band, and are hence ``optical'' drop-out sources. the photometric redshiftsof most of our sources (80%) are z~0.7-1.5. according to simple colour-colourdiagrams the majority of our objects would be classified as hosting old stellarpopulations. however, there are clear signs of dusty starbursts for severalamong them. these objects correspond to the most extreme ones in r-k colour. weestimate a surface density of (0.97+-0.31) arcmin-2 for eros with (r-k&gt;5.6) atk&lt;20.5. among our 15 eros 6 (40 %) also classify as distant red galaxies(drgs). 11 of 13 eros with available irac photometry also fulfil the selectioncriteria for irac selected eros (ieros) of yan et al. (2004). sed modellingshows that ~ 36 % of the ieros in our sample are luminous or ultra-luminousinfrared galaxies ((u)lirg). some very red drgs are found to be very dustystarbursts, even (u)lirgs, as also supported by their mid-ir photometry. noindication for agns is found, although faint activity cannot be excluded forall objects. from mid-ir and x-ray data 5 objects are clearly classified asstarbursts. the derived properties are quite similar to those of drgs andieros, except for 5 extreme objects in terms of colours, for which a very highextinction (av&gt;3) is found.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1106.0616	the radial and azimuthal profiles of mg ii absorption around 0.5 &lt; z &lt;  0.9 zcosmos galaxies of different colors, masses and environments	we map the radial and azimuthal distribution of mg ii gas within 200 kpc(physical) of 4000 galaxies at redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 using co-added spectraof more than 5000 background galaxies at z &gt; 1. we investigate the variation ofmg ii rest frame equivalent width as a function of the radial impact parameterfor different subsets of foreground galaxies selected in terms of theirrest-frame colors and masses. blue galaxies have a significantly higher averagemg ii equivalent width at close galactocentric radii as compared to the redgalaxies. amongst the blue galaxies, there is a correlation between mg iiequivalent width and galactic stellar mass of the host galaxy. we also findthat the distribution of mg ii absorption around group galaxies is moreextended than that for non-group galaxies, and that groups as a whole have moreextended radial profiles than individual galaxies. interestingly, these effectscan be satisfactorily modeled by a simple superposition of the absorptionprofiles of individual member galaxies, assuming that these are the same asthose of non-group galaxies, suggesting that the group environment may notsignificantly enhance or diminish the mg ii absorption of individual galaxies.we show that there is a strong azimuthal dependence of the mg ii absorptionwithin 50 kpc of inclined disk-dominated galaxies, indicating the presence of astrongly bipolar outflow aligned along the disk rotation axis. there is nosignificant dependence of mg ii absorption on the apparent inclination angle ofdisk-dominated galaxies.

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1110.0979	x-ray groups of galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 in zcosmos: increased agn activities  in high redshift groups	we present a photometric and spectroscopic study of galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 as afunction of environment based on data from the zcosmos survey. there is a fairamount of evidence that galaxy properties depend on mass of groups andclusters, in the sense that quiescent galaxies prefer more massive systems. webase our analysis on a mass-selected environment using x-ray groups of galaxiesand define the group membership using a large number of spectroscopic redshiftsfrom zcosmos. we show that the fraction of red galaxies is higher in groupsthan in the field at all redshifts probed in our study. interestingly, thefraction of [oii] emitters on the red sequence increases at higher redshifts ingroups, while the fraction does not strongly evolve in the field. this is dueto increased dusty star formation activities and/or increased activities ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) in high redshift groups. we study thesepossibilities using the 30-band photometry and x-ray data. we find that thestellar population of the red [oii] emitters in groups is old and there is noclear hint of dusty star formation activities in those galaxies. the observedincrease of red [oii] emitters in groups is likely due to increased agnactivities. however, our overall statistics is poor and any firm conclusionsneed to be drawn from a larger statistical sample of z~1 groups.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.1673	a journey from the outskirts to the cores of groups i: color- and  mass-segregation in 20k-zcosmos groups	using the group catalog obtained from zcosmos spectroscopic data and thecomplementary photometric data from the cosmos survey, we explore segregationeffects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. webuilt two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.45) and high (0.45 &lt;z &lt;= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxiesinto three samples according to their distance from the group center. weexplored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins ofstellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the groupcenter. we found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (log(m_gal/m_sun)&gt;= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions ofred/blue objects. for galaxies of lower masses (9.8 &lt;= log(m_gal/m_sun) &lt;=10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and bluegalaxies. this dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groupsdo not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. interestingly, masssegregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as afunction of radius. we suggest a simple scenario where color- andmass-segregation originate from different physical processes. while dynamicalfriction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, bothstarvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench starformation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. in poorer groups theenvironmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxyevolution. their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when movingfrom the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting therecent accretion history of these groups.

1201.3609	improved constraints on the expansion rate of the universe up to z~1.1  from the spectroscopic evolution of cosmic chronometers	we present new improved constraints on the hubble parameter h(z) in theredshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopicevolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. we extract a largesample of early-type galaxies (\sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys,spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.42). weselect the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving andwithout signature of ongoing star formation. those galaxies can be used asstandard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by jimenez &amp; loeb (2002),whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probesh(z). we analyze the 4000 {\aa} break (d4000) as a function of redshift, usestellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependenceof the differential age evolution on the differential d4000, and estimate thehubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors.we provide 8 new measurements of h(z) (see tab. 4), and determine its change inh(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z\sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on h(z) at z \neq 0 with aprecision comparable with the one achieved for the hubble constant (about 5-6%at z \sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) which is crucialto distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. these measurements havebeen tested to best match a \lambda cdm model, clearly providing astatistically robust indication that the universe is undergoing an acceleratedexpansion. this method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constraina variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g.euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \sim 2.

1205.1064	the cosmos density field: a reconstruction using both weak lensing and  galaxy distributions	the cosmos field has been the subject of a wide range of observations, with anumber of studies focusing on reconstructing the 3d dark matter density field.typically, these studies have focused on one given method or tracer. in thispaper, we reconstruct the distribution of mass in the cosmos field out to aredshift z=1 by combining hubble space telescope weak lensing measurements withzcosmos spectroscopic measurements of galaxy clustering. the distribution ofgalaxies traces the distribution of mass with high resolution (particularly inredshift, which is not possible with lensing), and the lensing data empiricallycalibrates the mass normalisation (bypassing the need for theoretical models).two steps are needed to convert a galaxy survey into a density field. the firststep is to create a smooth field from the galaxy positions, which is a pointfield. we investigate four possible methods for this: (i) gaussian smoothing,(ii) convolution with truncated isothermal sphere, (iii) fifth nearestneighbour smoothing and (iv) a muliti-scale entropy method. the second step isto rescale this density field using a bias prescription. we calculate theoptimal bias scaling for each method by comparing predictions from the smootheddensity field with the measured weak lensing data, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.in general, we find scale-independent bias for all the smoothing schemes, to aprecision of 10%. for the nearest neighbour smoothing case, we find the bias tobe 2.51\pm 0.25. we also find evidence for a strongly evolving bias, increasingby a factor of ~3.5 between redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;0.8. we believe this strong evolutioncan be explained by the fact that we use a flux limited sample to build thedensity field.

1205.6397	the all-sky geos rr lyr survey with the tarot telescopes. analysis of  the blazhko effect	we used the geos database to study the blazhko effect of galactic rrab stars.the database is continuously enriched by maxima supplied by amateur astronomersand by a dedicated survey by means of the two tarot robotic telescopes. thesame value of the blazhko period is observed at different values of thepulsation periods and different values of the blazhko periods are observed atthe same value of the pulsation period. there are clues suggesting that theblazhko effect is changing from one cycle to the next. the secular changes inthe pulsation and blazhko periods of z cvn are anticorrelated. the diagrams ofmagnitudes against phases of the maxima clearly show that the light curves ofblazhko variables can be explained as modulated signals, both in amplitude andin frequency. the closed curves describing the blazhko cycles in such diagramshave different shapes, reflecting the phase shifts between the epochs of thebrightest maximum and the maximum o-c. our sample shows that both clockwise andanticlockwise directions are possible for similar shapes. the improvedobservational knowledge of the blazhko effect, in addition to somepeculiarities of the light curves, have still to be explained by a satisfactoryphysical mechanism.

1207.0005	a group-galaxy cross-correlation function analysis in zcosmos	we present a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis using a group catalogproduced from the 16,500 spectra from the optical zcosmos galaxy survey. ouraim is to perform a consistency test in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8between the clustering strength of the groups and mass estimates that are basedon the richness of the groups. we measure the linear bias of the groups bymeans of a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis and convert it into massusing the bias-mass relation for a given cosmology, checking the systematicerrors using realistic group and galaxy mock catalogs. the measured bias forthe zcosmos groups increases with group richness as expected by the theory ofcosmic structure formation and yields masses that are reasonably consistentwith the masses estimated from the richness directly, considering the scatterthat is obtained from the 24 mock catalogs. an exception are the richest groupsat high redshift (estimated to be more massive than 10^13.5 m_sun), for whichthe measured bias is significantly larger than for any of the 24 mock catalogs(corresponding to a 3-sigma effect), which is attributed to the extremely largestructure that is present in the cosmos field at z ~ 0.7. our results are ingeneral agreement with previous studies that reported unusually strongclustering in the cosmos field.

1210.2723	proto-groups at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3 in the zcosmos-deep sample	we identify 42 candidate groups lying between 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.0 from a sample of 3502galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the zcosmos-deep redshift surveywithin the same redshift interval. these systems contain three to fivespectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (inphysical space) and within 700km/s in velocity. based on extensive analysis ofmock catalogues that have been generated from the millennium simulation, weexamine the likely nature of these systems at the time of observation, and whatthey will evolve into down to the present epoch. although few of the "member"galaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, andalmost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the samehalo by the present epoch. most of the candidate groups can therefore bedescribed as "proto-groups". an estimate of the overdensities is alsoconsistent with the idea that these systems are being seen at the start of theassembly process. we also examine present-day haloes and ask whether theirprogenitors would have been seen amongst our candidate groups. for present-dayhaloes between 10^14-10^15msun/h, 35% should have appeared amongst ourcandidate groups, and this would have risen to 70% if our survey had beenfully-sampled, so we can conclude that our sample can be taken asrepresentative of a large fraction of such systems. there is a clear excess ofmassive galaxies above 10^10msun around the locations of the candidate groupsin a large independent cosmos photo-z sample, but we see no evidence in thislatter data for any colour differentiation with respect to the field. this ishowever consistent with the idea that such differentiation arises in satellitegalaxies, as indicated at z&lt;1, if the candidate groups are indeed only startingto be assembled.

1304.2776	investigating the relationship between agn activity and stellar mass in  zcosmos galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1 using emission line diagnostic diagrams	we investigate the link between agn activity, star-formation and stellar massof the host galaxy at 0&lt;z&lt;1, looking for spectroscopic traces of agn and agingof the host. this work provides an extension of the existing studies at z&lt;0.1and contributes to shed light on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshifts. weused the zcosmos 20k data to create a sample of galaxies at z&lt;1. we divided thesample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with animproved s/n. we exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate agnfrom star-forming galaxies. we found indication of a role for the total galaxystellar mass in leading galaxy classification. stacked spectra show agnsignatures above the log m_*/m_sun&gt;10.2 threshold. moreover, the stellarpopulations of agn hosts are found to be older with respect to star-forming andcomposites galaxies. this could be due to the the tendency of agn to reside inmassive hosts. the dependence of the agn classification on the stellar mass isin agreement with what has been already found in previous studies. it isconsistent with, together with the evidence of older stellar populationsinhabiting the agn-like galaxies, the downsizing scenario. in particular, ourevidence points to an evolutionary scenario where the agn-feedback is capableof quenching the star formation in the most massive galaxies. therefore, theagn-feedback is the best candidate for initiating the passive evolutionaryphase of galaxies.

1307.4402	zcosmos 20k: satellite galaxies are the main drivers of environmental  effects in the galaxy population at least to z~0.7	we explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over0.1&lt;z&lt;0.7 using the final zcosmos-bright data set. using the red fraction ofgalaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction ofred galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity and with the stellarmass, consistent with previous works. as at lower redshift, the red fractionappears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of twoprocesses: mass and environmental quenching. the parameters describing theseappear to be essentially the same at z~0.7 as locally. we explore the relationbetween red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellitegalaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in thecentral-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samplesmatched in stellar mass. there is little evidence for a dependence of the redfraction of centrals on overdensity. satellites are consistently redder at alloverdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency increases withoverdensity at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.4. this is less marked at higher redshift, but both arenevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. at a givenstellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites also increases withthe overdensity. at a given overdensity and mass, the obtained relation betweenthe environmental quenching and the satellite fraction agrees well with thesatellite quenching efficiency, demonstrating that the environmental quenchingin the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced throughthe satellite quenching process at least up to z=0.7. however, despite theunprecedented size of our high redshift samples, the associated statisticaluncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood asapproximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.

1307.6553	the dependence of galactic outflows on the properties and orientation of  zcosmos galaxies at z ~ 1	we present an analysis of cool outflowing gas around galaxies, traced by mgiiabsorption lines in the co-added spectra of a sample of 486 zcosmos galaxies at1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. these galaxies span a range of stellar masses (9.45&lt;log[m*/msun]&lt;10.7) and star formation rates (0.14 &lt; log [sfr/msun/yr] &lt; 2.35).we identify the cool outflowing component in the mgii absorption and find thatthe equivalent width of the outflowing component increases with stellar mass.the outflow equivalent width also increases steadily with the increasing starformation rate of the galaxies. at similar stellar masses the blue galaxiesexhibit a significantly higher outflow equivalent width as compared to redgalaxies. the outflow equivalent width shows strong effect with star formationsurface density ({\sigma}sfr) of the sample. for the disk galaxies, the outflowequivalent width is higher for the face-on systems as compared to the edge-onones, indicating that for the disk galaxies, the outflowing gas is primarilybipolar in geometry. galaxies typically exhibit outflow velocities ranging from-200 km/s to -300 km/s and on average the face-on galaxies exhibit higheroutflow velocity as compared to the edge-on ones. galaxies with irregularmorphologies exhibit outflow equivalent width as well as outflow velocitiescomparable to face on disk galaxies. these galaxies exhibit minimum massoutflow rates &gt; 5-7 msun/yr and a mass loading factor ({\eta} = dmout/dt /sfr)comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies.

1403.3441	extreme emission-line galaxies out to z$\sim$1 in zcosmos. i. sample and  characterization of global properties	we present a thorough characterization of a large sample of 183 extremeemission-line galaxies (eelgs) at redshift 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.93 selected from the20k zcosmos bright survey because of their unusually large emission lineequivalent widths. we use multiwavelength cosmos photometry, hst-acs i-bandimaging and optical zcosmos spectroscopy to derive the main global propertiesof eelgs, such as sizes, masses, sfrs, reliable metallicities from both"direct" and "strong-line" methods. the eelgs are compact (r_50 ~ 1.3 kpc),low-mass (log(m*/msol)~7-10) galaxies forming stars at unusually high specificsfr (log(ssfr/yr) up to ~ -7) compared to main sequence sfgs of the samestellar mass and redshift. at uv wavelengths, the eelgs are luminous and showhigh surface brightness and include strong ly$\alpha$ emitters, as revealed bygalex spectroscopy. we show that zcosmos eelgs are high-ionization,low-metallicity systems, with median 12+log(o/h)=8.16, including a handful ofextremely metal-deficient galaxies (&lt;10% solar). while ~80% of the eelgs shownon-axisymmetric morphologies, including clumpy and tadpole galaxies, we findthat ~29% of them show additional low surface-brightness features, whichstrongly suggest recent or ongoing interactions. as star-forming dwarfs in thelocal universe, eelgs are most often found in relative isolation. while onlyvery few eelgs belong to compact groups, almost one third of them are found inspectroscopically confirmed loose pairs or triplets. we conclude that eelgs aregalaxies caught in a transient and probably early period of their evolution,where they are efficiently building-up a significant fraction of theirpresent-day stellar mass in an ongoing galaxy-wide starburst. therefore, theeelgs constitute an ideal benchmark for comparison studies between low- andhigh-redshift low-mass star-forming galaxies.

1408.0653	revisiting corot rr lyrae stars: detection of period doubling and  temporal variation of additional frequencies	we search for signs of period doubling in corot rr lyrae stars. theoccurrence of this dynamical effect in modulated rr lyrae stars might help usto gain more information about the mysterious blazhko effect. the temporalvariability of the additional frequencies in representatives of all subtypes ofrr lyrae stars is also investigated. we pre-process corot light curves byapplying trend and jump correction and outlier removal. standard fouriertechnique is used to analyze the frequency content of our targets and followthe time dependent phenomena. the most comprehensive collection of corot rrlyrae stars, including new discoveries is presented and analyzed. we foundalternating maxima and in some cases half-integer frequencies in four corotblazhko rr lyrae stars, as clear signs of the presence of period doubling. thisreinforces that period doubling is an important ingredient to understand theblazhko effect - a premise we derived previously from the kepler rr lyraesample. as expected, period doubling is detectable only for short timeintervals in most modulated rrab stars. our results show that the temporalvariability of the additional frequencies in all rr lyrae sub-types isubiquitous. the ephemeral nature and the highly variable amplitude of thesevariations suggest a complex underlying dynamics of and an intricate interplaybetween radial and possibly nonradial modes in rr lyrae stars. the omnipresenceof additional modes in all types of rr lyrae - except in non-modulated rrabstars - implies that asteroseismology of these objects should be feasible inthe near future (abridged).

astro-ph;0104477	vlt spectroscopy of galaxies lensed by abell ac114: implication for the  mass model and the study of low-luminosity galaxies at high-redshift	we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of faint lensedgalaxie s in the core of the galaxy cluster ac114 (z=0.312) obtained fromobservations w ith the fors1 spectrograph mounted on the vlt-antu. the galaxieswere chose n in areas close to the high-z critical lines predicted by thegravitational lens model of natarajan et al (nkse, 1998) for this cluster,according to both lensing and photometric redshift criteria. all the targetgalaxies are found to correspond to background galaxies with redshifts valuesin the [0.7, 3.5] interval. our spectroscopic observations confirm thepredicted lensing redshifts for 3 of the multiple-image galaxies, and togetherwith predictions of the nkse model led to the discovery of a new 5-imageconfiguration at redshift z=3.347. a revised nkse model, compatible with theredshift of this new multiple-image system, was generated and employed tocalculate the gravitational amplifications of all the observed galaxies. thegalaxies corresponding to the multiple-image systems are found to beintrinsically fainter, between 0.5 and 1.5 magnitudes, than the limitingmagnitudes of existing blank field studies. when all the observed backgroundgalaxies are considered, the resulting intrinsic absolute magnitudes range fromm_b~-22 to -19. therefore, a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosityhigh-z objects can actually be obtained, in agreement with theoreticalexpectations. this method can be used advantageously to probe the high redshiftuniverse and, in particular, its application to an ensemble of massive clustercores could constraint the faint end of luminosity function of high redshiftgalaxies.

astro-ph;0210547	physical properties of two low-luminosity z ~ 1.9 galaxies behind the  lensing cluster ac 114	we present vlt/isaac near-infrared spectroscopy of two gravitationally-lensedz ~ 1.9 galaxies, a2 and s2, located behind the cluster ac 114. thanks to largemagnification factors, we have been successful in detecting rest-frame opticalemission lines in star-forming galaxies 1 to 2 magnitudes fainter than inprevious studies of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3. from the haluminosity, we estimate star formation rates (sfrs) which are 7 to 15 timeshigher than those inferred from the uv continuum flux at 1500 ang without dustextinction correction. the behavior of s2 and a2 in terms of o/h and n/oabundance ratios are very different, and they are also different from typicallbgs at z ~ 3. s2 is a low-metallicity object (z ~ 0.03 zsun) with a low n/oratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-poor nearby hii galaxies. incontrast, a2 is a high-metallicity galaxy (z ~ 1.3 zsun) with a high n/oabundance ratio, similar to those derived in the most metal-rich starburstnucleus galaxies. the virial masses, derived from emission-line widths, are 0.5and 2.4 x 10^10 msun, for s2 and a2 respectively. thanks to the gravitationalamplification, the line profiles of s2 are spatially resolved, leading to avelocity gradient of +- 240 km/s, which yields a dynamical mass of ~ 1.3 x10^10 msun within the inner 1 kpc radius. combining these new data with thesample of lbgs at z ~ 3, we conclude that these three galaxies exhibitdifferent physical properties in terms of sfrs, abundance and mass-to-lightratios, and reddening. high-redshift galaxies of different luminosities couldthus have quite different star formation histories (abridged version).

astro-ph;9504038	dynamics of abell 2218 from optical and near-ir imagery of arc(let)s and  rosat/hri x-ray map	a mass model of the rich cluster a2218 is presented based on optical and newnear-infrared images of arc(let)s and the rosat/hri x-ray map. a lensing modelis proposed with two dark matter clumps, centered on the two bright galaxiesaround which the various arcs are observed. two of them, close to the mostmassive clump around the brightest galaxy, are required to be fold images,given their position angle with respect to the major axis. a third image foreach of the two arcs is then predicted to be on the opposite side of the majoraxis. both images are indeed found at the expected positions, with consistentmagnitudes, colors and shapes. one of the arcs has a known redshift of $0.7$,and the model predicts that the other arc should be at higher redshift, $z\approx 3$. photometric data in ubrzjk' indicates that a redshift close to 3 isindeed probable for this arc. the dark matter halo is found to be sharplypeaked on the giant central galaxy. the rosat/hri x-ray map shows a stronglyclumped image, poorly correlated with the cd light and the mass model on scalesbelow $\sim$ 200$h_{50}^{-1}$kpc, but similar to the distribution of galaxiesand the mass model when smoothed on this scale. the large degree of centralsubstructure implied helps to account for the discrepancy previously found (inthe two massive clusters a2218 \&amp; a1689) between the mass derived from thegravitational lenses and that derived from the x-ray profile and temperaturedistributions, in a model of hydrostatic equilibrium. most of the discrepancycan probably be explained by bulk motions and acceleration of the gas, andprojection effects enhancing the lensing power of the cluster.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
