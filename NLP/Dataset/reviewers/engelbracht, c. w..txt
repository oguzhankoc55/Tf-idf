0904.4244	spitzer observations of cold dust galaxies	we combine new spitzer space telescope observations in the mid- andfar-infrared with scuba 850 micron observations to improve the measurement ofdust temperatures, masses and luminosities for 11 galaxies of the scuba localuniverse galaxy survey (slugs). by fitting dust models we measure typical dustmasses of 10e7.9 m_sol and dust luminosities of ~ 10e10 l_sol, for galaxieswith modest star formation rates. the data presented in this paper combinedwith previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types ofspiral galaxies and is a major contributor to their total luminosity. becauseof the lower dust temperature of the scuba sources measured in this paper, theyhave flatter far-ir nu f_nu(160um)/nu f_nu(850um) slopes than the largerspitzer nearby galaxies survey (sings), the sample that provides the bestmeasurements of the dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe. the newdata presented here added to sings extend the parameter space that is wellcovered by local galaxies, providing a comprehensive set of templates that canbe used to interpret the observations of nearby and distant galaxies.

0907.2240	the structure of a low-metallicity giant molecular cloud complex	to understand the impact of low metallicities on giant molecular cloud (gmc)structure, we compare far infrared dust emission, co emission, and dynamics inthe star-forming complex n83 in the wing of the small magellanic cloud. dustemission (measured by spitzer as part of the s3mc and sage-smc surveys) probesthe total gas column independent of molecular line emission and tracesshielding from photodissociating radiation. we calibrate a method to estimatethe dust column using only the high-resolution spitzer data and verify thatdust traces the ism in the hi-dominated region around n83. this allows us toresolve the relative structures of h2, dust, and co within a giant molecularcloud complex, one of the first times such a measurement has been made in alow-metallicity galaxy. our results support the hypothesis that co isphotodissociated while h2 self-shields in the outer parts of low-metallicitygmcs, so that dust/self shielding is the primary factor determining thedistribution of co emission. four pieces of evidence support this view. first,the co-to-h2 conversion factor averaged over the whole cloud is very high 4-11\times 10^21 cm^-2/(k km/s), or 20-55 times the galactic value. second, theco-to-h2 conversion factor varies across the complex, with its lowest (mostnearly galactic) values near the co peaks. third, bright co emission is largelyconfined to regions of relatively high line-of-sight extinction, a_v &gt;~ 2 mag,in agreement with pdr models and galactic observations. fourth, a simple modelin which co emerges from a smaller sphere nested inside a larger cloud canroughly relate the h2 masses measured from co kinematics and dust.

0707.0395	warm molecular hydrogen in the spitzer sings galaxy sample	(simplified) results on the properties of warm h2 in 57 normal galaxies arederived from h2 rotational transitions, obtained as part of sings. this studyextends previous extragalactic surveys of h2, the most abundant constituent ofthe molecular ism, to more common systems (l_fir = e7 to 6e10 l_sun) of allmorphological and nuclear types. the s(1) transition is securely detected inthe nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5m_sun. the derived column densities of warm h2 (t &gt; ~100 k), even thoughaveraged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolvedpdrs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. they amount to between 1% and &gt;30%of the total h2. the power emitted in the sum of the s(0) to s(2) transitionsis on average 30% of the [siii] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infraredpower (tir) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistentwith excitation in pdrs. the fact that h2 emission scales tightly with pahemission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factorten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in pdrs,either dense or diffuse. a large fraction of the 25 liner/sy targets, however,strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer h2 in the excitedstates, and an excess of h2 emission with respect to pahs, tir and [siii]. wepropose a threshold in h2 to pah power ratios, allowing the identification oflow-luminosity agns by an excess h2 excitation. a dominant contribution fromshock heating is favored in these objects. finally, we detect, in nearly halfthe star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent withfuv pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,or possibly non-equilibrium pdr fronts advancing into cold gas.

0907.4722	the spitzer local volume legacy: survey description and infrared  photometry	the survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux propertiesare presented for the 258 galaxies in the local volume legacy (lvl). lvl is aspitzer space telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to11 mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, h-alpha, and hst imaging from11hugs (11 mpc h-alpha and ultraviolet galaxy survey) and angst (acs nearbygalaxy survey treasury). lvl covers an unbiased, representative, andstatistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting thehighest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with spitzer. as a resultof its approximately volume-limited nature, lvl augments previous spitzerobservations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of thelow-luminosity galaxy population. the collection of lvl galaxies shows a largespread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8umpah emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. conversely, thefar-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with adispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. in terms of the relationbetween infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the lvlsample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios thanstarburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important inthe lower mass systems that dominate the lvl sample. comparisons withtheoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relationfound for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populationsthat dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

0707.1303	variations in 24 micron morphologies among galaxies in the spitzer  infrared nearby galaxies survey: new insights into the hubble sequence	to study the distribution of star formation and dust emission within nearbygalaxies, we measured five morphological parameters in the 3.6 and 24 micronwave bands for 65 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) and 8 galaxies that were serendipitously observed by sings. themorphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the hubblesequence, including statistically significant differences between s0/a-sab andsc-sd galaxies. early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact,centralized, symmetric sources in the 24 micron band, while late-type galaxiesare generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. these results suggestthat the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulgesalso lead to more centralized 24 micron dust emission. several phenomena, suchas strong nuclear star formation, seyfert activity, or outer ring structures,may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at24 microns. we also note that the 24 micron morphologies of sdm-im galaxies arequite varied, with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric whileothers appear diffuse and asymmetric. these variations reflect the widevariation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at otherwavelengths. the variations in the 24 micron morphological parameters acrossthe hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in othertracers of the ism and in stellar emission. however, the 24 micronmorphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match themorphological parameters measured in the stellar wave bands. this implies thatthe distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to thedistribution of stellar emission.

0707.2103	absolute calibration and characterization of the multiband imaging  photometer for spitzer. iii. an asteroid-based calibration of mips at 160  microns	we describe the absolute calibration of the multiband imaging photometer forspitzer (mips) 160 micron channel. after the on-orbit discovery of a near-irghost image that dominates the signal for sources hotter than about 2000 k, weadopted a strategy utilizing asteroids to transfer the absolute calibrations ofthe mips 24 and 70 micron channels to the 160 micron channel. near-simultaneousobservations at all three wavelengths are taken, and photometry at the twoshorter wavelengths is fit using the standard thermal model. the 160 micronflux density is predicted from those fits and compared with the observed 160micron signal to derive the conversion from instrumental units to surfacebrightness. the calibration factor we derive is 41.7 mjy/sr/mips160 (mips160being the instrumental units). the scatter in the individual measurements ofthe calibration factor, as well as an assesment of the external uncertaintiesinherent in the calibration, lead us to adopt an uncertainty of 5.0mjy/sr/mips160 (12%) for the absolute uncertainty on the 160 micron fluxdensity of a particular source as determined from a single measurement. forsources brighter than about 2 jy, non-linearity in the response of the 160micron detectors produces an under-estimate of the flux density: for objects asbright as 4 jy, measured flux densities are likely to be ~20% too low. thiscalibration has been checked against that of iso (using ulirgs) and iras (usingiras-derived diameters), and is consistent with those at the 5% level.

0707.4167	gaps in the cloud cover? comparing extinction measures in spiral disks	dust in galaxies can be mapped by either the fir/sub-mm emission, the opticalor infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known backgroundsource. we compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of fifteensections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ismresponsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a knownbackground source. in our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurementsof 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objectsidentified though foreground disks in hst/wfpc2 images. for the 13 galaxiesthat overlap with the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), we nowcompare these results with those obtained from an i-l color map. our goal is todetermine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dustyism, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the diskextinction.  we find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sectionsmarked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on thecloud cover of {\it spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiralarms--and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. we note that our infraredcolor map (e[i-l]) underestimates the overall dust presence in these disksseverely, because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in frontof the stellar distribution.

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1004.1441	an aromatic inventory of the local volume	using infrared photometry from the spitzer space telescope, we perform thefirst inventory of aromatic feature emission (afe, but also commonly referredto as pah emission) for a statistically complete sample of star-forminggalaxies in the local volume. the photometric methodology involved iscalibrated and demonstrated to recover the aromatic fraction of the irac 8micron flux with a standard deviation of 6% for a training set of 40 singsgalaxies (ranging from stellar to dust dominated) with both suitablemid-infrared spitzer irs spectra and equivalent photometry. a potential factorof two improvement could be realized with suitable 5.5 and 10 micronphotometry, such as what may be provided in the future by jwst. the resultingtechnique is then applied to mid-infrared photometry for the 258 galaxies fromthe local volume legacy (lvl) survey, a large sample dominated in number bylow-luminosity dwarf galaxies for which obtaining comparable mid-infraredspectroscopy is not feasible. we find the total lvl luminosity due to fivestrong aromatic features in the 8 micron complex to be 2.47e10 solarluminosities with a mean volume density of 8.8e6 solar luminosities per cubicmegaparsec. twenty-four of the lvl galaxies, corresponding to a luminosity cutat m = -18.22 in the b band, account for 90% of the aromatic luminosity. usingoxygen abundances compiled from the literature for 129 of the 258 lvl galaxies,we find a correlation between metallicity and the aromatic to total infraredemission ratio but not the aromatic to total 8 micron dust emission ratio. apossible explanation is that metallicity plays a role in the abundance ofaromatic molecules relative to the total dust content, but other factors suchas star formation and/or the local radiation field affect the excitation ofthose molecules.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1301.6884	a detailed study of the radio--fir correlation in ngc6946 with  herschel-pacs/spire from kingfish	we derive the distribution of the synchrotron spectral index across ngc6946and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) andfar-infrared (fir) emission using the kingfish herschel pacs and spire data.the radio--fir correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surfacebrightness. the synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and theso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. the synchrotronspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), whileit is flat in places of giant h{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). the map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observationalevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in thedisk of the galaxy. variations in the synchrotron--fir correlation across thegalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.we find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather thanwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the mainheating source of dust. the synchrotron--fir correlation suggests a couplingbetween the magnetic field and the gas density. ngc6946 shows a power-lawbehavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength b and the starformation rate surface density $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ with an index of0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. this indicates an efficient production of the turbulentmagnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively starforming regions. the scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--fircorrelation indicates that the ism affects the propagation of old/diffusedcosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $d_0=4.6\times10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,gev cres.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1304.1541	star formation rates in resolved galaxies: calibrations with near and  far infrared data for ngc5055 and ngc6946	we use the near--infrared br\gamma hydrogen recombination line as a referencestar formation rate (sfr) indicator to test the validity and establish thecalibration of the {\it herschel} pacs 70 \mu m emission as a sfr tracer forsub--galactic regions in external galaxies. br\gamma offers the doubleadvantage of directly tracing ionizing photons and of being relativelyinsensitive to the effects of dust attenuation. for our first experiment, weuse archival cfht br\gamma and ks images of two nearby galaxies: ngc\,5055 andngc\,6946, which are also part of the {\it herschel} program kingfish (keyinsights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel). we use theextinction corrected br\gamma emission to derive the sfr(70) calibration forh{\sc ii} regions in these two galaxies. a comparison of the sfr(70)calibrations at different spatial scales, from 200 pc to the size of the wholegalaxy, reveals that about 50% of the total 70\mu m emission is due to dustheated by stellar populations that are unrelated to the current star formation.we use a simple model to qualitatively relate the increase of the sfr(70)calibration coefficient with decreasing region size to the star formationtimescale. we provide a calibration for an unbiased sfr indicator that combinesthe observed h\alpha with the 70 \mu m emission, also for use in h{\sc ii}regions. we briefly analyze the pacs 100 and 160 \mu m maps and find thatlonger wavelengths are not as good sfr indicators as 70\mu m, in agreement withprevious results. we find that the calibrations show about 50% differencebetween the two galaxies, possibly due to effects of inclination.

0801.1700	metallicity effects on dust properties in starbursting galaxies	we present infrared observations of 66 starburst galaxies over a wide rangeof oxygen abundances, to measure how metallicity affects their dust properties.the data include imaging and spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope,supplemented by groundbased near-infrared imaging. we confirm a strongcorrelation of aromatic emission with metallicity, with a threshold at ametallicity [12+log(o/h)]~8. the large scatter in both the metallicity andradiation hardness dependence of this behavior implies that it is not due to asingle effect, but to some combination. we show that the far-infrared colortemperature of the large dust grains increases towards lower metallicity,peaking at a metallicity of 8 before turning over. we compute dust masses andcompare them to hi masses from the literature to derive the gas to dust ratio,which increases by nearly 3 orders of magnitude between solar metallicity and ametallicity of 8, below which it flattens out. the abrupt change in aromaticemission at mid-infrared wavelengths thus appears to be reflected in thefar-infrared properties, indicating that metallicity changes affect thecomposition of the full range of dust grain sizes that dominate the infraredemission. in addition, we find that the ratio l(8 micron)/l(tir), important forcalibrating 24 micron measurements of high redshift galaxies, increasesslightly as the metallicity decreases from ~solar to ~50% of solar, and thendecreases by an order of magnitude with further decreases in metallicity.although the great majority of galaxies show similar patterns of behavior asdescribed above, there are three exceptions, sbs 0335-052e, haro 11, and shoc391. their infrared seds are dominated energetically by the mid-ir near 24micron rather than by the 60 - 200 micron region.

0806.2758	the relations among 8, 24, and 160 micron dust emission within nearby  spiral galaxies	we investigate the relations among the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 micronpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah 8 micron) emission, 24 micron hot dustemission, and 160 micron cold dust emission in fifteen nearby face-on spiralgalaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey sample. the relationbetween pah 8 and 24 micron emission measured in ~2 kpc regions is found toexhibit a significant amount of scatter, and strong spatial variations areobserved in the (pah 8 micron)/24 micron surface brightness ratio. inparticular, the (pah 8 micron)/24 micron surface brightness ratio is observedto be high in the diffuse interstellar medium and low in bright star-formingregions and other locations with high 24 micron surface brightness. pah 8micron emission is found to be well-correlated with 160 micron emission onspatial scales of ~2 kpc, and the (pah 8 micron)/160 micron surface brightnessratio is generally observed to increase as the 160 micron surface brightnessincreases. these results suggest that the pahs are associated with the diffuse,cold dust that produces most of the 160 micron emission in these galaxies, andthe variations in the (pah 8 micron)/160 micron ratio may generally beindicative of either the intensity or the spectrum of the interstellarradiation field that is heating both the pahs and the diffuse interstellardust.

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0008317	ngc1614: a laboratory for starburst evolution	the modest extinction and reasonably face-on viewing geometry make theluminous ir galaxy ngc1614 an ideal laboratory for study of a powerfulstarburst. hst/nicmos observations show: 1.) deep co stellar absorption,tracing a starburst nucleus about 45 pc in diameter; 2.) surrounded by a ~600pc diameter ring of supergiant hii regions revealed in pa$\alpha$ lineemission; 3.) lying within a molecular ring indicated by its extinction shadowin h-k; 4.) all at the center of a disturbed spiral galaxy. the luminosities ofthe giant hii regions in the ring are extremely high, an order of magnitudebrighter than 30 doradus. the relation of deep stellar co bands to surroundingionized gas ring to molecular gas indicates that the luminous starburst startedin the nucleus and is propagating outward into the surrounding molecular ring.this hypothesis is supported by evolutionary starburst modeling that shows thatthe properties of ngc1614 can be fitted with two short-lived bursts of starformation separated by 5 myr. the total dynamical mass of the starburst regionof 1.3x10^9 msol is mostly accounted for by the old pre-star burst stellarpopulation. although our starburst models use a modified salpeter imf, thetight mass budget suggests that the imf may contain relatively more 10-30 msolstars and fewer low mass stars than the salpeter function. the dynamical massis nearly 4 times smaller than the mass of molecular gas estimated from thestandard ratio of 12co(1-0) to h2. a number of arguments place the mass of gasin the starburst region at ~25% of the dynamical mass, nominally about 1/15 andwith an upper limit of 1/10 of the amount estimated from 12co and the standardratio.

astro-ph;0406035	the 24 micron source counts in deep spitzer surveys	galaxy source counts in the infrared provide strong constraints on theevolution of the bolometric energy output from distant galaxy populations. wepresent the results from deep 24 micron imaging from spitzer surveys, whichinclude approximately 50,000 sources to an 80% completeness of 60 ujy. the 24micron counts rapidly rise at near-euclidean rates down to 5 mjy, increase witha super-euclidean rate between 0.4 - 4 mjy, and converge below 0.3 mjy. the 24micron counts exceed expectations from non-evolving models by a factor &gt;10 at0.1 mjy. the peak in the differential number counts corresponds to a populationof faint sources that is not expected from predictions based on 15 microncounts from iso. we argue that this implies the existence of a previouslyundetected population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z ~ 1-3. integrating thecounts to 60 ujy, we derive a lower limit on the 24 micron background intensityof 1.9 +/- 0.6 nw m-2 sr-1 of which the majority (~ 60%) stems from sourcesfainter than 0.4 mjy. extrapolating to fainter flux densities, sources below 60ujy contribute 0.8 {+0.9/-0.4} nw m-2 sr-1 to the background, which provides anestimate of the total 24 micron background of 2.7 {+1.1/-0.7} nw m-2 sr-1.

astro-ph;0503198	an extremely large excess of 18o in the hydrogen-deficient carbon star,  hd 137613	we report the discovery of a uniquely large excess of 18o in thehydrogen-deficient carbon (hdc) star, hd 137613, based on a spectrum of thefirst overtone bands of co at 2.3-2.4 micron in which three strong absorptionbands of 12c18o are clearly present. bands of 12c16o also are present but nobands of 13c16o or 12c17o are seen. we estimate an isotopic ratio 16o/18o ~1.the solar value of this ratio is ~500. neither he-core burning nor he-shellflash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed inhd 137613. however, a remarkable similarity exists between the observedabundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad he-shell ofearly-agb stars, soon after the end of he-core burning. it is not known how theouter envelope down to the he-shell could be lost but some mechanism ofenhanced mass loss must be involved. hd 137613 may be a post-early-agb starwith the outer layers of the former he-burning shell as its photosphere.  the unusual elemental abundances of the hdc stars resemble those of the rcoronae borealis (rcb) stars, but hdc stars do not produce clouds of dust thatproduce declines in brightness. none of the other rcb or hdc stars observedshows significant 18o.

astro-ph;0503497	detection of near-ir co absorption bands in r coronae borealis stars	r coronae borealis (rcb) stars are hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich pulsatingpost-agb stars that experience massive irregular declines in brightness causedby circumstellar dust formation. the mechanism of dust formation around rcbstars is not well understood. it has been proposed that co molecules play animportant role in cooling the circumstellar gas so that dust may form. wereport on a survey for co in a sample of rcb stars. we obtained h- and k-bandspectra including the first and second overtone co bands for eight rcb stars,the rcb-like star, dy per and the final-helium-flash star, fg sge. the firstand second overtone co bands were detected in the cooler (t(eff)&lt;6000 k) rcbstars, z umi, es aql, sv sge and dy per. the bands are not present in thewarmer (t(eff)&gt;6000 k) rcb stars, r crb, ry sgr, su tau, xx cam. in addition,first overtone bands are seen in fg sge, a final-helium-flash star that is inan rcb-like phase at present. effective temperatures of the eight rcb starsrange from 4000 to 7250 k. the observed photospheric co absorption bands werecompared to line-blanketed model spectra of rcb stars. as predicted by themodels, the co bands are strongest in the coolest rcb stars and not present inthe warmest. no correlation was found between the presence or strength of theco bands and dust formation activity in the stars.

astro-ph;0506214	metallicity effects on mid-infrared colors and the 8 micron pah emission  in galaxies	we examine colors from 3.6 micron to 24 micron as a function of metallicity(o/h) for a sample of 34 galaxies. the galaxies range over 2 orders ofmagnitude in metallicity. they display an abrupt shift in the 8 micron to 24micron color between metallicities 1/3 to 1/5 of the solar value. the mean 8micron to 24 micron flux density ratio below and above 12 + log (o/h) = 8.2 is0.08 +/- 0.04 and 0.70 +/- 0.53, respectively. we use mid-infrared colors andspectroscopy to demonstrate that the shift is primarily due to a decrease inthe 8 micron flux density as opposed to an increase in the 24 micron fluxdensity. this result is most simply interpreted as due to a weakening at lowmetallicity of the mid-infrared emission bands usually attributed to pahs(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) relative to the small-grain dust emission.however, existing empirical spectral energy distribution models cannot accountfor the observed short-wavelength (i.e., below 8 micron) colors of thelow-metallicity galaxies merely by reducing the strength of the pah features;some other emission source (e.g., hot dust) is required.

astro-ph;0507645	infrared spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) is carrying out acomprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. the1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imagingdata from spitzer, 2mass, iso, iras, and scuba. the infrared colors derivedfrom the globally-integrated spitzer data are generally consistent with theprevious generation of models that were developed based on global data fornormal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailedinvestigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for variouslocations within the three large, nearby galaxies ngc3031 (m81), ngc5194 (m51),and ngc7331. strong correlations exist between the local star formation rateand the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local starformation activity level. preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colorswithin ngc3031, ngc5194, and ngc7331. if the galaxy-to-galaxy variations inspectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of therange present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infraredluminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will beuncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). the correspondinguncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for az=2 source) are factors of 10-20. considerable caution should be used wheninterpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.

astro-ph;0510227	an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlation within nearby  star-forming galaxies using the spitzer space telescope	(abridged) we present an initial look at the far infrared-radio correlationwithin the star-forming disks of four nearby, nearly face-on galaxies (ngc2403, ngc 3031, ngc 5194, and ngc 6946). using spitzer mips imaging and wsrtradio continuum data, observed as part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxiessurvey (sings), we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic 24mu/22cm(q_24) and 70mu/22cm (q_70) surface brightness ratios across each disk atsub-kpc scales. we find general trends of decreasing q_24 and q_70 withdeclining surface brightness and with increasing radius. the residualdispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versus surface brightness issmaller than the residual dispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versusradius, on average by ~0.1 dex, indicating that the distribution of starformation sites is more important in determining the infrared/radio diskappearance than the exponential profiles of disks. we have also performedpreliminary phenomenological modeling of cosmic ray electron (cre^-) diffusionusing an image-smearing technique, and find that smoothing the infrared mapsimproves their correlation with the radio maps. exponential kernels tend towork better than gaussian kernels which suggests that additional processesbesides simple random-walk diffusion in three dimensions must affect theevolution of cre^-s. the best fit smoothing kernels for the two less activestar-forming galaxies (ngc 2403 and ngc 3031) have much larger scale-lengthsthan those of the more active star-forming galaxies (ngc 5194 and ngc 6946).this difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent cre^- injectioninto the interstellar medium (ism) for the galaxies having largely quiescentdisks.

astro-ph;0604007	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of nuclear and extra-nuclear regions  in nearby galaxies	mid-infrared diagnostics are presented for a large portion of the spitzerinfrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample plus archival data from theinfrared space observatory and the spitzer space telescope. our main result isthat these mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominantpower source. the combination of a high ionization line index and pah strengthserves as an efficient discriminant between agn and star-forming nuclei,confirming progress made with iso spectroscopy on starbursting andultraluminous infrared galaxies. the sensitivity of spitzer allows us to probefainter nuclei and star-forming regions within galaxy disks. we find that bothstar-forming nuclei and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that arepowered by seyfert or liner activity. in fact, we identify areas within fourdiagnostic diagrams containing &gt;90% seyfert/liner nuclei or &gt;90% hiiregions/hii nuclei. we also find that, compared to starbursting nuclei,extranuclear regions typically separate even further from agn, especially forlow-metallicity extranuclear environments. in addition, instead of thetraditional mid-infrared approach to differentiating between agn andstar-forming sources that utilizes relatively weak high-ionization lines, weshow that strong low-ionization cooling lines of x-ray dominated regions like[siii] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.finally, the typical target in this sample shows relatively modest interstellarelectron density (~400 cm^{-3}) and obscuration (a_v ~ 1.0 mag for a foregroundscreen), consistent with a lack of dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dustresiding in the emitting regions.

astro-ph;0604267	the opaque nascent starburst in ngc 1377: spitzer sings observations	we analyze extensive data on ngc1377 from the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). within the category of nascent starbursts, that wepreviously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excessof the average and their hot dust, ngc1377 has the largest infrared excess yetmeasured. optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of arecent accretion event. infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaquesource dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micronsilicate band). we provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity beingthe heating source. hii regions are detected through the single [neii] line,probing &lt;1% of the ionizing radiation. not only is the optical depth very high,but &gt;85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. the only other detectedemission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly byshocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. the newobservations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely youngstarburst (&lt;1 myr). more generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron arelikely observed within a few myr of the onset of a starburst and after a longquiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ism with cosmic rays. the similarinfrared-radio properties of ngc1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxiessuggest that ngc1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburstevolution. although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionarystage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction ofmerger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. since they differdramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequencesfor the interpretation of deep surveys.

astro-ph;0609724	the effect of star formation on the far-infrared--radio correlation  within galaxies	using data obtained for twelve galaxies as part of the {\it spitzer} infrarednearby galaxies survey (sings) and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt)-sings radio continuum survey, we study how star formation activityaffects the far-infrared (fir)--radio correlation {\it within} galaxies bytesting a phenomenological model, which describes the radio image as a smearedversion of the fir image. the physical basis of this description is thatcosmic-ray (cr) electrons will diffuse measurably farther than the mean freepath of dust-heating photons before decaying by synchrotron radiation. thisdescription works well in general. galaxies with higher infrared surfacebrightnesses have best-fit smoothing scale-lengths of a few hundred parsecs,substantially shorter than those for lower surface brightness galaxies. weinterpret this result to suggest that galaxies with higher disk averaged starformation rates have had a recent episode of enhanced star formation and arecharacterized by a higher fraction of young cr electrons that have traveledonly a few hundred parsecs from their acceleration sites in supernova remnantscompared to galaxies with lower star formation activity.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.
