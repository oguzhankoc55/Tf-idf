0901.4364	spectroscopic observations of lyman-break galaxies at redshift ~ 4, 5  and 6 in the goods-south field	we report on observations of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey at mean redshift z~4, 5 and 6, obtainedwith fors2 spectrograph at the eso-vlt.this program has yielded spectroscopicidentifications for 114 galaxies of which 51 are at z~4, 31 at z~5, and 32 atz~6. the adopted selection criteria are effective, identifying galaxies at theexpected redshift with minimal foreground contamination. once selection effectsare properly accounted for, the rest-frame uv spectra of the higher-redshiftlbgs appear to be similar to their counterparts at z~3. as at z~3, lbgs at z~4and z~5 show lya both in emission and in absorption; when in absorption, stronginterstellar lines and red uv spectra are observed, a fact also measured at z~2and 3. at z~6, sensitivity issues bias our sample towards galaxies with lya inemission; nevertheless, these spectra appear to be similar to theirlower-redshift counterparts. as in other studies at similar redshifts, we findclear evidence that brighter lbgs tend to have weaker lya emission lines. atfixed rest-frame uv luminosity, the equivalent width of the lya emission lineis larger at higher redshifts. at all redshifts where the measurements can bereliably made, the redshift of the lya emission line turns out to be largerthan that of the interstellar absorption lines,with a median velocitydifference deltav~400 km/s at z~4 and 5, consistent with results at lowerredshifts. this shows that powerful, large-scale winds are common at highredshift.in general,there is no strong correlation between the morphology ofthe uv light and the spectroscopic properties. however, galaxies with deepinterstellar absorption lines and strong lya absorption appear to be morediffuse than galaxies with lya in emission.(abridged)

1001.1115	the great observatories origins deep survey - vlt/vimos spectroscopy in  the goods-south field: part ii	we present the full data set of the vimos spectroscopic campaign of theeso/goods program in the cdfs, which complements the fors2 eso/goodsspectroscopic campaign. the goods/vimos spectroscopic campaign is structured intwo separate surveys using two different vimos grisms. the vimos low resolutionblue (lr-blue) and medium resolution (mr) orange grisms have been used to coverdifferent redshift ranges. the lr-blue campaign is aimed at observing galaxiesmainly at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.5, while the mr campaign mainly aims at galaxies at z&lt;1 andlyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z&gt;3.5. the full goods/vimos spectroscopiccampaign consists of 20 vimos masks. this release adds 8 new masks to theprevious release (12 masks, popesso et al. 2009). in total we obtained 5052spectra, 3634 from the 10 lr-blue masks and 1418 from the 10 mr masks. asignificant fraction of the extracted spectra comes from serendipitouslyobserved sources: ~21% in the lr-blue and ~16% in the mr masks. we obtained2242 redshifts in the lr-blue campaign and 976 in the mr campaign for a totalsuccess rate of 62% and 69% respectively, which increases to 66% and 73% ifonly primary targets are considered. the typical redshift uncertainty isestimated to be ~0.0012 (~255 km/s) for the lr-blue grism and ~0.00040 (~120km/s) for the mr grism. by complementing our vimos spectroscopic catalog withall existing spectroscopic redshifts publicly available in the cdfs, wecompiled a redshift master catalog with 7332 entries, which we used toinvestigate large scale structures out to z~3.7. we produced stacked spectra oflbgs in a few bins of equivalent width (ew) of the ly-alpha and found evidencefor a lack of bright lbgs with high ew of the ly-alpha. finally, we obtainednew redshifts for 12 x-ray sources of the cdfs and extended-cdfs.

1002.0071	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: two modes of  star formation in agn hosts?	we study the co-existence of star formation and agn activity in x-rayselected agn by analyzing stacked 870um submm emission from a deep and wide mapof the extended chandra deep field south, obtained with laboca at the apextelescope. the total x-ray sample of 895 sources with median redshift z~1 isdetected at a mean submm flux of 0.49+-0.04mjy, corresponding to a typical starformation rate around 30msun/yr for a t=35k, beta=1.5 greybody far-infraredsed. the good s/n permits stacking analyses for subgroups. we observe a trendof star formation rate increasing with redshift. an increase of star formationrate with agn luminosity is indicated at the highest l_2-10&gt;~1e44erg/sluminosities only. increasing trends with x-ray obscuration as expected in someagn evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the x-ray agnsample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects. thissuggests a transition between two modes in the coexistence of agn activity andstar formation. for the bulk of the sample, the x-ray luminosity andobscuration of the agn are not intimately linked to the global star formationrate of their hosts. the hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly,at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxieswithout an agn at similar redshifts. the change indicated towards more intensestar formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates betweenunobscured and obscured agn at highest luminosities suggests that luminous agnfollow an evolutionary path on which obscured agn activity and intense starformation are linked, possibly via merging. comparison to local hard x-rayselected agn supports this interpretation.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1104.1094	the effect of environment on star forming galaxies at redshift 1 - first  insight from pacs	we use deep 70, 100 and 160 um observations taken with pacs, thephotodetector array camera and spectrometer on board of herschel, as part ofthe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed time, to study the relationbetween star formation rate and environment at redshift ~ 1 in the goods-s andgoods-n fields. we use the sdss spectroscopic catalog to build the local analogand study the evolution of the star formation activity dependence on theenvironment. at z ~ 1 we observe a reversal of the relation between starformation rate and local density, confirming the results based on spitzer 24 umdata. however, due to the high accuracy provided by pacs in measuring the starformation rate also for agn hosts, we identify in this class of objects thecause for the reversal of the density-sfr relation. indeed, agn hosts favorhigh stellar masses, dense regions and high star formation rates. without theagn contribution the relation flattens consistently with respect to the localanalog in the same range of star formation rates. as in the local universe, thespecific star formation rate anti-correlates with the density. this is due tomass segregation both at high and low redshift. the contribution of agn hostsdoes not affect this anti-correlation, since agn hosts exhibit the samespecific star formation rate as star forming galaxies at the same mass. thesame global trends and agn contribution is observed once the relations arestudied per morphological type. we study the specific star formation rate vsstellar mass relation in three density regimes. our data provides an indicationthat at m/m_{\odot} &gt; 10^{11} the mean specific star formation rate tends to behigher at higher density, while the opposite trend is observed in the localsdss star forming sample.

0709.3455	the evolution of agn host galaxies: from blue to red and the influence  of large-scale structures	we present an analysis of 109 moderate-luminosity (41.9 &lt; log l{0.5-8.0 kev}&lt; 43.7) agn in the extended chandra deep field-south survey, which is drawnfrom 5,549 galaxies from the combo-17 and gems surveys having 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.1.these obscured or optically-weak agn facilitate the study of their hostgalaxies since the agn provide an insubstantial amount of contamination to thegalaxy light. we find that the color distribution of agn host galaxies ishighly dependent upon (1) the strong color-evolution of luminous (m_v &lt; -20.7)galaxies, and (2) the influence of ~10 mpc scale structures. when excludinggalaxies within the redshift range 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 0.76, a regime dominated bysources in large-scale structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73, we observe a bimodalityin the host galaxy colors. galaxies hosting agn at z &gt; 0.8 preferentially havebluer (rest-frame u-v &lt; 0.7) colors than their z &lt;~ 0.6 counterparts (many ofwhich fall along the red sequence). the fraction of galaxies hosting agn peaksin the ``green valley'' (0.5 &lt; u-v &lt; 1.0); this is primarily due to enhancedagn activity in the redshift interval 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 0.76. the agn fraction in thisredshift and color interval is 12.8% (compared to its `field' value of 7.8%)and reaches a maximum of 14.8% at u-v~0.8. we further find that blue,bulge-dominated (sersic index n&gt;2.5) galaxies have the highest fraction of agn(21%) in our sample. we explore the scenario that the evolution of agn hosts isdriven by galaxy mergers and illustrate that an accurate assessment requires alarger area survey since only three hosts may be undergoing a merger withtimescales &lt;1 gyr following a starburst phase.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

1106.4284	goods-herschel: the far-infrared view of star formation in agn host  galaxies since z~3	we present a study of the infrared properties of x-ray selected, moderateluminosity (lx=10^{42}-10^{44}ergs/s) active galactic nuclei (agns) up to z~3,to explore the links between star formation in galaxies and accretion ontotheir central black holes. we use 100um and 160um fluxes from goods-herschel-the deepest survey yet undertaken by the herschel telescope- and show that in&gt;94 per cent of cases these fluxes are dominated by the host. we find noevidence of any correlation between the x-ray and infrared luminosities ofmoderate agns at any redshift, suggesting that star-formation is decoupled fromnuclear (agn) activity. the star formation rates of agn hosts increase stronglywith redshift; by a factor of 43 from z&lt;0.1 to z=2-3 for agns with the samex-ray luminosities. this increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50increase in the specific star formation rates (ssfrs) of normal, star-forming(main-sequence) galaxies. indeed, the average ssfrs of agn hosts are onlymarginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with thissmall deficit being due to a fraction of agns residing in quiescent (low-ssfr)galaxies. we estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate agns are hosted inmain-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and &lt;10 per centin strongly starbursting galaxies. the fractions of all main sequence galaxiesat z&lt;2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependenton galaxy stellar mass (mstars); rising from a few per cent atmstars~10^{10}msun to &gt;20 per cent at mstars&gt;10^{11}msun. our results indicatethat it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether agalaxy hosts a moderate luminosity agn. we argue that the majority of moderatenuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers,suggesting that disk instabilities could be an important agn feeding mechanism.

1107.1049	goods-herschel: evidence for a uv extinction bump in galaxies at z &gt; 1	dust attenuation curves in external galaxies are useful to study their dustproperties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energydistributions. in particular the presence or absence of a uv bump at 2175 aremains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broadband colours of distant galaxies. we study the dust attenuation curve in the uvrange at z &gt;1. in particular we search for the presence of a uv bump. we usedeep photometric data of the cdfs obtained with intermediate and broad bandfilters by the musyc project to sample the uv rest-frame of galaxies with 1&lt;z&lt;2. herschel/pacs and spitzer/mips data are used to measure the dust emission.30 galaxies were selected with high s/n in all bands. their seds from the uv tothe far-ir are fitted using the cigale code and the characteristics of the dustattenuation curve are obtained. the mean dust attenuation curve we deriveexhibits a uv bump at 2175a whose amplitude corresponds to 35 % (76%) that ofthe mw (lmc2 supershell) extinction curve. an analytical expression of theaverage attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than thecalzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. our galaxy sample is used tostudy the derivation of the slopes of the uv continuum from broad band colours,including the galex fuv-nuv colour. systematic errors induced by the presenceof the bump are quantified. we compare dust attenuation factors measured withcigale to the slope of the uv continuum and find that there is a large scatteraround the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). the uncertainties onthe determination of the uv slope lead to an extra systematic error of theorder of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the uv bump.

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1108.0838	goods-herschel a population of 24micron dropout sources at z &lt; 2	using extremely deep pacs 100- and 160um herschel data from thegoods-herschel program, we identify 21 infrared bright galaxies previouslymissed in the deepest 24um surveys performed by mips. these mips dropouts arepredominantly found in two redshift bins, centred at z ~0.4 and ~1.3. theirs_100/s_24 flux density ratios are similar to those of local lirgs and ulirgs,whose silicate absorption features at 18um (at z ~ 0.4) and 9.7um (at z ~ 1.3)are shifted into the 24um mips band at these redshifts. the high-z sub-sampleconsists of 11 infrared luminous sources, accounting for ~2% of the wholegoods-herschel sample and putting strong upper limits on the fraction oflirgs/ulirgs at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7 that are missed by the 24um surveys. we find that as_100/s_24 &gt; 43 colour cut selects galaxies with a redshift distributionsimilar to that of the mips dropouts and when combined with a second colourcut, s_16/s_8 &gt; 4, isolates sources at 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.7. we show that thesesources have elevated specific star formation rates (ssfr) compared to mainsequence galaxies at these redshifts and are likely to be compact starburstswith moderate/strong 9.7um silicate absorption features in their mid-irspectra. herschel data reveal that their infrared luminosities extrapolatedfrom the 24um flux density are underestimated, on average, by a factor of ~3.these silicate break galaxies account for 16% (8%) of the ulirg (lirg)population in the goods fields, indicating a lower limit in their space densityof 2.0 \times 10^(-5) mpc^(-3). finally, we provide estimates of the fractionof z &lt; 2 mips dropout sources as a function of the 24-, 100-, 160-, 250- and350um sensitivity limits, and conclude that previous predictions of apopulation of silicate break galaxies missed by the major 24um extragalacticsurveys have been overestimated.

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1109.1937	goods-herschel: the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the  far-infrared properties of galaxies	we study the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the fir properties ofgalaxies and its evolution at 0&lt;z&lt;1.2. using the high-z galaxies in the fieldsof goods observed by herschel in the framework of the goods-herschel keyprogram and the local iras or akari-selected galaxies in the field of sdss dr7,we investigate the dependence of galaxy properties on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy. we find that the sfrs and the ssfrs ofgalaxies, on average, depend on the morphology of and the distance to thenearest neighbor galaxy in this redshift range. when a late-type galaxy has aclose neighbor galaxy, the sfr and the ssfr increase as it approaches alate-type neighbor, which is supported by k-s and mc tests with a significancelevel of &gt;99%. however, the sfr and the ssfr decrease or do not change much asit approaches an early-type neighbor. the bifurcations of sfrs and ssfrsdepending on the neighbor's morphology seem to occur at r_n~0.5r_vir,nei, whichis supported by k-s and mc tests with a significance level of &gt;98%. for allredshift bins, the ssfrs of late-type galaxies interacting with late-typeneighbors are increased by factors of about 1.8+/-0.7 and 4.0+/-1.2 compared tothose of non-interacting galaxies when the pair separation is smaller than0.5r_vir,nei and 0.1r_vir,nei, respectively. the tdust of both local and high-zlate-type galaxies strongly interacting with late-type neighbors (i.e. r_n &lt;0.1r_vir,nei) appears to be higher than that of non-interacting galaxies with asignificance level of 96-99%. however, tdust of local late-type galaxiesstrongly interacting with early-type neighbors seems to be lower than orsimilar to that of non-interacting galaxies. our results suggest thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers have been strongly affecting the sfr andthe dust properties of star-forming galaxies over at least 8 billion years.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1204.1152	the agn content in luminous ir galaxies at z\sim2 from a global sed  analysis including herschel data	we use herschel-pacs far-infrared data, combined with previous multi-bandinformation and mid-ir spectra, to properly account for the presence of anactive nucleus and constrain its energetic contribution in luminous infrared(ir) sources at z\sim2. the sample is composed of 24 sources in the goods-southfield, with typical ir luminosity of 10^{12} lo. data from the 4 ms chandrax-ray imaging in this field are also used to identify and characterize agnemission. we reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (sed),decomposed into a host-galaxy and an agn component. a smooth-torus model forcircum-nuclear dust is used to account for the direct and re-processedcontribution from the agn. we confirm that galaxies with typicall_{8-1000um}\sim10^{12}lo at z\sim2 are powered predominantly bystar-formation. an agn component is present in nine objects (\sim35% of thesample) at the 3sigma confidence level, but its contribution to the 8-1000 umemission accounts for only \sim5% of the energy budget. the agn contributionrises to \sim23% over the 5-30 um range (in agreement with spitzer irs results)and to \sim60% over the narrow 2-6 um range. the presence of an agn isconfirmed by x-ray data for 3 (out of nine) sources, with x-ray spectralanalysis indicating the presence of significant absorption, i.e.nh\sim10^{23}-10^{24} cm^{-2}. an additional source shows indications ofobscured agn emission from x-ray data. the comparison between themid-ir--derived x-ray luminosities and those obtained from x-ray data suggeststhat obscuration is likely present also in the remaining six sources thatharbour an agn according to the sed-fitting analysis.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1209.3016	no clear submillimetre signature of suppressed star formation amongst  x-ray luminous agns	many theoretical models require powerful active galactic nuclei (agns) tosuppress star formation in distant galaxies and reproduce the observedproperties of today's massive galaxies. a recent study based on herschel-spiresubmillimetre observations claimed to provide direct support for this picture,reporting a significant decrease in the mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of themost luminous agns (lx&gt;10^44 erg/s) at z=1-3 in the chandra deep field-north(cdf-n). in this letter we extend these results using herschel-spire 250um datain the cosmos and cdf-s fields to achieve an order of magnitude improvement inthe number of sources at lx&gt;10^44 erg/s. on the basis of our analysis, we findno strong evidence for suppressed star formation in lx&gt;10^44 erg/s agns atz=1-3. the mean sfrs of the agns are constant over the broad x-ray luminosityrange of lx~10^43-10^45 erg/s (with mean sfrs consistent with typicalstar-forming galaxies at z~2; &lt;sfrs&gt;~100-200 msol/yr). we suggest that theprevious cdf-n results were likely due to low number statistics. we discuss ourresults in the context of current theoretical models.

1210.2760	dust temperature and co-to-h2 conversion factor variations in the sfr-m*  plane	deep herschel imaging and 12co(2-1) line luminosities from the iram pdbi arecombined for a sample of 17 galaxies at z&gt;1 from the goods-n field. the sampleincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (ms) traced bystar-forming galaxies in the sfr-m* plane. the far-infrared data are used toderive dust masses, mdust. combined with an empirical prescription for thedependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (gdr), the co luminositiesand mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the co-to-h2 conversionfactor, alpha_co. like in the local universe, the value of alpha_co is a factorof ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs). wealso uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (tdust; alpha_codecreasing with increasing tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits tothe far-infrared data. while the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(tdust)relation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematicbiases in the determination of mdust, gdr or metallicity. although we cannotformally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with thedust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, acritical value of tdust=30k can be used to determine whether the appropriatealpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 msun(k kms pc^2)^-1, iftdust&gt;30k) or closer to the galactic value (4.35 msun (k kms pc^2)^-1, iftdust&lt;30k). this indicator has the great advantage of being less subjectivethan visual morphological classifications of mergers/sfgs, which can bedifficult at high z because of the clumpy nature of sfgs. in the absence offar-infrared data, the offset of a galaxy from the main sequence (i.e.,log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]) can be used to identify galaxies requiring theuse of an alpha_co conversion factor lower than the galactic value.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1211.5770	the far-infrared, uv and molecular gas relation in galaxies up to z=2.5	we use the infrared excess (irx) fir/uv luminosity ratio to study therelation between the effective uv attenuation (a_irx) and the uv spectral slope(beta) in a sample of 450 1&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxies. the fir data is from very deepherschel observations in the goods fields that allow us to detect galaxies withsfrs typical of galaxies with log(m)&gt;9.3. thus, we are able to study galaxieson and even below the main sfr-stellar mass relation (main sequence). we findthat main sequence galaxies form a tight sequence in the irx--beta plane, whichhas a flatter slope than commonly used relations. this slope favors a smc-likeuv extinction curve, though the interpretation is model dependent. the scatterin the irx-beta plane, correlates with the position of the galaxies in thesfr-m plane. using a smaller sample of galaxies with co gas masses, we studythe relation between the uv attenuation and the molecular gas content. we finda very tight relation between the scatter in the irx-beta plane and thespecific attenuation (s_a), a quantity that represents the attenuationcontributed by the molecular gas mass per young star. s_a is sensitive to boththe geometrical arrangement of stars and dust, and to the compactness of thestar forming regions. we use this empirical relation to derive a method forestimating molecular gas masses using only widely available integratedrest-frame uv and fir photometry. the method produces gas masses with anaccuracy between 0.12-0.16 dex in samples of normal galaxies between z~0 andz~1.5. major mergers and sub-millimeter galaxies follow a different s_arelation.

1301.4496	panchromatic spectral energy distributions of herschel sources	(abridged) far-infrared herschel photometry from the pep and hermes programsis combined with ancillary datasets in the goods-n, goods-s, and cosmos fields.based on this rich dataset, we reproduce the restframe uv to fir ten-colorsdistribution of galaxies using a superposition of multi-variate gaussian modes.the median sed of each mode is then fitted with a modified version of themagphys code that combines stellar light, emission from dust heated by starsand a possible warm dust contribution heated by an agn. the defined gaussiangrouping is also used to identify rare sources. the zoology of outliersincludes herschel-detected ellipticals, very blue z~1 ly-break galaxies,quiescent spirals, and torus-dominated agn with star formation. out of thesegroups and outliers, a new template library is assembled, consisting of 32 sedsdescribing the intrinsic scatter in the restframe uv-to-submm colors ofinfrared galaxies. this library is tested against l(ir) estimates with andwithout herschel data included, and compared to eight other popular methodsoften adopted in the literature. when implementing herschel photometry, theseapproaches produce l(ir) values consistent with each other within a medianabsolute deviation of 10-20%, the scatter being dominated more by fine tuningof the codes, rather than by the choice of sed templates. finally, the libraryis used to classify 24 micron detected sources in pep goods fields. agn appearto be distributed in the stellar mass (m*) vs. star formation rate (sfr) spacealong with all other galaxies, regardless of the amount of infrared luminositythey are powering, with the tendency to lie on the high sfr side of the "mainsequence". the incidence of warmer star-forming sources grows for objects withhigher specific star formation rates (ssfr), and they tend to populate the"off-sequence" region of the m*-sfr-z space.

1302.1202	nuclear activity is more prevalent in star-forming galaxies	we explore the question of whether low and moderate luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially found in galaxies that are undergoinga transition from active star formation to quiescence. this notion has beensuggested by studies of the uv-to-optical colors of agn hosts, which find themto be common among galaxies in the so-called "green valley", a region of galaxycolor space believed to be composed mostly of galaxies undergoingstar-formation quenching. combining the deepest current x-ray and herschel.pacs far-infrared (fir) observations of the two chandra deep fields (cdfs) withredshifts, stellar masses and rest-frame photometry derived from the extensiveand uniform multi-wavelength data in these fields, we compare the rest-frameu-v color distributions and sfr distributions of agns and carefully constructedsamples of inactive control galaxies. the uv-to-optical colors of agns areconsistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z~2, butwe show that such colors are poor tracers of star formation. while the firdistributions of both star-forming agns and star-forming inactive galaxies arestatistically similar, we show that agns are preferentially found instar-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, agns are less likely to befound in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. we postulate that, amongx-ray selected agns of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply ofcold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclearblack holes.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1304.7000	on the redshift evolution (0 &lt; z &lt; 4) of dust attenuation and of the  total (uv+ir) star formation rate density	using new homogeneous lfs in the fuv and in the fir herschel/pep andherschel/hermes, we study the evolution of the dust attenuation with redshift.with this information in hand, we are able to estimate the redshift evolutionof the total (fuv + fir) star formation rate density sfrd_tot. by integratingsfrd_tot, we follow the mass building and analyze the redshift evolution of thestellar mass density (smd). this letter aims at providing a complete view ofstar formation from the local universe to z = 4 and, using assumptions onearlier star formation history, compares this evolution to what was knownbefore in an attempt to draw a homogeneous picture of the global evolution ofstar formation in galaxies.  the main conclusions of this letter are: 1) the dust attenuation a_fuv isfound to increase from z = 0 to z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease up toour last data point at z = 3.6; 2) the estimated sfrd confirms publishedresults up to z = 2. at z &gt; 2, we observe either a plateau or a small increaseup to z = 3 and then a likely decrease up to z = 3.6; 3) the peak of a_fuv isdelayed with respect to the plateau of sfrd_tot and a likely origin might befound in the evolution of the bright ends of the fuv and fir lfs; 4) usingassumptions (namely exponential rise and linear rise with time) for theevolution of the star formation density from z = 3.6 to z_form = 10, weintegrate sfrd_tot and find a good agreement with the published smds.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1304.7771	molecular gas mass functions of normal star forming galaxies since z~3	we use deep far-infrared data from the pep/goods-herschel surveys and restframe ultraviolet photometry to study the evolution of the molecular gas massfunction of normal star forming galaxies. computing the molecular gas mass,m(mol), by scaling star formation rates (sfr) through depletion timescales, orcombining ir luminosity and obscuration properties as in nordon et al., weobtain m(mol) for roughly 700, z=0.2-3.0 galaxies near the star forming "mainsequence". the number density of galaxies follows a schechter function ofm(mol). the characteristic mass m* is found to strongly evolve up to z~1, andthen to flatten at earlier epochs, resembling the infrared luminosity evolutionof similar objects. at z~1, our result is supported by an estimate based on thestellar mass function of star forming galaxies and gas fraction scalings fromthe phibss survey. we compare our measurements to results from current models,finding better agreement with those that are treating star formation lawsdirectly rather than in post-processing. integrating the mass function, westudy the evolution of the m(mol) density and its density parameter omega(mol).

1305.1938	dust-obscured star-formation in the outskirts of xmmu j2235.3-2557, a  massive galaxy cluster at z=1.4	star-formation in the galaxy populations of local massive clusters is reducedwith respect to field galaxies, and tends to be suppressed in the core region.indications of a reversal of the star-formation--density relation have beenobserved in a few z &gt;1.4 clusters. using deep imaging from 100-500um from pacsand spire onboard herschel, we investigate the infrared properties ofspectroscopic and photo-z cluster members, and of halpha emitters in xmmuj2235.3-2557, one of the most massive, distant, x-ray selected clusters known.our analysis is based mostly on fitting of the galaxies spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame 8-1000um. we measure total ir luminosity,deriving star formation rates (sfrs) ranging from 89-463 msun/yr for 13galaxies individually detected by herschel, all located beyond the core region(r &gt;250 kpc). we perform a stacking analysis of nine star-forming members notdetected by pacs, yielding a detection with sfr=48 msun/yr. using a colorcriterion based on a star-forming galaxy sed at the cluster redshift we select41 pacs sources as candidate star-forming cluster members. we characterize apopulation of highly obscured sf galaxies in the outskirts of xmmuj2235.3-2557. we do not find evidence for a reversal of the sf-density relationin this massive, distant cluster.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1308.2199	cosmological model dependence of the galaxy luminosity function:  far-infrared results in the lemaitre-tolman-bondi model	this is the first paper of a series aiming at investigating galaxy formationand evolution in the giant-void class of the lemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) modelsthat best fits current cosmological observations. here we investigate theluminosity function (lf) methodology, and how its estimates would be affectedby a change on the cosmological model assumed in its computation. are thecurrent observational constraints on the allowed cosmology enough to yieldrobust lf results? we use the far-infrared source catalogues built on theobservations performed with the herschel/pacs instrument, and selected as partof the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey. schechter profiles are obtained inredshift bins up to z approximately 4, assuming comoving volumes in both thestandard model, that is, friedmann-lemaitre-robertson-walker metric with aperfect fluid energy-momentum tensor, and non-homogeneous ltb dust models,parametrized to fit the current combination of results stemming from theobservations of supernovae ia, the cosmic microwave background, and baryonicacoustic oscillations. we find that the luminosity functions computed assumingboth the standard model and ltb void models show in general good agreement.however, the faint-end slope in the void models shows a significant departurefrom the standard model up to redshift 0.4. we demonstrate that this result isnot artificially caused by the used lf estimator which turns out to be robustunder the differences in matter-energy density profiles of the models. thedifferences found in the lf slopes at the faint end are due to variation in theluminosities of the sources, which depend on the geometrical part of the model.it follows that either the standard model is over-estimating the number densityof faint sources or the void models are under-estimating it.

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1311.3670	the evolution of the dust and gas content in galaxies	we use deep herschel pacs and spire observations in goodss, goodsn and cosmosto estimate the average dust mass (mdust) of galaxies on a redshift-stellarmass (mstar)-sfr grid. we study the scaling relations between mdust, mstar andsfr at z&lt;=2.5. no clear evolution of mdust is observed at fixed sfr and mstar.we find a tight correlation between sfr and mdust, likely a consequence of theschmidt-kennicutt (s-k) law. the mstar-mdust correlation observed by previousworks flattens or sometimes disappears when fixing the sfr. most of it likelyderives from the combination of the mdust-sfr and mstar-sfr correlations. wethen investigate the gas content as inferred by converting mdust by assumingthat the dust/gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity. all galaxiesin the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same sfr-mgas relation(integrated s-k law), which broadly agrees with co-based results for the bulkof the population, despite the completely different approaches. the majority ofgalaxies at z~2 form stars with an efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) ~5 times higherthan at z~0. it is not clear what fraction of such variation is an intrinsicredshift evolution and what fraction arises from selection effects. the gasfraction (fgas) decreases with mstar and increases with sfr, and does notevolve with z at fixed mstar and sfr. we explain these trends by introducing auniversal relation between fgas, mstar and sfr, non-evolving out to z~2.5.galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves in time. we usethe 3d fundamental fgas-mstar-sfr relation and the redshift evolution of themain sequence to estimate the evolution of fgas in the average population ofgalaxies as a function of z and mstar, and we find evidence a downsizingscenario.

1401.4503	tracing the cosmic growth of super massive black holes to z ~ 3 with  herschel	we study a sample of herschel-pacs selected galaxies within the goods-southand the cosmos fields in the framework of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)project. starting from the rich multi-wavelength photometric data-setsavailable in both fields, we perform a broad-band spectral energy distribution(sed) decomposition to disentangle the possible active galactic nucleus (agn)contribution from that related to the host galaxy. we find that 37 per cent ofthe herschel-selected sample shows signatures of nuclear activity at the 99 percent confidence level. the probability to reveal agn activity increases forbright ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt; 10^{11} \rm l_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies at$z&gt;0.3$, becoming about 80 per cent for the brightest ($l_{\rm 1-1000} &gt;10^{12} \rm l_{\odot}$) infrared (ir) galaxies at $z \geq 1$. finally, wereconstruct the agn bolometric luminosity function and the super-massive blackhole growth rate across cosmic time up to $z \sim 3$ from a far-infrared (fir)perspective. this work shows general agreement with most of the panchromaticestimates from the literature, with the global black hole growth peaking at $z\sim 2$ and reproducing the observed local black hole mass density withconsistent values of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm rad}$($\sim$0.07).

1406.1189	a multiwavelength consensus on the main sequence of star-forming  galaxies at z~2	we compare various star formation rate (sfr) indicators for star-forminggalaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;2.5$ in the cosmos field. the main focus is on the sfrs fromthe far-ir (pacs-herschel data) with those from the ultraviolet, for galaxiesselected according to the bzk criterion. fir-selected samples lead to a vastlydifferent slope of the sfr-stellar mass ($m_*$) relation, compared to that ofthe dominant main sequence population as measured from the uv, since the firselection picks predominantly only a minority of outliers. however, there isoverall agreement between the main sequences derived with the two sfrindicators, when stacking on the pacs maps the bzk-selected galaxies. theresulting logarithmic slope of the sfr-{$m_*$} relation is $\sim0.8-0.9$, inagreement with that derived from the dust-corrected uv-luminosity. exploitingdeeper 24$\mu$m-spitzer data we have characterized a sub-sample of galaxieswith reddening and sfrs poorly constrained, as they are very faint in the $b$band. the combination of herschel with spitzer data have allowed us to largelybreak the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, bydistinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in b-z because of being heavilydust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being)quenched. finally, we have compared our sfr(uv) to the sfrs derived by stackingthe radio data and to those derived from the h$\alpha$ luminosity of a sampleof star-forming galaxies at $1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the two sets of sfrs are broadlyconsistent as they are with the sfrs derived from the uv and by stacking thecorresponding pacs data in various mass bins.

1407.1863	large scale clustering measurements with photometric redshifts:  comparing the dark matter halos of x-ray agn, star-forming and passive  galaxies at z~1	we combine multiwavelength data in the aegis-xd and c-cosmos surveys tomeasure the typical dark matter halo mass of x-ray selected agn[lx(2-10kev)&gt;1e42 erg/s] in comparison with far-infrared selected star-forminggalaxies detected in the herschel/pep survey (pacs evolutionary probe; lir&gt;1e11solar) and quiescent systems at z~1. we develop a novel method to measure theclustering of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions in addition to any spectroscopy. this isadvantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clusteringanalysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. the method works bestfor large samples. the loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy isbalanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering. wefind that x-ray agn, far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies and passivesystems in the redshift interval 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 are found in halos of similar mass,$\log m_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. we argue that this is becausethe galaxies in all three samples (agn, star-forming, passive) have similarstellar mass distributions, approximated by the j-band luminosity. thereforeall galaxies that can potentially host x-ray agn, because they have stellarmasses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes of $\logm_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formationrates. this suggests that the stellar mass of x-ray agn hosts is driving theobserved clustering properties of this population. we also speculate thattrends between agn properties (e.g. luminosity, level of obscuration) and largescale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of the hostgalaxies.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1409.5122	the host galaxies of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5:  structure, star-formation and their relationships from candels and  herschel/pacs	we study the relationship between the structure and star-formation rate (sfr)of x-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe two chandra deep fields, using hubble space telescope imaging from thecosmic assembly near infrared extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and deepfar-infrared maps from the pep+goods-herschel survey. we derive detaileddistributions of structural parameters and fir luminosities from carefullyconstructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of theagns. at z~1, agns show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive(non-agn) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxydisturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpystructure). in contrast, at z~2, agns show similar levels of galaxy disturbanceas inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which mayarise due to a more pronounced bulge in agn hosts or due to extinguishednuclear light. we undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but ourresults do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. the mean sfrand its distribution among agns and inactive galaxies are similar at z&gt;1.5. atz&lt;1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the sfrs of agnswith bulge-dominated light profiles. these trends suggest an evolution in therelation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards aminor role for mergers and interactions at z&gt;1.5.

1409.5795	the evolution of star formation activity in galaxy groups	we study the evolution of the total star formation (sf) activity, totalstellar mass and halo occupation distribution in massive halos by using one ofthe largest x-ray selected sample of galaxy groups with secure spectroscopicidentification in the major blank field surveys (ecdfs, cdfn, cosmos, aegis).we provide an accurate measurement of sfr for the bulk of the star-forminggalaxies using very deep mid-infrared spitzer mips and far-infrared herschelpacs observations. for undetected ir sources, we provide a well-calibrated sfrfrom sed fitting. we observe a clear evolution in the level of sf activity ingalaxy groups. the total sf activity in the high redshift groups (0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1) ishigher with respect to the low redshift (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5) sample at any mass by0.8+/-0.12 dex. a milder difference (0.35+/-0.1 dex) is observed between thelow redshift bin and the groups at z~0. we show that the level of sf activityis declining more rapidly in the more massive halos than in the more commonlower mass halos. we do not observe any evolution in the halo occupationdistribution and total stellar mass- halo mass relations in groups. the pictureemerging from our findings suggests that the galaxy population in the mostmassive systems is evolving faster than galaxies in lower mass halos,consistently with a "halo downsizing" scenario.

1410.7412	the far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies  in the sfr-m* plane up to z 2	[abridged] we study the evolution of the radio spectral index andfar-infrared/radio correlation (frc) across the star-formation rate-stellarmasse (i.e. sfr-m*) plane up to z 2. we start from a m*-selected sample ofgalaxies with reliable sfr and redshift estimates. we then grid the sfr-m*plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radioluminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the frc index (i.e. qfir) ofeach sfr-m*-z bin. the infrared luminosities of our sfr-m*-z bins are estimatedusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observationsobtained with herschel. their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices(i.e. alpha, where snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4ghz and610mhz flux densities from the vla and gmrt, respectively. our far-infrared andradio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields-goods-n/s, ecdfs, and cosmos- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. using thismethodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and frc index ofstar-forming galaxies with m*&gt;10^10msun and 0&lt;z&lt;2.3. we find thatalpha^1.4ghz_610mhz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with thedistance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane(i.e. delta_log(ssfr)_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). instead,star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonicalvalue of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated bynon-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. we find that qfir displays amoderate but statistically significant redshift evolution asqfir(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previousliterature. finally, we find no significant correlation between qfir anddelta_log(ssfr)_ms, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of ourredshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

1503.05779	goods-$herschel$: identification of the individual galaxies responsible  for the 80-290$\mu$m cosmic infrared background	we propose a new method of pushing $herschel$ to its faintest detectionlimits using universal trends in the redshift evolution of the far infraredover 24$\mu$m colours in the well-sampled goods-north field. an extension toother fields with less multi-wavelength information is presented. this methodis applied here to raise the contribution of individually detected $herschel$sources to the cosmic infrared background (cirb) by a factor 5 close to itspeak at 250$\mu$m and more than 3 in the 350$\mu$m and 500$\mu$m bands. weproduce realistic mock $herschel$ images of the deep pacs and spire images ofthe goods-north field from the goods-$herschel$ key program and use them toquantify the confusion noise at the position of individual sources, i.e.,estimate a "local confusion noise". two methods are used to identify sourceswith reliable photometric accuracy extracted using 24$\mu$m prior positions.the clean index (ci), previously defined but validated here with simulations,which measures the presence of bright 24$\mu$m neighbours and the photometricaccuracy index (pai) directly extracted from the mock $herschel$ images. aftercorrection for completeness, thanks to our mock $herschel$ images, individuallydetected sources make up as much as 54% and 60% of the cirb in the pacs bandsdown to 1.1 mjy at 100$\mu$m and 2.2 mjy at 160$\mu$m and 55, 33, and 13% ofthe cirb in the spire bands down to 2.5, 5, and 9 mjy at 250$\mu$m, 350$\mu$m,and 500$\mu$m, respectively. the latter depths improve the detection limits of$herschel$ by factors of 5 at 250$\mu$m, and 3 at 350$\mu$m and 500$\mu$m ascompared to the standard confusion limit. interestingly, the dominantcontributors to the cirb in all $herschel$ bands appear to be distant siblingsof the milky way ($z$$\sim$0.96 for $\lambda$$&lt;$300$\mu$m) with a stellar massof $m_{\star}$$\sim$9$\times$10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$.

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

astro-ph;0312064	photometric redshifts with the multilayer perceptron neural network:  application to the hdf-s and sdss	we present a technique for the estimation of photometric redshifts based onfeed-forward neural networks. the multilayer perceptron (mlp) artificial neuralnetwork is used to predict photometric redshifts in the hdf-s from an ultradeep multicolor catalog. various possible approaches for the training of theneural network are explored, including the deepest and most completespectroscopic redshift catalog currently available (the hubble deep field northdataset) and models of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies availablein the literature. the mlp can be trained on observed data, theoretical dataand mixed samples. the prediction of the method is tested on the spectroscopicsample in the hdf-s (44 galaxies). over the entire redshift range, $0.1&lt;z&lt;3.5$,the agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf-sis good: the training on mixed data produces sigma_z(test) ~ 0.11, showing thatmodel libraries together with observed data provide a sufficiently completedescription of the galaxy population. the neural system capability is alsotested in a low redshift regime, 0&lt;z&lt;0.4, using the sloan digital sky surveydata release one (dr1) spectroscopic sample. the resulting accuracy on 88108galaxies is sigma_z(test) ~ 0.022. inputs other than galaxy colors - such asmorphology, angular size and surface brightness - may be easily incorporated inthe neural network technique. an important feature, in view of the applicationof the technique to large databases, is the computational speed: in theevaluation phase, redshifts of 10^5 galaxies are estimated in few seconds.

astro-ph;0506201	rass-sdss galaxy cluster survey. iv. a ubiquitous dwarf galaxy  population in clusters	we analyze the luminosity functions (lfs) of a subsample of 69 clusters fromthe rass-sdss galaxy cluster catalog. when calculated within the clusterphysical sizes, given by r200 or r500, all the cluster lfs appear to have thesame shape, well fitted by a composite of two schechter functions with a markedupturn and a steepening at the faint-end. previously reportedcluster-to-cluster variations of the lf faint-end slope are due to the use of ametric cluster aperture for computing the lf of clusters of different masses.  we determine the composite lf for early- and late-type galaxies, where thetyping is based on the galaxy u-r colors. the late-type lf is well fitted by asingle schechter function with a steep slope (alpha=-2.0 in the r band, withinr200}). the early-type lf instead cannot be fitted by a single schechterfunction, and a composite of two schechter functions is needed. the faint-endupturn of the global cluster lf is due to the early-type cluster galaxies. theshape of the bright-end tail of the early-type lf does not seem to depend uponthe local galaxy density or the distance from the cluster center. the late-typelf shows a significant variation only very near the cluster center. on theother hand, the faint-end tail of the early-type lf shows a significant andcontinuous variation with the environment. we provide evidence that the processresponsible for creating the excess population of dwarf early type galaxies inclusters is a threshold process that occurs when the density exceeds ~500 timesthe critical density of the universe. we interpret our results in the contextof the 'harassment' scenario, where faint early-type cluster galaxies arepredicted to be the descendants of tidally-stripped late-type galaxies.

(2004), which is based on sdss spectra. we only considergalaxies with m_r &lt;= -20.25 in our analysis, and exclude agns. we find thatboth sigma_sfr and m_star are correlated with all the cluster globalquantities. a partial correlation analysis show that all the correlations areinduced by the fundamental one between sigma_sfr and n_gal, hence there is noevidence that the cluster properties affect the mean sfr or m_star per galaxy.the relations between sigma_sfr and m_star, on one side, and both n_gal andm_200, on the other side, are linear, i.e. we see no evidence that differentclusters have different sfr or different m_star per galaxy and per unit mass.the fraction f_sf does not depend on any cluster property considered, while f_bdoes depend on l_x. we note that a significant fraction of star-forming clustergalaxies are red (~25% of the whole cluster galaxy population). we concludethat the global cluster properties are unable to affect the sf properties ofcluster galaxies, but the presence of the x-ray luminous intra-cluster mediumcan affect their colors, perhaps through the ram-pressure stripping mechanism.

astro-ph;0610738	the agn fraction - velocity dispersion relation in clusters of galaxies	some previous investigations have found that the fraction (f_agn) of activegalactic nuclei (agns) is lower in clusters than in the field. this can resultfrom the suppression of galaxy-galaxy mergers in high-velocity dispersion(sigma_v) clusters, if the formation and/or fueling of agns is directly relatedto the merging process. we investigate the existence of a relation betweenf_agn and sigma_v in galaxy clusters in order to shed light on the formationand evolution processes of agns and cluster galaxies. using data from the sloandigital sky survey we determine f_agn and sigma_v for the clusters in twosamples, extracted from the catalogs of popesso et al. (2006a) and miller etal. (2005), and excluding clusters with significant evidence for substructures.we find a significant f_agn-sigma_v anti-correlation. clusters with sigma_vlower and, respectively, higher than 500 km/s have agn fractions of $0.21 \pm0.01$ and $0.15 \pm 0.01$, on average. the f_agn-sigma_v relation can bedescribed by a model that assumes f_agn is proportional to the galaxies mergingrate, plus a constant. since f_agn increases with decreasing sigma_v, agns arelikely to have played a significant role in heating the intra-cluster mediumand driving galaxy evolution in cluster precursors and groups.

astro-ph;0703653	the reversal of the star formation-density relation in the distant  universe	we study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and theirstar formation rate (sfr) in the great observatories origins deep survey,goods, at z~1, from ultradeep imaging at 24 microns with the mips cameraonboard spitzer. we show that the star formation-density relation observedlocally was reversed at z~1: the average sfr of an individual galaxy increasedwith local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age.hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the millenniummodel) predicted such a reversal to occur only at only at earlier epochs (z&gt;2)and at a lower level. we present a remarkable structure at z~1.016, containingx-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into avirgo-like cluster. this structure illustrates how the individual sfr ofgalaxies increases with density at the ~1-2 mpc scale. the sfr of z~1 galaxiesis found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role inthe observed star formation-density trend. however the specific sfr (=sfr/m*)decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, whichimplies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activityof galaxies. major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major causefor this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) at z~1 present the hst-acs morphology of spirals, while only a thirdpresent a clear signature of major mergers. the remaining galaxies are dividedinto compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. moreover, the specific sfr ofmajor mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals. reproducing thesfr-density relation at z ~ 1 is a new challenge for models, requiring acorrect balance between mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.
