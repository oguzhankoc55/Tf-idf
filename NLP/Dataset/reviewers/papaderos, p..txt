0907.2116	sbs 0335-052e+w: deep vlt/fors+uves spectroscopy of the pair of the  lowest-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies	(abridged) we present deep archival vlt/fors1+uves spectroscopic observationsof the system of two blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxies sbs 0335-052e and sbs0335-052w. our aim is to derive element abundances in different hii regions ofthis unique system of galaxies and to study spatial abundance variations. wedetermine abundances of helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, chlorine, argonand iron. the oxygen abundance in the brighter eastern galaxy varies in therange 7.11 to 7.32 in different hii regions supporting previous findings andsuggesting the presence of oxygen abundance variations on spatial scales of~1-2 kpc. the oxygen abundance in the brightest region no.1 of sbs 0335-052w is7.22+/-0.07, consistent with previous determinations.three other hii regionsare much more metal-poor with an unprecedently low oxygen abundance of12+logo/h=7.01+/-0.07 (region no.2), 6.98+/-0.06 (region no.3), and 6.86+/-0.14(region no.4). these are the lowest oxygen abundances ever derived inemission-line galaxies. helium abundances derived for the brightest hii regionsof both galaxies are mutually consistent. we derive weighted mean he massfractions of 0.2485+/-0.0012 and 0.2514+/-0.0012 for two different sets of heiemissivities. the n/o abundance ratio in both galaxies is slightly higher thanthat derived for other bcds with 12+logo/h&lt;7.6. this implies that the n/o inextremely metal-deficient galaxies could increase with decreasing metallicity.

0908.2539	an investigation of the luminosity-metallicity relation for a large  sample of low-metallicity emission-line galaxies	(abridged) we present 8.2m vlt spectroscopic observations of 28 hii regionsin 16 emission-line galaxies and 3.6m eso telescope spectroscopic observationsof 38 hii regions in 28 emission-line galaxies. these emission-line galaxieswere selected mainly from the data release 6 (dr6) of the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) as metal-deficient galaxy candidates. we collect photometric andhigh-quality spectroscopic data for a large uniform sample of star forminggalaxies including new observations. our aim is to study theluminosity-metallicity (l-z) relation for nearby galaxies, especially at itslow-metallicity end and compare it with that for higher-redshift galaxies. fromour new observations we find that the oxygen abundance in 61 out of the 66 hiiregions of our sample ranges from 12+logo/h=7.05 to 8.22. our sample includes27 new galaxies with 12+logo/h&lt;7.6 which qualify as extremely metal-poorstar-forming galaxies (xbcds). among them are 10 hii regions with12+logo/h&lt;7.3. the new sample is combined with a further 93 low-metallicitygalaxies with accurate oxygen abundance determinations from our previousstudies, yielding in total a high-quality spectroscopic data set of 154 hiiregions. 9000 more galaxies with oxygen abundances, based mainly on thete-method, are compiled from the sdss. our data set spans a range of 8 mag withrespect to its absolute magnitude in sdss g (-12&gt;mg&gt;-20) and nearly 2 dex inits oxygen abundance (7.0&lt;12+logo/h&lt;8.8), allowing us to probe the l-z relationin the nearby universe down to the lowest currently studied metallicity level.the l-z relation established on the basis of the present sample is consistentwith previous ones obtained for emission-line galaxies.

0911.2344	new light in star-forming dwarf galaxies: the pmas integral field view  of the blue compact dwarf galaxy mrk 409	we present an integral field spectroscopic study of the central 2x2 kpc^2 ofthe blue compact dwarf galaxy mrk 409, observed with the potsdam multiaperturespectrophotometer. this study focuses on the morphology, two-dimensionalchemical abundance pattern, excitation properties and kinematics of the ionizedinterstellar medium in the starburst component. we also investigate the natureof the extended ring of ionized gas emission surrounding the bright nuclearstarburst region of mrk 409. pmas spectra of selected regions along the ring,interpreted with evolutionary and population synthesis models, indicate thattheir ionized emission is mainly due to a young stellar population with a totalmass of ~1.5x10^6 m_sun, which started forming almost coevally ~10 myr ago.this stellar component is likely confined to the collisional interface of aspherically expanding, starburst-driven super-bubble with denser, swept-upambient gas, ~600 pc away from the central starburst nucleus. the spectroscopicproperties of the latter imply a large extinction (c_h-beta&gt;0.9), and thepresence of an additional non-thermal ionization source, most likely alow-luminosity active galactic nucleus. mrk 409 shows a relatively large oxygenabundance (12+log(o/h)~8.4) and no chemical abundance gradients out to r~600pc. the ionized gas kinematics displays an overall regular rotation on anorthwest-southwest axis, with a maximum velocity of 60 km/s; the total massinside the star-forming ring is about 1.4x10^9 m_sun.

1005.1844	tol 2240-384 - a new low-metallicity agn candidate	active galactic nuclei (agns) have typically been discovered in massivegalaxies of high metallicity. we attempt to increase the number of agncandidates in low metallicity galaxies. we present vlt/uves and archivalvlt/fors1 spectroscopic and ntt/susi2 photometric observations of thelow-metallicity emission-line galaxy tol 2240-384 and perform a detailed studyof its morphology, chemical composition, and emission-line profiles. wedetermine abundances of nitrogen, o, ne, s, cl, ar, and fe by analyzing thefluxes of narrow components of the emission lines using empirical methods. weverify with a photoionisation model that the physics of the narrow-linecomponent gas is similar to that in common metal-poor galaxies. imagedeconvolution reveals two high-surface brightness regions in tol 2240-384separated by 2.4 kpc.the brightest southwestern region is surrounded by intenseionised gas emission on a spatial scale of ~5 kpc. the profiles of the strongemission lines in the uves spectrum are asymmetric and all these lines apartfrom halpha and hbeta can be fitted by two gaussians of fwhm ~75-92 km/sseparated by ~80 km/s implying that there are two regions of ionised gasemitting narrow lines. the shapes of the halpha and hbeta lines are morecomplex. in particular, the halpha emission line consists of two broadcomponents of fwhm ~700 km/s and 2300 km/s, in addition to narrow components oftwo regions revealed from profiles of other lines. the extraordinarily highluminosity of the broad halpha line of 3x10e41 erg/s cannot be accounted for bymassive stars at different stages of their evolution. the broad halpha emissionpersists over a period of 7 years, which excludes supernovae as a poweringmechanism of this emission. this emission most likely arises from an accretiondisc around a black hole of mass ~10e7 msun.

1103.5771	star cluster formation and evolution in mrk 930: properties of a  metal-poor starburst	we present a hst multiband analysis of the large population of star clustersin the blue compact galaxy (bcg) mrk 930. we have reconstructed the spectralenergy distributions of the star clusters and estimated age, mass, andextinction for a representative sample. we observe a very young clusterpopulation with 70% of the systems formed less than 10 myr ago. the peak in thestar cluster age distribution at 4 myr is corroborated by the presence ofwolf-rayet spectral features, and by the observed optical and ir lines ratios[oiii]/h_beta and [neiii]/[neii]. the recovered extinction in these very youngclusters shows large variations, with a decrease at older ages. it is likelythat our analysis is limited to the optically brightest objects (i.e. systemsonly partially embedded in their natal cocoons). we map the extinction acrossthe galaxy using low-resolution spectra and the h_alpha/h_beta ratio, asobtained from ground-based narrow band imaging. we find that the mean opticalextinction derived in the starburst regions is close to the averaged valueobserved in the clusters, but locally, do not trace the more extinguishedclusters. previous hst studies of bcgs have revealed a population of young andextremely red super star clusters. we detect a considerable fraction ofclusters affected by a red excess also in mrk 930. the nature of the redexcess, which turns up at near-ir wavelengths remains unknown. we compare thecluster and the star formation history, the latter derived from the fit ofspectral population synthesis models to the spectra. we find a generalagreement between the two independently estimated quantities. using the clusterproperties we perform a study of the host environmental properties. we findthat the cluster formation efficiency is significantly higher, suggesting a keyrole of the environment for the formation of these massive objects.[abridged]

1104.1434	spatially resolved spectroscopy and chemical history of star-forming  galaxies in the hercules cluster: the effects of the environment	spatially resolved spectroscopy has been obtained for a sample of 27star-forming (sf) galaxies selected from our deep halpha survey of the herculescluster. we have applied spectral synthesis models to all emission-line spectraof this sample using the population synthesis code starlight. we have obtainedfundamental parameters of the stellar components, as the mean metallicity andage, and we have corrected the emission-line spectra for underlying stellarabsorption. o/h and n/o gas chemical abundances were obtained using the latestempirical calibrations. the effects of cluster environment on the chemicalevolution of galaxies and on their mass-metallicity (mz) andluminosity-metallicity (lz) relations were studied combining the derived gasmetallicities, the mean stellar metallicities and ages, the masses andluminosities of galaxies and their existing hi data. we have found that ourhercules sf galaxies divide into three main subgroups: a) chemically evolvedspirals with truncated ionized-gas disks and nearly flat oxygen gradients,witnessing the effect of ram-pressure stripping, b) chemically evolveddwarfs/irregulars populating the highest local densities, possible products oftidal interactions in preprocessing events, or c) less metallic dwarf galaxieswhich appear to be "newcomers" to the cluster, experiencing pressure-triggeredstar-formation. most hercules sf galaxies follow well defined mz and lzsequences (for both o/h and n/o); though the dwarf/irregular galaxies locatedat the densest regions appear to be outliers to these global relations,suggesting a physical reason for the dispersion in these fundamental relations.the hercules cluster appears to be currently assembling via the merger ofsmaller substructures, providing an ideal laboratory where the localenvironment has been found to be a key parameter to understand the chemicalhistory of galaxies.

1111.1392	vlt spectroscopy of low-metallicity emission-line galaxies: abundance  patterns and abundance discrepancies	(abridged) we present deep spectroscopy of a large sample of low-metallicityemission-line galaxies. the main goal of this study is to derive elementabundances in these low-metallicity galaxies. we analyze 121 vlt spectra of hiiregions in 46 low-metallicity emission-line galaxies. 83 of these spectra arearchival vlt/fors1+uves spectra of hii regions in 31 low-metallicityemission-line galaxies that are studied for the first time with standard directmethods to determine the electron temperatures, the electron number densities,and the chemical abundances. the oxygen abundance of the sample lies in therange 12 + log o/h = 7.2-8.4. the ne/o ratio increases with increasing oxygenabundance. the fe/o ratio decreases from roughly solar at the lowestmetallicities to about one tenth of solar, indicating that the degree ofdepletion of iron into dust grains depends on metallicity. the n/o ratio inextremely low-metallicity galaxies with 12+logo/h&lt;7.5 shows a slight increasewith decreasing oxygen abundance. we present the first empirical relationbetween the electron temperature derived from [siii]6312/9069 or [nii]5755/6583and the one derived from [oiii]4363/(4959+5007) in low-metallicity galaxies. ina number of objects, the abundances of c^++ and o^++ could be derived fromrecombination lines. our study confirms the discrepancy between abundancesfound from recombination lines (rls) and collisionally excited lines (cels) andthat c/o increases with o/h.

1202.0511	the ionized gas in the califa early-type galaxies i. mapping two  representative cases: ngc 6762 and ngc 5966	as part of the califa survey, we conducted a thorough 2d analysis of theionized gas in two e/s0 galaxies, ngc6762 and ngc5966, aiming to shed light onthe nature of their warm ionized ism. we present optical ifs obtained with thepmas/ppak spectrophotometer. to recover the nebular lines, we subtracted theunderlying stellar continuum from the observed spectra using the starlightcode. in ngc6762, the ionized gas and stellar emission display similarmorphologies, while the emission line morphology is elongated in ngc5966,spanning ~6 kpc, and is oriented roughly orthogonal to the major axis of thestellar continuum ellipsoid. whereas gas and stars are kinematically aligned inngc6762, the gas is kinematically decoupled from the stars in ngc5966. adecoupled rotating disk or an ionization cone are two possible interpretationsof the elongated ionized gas structure in ngc5966. the latter would be thefirst ionization cone of such a dimension detected within a weak emission-linegalaxy. both galaxies have weak emission-lines relative to the continuum[ew(ha)&lt; 3 a] and have low excitation, log([oiii]5007/hb) &lt; 0.5. based onoptical diagnostic ratios([oiii]5007/hb,[nii]6584/ha,[sii]6717,6731/ha,[oi]6300/ha), both objectscontain a liner nucleus and an extended liner-like gas emission. the emissionline ratios do not vary significantly with radius or aperture, which indicatesthat the nebular properties are spatially homogeneous. the gas emission inngc6762 can be best explained by photoionization by pagb stars without the needof invoking any other excitation mechanism. in the case of ngc5966, thepresence of a nuclear ionizing source seems to be required to shape theelongated gas emission feature in the ionization cone scenario, althoughionization by pagb stars cannot be ruled out.(abridged)

1210.8150	califa, the calar alto legacy integral field area survey. ii. first  public data release	we present the first public data release of the califa survey. it consists ofscience-grade optical datacubes for the first 100 of eventually 600 nearby(0.005&lt;z&lt;0.03) galaxies, obtained with the integral-field spectrographpmas/ppak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the calar alto observatory. thegalaxies in dr1 already cover a wide range of properties in color-magnitudespace, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionization conditions. thisoffers the potential to tackle a variety of open questions in galaxy evolutionusing spatially resolved spectroscopy. two different spectral setups areavailable for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution v500 setup covering the nominalwavelength range 3745-7500a with a spectral resolution of 6.0a (fwhm), and (ii)a medium-resolution v1200 setup covering the nominal wavelength range3650-4840a with a spectral resolution of 2.3a (fwhm). we present thecharacteristics and data structure of the califa datasets that should be takeninto account for scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the effectsof vignetting, bad pixels and spatially correlated noise. the data quality testfor all 100 galaxies showed that we reach a median limiting continuumsensitivity of 1.0x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 5635a and2.2x10^-18erg/s/cm^2/a/arcsec^2 at 4500a for the v500 and v1200 setuprespectively, which corresponds to limiting r and g band surface brightnessesof 23.6mag/arcsec^2 and 23.4mag/arcsec^2, or an unresolved emission-line fluxdetection limit of roughly 1x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 and0.6x10^-17erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, respectively. the median spatial resolution is3.7", and the absolute spectrophotometric calibration is better than 15%(1sigma). we also describe the available interfaces and tools that allow easyaccess to this first public califa data.

1301.5320	a virtual observatory census to address dwarfs origins. avocado - i.  science goals, sample selection and analysis tools	(abridged) avocado aims at establishing firm conclusions on the formation andevolution of dwarf galaxies by constructing and analysing a homogeneous,multiwavelength dataset for a statistically significant sample of approximately6500 nearby dwarfs (m_i &gt; -18 mag). we present the sample selection criteriaand describe the suite of analysis tools, some of them developed in theframework of the virtual observatory. we make use of optical spectra anduv-to-nir imaging of the dwarf sample to derive sfrs, stellar masses, ages andmetallicities - which are further supplemented with structural parameters thatare used to classify them morphologically. this dataset, coupled with adetailed characterisation of each dwarf's environment, allows for a fullycomprehensive investigation of their origins and to track the potentialevolutionary paths between the different dwarf types. we characterise the localenvironment of all dwarfs in our sample, paying special attention to trendswith current star formation activity. we find that virtually all quiescentdwarfs are located in the vicinity (projected distances &lt; 1.5 mpc) of l*companions, consistent with recent results. while star-forming dwarfs arepreferentially found at separations of the order of 1 mpc, there appears to bea tail towards low separations (&lt;100 kpc) in the distribution of projecteddistances. we speculate that, modulo projection effects, this probablyrepresents a genuine population of late-type dwarfs caught upon first infallabout their host and before environmental quenching has fully operated. in thiscontext, these results suggest that internal mechanisms -such as gas exhaustionvia star formation or feedback effects- are not sufficient to completely ceasethe star formation activity in dwarf galaxies, and that becoming the satelliteof a massive central galaxy appears to be a necessary condition to create aquiescent dwarf.

1304.1644	aperture corrections for disk galaxy properties derived from the califa  survey. balmer emission lines in spiral galaxies	this work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxyproperties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. we focus onsome indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiralgalaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. wehave used 104 spiral galaxies from the califa survey for which 2d spectroscopywith complete spatial coverage is available. from the 3d cubes we have derivedgrowth curves of the most conspicuous balmer emission lines (halpha, hbeta) forcircular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus afterremoving the underlying stellar continuum. we find that the halpha flux(f(halpha)) growth curve follows a well defined sequence with aperture radiusshowing low dispersion around the median value. from this analysis, we deriveaperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshiftintervals. once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, thef(halpha)/f(hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing towardsthe absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. aperturecorrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval[0.3,2.5]r_50. finally, the halpha equivalent width (ew(halpha)) growth curveincreases with the size of the aperture and shows a very large dispersion forsmall apertures. this large dispersion prevents the use of reliable aperturecorrections for this quantity. in addition, this result suggests thatseparating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed ew(halpha)through small apertures is likely to result in low ew(halpha) star-forminggalaxies begin classified as quiescent.

1304.2158	the mass-metallicity relation explored with califa: i. is there a  dependence on the star formation rate?	we present the results on the study of the global and local m-z relationbased on the first data available from the califa survey (150 galaxies). thissurvey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent ofeach galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separateindividual hii regions and/or aggregations. nearly $\sim$3000 individual hiiregions have been detected. the spectra cover the wavelength range between[oii]3727 and [sii]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygenabundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. in addition, wehave computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surfacedensities), based on sdss photometric data. we explore the relations betweenthe stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  we derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and thegas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported inthe literature ($\sigma_{\delta{\rm log(o/h)}}=$0.07 dex). indeed, thisdispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for ouroxygen abundances. however, we do not find any secondary relation with thestar-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation ofthis quantity with the stellar mass. we confirm the result using the $\sim$3000individual hii regions, for the corresponding local relations.  our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, bothlocally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like thatof gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. in essence,late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, witha behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneousrecycling/closed-box model.

1306.2338	nebular emission and the lyman continuum photon escape fraction in  califa early-type galaxies	we use deep integral field spectroscopy data from the califa survey to studythe warm interstellar medium (wim) of 32 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs). wepropose a tentative subdivision of our sample etgs into two groups, accordingto their ha equivalent width (ew) and lyman continuum (lyc) photon escapefraction (plf). type i etgs show nearly constant ews and a plf~0, suggestingthat photoionization by post-agb stars is the main driver of their faintextranuclear nebular emission. type ii etgs are characterized by very low,outwardly increasing ews, and a plf as large as ~0.9 in their centers. suchproperties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing wim density and/or volumefilling factor. we argue that, because of extensive lyc photon leakage,emission-line luminosities and ews are reduced in type ii etg nuclei by atleast one order of magnitude. consequently, the line weakness of these etgs isby itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely "weak"(sub-eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (agn). in fact, lyc photonescape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key elementin understanding why many etgs with prominent signatures of agn activity inradio continuum and/or x-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines andweak signatures of agn activity in their optical spectra. the lyc photonescape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear ews by line-of-sightintegration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impededetection of agn in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-linespectroscopy. we further find that type i and ii etgs differ little (~0.4 dex)in their mean bpt line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic ofliners. this potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,luminosity-weighted bpt ratios for the specific 3d properties of the wim inetgs.

1307.4899	extremely metal-poor galaxies: the hi content	extremely metal-poor (xmp) galaxies are chemically, and possibly dynamically,primordial objects in the local universe. our objective is to characterize thehi content of the xmp galaxies as a class, using as a reference the list of 140known local xmps compiled by morales-luis et al. (2011). we have observed 29xmps, which had not been observed before at 21 cm, using the effelsberg radiotelescope. this information was complemented with hi data published inliterature for a further 53 xmps. in addition, optical data from the literatureprovided morphologies, stellar masses, star-formation rates and metallicities.effelsberg hi integrated flux densities are between 1 and 15 jy km/s, whileline widths are between 20 and 120 km/s. hi integrated flux densities and linewidths from literature are in the range 0.1 - 200 jy km/s and 15 - 150 km/s,respectively. of the 10 new effelsberg detections, two sources show anasymmetric double-horn profile, while the remaining sources show eitherasymmetric (7 sources) or symmetric (1 source) single-peak 21 cm line profiles.an asymmetry in the hi line profile is systematically accompanied by anasymmetry in the optical morphology. typically, the g-band stellarmass-to-light ratios are ~0.1, whereas the hi gas mass-to-light ratios may beup to 2 orders of magnitude larger. moreover, hi gas-to-stellar mass ratiosfall typically between 10 and 20, denoting that xmps are extremely gas-rich. wefind an anti-correlation between the hi gas mass-to-light ratio and theluminosity, whereby fainter xmps are more gas-rich than brighter xmps,suggesting that brighter sources have converted a larger fraction of their higas into stars. the dynamical masses inferred from the hi line widths implythat the stellar mass does not exceed 5% of the dynamical mass, while the\ion{h}{i} mass constitutes between 20 and 60% of the dynamical mass.(abridged)

1307.5316	the o3n2 and n2 abundance indicators revisited: improved calibrations  based on califa and te-based literature data	the use of ifs is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxesof an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and athigh redshift. the main goal of this study is to review the most widely usedempirical oxygen calibrations, o3n2 and n2, by using new direct abundancemeasurements. we pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of thesecalibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and thepresence of possible systematic offsets. this is possible thanks to theanalysis of the most ambitious compilation of te-based hii regions to date.this new dataset compiles the te-based abundances of 603 hii regions extractedfrom the literature but also includes new measurements from the califa survey.besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gasabundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrationswith a total of 3423 additional califa hii complexes with abundances derivedusing the ons calibration by pilyugin et al. (2010). the combined analysis ofte-based and ons abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibrationto date for both the o3n2 and n2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of allstatistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. inparticular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundancedependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of pettiniand pagel (2004), nagao et al.

1311.3941	the effects of spatial resolution on integral field spectrograph surveys  at different redshifts. the califa perspective	over the past decade, 3d optical spectroscopy has become the preferred toolfor understanding the properties of galaxies and is now increasingly used tocarry out galaxy surveys. low redshift surveys include sauron, diskmass,atlas3d, pings and venga. at redshifts above 0.7, surveys such as massiv, sins,glace, and images have targeted the most luminous galaxies to study mainlytheir kinematic properties. the on-going califa survey ($z\sim0.02$) is thefirst of a series of upcoming integral field spectroscopy (ifs) surveys withlarge samples representative of the entire population of galaxies. othersinclude sami and manga at lower redshift and the upcoming kmos surveys athigher redshift. given the importance of spatial scales in ifs surveys, thestudy of the effects of spatial resolution on the recovered parameters becomesimportant. we explore the capability of the califa survey and a hypotheticalhigher redshift survey to reproduce the properties of a sample of objectsobserved with better spatial resolution at lower redshift. using a sample ofpings galaxies, we simulate observations at different redshifts. we then studythe behaviour of different parameters as the spatial resolution degrades withincreasing redshift.

1311.7052	a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient in galaxy disks unveiled with  califa	we present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of hii regions andassociations compiled so far. the catalog comprises more than 7000 ionizedregions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the califa survey. we describethe procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic propertiesof these ionized regions. in the current study we focus on the characterizationof the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on thestudy of the deprojected distribution of hii regions. we found that allgalaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient inthe oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/rebetween 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with randomfluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the diskeffective radius. the slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,absolute magnitude or mass. only those galaxies with evidence of interactionsand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,consistent with previous results. the majority of the 94 galaxies with h iiregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in theoxygen abundance. the flattening is statistically significant. we cannotprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.however, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to thesecular evolution of galaxies. finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygenabundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. all of them arenon-interacting, mostly unbarred, sb/sbc galaxies. this feature is associatedwith a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features areproduced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

1405.7070	on the properties of the interstellar medium in extremely metal-poor  blue compact dwarf galaxies: gmos-ifu spectroscopy and sdss photometry of the  double-knot galaxy hs 2236+1344	the main goal of this study is to carry out a spatially resolvedinvestigation of the warm interstellar medium (ism) in the extremely metal-poorblue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy hs 2236+1344. special emphasis is laid on theanalysis of the spatial distribution of chemical abundances, emission-lineratios and kinematics of the ism, and to the recent star-forming activity inthis galaxy. this study is based on optical integral field unit spectroscopydata from gemini multi-object spectrograph at the gemini north telescope andarchival sloan digital sky survey images. the data were obtained in twodifferent positions across the galaxy, obtaining a total 4 arcsec x 8 arcsecfield which encompasses most of its ism. emission-line maps and broad-bandimages obtained in this study indicate that hs 2236+1344 hosts three giant hiiregions. our data also reveal some faint curved features in the bcd peripherythat might be due to tidal perturbations or expanding ionized-gas shells. theism velocity field shows systematic gradients along the major axis of the bcd,with its south-eastern and north-western half differing by ~80 km/s in theirrecessional velocity. the ha and hb equivalent width distribution in thecentral part of hs 2236+1344 is consistent with a very young (~3 myr) burst.our surface photometry analysis indicates that the ongoing starburst provides~50% of the total optical emission, similar to other bcds. it also reveals anunderlying lower-surface brightness component with moderately red colors, whichsuggest that the galaxy has undergone previous star formation. we derive anintegrated oxygen abundance of 12+log(o/h)=7.53\pm0.06 and a nitrogen-to-oxygenratio of log(n/o)=-1.57\pm0.19. our results are consistent, within theuncertainties, with a homogeneous distribution of oxygen and nitrogen withinthe ism of the galaxy.

1407.0002	stellar population gradients in galaxy discs from the califa survey	while studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common,very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients inthe same regions. we present here a comparative study of the stellarmetallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiralgalaxies with and without bars, using data from the califa survey. we measurethe slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties ofthe galaxies. we find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients inthe disc are shallow and negative. furthermore, when normalized to theeffective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradientsdoes not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of thegalaxies. contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\sim$2.5scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similarmanner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average,older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. one of the goals of thepresent paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear couplingbetween the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producingradial migrations across significant distances within discs. the process ofradial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and,therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barredgalaxies. however, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or agegradients in galaxies with without bars. we discuss possible scenarios that canlead to this absence of difference.

1408.5765	ionized gas kinematics of galaxies in the califa survey i: velocity  fields, kinematic parameters of the dominant component, and presence of  kinematically distinct gaseous systems	this work provides an overall characterization of the kinematic behavior ofthe ionized gas of the galaxies included in the calar alto legacy integralfield area (califa), offering kinematic clues to potential users of this surveyfor including kinematical criteria for specific studies. from the first 200galaxies observed by califa, we present the 2d kinematic view of the 177galaxies satisfying a gas detection threshold. after removing the stellarcontribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radialvelocity of the dominant gaseous component. the main kinematic parameters weredirectly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internalmotions. evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with differentkinematics were detected by using [oiii] profiles. most objects in the sampleshow regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarelyconsistent with simple coplanar circular motions. 35% of the objects presentevidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers largerthan the original spaxel radii. only 17% of the objects in the sample exhibitkinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of thevelocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclearactivity. early-type galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematicmisaligments. there is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profilessuggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components atdifferent distances from the nucleus. this work constitutes the firstdetermination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in thecalifa survey. the derived velocity fields, the reported kinematicpeculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseouscomponents might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies forspecific studies.

1509.00180	localized starbursts in dwarf galaxies produced by impact of low  metallicity cosmic gas clouds	models of galaxy formation predict that gas accretion from the cosmic web isa primary driver of star formation over cosmic history. except in very denseenvironments where galaxy mergers are also important, model galaxies feed fromcold streams of gas from the web that penetrate their dark matter haloes.although these predictions are unambiguous, the observational support has beenindirect so far. here we report spectroscopic evidence for this process inextremely metal-poor galaxies (xmps) of the local universe, taking the form oflocalized starbursts associated with gas having low metallicity. detailedabundance analyses based on gran telescopio canarias (gtc) optical spectra often xmps show that the galaxy hosts have metallicities around 60 % solar onaverage, while the large star-forming regions that dominate their integratedlight have low metallicities of some 6 % solar. because gas mixes azimuthallyin a rotation timescale (a few hundred myr), the observed metallicityinhomogeneities are only possible if the metal-poor gas fell onto the diskrecently. we analyze several possibilities for the origin of the metal-poorgas, favoring the metal-poor gas infall predicted by numerical models. if thisinterpretation is correct, xmps trace the cosmic web gas in their surroundings,making them probes to examine its properties.

1511.01300	spectroscopic aperture biases in inside-out evolving early-type galaxies  from califa	integral field spectroscopy studies based on califa data have recentlyrevealed the presence of ongoing low-level star formation (sf) in the peripheryof ~10% of local early-type galaxies (etgs), witnessing a still ongoinginside-out galaxy growth process. a distinctive property of the nebularcomponent in these etgs, classified i+, is a two-radial-zone structure, withthe inner zone displaying liner emission with a h\alpha equivalent widthew~1{\aa}, and the outer one (3{\aa}&lt;ew&lt;~20{\aa}) showing hii-regioncharacteristics. using califa ifs data, we empirically demonstrate that theconfinement of nebular emission to the galaxy periphery leads to a strongaperture (or, redshift) bias in spectroscopic single-fiber studies of type i+etgs: at low redshift (&lt;~0.45), sdss spectroscopy is restricted to the inner(sf-devoid liner) zone, thereby leading to their erroneous classification as"retired" galaxies (systems lacking sf and whose faint emission is powered bypagb stars). only at higher z's the sdss aperture can encompass the outer sfzone, permitting their unbiased classification as "composite sf/liner". we alsodemonstrate that the principal effect of a decreasing aperture on theclassification of i+ etgs via standard bpt emission-line ratios consists in amonotonic up-right shift precisely along the upper-right wing of the "seagull"distribution. motivated by these insights, we also investigate theoreticallythese biases in aperture-limited studies of inside-out growing galaxies as afunction of z. to this end, we devise a simple model, which involves anoutwardly propagating sf process, that reproduces the radial extent andtwo-zone ew distribution of i+ etgs. by simulating on this model thespectroscopic sdss aperture, we find that sdss studies at z&lt;~1 areprogressively restricted to the inner liner-zone, and miss an increasinglylarge portion of the h\alpha-emitting periphery.

(2013) we argue that etgsspan a broad continuous sequence with regard to the properties of their wim,and they can be roughly subdivided into two characteristic classes. the firstone (type i) comprises etgs with a nearly constant ew~1-3 {\aa} in theirextranuclear component, in quantitative agreement with (even though, no prooffor) the hypothesis of photoionization by pagb stars. the second class (typeii) consists of virtually wim-evacuated etgs with a large lyman continuum (lyc)photon escape fraction and a very low (&lt;= 0.5 {\aa}) ew in their nuclear zone.these two classes appear indistinguishable from one another by theirliner-specific emission-line ratios. additionally, here we extend theclassification by the class i+ which stands for a subset of type i etgs withlow-level star-fomation in contiguous spiral-arm like features in theiroutermost periphery. these faint features, together with traces of localizedstar formation in several type i&amp;i+ systems point to a non-negligiblecontribution from young massive stars to the global ionizing photon budget inetgs.

"cometary" blue compact dwarf galaxies (ii,c bcds) are characterized byoff-center starbursts close to the end of an elongated dwarf irregular(di)-like host galaxy. this may either represent randomly enhanced star-formingactivity of a di, or may be caused by a set of special properties of suchsystems or their environment. for a first investigation of this issue, weanalyse the nearby ii,c bcds markarian 59 and markarian 71. using deepground-based spectrophotometric data and hst images, we derive physicalproperties, structure and ages of the starburst regions and the underlyingstellar host galaxies. the metallicities show small scatter in the vicinity ofthe star-forming regions and along the major axis of mrk 59 which suggestseffective mixing of heavy elements on kpc scales. the surface brightnessprofiles of the underlying host galaxies in either ii,c bcd show an exponentialdecay with a central surface brightness and scale length that are intermediatebetween typical ie/ne bcds and dis. spectral population synthesis models incombination with colour magnitude diagrams and colour profiles yield mostlikely formation ages of ~2 gyr for the host galaxies in both ii,c bcds, withupper limits of ~4 gyr for mrk 59 and ~3 gyr for mrk 71, i.e. significantlylower than the typical age of several gyr derived for the host galaxies ofie/ne bcds. these findings raise the question whether ii,c systems form adistinct class within bcds with respect to the age and structure of theirhosts, or whether they represent an evolutionary stage connecting young i0 bcdsand "classical" ie/ne bcds. properties of analogous objects studied in thelocal universe and at medium redshifts provide some support for thisevolutionary hypothesis.

astro-ph;0207314	the blue compact dwarf galaxy i zw 18: a comparative study of its  low-surface-brightness component	(abridged): using hst and ground-based optical and nir imaging data, weinvestigate whether the blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy i zw 18 possesses anextended low-surface-brightness (lsb) old stellar population underlying itsstar-forming (sf) regions. we show that the exponential intensity decreaseobserved in the filamentary lsb envelope of the bcd out to 18 arcsec (1.3 kpcat a distance of 15 mpc) is not due to an evolved stellar disc, but rather dueto extended ionized gas emission. broad-band images reveal, after subtractionof nebular line emission, a compact stellar lsb component extending slightlybeyond the sf regions. this stellar host, being blue over a radius range of 5exponential scale lengths and showing little colour contrast to the sfcomponent, differs strikingly from the red lsb host of standard bcds. thisfact, in connection with the blue colors of component i zw 18 c, suggests thatmost of the stellar mass in i zw 18 has formed within the last 0.5 gyr.furthermore, we show that the exponential intensity fall-off in the filamentaryionized envelope of i zw 18 is not particular to this system but a commonproperty of the ionized halo of many sf dwarf galaxies on galactocentricdistances of several kpc. in the absence of an appreciable underlying stellarbackground, extended ionized gas emission dominates in the periphery of i zw18, mimicking an exponential stellar disc on optical surface brightnessprofiles.

astro-ph;9808146	x-ray observations of the interacting system arp 284	we discuss the x-ray properties of the interacting system arp 284, consistingof the active nuclear starburst galaxy ngc 7714 and its post-starburstcompanion ngc 7715. a morphological signature of the interaction, thought tohave started &lt;100 myr ago, is an asymmetric stellar ring dominating theintensity profile of ngc 7714 in the inner disk (~ 2 exponential scalelengths). in agreement to previous einstein-data our rosat pspc exposure showsthe x-ray emission of arp 284 to be confined to ngc 7714. the bulk of theintrinsic x-ray luminosity in the rosat 0.1--2.4 kev band can be accounted forby thermal emission from hot (~5x10**6 k) gas and amounts to ~2-4 x 10**41erg/sec. follow-up observations with the rosat hri revealed two distinctextended emitting regions contributing to the x-ray luminosity in ngc 7714. themore luminous of them (l_x &lt; 2 x 10*41 erg/sec) coincides with the centralstarburst nucleus and can be explained this way. the fainter one (l_x~ 8x10**40erg/sec) is located ~20 arcsec off-center and does not have any conspicuousoptical counterpart. it is, likely, located at the borderline between thestellar ring and a massive (&gt;10**9 m(solar)) hi-bridge further to the eastpossibly intersecting ngc 7714. the hi and x-ray morphology and the extensivestarburst nature of the nuclear energy source suggest different scenarios forthe formation of the eastern emission spot. the possibilities of (i)collisional heating of the outlying gas by a starburst-driven nuclear wind and(ii) infall of hi-clouds from the bridge onto the disk of ngc 7714 arediscussed.

astro-ph;9907082	is i zw 18 a young galaxy?	hubble space telescope (hst) colour - magnitude diagrams in b, v and r alongwith long-slit multiple mirror telescope (mmt) spectrophotometric data are usedto investigate the evolutionary status of the nearby blue compact dwarf (bcd)galaxy i zw 18. we find that the distance to i zw 18 should be as high as 20mpc, twice the previously accepted distance, to be consistent with existingobservational data on the galaxy: colour-magnitude diagrams, the highionization state of the gas and presence of wr stars in the main body, and theionization state of the c component. the spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe main body of i zw 18 is consistent with that of a stellar population withage &lt; 5 myr. however, the presence of large-scale shells observed around themain body suggests that star formation began ~ 20 myr at the nw end andpropagated in the se direction. our analysis of colour-magnitude diagrams andof the spectral energy distribution of the c component implies that starformation in this component started &lt; 100 myr ago at the nw end, propagated tothe se and stopped ~ 15 myr ago. thus, i zw 18 is likely to be one of theyoungest nearby extragalactic objects.
