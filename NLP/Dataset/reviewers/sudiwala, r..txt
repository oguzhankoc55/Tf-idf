1004.2595	planck pre-launch status: high frequency instrument polarization  calibration	the high frequency instrument of planck will map the entire sky in themillimeter and sub-millimeter domain from 100 to 857 ghz with unprecedentedsensitivity to polarization ($\delta p/t_{\tiny cmb} \sim 4\cdot 10^{-6}$) at100, 143, 217 and 353 ghz. it will lead to major improvements in ourunderstanding of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and polarizedforeground signals. planck will make high resolution measurements of the$e$-mode spectrum (up to $\ell \sim 1500$) and will also play a prominent rolein the search for the faint imprint of primordial gravitational waves on thecmb polarization. this paper addresses the effects of calibration of bothtemperature (gain) and polarization (polarization efficiency and detectororientation) on polarization measurements. the specific requirements on thepolarization parameters of the instrument are set and we report on theirpre-flight measurement on hfi bolometers. we present a semi-analytical methodthat exactly accounts for the scanning strategy of the instrument as well asthe combination of different detectors. we use this method to propagate errorsthrough to the cmb angular power spectra in the particular case of planck-hfi,and to derive constraints on polarization parameters. we show that in order tolimit the systematic error to 10% of the cosmic variance of the $e$-mode powerspectrum, uncertainties in gain, polarization efficiency and detectororientation must be below 0.15%, 0.3% and 1\deg\ respectively. pre-launchground measurements reported in this paper already fulfill these requirements.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2035	planck early results: the galactic cold core population revealed by the  first all-sky survey	we present the statistical properties of the first version of the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po), in terms of their spatial distribution,temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. we also describe the statistics ofthe early cold core catalogue (ecc, delivered with the early release compactsource catalogue, ercsc) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detectionsof the complete catalogue. we have used the cococodet algorithm to extract10783 cold sources. temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} valuesare derived using the fluxes in the iras 100 \mum band and the three highestfrequency planck bands. temperature spans from 7k to 17k, and peaks around 13k.data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the alltemperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(t) and theeffect of multiple t components folded into the measurements. for one third ofthe objects the distances are obtained. most of the detections are within 2 kpcin the solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. thecores are distributed from the deep galactic plane, despite the confusion, tohigh latitudes (&gt;30$^{\circle}$). the associated mass estimates range from 1 to$10^5$ solar masses. using their physical properties these cold sources areshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structuresbetween clouds and cores. these cold clumps are not isolated but mostlyorganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue ofcold objects. it gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties ofthese potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for theirclassification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2039	planck early results: first assessment of the high frequency instrument  in-flight performance	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) is designed to measure thetemperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgroundand galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545and 857 ghz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 ghz), 7' (143 ghz), and 5'(217 ghz and higher). hfi has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 may2009. the bolometers cooled to 100 mk as planned. the settings of the readoutelectronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize hfi's noiseperformance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during groundtesting. observations of mars, jupiter, and saturn verified both the opticalsystem and the time response of the detection chains. the optical beams areclose to predictions from physical optics modeling. the time response of thedetection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. the detectors suffer froman unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. due tothe redundancy of planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percentof data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.the cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation onperiods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of allbolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. only thehigh energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is aprobable source of low frequency noise.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1301.3650	scuba-2: the 10000 pixel bolometer camera on the james clerk maxwell  telescope	scuba-2 is an innovative 10000 pixel bolometer camera operating atsubmillimetre wavelengths on the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). thecamera has the capability to carry out wide-field surveys to unprecedenteddepths, addressing key questions relating to the origins of galaxies, stars andplanets. with two imaging arrays working simultaneously in the atmosphericwindows at 450 and 850 microns, the vast increase in pixel count means thatscuba-2 maps the sky 100-150 times faster than the previous scuba instrument.in this paper we present an overview of the instrument, discuss the physicalcharacteristics of the superconducting detector arrays, outline the observingmodes and data acquisition, and present the early performance figures on thetelescope. we also showcase the capabilities of the instrument via some earlyexamples of the science scuba-2 has already undertaken. in february 2012,scuba-2 began a series of unique legacy surveys for the jcmt community. thesesurveys will take 2.5 years and the results are already providing complementarydata to the shorter wavelength, shallower, larger-area surveys from herschel.the scuba-2 surveys will also provide a wealth of information for further studywith new facilities such as alma, and future telescopes such as ccat and spica.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1403.5639	characterization and physical explanation of energetic particles on  planck hfi instrument	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) has been surveying the skycontinuously from the second lagrangian point (l2) between august 2009 andjanuary 2012. it operates with 52 high impedance bolometers cooled at 100mk ina range of frequency between 100 ghz and 1thz with unprecedented sensivity, butstrong coupling with cosmic radiation. at l2, the particle flux is about 5$cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ and is dominated by protons incident on the spacecraft.protons with an energy above 40mev can penetrate the focal plane unit boxcausing two different effects: glitches in the raw data from direct interactionof cosmic rays with detectors (producing a data loss of about 15% at the end ofthe mission) and thermal drifts in the bolometer plate at 100mk addingnon-gaussian noise at frequencies below 0.1hz. the hfi consortium has madestrong efforts in order to correct for this effect on the time ordered data andfinal planck maps. this work intends to give a view of the physical explanationof the glitches observed in the hfi instrument in-flight. to reach this goal,we performed several ground-based experiments using protons and $\alpha$particles to test the impact of particles on the hfi spare bolometers with abetter control of the environmental conditions with respect to the in-flightdata. we have shown that the dominant part of glitches observed in the datacomes from the impact of cosmic rays in the silicon die frame supporting themicro-machinced bolometric detectors propagating energy mainly by ballisticphonons and by thermal diffusion. the implications of these results for futuresatellite missions will be discussed.

1403.6592	impact of particles on the planck hfi detectors: ground-based  measurements and physical interpretation	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) surveyed the sky continuously fromaugust 2009 to january 2012. its noise and sensitivity performance wereexcellent, but the rate of cosmic ray impacts on the hfi detectors wasunexpectedly high. furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal planeproduced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range ofcharacteristics. a study of cosmic ray impacts on the hfi detector modules hasbeen undertaken to categorize and characterize the glitches, to correct the hfitime-ordered data, and understand the residual effects on planck maps and dataproducts. this paper presents an evaluation of the physical origins of glitchesobserved by the hfi detectors. in order to better understand the glitchesobserved by hfi in flight, several ground-based experiments were conducted withflight-spare hfi bolometer modules. the experiments were conducted between 2010and 2013 with hfi test bolometers in different configurations using varyingparticles and impact energies. the bolometer modules were exposed to 23 mevprotons from the orsay ipn tandem accelerator, and to $^{241}$am and $^{244}$cm$\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$fe radioactive x-ray sources. the calibration datafrom the hfi ground-based preflight tests were used to further characterize theglitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations underlaboratory conditions. test results provide strong evidence that the dominantfamily of glitches observed in flight are due to cosmic ray absorption by thesilicon die substrate on which the hfi detectors reside. glitch energy ispropagated to the thermistor by ballistic phonons, while there is also athermal diffusion contribution. the implications of these results for futuresatellite missions, especially those in the far-infrared to sub-millimetre andmillimetre regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, are discussed.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1406.7482	planck intermediate results. xxiv. constraints on variation of  fundamental constants	any variation of the fundamental physical constants, and more particularly ofthe fine structure constant, $\alpha$, or of the mass of the electron, $m_e$,would affect the recombination history of the universe and cause an imprint onthe cosmic microwave background angular power spectra. we show that the planckdata allow one to improve the constraint on the time variation of the finestructure constant at redshift $z\sim 10^3$ by about a factor of 5 compared towmap data, as well as to break the degeneracy with the hubble constant, $h_0$.in addition to $\alpha$, we can set a constraint on the variation of the massof the electron, $m_{\rm e}$, and on the simultaneous variation of the twoconstants. we examine in detail the degeneracies between fundamental constantsand the cosmological parameters, in order to compare the limits obtained fromplanck and wmap and to determine the constraining power gained by includingother cosmological probes. we conclude that independent time variations of thefine structure constant and of the mass of the electron are constrained byplanck to ${\delta\alpha}/{\alpha}= (3.6\pm 3.7)\times10^{-3}$ and ${\deltam_{\rm e}}/{m_{\rm e}}= (4 \pm 11)\times10^{-3}$ at the 68% confidence level.we also investigate the possibility of a spatial variation of the finestructure constant. the relative amplitude of a dipolar spatial variation of$\alpha$ (corresponding to a gradient across our hubble volume) is constrainedto be $\delta\alpha/\alpha=(-2.4\pm 3.7)\times 10^{-2}$.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01586	planck 2015 results. vii. hfi toi and beam processing	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) has observed the full sky at sixfrequencies (100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 ghz) in intensity and at fourfrequencies in linear polarization (100, 143, 217, and 353 ghz). in order toobtain sky maps, the time-ordered information (toi) containing the detector andpointing samples must be processed and the angular response must be assessed.the full mission toi is included in the planck 2015 release. this paperdescribes the hfi toi and beam processing for the 2015 release. hfi calibrationand map-making are described in a companion paper. the main pipeline has beenmodified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), byincluding a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and byimproving the model of the bolometer time response. the beam processing is anessential tool that derives the angular response used in all the planck sciencepapers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window functionuncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. noisecorrelations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed usingdedicated simulations. angular cross-power spectra using datasets that aredecorrelated in time are immune to the main systematic effects.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1504.03339	planck intermediate results. xxxvii. evidence of unbound gas from the  kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect	by looking at the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz) in planck nominalmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating inlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (cgs) at redshift $z\approx0.1$. we estimate the pairwise momentum of the ksz temperature fluctuations atthe positions of the cgc (central galaxy catalogue) samples extracted fromsloan digital sky survey (dr7) data. for the foreground-cleaned maps, we find$1.8$-$2.5\sigma$ detections of the ksz signal, which are consistent with theksz evidence found in individual planck raw frequency maps, although lower thanfound in the wmap-9yr w band ($3.3\sigma$). we further reconstruct the peculiarvelocity field from the cg density field, and compute for the first time thecross-correlation function between ksz temperature fluctuations and estimatesof cg radial peculiar velocities. this correlation function yields a$3.0$-$3.7$$\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on mpcscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ mpc. both thepairwise momentum estimates and ksz temperature-velocity field correlation findevidence for ksz signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,corresponding to a physical radius of $&gt; 1$ mpc, more than twice the meanvirial radius of halos. this is consistent with the predictions from hydrosimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. we fit asimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation isproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon n-bodysimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an "effective"optical depth to thomson scattering. we find $\tau_t=(1.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of thegas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to x-ray or thermalsz observations.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

0805.3690	detecting the b-mode polarisation of the cmb with clover	we describe the objectives, design and predicted performance of clover, whichis a ground-based experiment to measure the faint ``b-mode'' polarisationpattern in the cosmic microwave background (cmb). to achieve this goal, cloverwill make polarimetric observations of approximately 1000 deg^2 of the sky inspectral bands centred on 97, 150 and 225 ghz. the observations will be madewith a two-mirror compact range antenna fed by profiled corrugated horns. thetelescope beam sizes for each band are 7.5, 5.5 and 5.5 arcmin, respectively.the polarisation of the sky will be measured with a rotating half-wave plateand stationary analyser, which will be an orthomode transducer. the skycoverage combined with the angular resolution will allow us to measure theangular power spectra between 20 &lt; l &lt; 1000. each frequency band will employ192 single polarisation, photon noise limited tes bolometers cooled to 100 mk.the background-limited sensitivity of these detector arrays will allow us toconstrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to 0.026 at 3sigma, assuming any polarisedforeground signals can be subtracted with minimal degradation to the 150 ghzsensitivity. systematic errors will be mitigated by modulating the polarisationof the sky signals with the rotating half-wave plate, fast azimuth scans andperiodic telescope rotations about its boresight. the three spectral bands willbe divided into two separate but nearly identical instruments - one for 97 ghzand another for 150 and 225 ghz. the two instruments will be sited on identicalthree-axis mounts in the atacama desert in chile near pampa la bola.observations are expected to begin in late 2009.

1508.03375	planck 2013 results. xxxi. consistency of the planck data	the planck design and scanning strategy provide many levels of redundancythat can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. one of the mostimportant is the comparison of the 70ghz and 100ghz channels. based ondifferent instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focalplane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, andnear the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effecttwo different experiments. the 143ghz channel has the lowest noise level onplanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. in thispaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 planck data. weconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143ghz channel maps and powerspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acousticpeaks, on maps masked for diffuse galactic emission and for strong unresolvedsources. difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin areconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave backgroundstructure. including small but important corrections for unresolved-sourceresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100ghz power spectraaveraged over 70&lt;l&lt;390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100ghzpower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. these values are within andconsistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the planck2013 results. we also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysisshowing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217ghz power spectra. weanalyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of thesedifferences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematic errorsthat could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertaintiesstill further. several possible small improvements are described...(abridged)

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0509674	first ground-based 200-um observing with thumper on jcmt - sky  characterisation and planet maps	we present observations that were carried out with the two hundred micronphotometer (thumper) mounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) inhawaii, at a wavelength of 200 um (frequency 1.5 thz). the observations utilisea small atmospheric window that opens up at this wavelength under very dryconditions at high-altitude observing sites. the atmosphere was calibratedusing the sky-dipping method and a relation was established between the opticaldepth, tau, at 1.5 thz and that at 225 ghz: tau_1.5thz = (95 +/-10)*tau_225ghz. mars and jupiter were mapped from the ground at this wavelengthfor the first time, and the system characteristics measured. a noise equivalentflux density (nefd) of ~65 +/- 10 jy (1 sigma 1 second) was measured for thethumper-jcmt combination, consistent with predictions based upon our laboratorymeasurements. the main-beam resolution of 14 arcsec was confirmed and anextended error-beam detected at roughly two-thirds of the magnitude of the mainbeam. measurements of the sun allow us to estimate that the fraction of thepower in the main beam is ~15%, consistent with predictions based on modellingthe dish surface accuracy. it is therefore shown that the sky over mauna kea issuitable for astronomy at this wavelength under the best conditions. however,higher or drier sites should have a larger number of useable nights per year.
