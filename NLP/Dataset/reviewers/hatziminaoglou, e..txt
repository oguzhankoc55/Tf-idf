0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0904.3825	a deep xmm-newton serendipitous survey of a middle-latitude area. ii.  new deeper x-ray and optical observations	the radio-quiet neutron star 1e1207.4-5209 has been the target of severalxmm-newton observations, with a total exposure of ~350 ks. the source islocated at intermediate galactic latitude (b~10 degrees), i.e. in a sky regionwith an extremely interesting mix of both galactic and extra-galactic x-raysources. the aim of our work is to investigate the properties of both theintermediate-latitude galactic and extra-galactic x-ray source populations inthe 1e1207.4-5209 field. we performed a coherent analysis of the wholexmm-newton observation data set to build a catalogue of serendipitous x-raysources detected with high confidence and to derive information on the sourceflux, spectra, and time variability. in addition, we performed a completemulti-band (ubvri) optical coverage of the field with the wide field imager(wfi) of the eso/mpg 2.2m telescope (la silla) to search for candidate opticalcounterparts to the x-ray sources, down to a v-band limiting magnitude of~24.5. we detected a total of 144 serendipitous x-ray sources. thanks to therefined x-ray positions and to the wfi observations, we found candidate opticalcounterparts for most of the x-ray sources in our compilation. for most of thebrightest ones we proposed a likely classification based on both the x-rayspectra and the optical colours. our results indicate that at intermediategalactic latitude the x-ray source population is dominated by theextra-galactic component, but with a significant contribution from the galacticcomponent in the soft energy band, below 2 kev.

0905.2518	resolved dust emission in a quasar at z=3.65	we present submillimetre observations of the z=3.653 quasar sdss160705+533558together with data in the optical and infrared. the object is unusually brightin the far-ir and submm with an ir luminosity of ~10^14 l_sun. we ascribe thisluminosity to a combination of agn and starburst emission, with the starburstforming stars at a rate of a few thousand solar masses per year. submillimetrearray (sma) imaging observations with a resolution ~1" show that the submm (850micron) emission is extended on scales of 10--35kpc and is offset from theoptical position by ~10 kpc. this morphology is dissimilar to that found insubmm galaxies, which are generally un- or marginally resolved on arcsecondscales, or submm-luminous agn where the agn lies at the peak of the submm ormolecular emission. the simplest explanation is that the object is in the earlystages of a merger between a gas rich galaxy, which hosts the starburst, and agas-poor agn-host galaxy, which is responsible for the quasar emission. it isalso possible that jet induced star formation might contribute to the unusualmorphology.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1001.5419	the environments of z~1 active galactic nuclei at 3.6um	we present an analysis of a large sample of agn environments at z~1 usingstacked spitzer data at 3.6um. the sample contains type-1 and type-2 agn in theform of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical andradio luminosity. we find, on average, that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containinga substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of theagn, constituting a &gt;8-sigma excess relative to the field. secondly, we findevidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radioluminosity of agn, but not with black-hole mass. this is shown first bydividing the agn into their classical agn types, where we see more significantover-densities in the fields of the radio-loud agn. if instead we dispense withthe classical agn definitions, we find that the source over-density as afunction of radio luminosity for all our agn exhibits a positive correlation.one interpretation of this result is that the mpc-scale environment is in someway influencing the radio emission that we observe from agn. this could beexplained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading toenhanced radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapidblack-hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1202.4577	the starburst-agn connection in the merger galaxy mrk 938: an infrared  and x-ray view	mrk938 is a luminous infrared galaxy in the local universe believed to be theremnant of a galaxy merger. it shows a seyfert 2 nucleus and intense starformation according to optical spectroscopic observations. we have studied thisgalaxy using new herschel far-ir imaging data in addition to archival x-ray,uv, optical, near-ir and mid-ir data. mid- and far-ir data are crucial tocharacterise the starburst contribution, allowing us to shed new light on itsnature and to study the coexistence of agn and starburst activity in the localuniverse. the decomposition of the mid-ir spitzer spectrum shows that the agnbolometric contribution to the mid-ir and total infrared luminosity is small(lbol(agn)/lir~0.02), which agrees with previous estimations. we havecharacterised the physical nature of its strong infrared emission andconstrained it to a relatively compact emitting region of &lt;2kpc. it is in thisobscured region where most of the current star formation activity is takingplace as expected for lirgs. we have used herschel imaging data for the firsttime to constrain the cold dust emission with unprecedented accuracy. we havefitted the integrated far-ir spectral energy distribution and derived theproperties of the dust, obtaining a dust mass of 3x10^7msun. the far-ir isdominated by emission at 35k, consistent with dust heated by the on-going starformation activity.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.2108	probing the nuclear and circumnuclear activity of ngc1365 in the  infrared	we present new far-infrared (70-500micron) herschel pacs and spire imagingobservations as well as new mid-ir gemini/t-recs imaging (8.7 and 18.3micron)and spectroscopy of the inner lindblad resonance (ilr) region (r&lt;2.5kpc) of thespiral galaxy ngc1365. we complemented these observations with archival spitzerimaging and spectral mapping observations. the ilr region of ngc1365 contains aseyfert 1.5 nucleus and a ring of star formation with an approximate diameterof 2kpc. the strong star formation activity in the ring is resolved by theherschel/pacs imaging data, as well as by the spitzer 24micron continuumemission, [neii]12.81micron line emission, and 6.2 and 11.3micron pah emission.the agn is the brightest source in the central regions up to lambda~24micron,but it becomes increasingly fainter in the far-infrared when compared to theemission originating in the infrared clusters (or groups of them) located inthe ring. we modeled the agn unresolved infrared emission with the clumpy torusmodels and estimated that the agn contributes only to a small fraction (~5%) ofthe infrared emission produced in the inner ~5kpc. we fitted the non-agn24-500micron spectral energy distribution of the ilr region and found that thedust temperatures and mass are similar to those of other nuclear andcircumnuclear starburst regions. finally we showed that within the ilr regionof ngc1365 most of the on-going star formation activity is taking place industy regions as probed by the 24micron emission.

1207.2668	smooth and clumpy dust distribution in agn: a direct comparison of two  commonly explored infrared emission models	the geometry of the dust distribution within the inner regions of activegalactic nuclei (agn) is still a debated issue and relates directly with theagn unified scheme. traditionally, models discussed in the literature assumeone of two distinct dust distributions in what is believed to be a toroidalregion around the supermassive black holes: a continuous distribution,customarily referred to as smooth, and a concentration of dust in clumps orclouds, referred to as clumpy.  in this paper we perform a thorough comparison between two of the mostpopular models in the literature, namely the smooth models by fritz. et al.2006 and the clumpy models by nenkova et al. 2008a, in their common parametersspace. particular attention is paid to the silicate features at ~9.7 and ~18micron, the width of the infrared bump, the near-infrared index and theluminosity at 12.3 micron, all previously reported as possible diagnostic toolsto distinguish between the two dust distributions. we find that, due to thedifferent dust chemical compositions used in the two models, the behaviour ofthe silicate features at 9.7 and 18 micron is quite distinct between the twomodels. the width of the infrared bump and the peak of the infrared emissioncan take comparable values, their distributions do, however, vary. thenear-infrared index is also quite different, due partly to the primary sourcesadopted by the two models. models with matched parameters do not producesimilar seds and virtually no random parameter combinations can result inseemingly identical seds.

1301.4496	panchromatic spectral energy distributions of herschel sources	(abridged) far-infrared herschel photometry from the pep and hermes programsis combined with ancillary datasets in the goods-n, goods-s, and cosmos fields.based on this rich dataset, we reproduce the restframe uv to fir ten-colorsdistribution of galaxies using a superposition of multi-variate gaussian modes.the median sed of each mode is then fitted with a modified version of themagphys code that combines stellar light, emission from dust heated by starsand a possible warm dust contribution heated by an agn. the defined gaussiangrouping is also used to identify rare sources. the zoology of outliersincludes herschel-detected ellipticals, very blue z~1 ly-break galaxies,quiescent spirals, and torus-dominated agn with star formation. out of thesegroups and outliers, a new template library is assembled, consisting of 32 sedsdescribing the intrinsic scatter in the restframe uv-to-submm colors ofinfrared galaxies. this library is tested against l(ir) estimates with andwithout herschel data included, and compared to eight other popular methodsoften adopted in the literature. when implementing herschel photometry, theseapproaches produce l(ir) values consistent with each other within a medianabsolute deviation of 10-20%, the scatter being dominated more by fine tuningof the codes, rather than by the choice of sed templates. finally, the libraryis used to classify 24 micron detected sources in pep goods fields. agn appearto be distributed in the stellar mass (m*) vs. star formation rate (sfr) spacealong with all other galaxies, regardless of the amount of infrared luminositythey are powering, with the tendency to lie on the high sfr side of the "mainsequence". the incidence of warmer star-forming sources grows for objects withhigher specific star formation rates (ssfr), and they tend to populate the"off-sequence" region of the m*-sfr-z space.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1507.07044	hermes: disentangling active galactic nuclei and star formation in the  radio source population	we separate the extragalactic radio source population above ~50 ujy intoactive galactic nuclei (agn) and star-forming sources. the primary method ofour approach is to fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (seds),constructed using spitzer/irac and mips and herschel/spire photometry, of 380radio sources in the extended chandra deep field-south. from the fitted seds,we determine the relative agn and star-forming contributions to their infraredemission. with the inclusion of other agn diagnostics such as x-ray luminosity,spitzer/irac colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming totalinfrared flux to k-corrected 1.4 ghz flux density, qir, we determine whetherthe radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an agn.the majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an agnat some wavelength. of the sources with agn signatures, 58 per cent are hybridsystems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. thisimplies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their starformation have a high agn fraction. below a 1.4 ghz flux density of 1 mjy,along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from purestar-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20-65 per cent ofthe sources. this result suggests that hybrid sources have a significantcontribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable agn, to theobserved flattening of the source counts at ~1mjy for the extragalactic radiosource population.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0001538	quasar candidate multicolor selection technique: a different approach	we present a quasar candidate identification technique based on multicolorphotometry. the traditional multi-dimensional method (2 $\times$ n dimensions,where n is the number of the color-color diagrams) is reduced to aone-dimensional technique, which consists in a standard fitting procedure,where the observed spectral energy distributions are compared to quasarsimulated spectra and stellar templates. this new multicolor approach isfirstly applied to simulated catalogues and its {\it efficiency} is examined invarious redshift ranges, as a function of the filter combination and theavailable observing time for spectroscopy. we conclude that this method isbetter suited than the usual multicolor selection techniques to quasaridentification, especially for high-redshift quasars. the application of themethod to real quasar samples found in the literature results in an {\itefficiency} comparable to the one obtained from the use of color-colordiagrams. the major advantage of the new method is the estimation of the {\itphotometric} redshift of quasar candidates, enabling, in almost all cases,spectroscopy to be targeted to best suited wavelength ranges.

astro-ph;0009105	accretion disk instabilities, cdm models and their role in quasar  evolution	we have developed a consistent analytical model to describe the observedevolution of the quasar luminosity function. our model combines black hole massdistributions based on the press - schechter theory of the structure formationin the universe with quasar luminosity functions resulting from a physics-basedemission model that takes into account the time-dependent phenomena occurringin the accretion disks. quasar evolution and cdm models are mutuallyconstraining, therefore our model gives an estimation of the exponent, n, ofthe power spectrum, p(k), which is found to be -1.8 &lt; n &lt; -1.6. we were able toreject a generally assumed hypothesis of a constant ratio between dark matterhalo and the black hole mass, since the observed data could not be fitted underthis assumption. we found that the relation between the dark matter halos andblack hole masses is better described by m_{bh}=m_{dmh}^{0.668}. this modelprovides a reasonable fit to the observed quasar luminosity function atredshifts higher than ~2.0. we suggest that the disagreement at lower redshiftis due to mergers. based on the agreement at high redshift, we estimated themerger rate at lower redshift, and argue that this rate should depend on theredshift, like (1+z)^3.

astro-ph;0201028	eso imaging survey. exploring the optical/infrared imaging data of  cdf-s: point sources	this paper describes the methodology currently being implemented in the eispipeline for analysing optical/infrared multi-colour data. the aim is toidentify different classes of objects as well as possible undesirable featuresassociated with the construction of colour catalogues. the classificationmethod used is based on the xi^2-fitting of template spectra to the observedseds, as measured through broad-band filters. its main advantage is thesimultaneous use of all colours, properly weighted by the photometric errors.in addition, it provides basic information on the properties of the classifiedobjects (eg redshift, effective temperature). these characteristics make thexi^2-technique ideal for handling large multi-band datasets. the results arecompared to the more traditional colour-colour selection and, wheneverpossible, to model predictions. in order to identify objects with odd colours,either associated with rare populations or to possible problems in thecatalogue, outliers are searched for in the multi-dimensional colour spaceusing a nearest-neighbour criterion. outliers with large xi^2-values areindividually inspected to further investigate their nature. the tools developedare used for a preliminary analysis of the multi-colour point source catalogueconstructed from the optical/infrared imaging data obtained for the chandradeep field south (cdf-s). these data are publicly available, representing thefirst installment of the ongoing eis deep public survey.

astro-ph;0406346	on the use of photometric redshifts for x-ray selected agns	(abridged) in this paper we present photometric redshift estimates for asample of x-ray selected sources detected in the wide field (~2 deg^2), bright[f_{x} (0.5-8 kev)~10^{-14} cgs] xmm-newton/2df survey. unlike deeper x-raysamples comprising a large fraction of sources with colours dominated by thehost galaxy, our bright survey primarily probes the qso x-ray population.therefore photometric redshift methods employing both galaxy and qso templatesneed to be used. we employ the photometric redshift technique ofhatziminaoglou, mathez &amp; pello (2000) using 5-band photometry from the sdss. weseparate our x-ray sources according to their optical profile to point-like andextended. we apply qso and galaxy templates to the point-like and extendedsources respectively. x-ray sources associated with galactic stars areidentified and discarded from our point-like sample on the basis of their lowx-ray--to--optical flux ratio and their broad band colours that are best fit bystellar templates. comparison of our results with spectroscopic redshiftsavailable, allows calibration of our method and estimation of the photometricredshift accuracy. for ~70 per cent of the point-like sources photometricredshifts are correct within dz &lt;= 0.3 (or ~75 per cent have dz/(1+z) &lt;= 0.2),and the rms scatter is estimated to be sigma_z = 0.30. for the opticallyextended objects the photometric redshifts work only in the case of red (g - r&gt; 0.5 mag) sources yielding dz &lt;= 0.15 and dz/(1+z) &lt;= 0.2 for 73 and 93 percent respectively. however, we find that the above photometric redshifttechnique does not work in the case of extended sources with blue colours (g -r &lt; 0.5): such sources cannot be fit successfully by qso or galaxy templates,or any linear combination of the two.

astro-ph;0412476	complete multiwavelength characterization of faint chandra x-ray sources  seen in the spitzer wide-area ir extragalactic (swire) survey	we exploit deep combined observations with spitzer and chandra of the swiresurvey in the elais-n1 region, to investigate the nature of the faint x-ray andir sources in common, to identify agn/starburst diagnostics, and to study thesources of the x-ray and ir cosmic backgrounds. in the 17'x17' area of thechandra acis-i image there are 3400 swire near-ir sources with 4 sigmadetections in at least 2 irac bands and 988 sources detected at 24micron withmips brighter than 0.1 mjy. of these, 102 irac and 59 mips sources have chandracounterparts, out of a total of 122 x-ray sources present in the area withs(0.5-8 kev)&gt;10^(-15) erg/cm^2/s. we have constructed seds for each sourceusing data from the 4 irac wavebands, chandra fluxes, and optical follow-updata in the wavebands u, g', r', i', z, and h. we fit a number of spectraltemplates to the seds at optical and infrared wavelengths to determinephotometric redshifts and spectral categories, and also make use of diagnosticsbased on the x-ray luminosities, hardness ratios, x-ray to infrared spectralslopes and optical morphologies. although we have spectroscopic redshifts foronly a minority of the chandra sources, the available seds constrain theredshifts for most of the sample sources, which turn out to be typically at0.5&lt;z&lt;2. we find that 39% of the chandra sources are dominated by type-1 agnemission, 23% display optical/ir spectra typical of type-2 agns, while theremaining 38% fraction show starburst-like or even normal galaxy spectra. sincewe prove that all these galaxies are dominated by agn emission in x-rays thisbrings the fraction of type-1 agns to be 80% of the type-2: even assuming thatall the chandra sources undetected by spitzer are type-2 agns, the type-1fraction would exceed 1/3 of the total population (abridged).

astro-ph;0510788	remarkable disk and off-nuclear starburst activity in the "tadpole  galaxy" as revealed by the spitzer space telescope	we present ground-based optical and spitzer infrared imaging observations ofthe interacting galaxy ugc 10214, the "tadpole galaxy" (z = 0.0310), focusingon the star formation activity in the nuclear, disk, spiral arms and tidal tailregions. the major findings of this study are that the tadpole is activelyforming stars in the main disk outside of the nucleus and in the tidal plume,with an estimated mean star formation rate of ~2 to 4 m_sun/yr. the mostprominent sites of mid-infrared emission define a "ring" morphology that,combined with the overall morphology of the system, suggest the interaction maybelong to the rare class of off-center collisional ring systems that form bothshock-induced rings of star formation and tidal plumes. the nuclear emission issolely powered by older stars, with little evidence for ongoing star formationat the center of the tadpole. extra-nuclear star formation accounts for &gt;50% ofthe total star formation in the disk and spiral arms, featuring infrared-bright'hot spots' that exhibit strong pah emission, whose band strength is comparableto that of late-type star-forming disk galaxies. the tidal tail, which extends2 arcmin (~75 kpc) into the intergalactic medium, is populated by super massivestar clusters likely triggered by the galaxy-galaxy interaction that hasdistorted ugc 10214 into its current "tadpole" shape.

astro-ph;0511428	revisiting the infrared spectra of active galactic nuclei with a new  torus emission model	we describe improved modelling of the emission by dust in a toroidal--likestructure heated by a central illuminating source within active galactic nuclei(agn). we chose a simple but realistic torus geometry, a flared disc, and adust grain distribution function including a full range of grain sizes. theoptical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking into account thedifferent sublimation temperatures of the silicate and graphite grains, whichsolves previously reported inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature intype-1 agn. we exploit this model to study the spectral energy distributions(seds) of 58 extragalactic (both type-1 and type-2) sources using archivaloptical and infrared (ir) data. we find that both agn and starburstcontributions are often required to reproduce the observed seds, although in afew cases they are very well fitted by a pure agn component. the agncontribution to the far-ir luminosity is found to be higher in type-1 sources,with all the type-2 requiring a substantial contribution from a circum-nuclearstarburst. our results appear in agreement with the agn unified scheme, sincethe distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to becompatible for type-1 and type-2 agn. further support to the unificationconcept comes from comparison with medium-resolution ir spectra of type-1 agnby the spitzer observatory, showing evidence for a moderate silicate emissionaround 10 \mums which our code reproduces. from our analysis we infer accretionflows in the inner nucleus of local agn characterized by high equatorialoptical depths ($a_v\simeq 100$), moderate sizes ($r_{max}&lt;100 pc$) and veryhigh covering factors ($f\simeq 80$ per cent) on average.
