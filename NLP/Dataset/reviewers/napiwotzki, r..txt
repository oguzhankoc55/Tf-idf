0901.2325	the age of white dwarf companions	we carried out a spectroscopic investigation of single lined white dwarfs(wds) in double degenerate (dd) systems and discuss their binary evolution.simulated spectra of the halpha region are used to derive upper limits on thetemperature of the invisible component and thus lower limits on the coolingage. this is done for a range of hypothetical secondary masses and a minimumcooling age deduced. results are compared with the well known parameters of thevisible primary, which allows us to determine a lower limit for the cooling agedifference of both wds. most of the ten systems in our sample have a minimumage difference of not larger than 0.5gyr and their small orbital separation ishighly suggestive of at least one unstable mass transfer phase. however, astable first mass transfer phase is feasible as the age difference is less then1gyr. the results imply that unstable mass transfer is the most likely finalcontact binary scenario to have occurred in dd systems but the first masstransfer phase is not constrained.

0901.4464	high resolution optical spectroscopy of praesepe white dwarfs	we present the results of a high resolution optical spectroscopic study ofnine white dwarf candidate members of praesepe undertaken with the vlt anduves. we find, contrary to a number of previous studies, that wd0836+201(lb390, eg59) and wd0837+199 (lb393, eg61) are magnetic and non-magnetic whitedwarfs respectively. subsequently, we determine the radial velocities for theeight non-magnetic degenerates and provide compelling evidence that wd0837+185is a radial velocity variable and possibly a double-degenerate system. we alsofind that our result for wd0837+218, in conjunction with its projected spatiallocation and position in initial mass-final mass space, argues it is morelikely to be a field star than a cluster member. after eliminating these twowhite dwarfs, and wd0836+199 which has no clean sdss photometry, we use theremaining 5 stars to substantiate modern theoretical mass-radius relations forwhite dwarfs. in light of our new results we re-examine the white dwarf membersof praesepe and use them to further constrain the initial mass-final massrelation. we find a a near monotonic ifmr, which can still be adequatelyrepresented by simple linear function with only one outlier which may haveformed from a blue straggler star.

0902.4259	a new detailed examination of white dwarfs in ngc3532 and ngc2287	we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic study of the whitedwarf candidate members of the intermediate age open clusters ngc3532 andngc2287. of the nine objects investigated, it is determined that six areprobable members of the clusters, four in ngc3532 and two in ngc2287. for thesesix white dwarfs we use our estimates of their cooling times together with thecluster ages to constrain the lifetimes and masses of their progenitor stars.we examine the location of these objects in initial mass-final mass space andfind that they now provide no evidence for substantial scatter in initialmass-final mass relation as suggested by previous investigations. instead, wedemonstrate that, when combined with current data from other solar metalicityopen clusters and the sirius binary system, they hint at an ifmr that issteeper in the initial mass range 3m$_{\odot}$$\simless$m$_{\rminit}$$\simless$4m$_{\odot}$ than at progenitor masses immediately lower andhigher than this. this form is generally consistent with the predictions ofstellar evolutionary models and can aid population synthesis models inreproducing the relatively sharp drop observed at the high mass end of the mainpeak in the mass distribution of white dwarfs.

0706.2936	high-resolution spectra observed for spy. ii. db and dba stars	we present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the stars withhelium-dominated spectra in the eso supernova ia progenitor survey (spy).atmospheric parameters, masses, and abundances of trace hydrogen are determinedand discussed in the context of spectral evolution of white dwarfs. our finalsample contains 71 objects, of which 6 are new detections and 14 arereclassified from db to dba because of the presence of h lines. 55% of the dbsample show hydrogen and are thus dba, a significantly higher fraction thanfound before. the large incidence of dba, and the derived total hydrogen massesare compatible with the scenario that dbs ``reappear'' around 30000 k from thedb gap by mixing and diluting a thin hydrogen layer of the order of e-15 msun.this hydrogen mass is then during the evolution continuously increased byinterstellar accretion. there are indications that the accretion rate increasessmoothly with age or decreasing temperature, a trend which continuous evenbelow the current low temperature limit (dufour 2006). a remaining mystery isthe low accretion rate of h compared to that of ca observed in the dbza, but astellar wind extending down to the lowest temperatures with decreasing strengthmight be part of the solution.

0911.4019	the chemical composition of ts 01, the most oxygen-deficient planetary  nebula. agb nucleosynthesis in a metal-poor binary star	the planetary nebula ts 01 (also called pn g 135.9+55.9 or sbs 1150+599a),with its record-holding low oxygen abundance and its double degenerate closebinary core (period 3.9 h), is an exceptional object located in the galactichalo. we have secured observational data in a complete wavelength range inorder to pin down the abundances of half a dozen elements in the nebula. theabundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling taking intoaccount all the observational constraints (including geometry and apertureeffects) using the pseudo-3d photoionization code cloudy_3d. the spectralenergy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate modelatmospheres. both stellar components contribute to the ionization: the ``cool''one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization, and the ``hot'' one isresponsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions, which explainswhy previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties. the nebularabundances of c, n, o, and ne are found to be respectively, 1/3.5, 1/4.2, 1/70,and 1/11 of the solar value, with uncertainties of a factor 2. thus the extremeo deficiency of this object is confirmed. the abundances of s and ar are lessthan 1/30 of solar. standard models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesiscannot explain the abundance pattern observed in the nebula. to obtain anextreme oxygen deficiency in a star whose progenitor has an initial mass ofabout 1 msun requires an additional mixing process, which can be induced bystellar rotation and/or by the presence of the close companion. we havecomputed a stellar model with initial mass of 1 msun, appropriate metallicity,and initial rotation of 100 kms, and find that rotation greatly improves theagreement between the predicted and observed abundances.

1003.4113	binaries discovered by the spy project v. gd 687 - a massive double  degenerate binary progenitor that will merge within a hubble time	aims. the eso sn ia progenitor survey (spy) aims at finding merging doubledegenerate binaries as candidates for supernova type ia (sn ia) explosions. awhite dwarf merger has also been suggested to explain the formation of raretypes of stars like r crb, extreme helium or he sdo stars. here we present thehot subdwarf b binary gd 687, which will merge in less than a hubble time.  methods. the orbital parameters of the close binary have been determined fromtime resolved spectroscopy. since gd 687 is a single-lined binary, the spectracontain only information about the subdwarf primary and its orbit. from highresolution spectra the projected rotational velocity was derived. assumingorbital synchronisation, the inclination of the system and the mass of theunseen companion were constrained.  results. the derived inclination is $i=39.3^{+6.2}_{-5.6}\,^{\circ}$. themass $m_{\rm 2}=0.71_{-0.21}^{+0.22}\,m_{\rm \odot}$ indicates that thecompanion must be a white dwarf, most likely of c/o composition. this is onlythe fourth case that an sdb companion has been proven to be a white dwarfunambiguously. its mass is somewhat larger than the average white dwarf mass,but may be as high as $0.93\,m_{\rm \odot}$ in which case the total mass of thesystem comes close to the chandrasekhar limit.  conclusions. gd 687 will evolve into a double degenerate system and merge toform a rare supermassive white dwarf with a mass in excess of solar. a death ina sub-chandrasekhar supernova is also conceivable.

1008.2960	discovery of a t dwarf + white dwarf binary system	we present the discovery of the first t dwarf + white dwarf binary systemlspm 1459+0857ab, confirmed through common proper motion and spectroscopy. thewhite dwarf is a high proper motion object from the lspm catalogue that weconfirm spectroscopically to be a relatively cool (teff=5535+\-45k) andmagnetic (b~2mg) hydrogen-rich white dwarf, with an age of at least 4.8gyrs.the t dwarf is a recent discovery from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ulas1459+0857), and has a spectral type of t4.5+\-0.5 and a distance in the range43-69pc. with an age constraint (inferred from the white dwarf) of &gt;4.8gyrs weestimate teff=1200-1500k and logg=5.4-5.5 for ulas 1459+0857, making it abenchmark t dwarf with well constrained surface gravity. we also compare the tdwarf spectra with the latest lyon group atmospheric model predictions, whichdespite some shortcomings are in general agreement with the observed propertiesof ulas 1459+0857. the separation of the binary components (16,500-26,500au, or365 arcseconds on the sky) is consistent with an evolved version of the morecommon brown dwarf + main-sequence binary systems now known, and although thesystem has a wide separation, it is shown to be statistically robust as a nonspurious association. the observed colours of the t dwarf show that it isrelatively bright in the z band compared to other t dwarfs of similar type, andfurther investigation is warranted to explore the possibility that this couldbe a more generic indicator of older t dwarfs. future observations of thisbinary system will provide even stronger constraints on the t dwarf properties,and additional systems will combine to give a more comprehensively robust testof the model atmospheres in this temperature regime.

1010.3651	ejection velocities of high galactic latitude runaway stars	we estimate the distribution of ejection velocities for the known populationof high galactic latitude runaway stars. the initial sample is a collection of174 early-type stars selected from the literature. the stars are firstclassified according to their evolutionary status in order to obtain ahomogeneous sample of 96 genuine main sequence stars. their present velocitiesand flight times are then estimated using proper motion data from variousastrometric catalogues (including tycho-2, ucac2, and usno-b) and the ejectionvelocities are computed by tracing their orbits back in time, based on agalactic potential. the potential used is constructed from a mass density modelchosen to fit the most recent observational constraints. we find evidence fortwo different populations of runaway stars: a "high" velocity population, witha maximum ejection velocity of about 400 - 500 km/s, and a "low" velocitypopulation, with a maximum ejection velocity of about 300 km/s. we argue thatthe observed limit of 500 km/s and the bimodality of the observed ejectionvelocity distribution are natural consequences of the so-called binary ejectionmechanism. we discuss the connection between the "high" velocity population andthe so-called hypervelocity stars, showing how previously studied hypervelocitystars are consistent with the results obtained. we also find that some starsthat were once thought to be best explained as being formed in the halo arecompatible with a runaway hypothesis once proper motions are included in theanalysis. however, three stars in the selected sample appear to be inconsistentwith ejection from the galactic disc. possible scenarios are discussed,including a possible formation in the galactic halo.

1010.5143	search for the coolest white dwarfs in the galaxy	a number of so-called ultra-cool white dwarfs have been detected in differentsurveys so far. however, based on anecdotal evidence it is believed that mostor all of these ultra-cool white dwarfs are low-mass products of binaryevolution and thus not representative for the oldest white dwarfs. their lowmass causes relatively high luminosity making them the first cool white dwarfsdetected in relatively shallow surveys. deeper observations are needed for theoldest, high mass white dwarfs with the longest cooling times. we reportresults of an ongoing project that combines deep ir and optical data. thiscombination plus proper motion information will allow an unambiguousidentification of very cool white dwarfs, since the spectral energydistributions are very different from other types of stellar objects. theatmospheric parameters that can be derived from the spectral energydistributions together with the proper motions inferred from the ir data can beused to construct the white dwarf luminosity functions for the thick disc andhalo populations. from these we will be able to test the early star formationhistory and initial mass function of the first stellar populations.

1102.4757	binaries discovered by the spy survey vi. discovery of a low mass  companion to the hot subluminous planetary nebula central star egb\,5 - a  recently ejected common envelope?	hot subdwarf b stars (sdbs) in close binary systems are assumed to be formedvia common envelope ejection. according to theoretical models, the amount ofenergy and angular momentum deposited in the common envelope scales with themass of the companion. that low mass companions near or below the corehydrogen-burning limit are able to trigger the ejection of this envelope iswell known. the currently known systems have very short periods$\simeq0.1-0.3\,{\rm d}$. here we report the discovery of a low mass companion($m_{\rm 2}&gt;0.14\,m_{\rm \odot}$) orbiting the sdb star and central star of aplanetary nebula egb\,5 with an orbital period of $16.5\,{\rm d}$ at a minimumseparation of $23\,r_{\rm \odot}$. its long period is only just consistent withthe energy balance prescription of the common envelope. the marked differencebetween the short and long period systems will provide strong constraints onthe common envelope phase, in particular if the masses of the sdb stars can bemeasured accurately. due to selection effects, the fraction of sdbs with lowmass companions and similar or longer periods may be quite high. low massstellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for thestill unclear formation of hot subdwarf stars. furthermore, the nebula aroundegb\,5 may be the remnant of the ejected common envelope making this binary aunique system to study this short und poorly understood phase of binaryevolution.

1210.0446	wd0837+185:the formation and evolution of an extreme mass ratio white  dwarf-brown dwarf binary in praesepe	there is a striking and unexplained dearth of brown dwarf companions in closeorbits (&lt; 3au) around stars more massive than the sun, in stark contrast to thefrequency of stellar and planetary companions. although rare and relativelyshort-lived, these systems leave detectable evolutionary end points in the formof white dwarf - brown dwarf binaries and these remnants can offer uniqueinsights into the births and deaths of their parent systems. we present thediscovery of a close (orbital separation ~ 0.006 au) substellar companion to amassive white dwarf member of the praesepe star cluster. using the cluster ageand the mass of the white dwarf we constrain the mass of the white dwarfprogenitor star to lie in the range 3.5 - 3.7 msun (b9). the high mass of thewhite dwarf means the substellar companion must have been engulfed by the bstar's envelope while it was on the late asymptotic giant branch (agb). hence,the initial separation of the system was ~2 au, with common envelope evolutionreducing the separation to its current value. the initial and final orbitalseparations allow us to constrain the combination of the common envelopeefficiency (alpha) and binding energy parameters (lambda) for the agb star toalpha lambda ~3. we examine the various formation scenarios and conclude thatthe substellar object was most likely to have been captured by the white dwarfprogenitor early in the life of the cluster, rather than forming in situ.

1210.1217	the first planet detected in the wts: an inflated hot-jupiter in a 3.35  day orbit around a late f-star	we report the discovery of wts-1b, the first extrasolar planet found by thewfcam transit survey, which began observations at the 3.8-m united kingdominfrared telescope. light curves comprising almost 1200 epochs with aphotometric precision of better than 1 per cent to j=16 were constructed for60000 stars and searched for periodic transit signals. for one of the mostpromising transiting candidates, high-resolution spectra taken at thehobby-eberly telescope allowed us to estimate the spectroscopic parameters ofthe host star, a late-f main sequence dwarf (v=16.13) with possibly slightlysubsolar metallicity, and to measure its radial velocity variations. thecombined analysis of the light curves and spectroscopic data resulted in anorbital period of the substellar companion of 3.35 days, a planetary mass of4.01+-0.35 mj and a planetary radius of 1.49+-0.17 rj. wts-1b has one of thelargest radius anomalies among the known hot jupiters in the mass range 3-5 mj.

1212.2899	nltt5306: the shortest period detached white dwarf + brown dwarf binary	we have spectroscopically confirmed a brown dwarf mass companion to thehydrogen atmosphere white dwarf nltt5306. the white dwarf's atmosphericparameters were measured using sloan digital sky survey and x-shooterspectroscopy as t_eff=7756+/-35k and log(g)=7.68+/-0.08, giving a mass for theprimary of m_wd=0.44+/-0.04 m_sun, at a distance of 71+/-4 pc with a coolingage of 710+/-50 myr. the existence of the brown dwarf secondary was confirmedthrough the near-infrared arm of the x-shooter data and a spectral type ofdl4-dl7 was estimated using standard spectral indices. combined radial velocitymeasurements from the sloan digital sky survey, x-shooter and the hobby-eberlytelescope's high resolution spectrograph of the white dwarf gives a minimummass of 56+/-3 m_jup for the secondary, confirming the substellar nature. theperiod of the binary was measured as 101.88+/-0.02 mins using both the radialvelocity data and i'-band variability detected with the int. this variabilityindicates 'day' side heating of the brown dwarf companion. we also observeh{\alpha} emission in our higher resolution data in phase with the white dwarfradial velocity, indicating this system is in a low level of accretion, mostlikely via a stellar wind. this system represents the shortest period whitedwarf + brown dwarf binary and the secondary has survived a stage of commonenvelope evolution, much like its longer period counterpart, wd0137-349. bothsystems likely represent bona-fide progenitors of cataclysmic variables with alow mass white dwarf and a brown dwarf donor.

1304.4452	a progenitor binary and an ejected mass donor remnant of faint type ia  supernovae	type ia supernovae (sn ia) are the most important standard candles formeasuring the expansion history of the universe. the thermonuclear explosion ofa white dwarf can explain their observed properties, but neither the progenitorsystems nor any stellar remnants have been conclusively identified.underluminous sn ia have been proposed to originate from a so-calleddouble-detonation of a white dwarf. after a critical amount of helium isdeposited on the surface through accretion from a close companion, the heliumis ignited causing a detonation wave that triggers the explosion of the whitedwarf itself. we have discovered both shallow transits and eclipses in thetight binary system cd-30 11223 composed of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf and ahot helium star, allowing us to determine its component masses and fundamentalparameters. in the future the system will transfer mass from the helium star tothe white dwarf. modelling this process we find that the detonation in theaccreted helium layer is sufficiently strong to trigger the explosion of thecore. the helium star will then be ejected at so large a velocity that it willescape the galaxy. the predicted properties of this remnant are an excellentmatch to the so-called hypervelocity star us 708, a hot, helium-rich starmoving at more than 750 km/s, sufficient to leave the galaxy. theidentification of both progenitor and remnant provides a consistent picture ofthe formation and evolution of underluminous type ia supernovae.

0801.4456	lmc origin of the hyper-velocity star he 0437-5439. beyond the  supermassive black hole paradigm	context: hyper-velocity stars move so fast that only a supermassive blackhole (smbh) seems to be capable to accelerate them. hence the galactic centre(gc) is their only suggested place of origin. edelmann et al. (2005) found theearly b-star he0437-5439 to be too short-lived to have reached its currentposition in the galactic halo if ejected from the gc, except if being a bluestraggler. its proximity to the lmc suggested an origin from this galaxy. aims:the chemical signatures of stars at the gc are significantly different fromthose in the lmc. hence, an accurate measurement of the abundance pattern ofhe0437-5439 will yield a new tight constraint on the place of birth of thisstar. methods: high-resolution spectra obtained with uves on the vlt areanalysed using state-of-the-art non-lte modelling techniques. results: wemeasured abundances of individual elements to very high accuracy in he0437-5439as well as in two reference stars, from the lmc and the solar neighbourhood.the abundance pattern is not consistent at all with that observed in stars nearthe gc, ruling our an origin from the gc. however, there is a high degree ofconsistency with the lmc abundance pattern. our abundance results cannot ruleout an origin in the outskirts of the galactic disk. however, we find the lifetime of he0437-5439 to be more than 3 times shorter than the time of flight tothe edge of the disk, rendering a galactic origin unlikely. conclusions: onlyone smbh is known to be present in galaxy and none in the lmc. hence theexclusion of an gc origin challenges the smbh paradigm. we conclude that theremust be other mechanism(s) to accelerate stars to hyper-velocity speed than thesmbh. we draw attention to dynamical ejection from dense massive clusters, thathas recently been proposed by gvaramadze et al.

1403.6045	gaia photometry for white dwarfs	context. white dwarfs can be used to study the structure and evolution of thegalaxy by analysing their luminosity function and initial mass function. amongthem, the very cool white dwarfs provide the information for the early ages ofeach population. because white dwarfs are intrinsically faint only the nearby(about 20 pc) sample is reasonably complete. the gaia space mission willdrastically increase the sample of known white dwarfs through its 5-6 yearssurvey of the whole sky up to magnitude v = 20-25.  aims. we provide a characterisation of gaia photometry for white dwarfs tobetter prepare for the analysis of the scientific output of the mission.transformations between some of the most common photometric systems and gaiapassbands are derived. we also give estimates of the number of white dwarfs ofthe different galactic populations that will be observed.  methods. using synthetic spectral energy distributions and the most recentgaia transmission curves, we computed colours of three different types of whitedwarfs (pure hydrogen, pure helium, and mixed composition with h/he= 0.1). withthese colours we derived transformations to other common photometric systems(johnson-cousins, sloan digital sky survey, and 2mass). we also present numbersof white dwarfs predicted to be observed by gaia.  results. we provide relationships and colour-colour diagrams among differentphotometric systems to allow the prediction and/or study of the gaia whitedwarf colours. we also include estimates of the number of sources expected inevery galactic population and with a maximum parallax error. gaia will increasethe sample of known white dwarfs tenfold to about 200 000. gaia will be able toobserve thousands of very cool white dwarfs for the first time, which willgreatly improve our understanding of these stars and early phases of starformation in our galaxy.

0804.1282	binary sdb stars with massive compact companions	the masses of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars and blackholes are fundamental to astrophysics, but very difficult to measure. wepresent the results of an analysis of subluminous b (sdb) stars in close binarysystems with unseen compact companions to derive their masses and clarify theirnature. radial velocity curves were obtained from time resolved spectroscopy.the atmospheric parameters were determined in a quantitative spectral analysis.based on high resolution spectra we were able to measure the projectedrotational velocity of the stars with high accuracy. in the distribution ofprojected rotational velocities signs of tidal locking with the companions arevisible. by detecting ellipsoidal variations in the lightcurve of an sdb binarywe were able to show that subdwarf binaries with orbital periods up to 0.6 dare most likely synchronized. in this case, the inclination angles andcompanion masses of the binaries can be tightly constrained. five invisiblecompanions have masses that are compatible with that of normal white dwarfs orlate type main sequence stars. however, four sdbs have compact companionsmassive enough to be heavy white dwarfs (&gt;1 msun), neutron stars or even blackholes. such a high fraction of massive compact companions is not expected fromcurrent models of binary evolution.

0804.1287	metal abundances of subdwarf b stars from spy - a pattern emerges	the formation of sdbs is still puzzling, as is the chemical composition oftheir atmospheres. while helium and other light elements are depleted relativeto solar values, heavy elements are highly enriched. diffusion processes in thehot, radiative atmosphere of these stars are the most likely explanation.although several attempts were made, it was not yet possible to model all theobserved features of sdb atmospheres. a setback of most prior studies was thesmall sample size. we present a detailed abundance analysis of 68 sdbs. fromhigh resolution spectra obtained with the vlt/uves instrument in the course ofthe eso supernova progenitor survey (spy) we measured elemental abundances ofup to 24 different ions per star. a general trend of enrichment was found withincreasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. the lighter elementslike carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted irrespective of the temperature.although there is considerable scatter from one star to another, the generalabundance patterns in most sdbs are similar. an interplay between gravitationalsettling, radiative levitation and weak winds is most likely responsible. about6 % of the analysed stars show an enrichment in carbon and helium which cannotbe explained in the framework of diffusion alone. nuclear processed materialmust have been transported to the surface. the late hot-flasher scenario mayprovide a possible explanation for this effect.

astro-ph;0201096	resolving subdwarf b stars in binaries by hst imaging	the origin of subluminous b stars is still an unsolved problem in stellarevolution. single star as well as close binary evolution scenarios have beeninvoked but until now have met with little success. we have carried out a smallsurvey of spectroscopic binary candidates (19 systems consisting of an sdb starand late type companion) with the planetary camera of the wfpc2 onboard hubblespace telescope to test these scenarios. monte carlo simulations indicate thatby imaging the programme stars in the r-band about one third of the sample (6-7stars) should be resolved at a limiting angular resolution of 0.1" if they havelinear separations like main sequence stars ("single star evolution"). noneshould be resolvable if all systems were produced by close binary evolution. inaddition we expect three triple systems to be present in our sample. most ofthese, if not all, should be resolvable. components were resolved in 6 systemswith separations between 0.2" and 4.5". however, only in two systems do themagnitudes of the resolved components match the expectations from thedeconvolution of the spectral energy distribution. these two stars could bephysical binaries whereas in the other cases the nearby star may be a chanceprojection or a third component. radial velocity measurements indicate that theresolved system ton 139 is a triple system, with the sdb having a closecompanion that does not contribute detectably to the integrated light of thesystem. accordingly the success rate would be only 5% which is clearly belowthe prediction for single star evolution. we conclude that the distribution ofseparations of sdb binaries deviates strongly from that of normal stars. ourresults add further evidence that close binary evolution is fundamental for theevolution of sdb stars.

astro-ph;0409136	hot subdwarfs from the eso supernova ia progenitor survey - i.  atmospheric parameters and cool companions of sdb stars	we present the analysis of a high-resolution, high-quality sample of opticalspectra for 76 subdwarf b (sdb) stars from the eso supernova ia progenitorsurvey (spy). effective temperature, surface gravity, and photospheric heliumabundance are determined simultaneously by fitting the profiles of hydrogen andhelium lines using synthetic spectra calculated from lte and nlte modelatmospheres. we perform a detailed comparison of our measurements withtheoretical calculations, both for single star evolution and for binarypopulation synthesis models of close binary evolution. the luminosity evolutiongiven by the standard ehb evolutionary tracks from dorman et al. (1993) showsan overall agreement in shape with our observations, although a constant offsetin luminosity exists. the various simulation sets for binary formation channelsof sdb stars calculated by han et al. (2003) are compared individually to ourdata for testing our current understanding of sdb formation processes and thephysical effects involved. the best-matching sets manage to reproduce theobserved sdb distribution in the temperature-gravity-plane well. however, theydo not match the observed cumulative luminosity function, indicating thattheoretical improvement is necessary. we also investigate composite-spectrumobjects showing clear signatures of a cool companion with optical and infraredphotometry. these stars have cool main sequence companions of spectral types fto k. typical helium abundances of composite and non-composite sdb stars do notdiffer.

astro-ph;0410230	the mass of the sdb primary of the binary hs 2333+3927	short period sdb binaries with cool companions are crucial to understandpre-cv evolution, because they will evolve into cataclysmic variables, when thesdb will have left the extended horizontal branch. recently we discovered thesixth such system, hs 2333+3927, consisting of an sdb star and an m dwarf(period: 0.172 d) with a very strong reflection effect, but no eclipses. thereflection is stronger than in any of the other similar systems which renders aquantitative spectral analysis very difficult because the balmer line profilesmay be disturbed by the reflected light. a spectroscopic analysis results inteff = 36500 k, log g = 5.70, and log (n_he/n_h) = -2.15. mass-radius relationswere derived from the results of the analysis of light and radial-velocitycurves. comparison with the mass-radius relation derived from the surfacegravity of the sdb star favours a rather low mass of 0.38 msun for the primary.the mass of the companion is 0.29 m_sun. hs 2333+3927 is the only known sdb+dmsystem with a period above the cv period gap.

astro-ph;0410433	subluminous o stars from the eso supernova progenitor survey -  observation versus theory	the eso supernova progenitor survey (spy) has identified 58 (mostlyhelium-rich) subluminous o stars. we use the balmer line strength todistinguish sdo from he-sdo (no balmer lines) and present the results of theanalyses of high resolution optical vlt-uves spectra using an extensive grid ofnlte atmosphere models covering a large range in teff, log g and heliumabundances. the stellar atmospheric parameters are derived from line profilefits using a chi**2 technique. the resulting distribution in the (teff, log g)diagram as well as the luminosity function are discussed in the context ofstellar evolution scenarios. by combining our results with those for the sdbstars from spy (lisker et al. 2004) we discuss the implications for binarypopulation synthesis models of han et al. (2003). models with a low ceeefficiency and a constant mass ratio distribution provide a reasonableexplanation of the observed properties of the spy sample of sdb and sdo starsindicating that the sdo stars form the hot and luminous extension of the sdbsequence. however, for the he-sdo stars none of the considered evolutionscenarios are in agreement with the measured parameters of our programme stars.we conclude that he-sdo stars are formed by a different process than the sdband sdo stars.

(2003), but still at the very edge of theperiod limit for hydrogen-rich cvs. the spectrum shows double-peaked balmeremission lines flanked by strong broad balmer absorption, indicating a dominantcontribution by the white dwarf primary star, and is similar to the spectra ofshort-period low-mass transfer wz sge-like systems. the photometric light curveshows complex variability. the system undergoes cyclic brightening up to 0.4mags, which are of semi-periodic nature with periods of the order of 8-12hours. we also detect a 40.25 min variability of ~0.15 mag corresponding tohalf of the orbital period. amplitude of the latter increases with the cyclicbrightening of the system. we discuss the variable accretion rate and itsimpact on the hot spot as the most probable reason for both observed processes.sdss j123813.73-033933.0 is preliminary classified as a wz sge-like shortperiod system with low and unstable accretion rate.

astro-ph;0603314	new praesepe white dwarfs and the initial mass-final mass relation	we report the spectroscopic confirmation of four further white dwarf membersof praesepe. this brings the total number of confirmed white dwarf members toeleven making this the second largest collection of these objects in an opencluster identified to date. this number is consistent with the high mass end ofthe initial mass function of praesepe being salpeter in form. furthermore, itsuggests that the bulk of praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a substantialrecoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass during theasymptotic giant branch phase of evolution. by comparing our estimates of theeffective temperatures and the surface gravities of wd0833+194, wd0840+190,wd0840+205 and wd0843+184 to modern theoretical evolutionary tracks we havederived their masses to be in the range 0.72-0.76msun and their cooling ages\~300myrs. for an assumed cluster age of 625+/-50myrs the infered progenitormasses are between 3.3-3.5msun. examining these new data in the context of theinitial mass-final mass relation we find that it can be adequately representedby a linear function (a0=0.289+/-0.051, a1=0.133+/-0.015) over the initial massrange 2.7msun to 6msun. assuming an extrapolation of this relation to largerinitial masses is valid and adopting a maximum white dwarf mass of 1.3msun, ourresults support a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae progenitors in therange ~6.8-8.6msun.

astro-ph;0608671	on the origin of the ultramassive white dwarf gd50	we argue on the basis of astrometric and spectroscopic data that theultramassive white dwarf gd50 is associated with the star formation event thatcreated the pleiades and is possibly a former member of this cluster. itscooling age (~60myrs) is consistent with it having evolved essentially as asingle star from a progenitor with a mass m&gt;6msun so we find no need to invokea white dwarf-white dwarf binary merger scenario to account for its existence.this result may represent the first direct observational evidence that singlestar evolution can produce white dwarfs with m&gt;1.1msun, as predicted by somestellar evolutionary theories. on the basis of its tangential velocity we alsoprovisionally identify the ultramassive (m~1.2msun) white dwarf pg0136+251 asbeing related to the pleiades. these findings may help to alleviate thedifficulties in reconciling the observed number of hot nearby ultramassivewhite dwarfs with the smaller number predicted by binary evolution models underthe assumption that they are the products of white dwarf mergers.

astro-ph;0609718	hot subdwarfs from the eso supernova ia progenitor survey: ii.  atmospheric parameters of subdwarf o stars	we address the origin and evolutionary status of hot subdwarf stars bystudying the optical spectral properties of 58 subdwarf o (sdo) stars.combining them with the results of our previously studied subdwarf b (sdb)stars, we aim at investigating possible evolutionary links. we analyzehigh-resolution eso vlt uves spectra from the eso supernova ia progenitorsurvey (spy). effective temperatures, gravities, and helium abundances aredetermined simultaneously by fitting the profiles of h and he lines usingdedicated synthetic spectra in nlte. evidence for cool companions to 8 sdos aswell as a binary consisting of two sdo stars is found. a correlation between heabundances and the presence of carbon and/or nitrogen lines emerges: belowsolar he abundance, no sdo shows c or n lines. in contrast, c and/or n linesare present in all sdos with super- solar he abundance. we thus use the solarhe abundance to divide our sample into he-deficient and he-enriched sdos. whilehe-deficient sdos are scattered in a wide range of the teff-log(g)-diagram,most of the he-enriched sdos cluster in a narrow region at teff = 40,000 ...50,000k and log(g)=5.5 ... 6.0. an evolu- tionary link between sdbs and sdosappears plausible only for the he-deficient sdos indicating that they are thelikely successors to sdbs. the properties of he-enriched sdos cannot beexplained with canonical single star evolutionary models. alternative scenarios(late hot flasher) as well as for binary evolution (white dwarf merger;post-rgb evolution) are tested. while we regard the post-rgb scenario asinappropriate, the white dwarf merger and the late hot flasher scenarios remainviable to explain the origin of he-enriched sdos.

0810.2547	high spatial resolution galactic 3d extinction mapping with iphas	we present an algorithm ({\scshape mead}, for `mapping extinction againstdistance') which will determine intrinsic ($r' - i'$) colour, extinction, anddistance for early-a to k4 stars extracted from the iphas $r'/i'/\halpha$photometric database. these data can be binned up to map extinction in threedimensions across the northern galactic plane. the large size of the iphasdatabase ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digitalphotometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allowextinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the solarcircle. high reddening within the solar circle on occasion brings this rangedown to $\sim 2$ kpc. the resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatlyexceeds that of previous empirical 3d extinction maps, enabling the structureof the galactic plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,unresolved ism substructure, and binarity. the impact of metallicityvariations, within the range typical of the galactic disc is small. theaccuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use ofsimulated photometry created with monte-carlo sampling techniques. the successof this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results arecompared to the literature.
