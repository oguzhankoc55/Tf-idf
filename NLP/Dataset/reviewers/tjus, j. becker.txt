1207.0810	use of event-level neutrino telescope data in global fits for theories  of new physics	we present a fast likelihood method for including event-level neutrinotelescope data in parameter explorations of theories for new physics, andannounce its public release as part of darksusy 5.0.6. our constructionincludes both angular and spectral information about neutrino events, as wellas their total number. we also present a corresponding measure for simple modelexclusion, which can be used for single models without reference to the rest ofa parameter space. we perform a number of supersymmetric parameter scans withicecube data to illustrate the utility of the method: example global fits and asignal recovery in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model(cmssm), and a model exclusion exercise in a 7-parameter phenomenologicalversion of the mssm. the final icecube detector configuration will probe almostthe entire focus-point region of the cmssm, as well as a number of mssm-7models that will not otherwise be accessible to e.g. direct detection. ourmethod accurately recovers the mock signal, and provides tight constraints onmodel parameters and derived quantities. we show that the inclusion of spectralinformation significantly improves the accuracy of the recovery, providingmotivation for its use in future icecube analyses.

1208.3430	an improved method for measuring muon energy using the truncated mean of  de/dx	the measurement of muon energy is critical for many analyses in largecherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separatingextraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. muonenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss(de/dx) along the muon's path and relating the de/dx to the muon energy.because high-energy muons (e_mu &gt; 1 tev) lose energy randomly, the spread inde/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 inlog10(e_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the icecubedetector. in this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncatedmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. the muon track isdivided into separate segments with individual de/dx values. the elimination ofsegments with the highest de/dx results in an overall de/dx that is moreclosely correlated to the muon energy. this method results in an energyresolution of 0.22 in log10(e_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. thistechnique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially tolarge scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

1209.1197	cosmic-ray-induced ionization in molecular clouds adjacent to supernova  remnants	energetic gamma rays (gev to tev photon energy) have been detected towardseveral supernova remnants (snr) that are associated with molecular clouds. ifthe gamma rays are produced mainly by hadronic processes rather than leptonicprocesses like bremsstrahlung, then the flux of energetic cosmic ray nuclei (&gt;1gev) required to produce the gamma rays can be inferred at the site where theparticles are accelerated in snr shocks. it is of great interest to understandthe acceleration of the cosmic rays of lower energy (&lt;1 gev) that accompany theenergetic component. these particles of lower energy are most effective inionizing interstellar gas, which leaves an observable imprint on theinterstellar ion chemistry. a correlation of energetic gamma radiation withenhanced interstellar ionization can thus be used to support the hadronicorigin of the gamma rays and to constrain the acceleration of ionizing cosmicrays in snr. using observational gamma ray data, the primary cosmic ray protonspectrum can be modeled for e &gt;1 gev, and careful extrapolation of the spectrumto lower energies offers a method to calculate the ionization rate of themolecular cloud.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1210.7992	search for galactic pev gamma rays with the icecube neutrino observatory	gamma-ray induced air showers are notable for their lack of muons, comparedto hadronic showers. hence, air shower arrays with large underground muondetectors can select a sample greatly enriched in photon showers by rejectingshowers containing muons. icecube is sensitive to muons with energies above~500 gev at the surface, which provides an efficient veto system for hadronicair showers with energies above 1 pev. one year of data from the 40-stringicecube configuration was used to perform a search for point sources and agalactic diffuse signal. no sources were found, resulting in a 90% c.l. upperlimit on the ratio of gamma rays to cosmic rays of 1.2 x 10^(-3)for the fluxcoming from the galactic plane region (-80 deg &lt; l &lt; -30 deg; -10 deg &lt; b &lt; 5deg) in the energy range 1.2 - 6.0 pev. in the same energy range, point sourcefluxes with e^(-2) spectra have been excluded at a level of (e/tev)^2 d\phi/de~ 10^(-12)-10^(-11) cm^2/s/tev depending on source declination. the completeicecube detector will have a better sensitivity, due to the larger detectorsize, improved reconstruction and vetoing techniques. preliminary data from thenearly-final icecube detector configuration has been used to estimate the 5year sensitivity of the full detector. it is found to be more than an order ofmagnitude better, allowing the search for pev extensions of known tev gamma-rayemitters.

1301.1173	search for photon line-like signatures from dark matter annihilations  with h.e.s.s	gamma-ray line signatures can be expected in the very-high-energy (vhe;e_\gamma &gt; 100 gev) domain due to self-annihilation or decay of dark matter(dm) particles in space. such a signal would be readily distinguishable fromastrophysical \gamma-ray sources that in most cases produce continuous spectrawhich span over several orders of magnitude in energy. using data collectedwith the h.e.s.s. \gamma-ray instrument, upper limits on line-like emission areobtained in the energy range between ~500 gev and ~25 tev for the central partof the milky way halo and for extragalactic observations, complementing recentlimits obtained with the fermi-lat instrument at lower energies. nostatistically significant signal could be found. for monochromatic \gamma-rayline emission, flux limits of (2x10^-7 - 2x10^-5) m^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 and (1x10^-8- 2x10^-6) m^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 are obtained for the central part of the milky wayhalo and extragalactic observations, respectively. for a dm particle mass of 1tev, limits on the velocity-averaged dm annihilation cross section &lt; \sigma v&gt;(\chi\chi -&gt; \gamma\gamma) reach ~10^-27 cm^3 s^-1, based on the einastoparametrization of the galactic dm halo density profile.

1301.1678	search for very-high-energy \gamma-ray emission from galactic globular  clusters with h.e.s.s	globular clusters (gcs) are established emitters of high-energy (he, 100mev&lt;e&lt;100 gev) \gamma-ray radiation which could originate from the cumulativeemission of the numerous millisecond pulsars (mspsrs) in the clusters' cores orfrom inverse compton (ic) scattering of relativistic leptons accelerated in thegc environment. these stellar clusters could also constitute a new class ofsources in the very-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) \gamma-ray regime, judgingfrom the recent detection of a signal from the direction of terzan 5 with theh.e.s.s. telescope array.  we searched for point-like and extended vhe \gamma-ray emission from 15 gcsserendipitously covered by h.e.s.s observations and also performed a stackinganalysis combining the data from all gcs to investigate the hypothesis of apopulation of faint emitters. assuming ic emission as the origin of the vhe\gamma-ray signal from the direction of terzan 5, we calculated the expected\gamma-ray flux from each of the 15 gcs, based on their number of millisecondpulsars, their optical brightness and the energy density of background photonfields.  we did not detect significant vhe \gamma-ray emission from any of the 15 gcsin either of the two analyses. given the uncertainties related to the parameterdeterminations, the obtained flux upper limits allow to rule out the simpleic/mspsr scaling model for ngc 6388 and ngc 7078. the upper limits derived fromthe stacking analyses are factors between 2 and 50 below the flux predicted bythe simple leptonic scaling model, depending on the assumed source extent andthe dominant target photon fields. therefore, terzan 5 still remainsexceptional among all gcs, as the vhe \gamma-ray emission either arises fromextra-ordinarily efficient leptonic processes, or from a recent catastrophicevent, or is even unrelated to the gc itself.

1405.0471	neutrinos from colliding wind binaries: future prospects for pingu and  orca	massive stars play an important role in explaining the cosmic ray spectrumbelow the knee, possibly even up to the ankle, i.e. up to energies of 1e15 evor 1e18.5 ev, respectively. in particular, supernova remnants are discussed asone of the main candidates to explain the cosmic ray spectrum. even beforetheir violent deaths, during the stars' regular life times, cosmic rays can beaccelerated in wind environments. high-energy gamma-ray measurements indicatehadronic acceleration binary systems, leading to both periodic gamma-rayemission from binaries like lsi+60~303 and continuous emission from collidingwind environments like eta carinae. the detection of neutrinos and photons fromhadronic interactions are one of the most promising methods to identifyparticle acceleration sites. in this paper, future prospects to detectneutrinos from colliding wind environments in massive stars are investigated.in particular, the seven most promising candidates for emission from collidingwind binaries are investigated to provide an estimate of the signal strength.the expected signal of a single source is about a factor of $5-10$ below thecurrent icecube sensitivity and it is therefore not accessible at the moment.what is discussed in addition is future the possibility to measure low-energyneutrino sources with detectors like pingu and orca: the minimum of theatmospheric neutrino flux at around 25 gev from neutrino oscillations providesan opportunity to reduce the background and increase the significance tosearches for gev/tev neutrino sources. this paper presents the first idea,detailed studies including the detector's effective areas will be necessary inthe future to test the feasibility of such an approach.

1406.6868	multipole analysis of icecube data to search for dark matter accumulated  in the galactic halo	dark matter which is bound in the galactic halo might self-annihilate andproduce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.these neutrinos can be detected with icecube, a cubic-kilometer sized cherenkovdetector. given icecube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy ofthe additional neutrino flux is expected. in this paper we describe a multipolemethod to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in icecube data. this methoduses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrivaldirections and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansioncoefficient. we apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample fromthe northern hemisphere. the final result is compatible with thenull-hypothesis. as no signal was observed, we present limits on theself-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocitydistribution $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ down to $1.9\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of$700\,\mathrm{gev}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{gev}$ and direct annihilation into$\nu\bar{\nu}$. the resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limitsfrom $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer galactic halo, for highdark matter masses of a few tev and hard annihilation channels.

1408.0634	searches for small-scale anisotropies from neutrino point sources with  three years of icecube data	recently, icecube found evidence for a diffuse signal of astrophysicalneutrinos in an energy range of $60\,\mathrm{tev}$ to the $\mathrm{pev}$-scale.the origin of those events, being a key to understanding the origin of cosmicrays, is still an unsolved question. so far, analyses have not succeeded toresolve the diffuse signal into point-like sources. searches including amaximum-likelihood-ratio test, based on the reconstructed directions andenergies of the detected down- and up-going neutrino candidates, were alsoperformed on icecube data leading to the exclusion of bright point sources. inthis paper, we present two methods to search for faint neutrino point sourcesin three years of icecube data, taken between 2008 and 2011. the first methodis an autocorrelation test, applied separately to the northern and southernsky. the second method is a multipole analysis, which expands the measured datain the northern hemisphere into spherical harmonics and uses the resultingexpansion coefficients to separate signal from background. with both methods,the results are consistent with the background expectation with a slightly moresparse spatial distribution, corresponding to an underfluctuation. depending onthe assumed number of sources, the resulting upper limit on the flux per sourcein the northern hemisphere for an $e^{-2}$ energy spectrum ranges from $1.5\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s})$, in the case of oneassumed source, to $4 \cdot 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{gev}/(\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s})$, in the case of $3500$ assumed sources.

1412.2251	h.e.s.s. detection of tev emission from the interaction region between  the supernova remnant g349.7+0.2 and a molecular cloud	g349.7+0.2 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr) located at thedistance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrumfrom radio to high energy (he) gamma-rays. radio and infrared observationsindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. in this paper,the detection of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emission coincident with thissnr with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) is reported. anintegral flux f(e&gt;400gev)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/scorresponding to 0.7% of that of the crab nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index gamma_vhe = 2.8+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. the analysis of more than 5 yr of fermi-latdata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photonindex gamma_he = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. the combined gamma-ray spectrumof g349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (bpl) or apower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (plc). in the formercase, the photon break energy is found at e_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 gev, slightlyhigher than what is usually observed in the he/vhe gamma-ray emittingmiddle-aged snrs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. in the lattercase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measuredat e_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) tev. a pion-decayprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nucleiwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explainthe gamma-ray emission. the bpl with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the plcprovide equally good fits to the data. the product of the average gas densityand the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nh wp~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

1412.6997	h.e.s.s. reveals a lack of tev emission from the supernova remnant  puppis a	puppis a is an interesting ~4 kyr-old supernova remnant (snr) that showsstrong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.it has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (he,0.1-100 gev) gamma-rays. an analysis of the fermi-lat data has shown anextended he gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 gev spectrum exhibiting nosignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the gev-emitting snrsknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. this makes it a promising targetfor imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes (iacts) to probe the gamma-rayemission above 100 gev. very-high-energy (vhe, e &gt;= 0.1 tev) gamma-ray emissionfrom puppis a is for the first time searched for with the high energystereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.). the analysis of the h.e.s.s. data does notreveal any significant emission towards puppis a. the derived upper limits onthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum mustexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. by combining fermi-lat and h.e.s.s.measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are foundto be 450 and 280 gev, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and asub-exponential cutoff, respectively. it is concluded that none of the standardlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle accelerationmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of vhesignal. the scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago isconsidered as an alternative explanation. the he/vhe spectrum of puppis a couldthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several otherinteracting snrs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interactionwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.

1501.05087	the 2012 flare of pg 1553+113 seen with h.e.s.s. and fermi-lat	very high energy (vhe, $e&gt;$100 gev) $\gamma$-ray flaring activity of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object \pg\ has been detected by the \hess\telescopes. the flux of the source increased by a factor of 3 during the nightsof 2012 april 26 and 27 with respect to the archival measurements with hint ofintra-night variability. no counterpart of this event has been detected in the\fla\ data. this pattern is consistent with vhe $\gamma$ ray flaring beingcaused by the injection of ultrarelativistic particles, emitting $\gamma$ raysat the highest energies. the dataset offers a unique opportunity to constrainthe redshift of this source at \bestz\ using a novel method based on bayesianstatistics. the indication of intra-night variability is used to introduce anovel method to probe for a possible lorentz invariance violation (liv), and toset limits on the energy scale at which quantum gravity (qg) effects causingliv may arise. for the subluminal case, the derived limits are $\textrm{e}_{\rmqg,1}&gt;4.10\times 10^{17}$ gev and $\textrm{e}_{\rm qg,2}&gt;2.10\times 10^{10}$gev for linear and quadratic liv effects, respectively.

1503.00598	searches for time dependent neutrino sources with icecube data from 2008  to 2012	in this paper searches for flaring astrophysical neutrino sources and sourceswith periodic emission with the icecube neutrino telescope are presented. incontrast to time integrated searches, where steady emission is assumed, theanalyses presented here look for a time dependent signal of neutrinos using theinformation from the neutrino arrival times to enhance the discovery potential.a search was performed for correlations between neutrino arrival times anddirections as well as neutrino emission following time dependent lightcurves,sporadic emission or periodicities of candidate sources. these include activegalactic nuclei, soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters, supernova remnants hostingpulsars, micro-quasars and x-ray binaries. the work presented here updates andextends previously published results to a longer period that covers four yearsof data from 2008 april 5 to 2012 may 16 including the first year of operationof the completed 86-string detector. the analyses did not find any significanttime dependent point sources of neutrinos and the results were used to setupper limits on the neutrino flux from source candidates.

1503.02711	discovery of variable vhe gamma-ray emission from the binary system 1fgl  j1018.6-5856	re-observations with the h.e.s.s. telescope array of the very-high-energy(vhe) source hess j1018-589 a coincident with the fermi-lat $\gamma$-ray binary1fgl j1018.6-5856 have resulted in a source detection significance of more than9$\sigma$, and the detection of variability ($\chi^2$/$\nu$ of 238.3/155) inthe emitted $\gamma$-ray flux. this variability confirms the association ofhess j1018-589 a with the high-energy $\gamma$-ray binary detected byfermi-lat, and also confirms the point-like source as a new very-high-energybinary system. the spectrum of hess j1018-589 a is best fit with a power-lawfunction with photon index $\gamma = 2.20 \pm 0.14_{\rm stat} \pm 0.2_{\rmsys}$. emission is detected up to ~20 tev. the mean differential flux level is$(2.9 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-13}$ tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev,equivalent to ~1% of the flux from the crab nebula at the same energy.variability is clearly detected in the night-by-night lightcurve. when foldedon the orbital period of 16.58 days, the rebinned lightcurve peaks in phasewith the observed x-ray and high-energy phaseograms. the fit of the h.e.s.s.phaseogram to a constant flux provides evidence of periodicity at the level of3$\sigma$. the shape of the vhe phaseogram and measured spectrum suggest a lowinclination, low eccentricity system with a modest impact from vhe $\gamma$-rayabsorption due to pair production ($\tau$ &lt; 1 at 300 gev).

1504.03753	measurement of the atmospheric $\nu_e$ spectrum with icecube	we present a measurement of the atmospheric $\nu_e$ spectrum at energiesbetween 0.1 tev and 100 tev using data from the first year of the completeicecube detector. atmospheric $\nu_e$ originate mainly from the decays of kaonsproduced in cosmic-ray air showers. this analysis selects 1078 fully containedevents in 332 days of livetime, then identifies those consistent with particleshowers. a likelihood analysis with improved event selection extends ourprevious measurement of the conventional $\nu_e$ fluxes to higher energies. thedata constrain the conventional $\nu_e$ flux to be $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times abaseline prediction from a honda's calculation, including the knee of thecosmic-ray spectrum. a fit to the kaon contribution ($\xi$) to the neutrinoflux finds a kaon component that is $\xi =1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ times the baselinevalue. the fitted/measured prompt neutrino flux from charmed hadron decaysstrongly depends on the assumed astrophysical flux and shape. if theastrophysical component follows a power law, the result for the prompt flux is$0.0^{+3.0}_{-0.0}$ times a calculated flux based on the work by enberg, renoand sarcevic.

1505.07259	search for dark matter annihilation in the galactic center with  icecube-79	the milky way is expected to be embedded in a halo of dark matter particles,with the highest density in the central region, and decreasing density with thehalo-centric radius. dark matter might be indirectly detectable at earththrough a flux of stable particles generated in dark matter annihilations andpeaked in the direction of the galactic center. we present a search for anexcess flux of muon (anti-) neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in thegalactic center using the cubic-kilometer-sized icecube neutrino detector atthe south pole. there, the galactic center is always seen above the horizon.thus, new and dedicated veto techniques against atmospheric muons are requiredto make the southern hemisphere accessible for icecube. we used 319.7 live-daysof data from icecube operating in its 79-string configuration during 2010 and2011. no neutrino excess was found and the final result is compatible with thebackground. we present upper limits on the self-annihilation cross-section,$\left&lt;\sigma_\mathrm{a} v\right&gt;$, for wimp masses ranging from 30 gev up to10 tev, assuming cuspy (nfw) and flat-cored (burkert) dark matter haloprofiles, reaching down to $\simeq 4 \cdot 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and$\simeq 2.6 \cdot 10^{-23}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for the $\nu\overline{\nu}$channel, respectively.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

1507.03991	a combined maximum-likelihood analysis of the high-energy astrophysical  neutrino flux measured with icecube	evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now beenfound in multiple searches with the icecube detector. the first solid evidencewas provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies$\gtrsim30$ tev and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. recentanalyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies andis also visible with throughgoing, $\nu_\mu$-induced tracks from the northernhemisphere. here, we combine the results from six different icecube searchesfor astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. the combinedevent sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-likeevents. the data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle andevent topology. assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and toconsist of equal flavors at earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrinoenergies between 25 tev and 2.8 pev is well described by an unbroken power lawwith best-fit spectral index $-2.50\pm0.09$ and a flux at 100 tev of$\left(6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1}\right)\cdot10^{-18}\,\mathrm{gev}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index $-2$ is disfavoredwith a significance of 3.8 $\sigma$ ($p=0.0066\%$) with respect to the bestfit. this significance is reduced to 2.1 $\sigma$ ($p=1.7\%$) if instead wecompare the best fit to a spectrum with index $-2$ that has an exponentialcut-off at high energies. allowing the electron neutrino flux to deviate fromthe other two flavors, we find a $\nu_e$ fraction of $0.18\pm0.11$ at earth.the sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic ofneutron-decay dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ ($p=0.014\%$).

1507.04005	evidence for astrophysical muon neutrinos from the northern sky with  icecube	results from the icecube neutrino observatory have recently providedcompelling evidence for the existence of a high energy astrophysical neutrinoflux utilizing a dominantly southern hemisphere dataset consisting primarily ofnu_e and nu_tau charged current and neutral current (cascade) neutrinointeractions. in the analysis presented here, a data sample of approximately35,000 muon neutrinos from the northern sky was extracted from data takenduring 659.5 days of livetime recorded between may 2010 and may 2012. whilethis sample is composed primarily of neutrinos produced by cosmic rayinteractions in the earth's atmosphere, the highest energy events areinconsistent with a hypothesis of solely terrestrial origin at 3.7 sigmasignificance. these neutrinos can, however, be explained by an astrophysicalflux per neutrino flavor at a level of phi(e_nu) = 9.9^{+3.9}_{-3.4} times10^{-19} gev^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} s^{-1} ({e_nu / 100 tev})^{-2}, consistentwith icecube's southern hemisphere dominated result. additionally, a fit for anastrophysical flux with an arbitrary spectral index was performed. we find aspectral index of 2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, which is also in good agreement with thesouthern hemisphere result.
