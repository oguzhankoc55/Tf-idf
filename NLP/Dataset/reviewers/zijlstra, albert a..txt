0903.1045	metal-rich carbon stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present spectroscopic observations from the {\it spitzer space telescope}of six carbon-rich agb stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgrdsph) and two foreground galactic carbon stars. the band strengths of theobserved c$_2$h$_2$ and sic features are very similar to those observed ingalactic agb stars. the metallicities are estimated from an empirical relationbetween the acetylene optical depth and the strength of the sic feature. themetallicities are higher than those of the lmc, and close to galactic values.while the high metallicity could imply an age of around 1 gyr, for the dustyagb stars, the pulsation periods suggest ages in excess of 2 or 3 gyr. we fitthe spectra of the observed stars using the dusty radiative transfer model anddetermine their dust mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0--3.3$\times 10^{-8}$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. the two galactic foreground carbon-rich agb stars arelocated at the far side of the solar circle, beyond the galactic centre. one ofthese two stars show the strongest sic feature in our present local groupsample.

0706.3857	the onset of photoionization in sakurai's object (v4334 sgr)	we investigate the reheating of the very late thermal pulse (vltp) objectv4334 sgr (sakurai's object) using radio observations from the very largearray, and optical spectra obtained with the very large telescope. we find asudden rise of the radio flux at 5 and 8 ghz - from &lt;= 90 micro-jy and 80 +/-30 micro-jy in february 2005 to 320 micro-jy and 280 micro-jy in june 2006.optical line emission is also evolving, but the emission lines are fading. theoptical line emission and early radio flux are attributed to a fast shock (andnot photoionization as was reported earlier) which occurred around 1998. thefading is due to post-shock cooling and recombination. the recent rapidincrease in radio flux is evidence for the onset of photoionization of carbonstarting around 2005. the current results indicate an increase in the stellartemperature to 12 kk in 2006. the mass ejected in the vltp eruption is m_ej &gt;=1e-4 msol, but could be as high as 1e-2 msol, depending mainly on the distanceand the clumping factor of the outflow. we derive a distance between 1.8 and 5kpc. a high mass loss could expose the helium layer and yield abundancescompatible with those of [wc] and pg1159 stars.

0909.5143	detection of the central star of the planetary nebula ngc 6302	ngc 6302 is one of the highest ionization planetary nebulae known and showsemission from species with ionization potential &gt;300ev. the temperature of thecentral star must be &gt;200,000k to photoionize the nebula, and has beensuggested to be up to ~ 400,000k. on account of the dense dust and moleculardisc, the central star has not convincingly been directly imaged until now. ngc6302 was imaged in six narrow band filters by wide field camera 3 on hst aspart of the servicing mission 4 early release observations. the central star isdirectly detected for the first time, and is situated at the nebula centre onthe foreground side of the tilted equatorial disc. the magnitudes of thecentral star have been reliably measured in two filters(f469n and f673n).assuming a hot black body, the reddening has been measured from the(4688-6766\aa) colour and a value of c=3.1, a_v=6.6 mag determined. a g-k mainsequence binary companion can be excluded. the position of the star on the hrdiagram suggests a fairly massive pn central star of about 0.64,m_sun close tothe white dwarf cooling track. a fit to the evolutionary tracks for(t,l,t)=(200,000k, 2000l_sun, 2200yr), where t is the nebular age, is obtained;however the luminosity and temperature remain uncertain. the model trackspredict that the star is rapidly evolving, and fading at a rate of almost 1 %per year. future observations could test this prediction.

1005.3489	rusty old stars: a source of the missing interstellar iron?	iron, the universe's most abundant refractory element, is highly depleted inboth circumstellar and interstellar environments, meaning it exists in solidform. the nature of this solid is unknown. in this letter, we provide evidencethat metallic iron grains are present around oxygen-rich agb stars, where it isobservationally manifest as a featureless mid-infrared excess. thisidentification is made using spitzer space telescope observations of evolvedglobular cluster stars, where iron dust production appears ubiquitous and insome cases can be modelled as the only observed dust product. in this context,feo is examined as the likely carrier for the 20-micron feature observed insome of these stars. metallic iron appears to be an important part of the dustcondensation sequence at low metallicity, and subsequently plays an influentialrole in the interstellar medium. we explore the stellar metallicities andluminosities at which iron formation is observed, and how the presence of ironaffects the outflow and its chemistry. the conditions under which iron canprovide sufficient opacity to drive a wind remain unclear.

0708.3112	near-infrared vlt adaptive optics imaging of evolved stars	the high angular resolution and dynamic range achieved by the naco adaptiveoptics system on the vlt is an excellent tool to study the morphology ofplanetary nebulae (pne). we observed four stars in different evolutionarystages from the agb to the pne phase.  the images of the inner parts of the pn hen 2-113 reveal the presence of adusty torus tilted with respect to all the other structures of the nebula andthe present of hot dust close to the hot central star. the naco observations ofroberts 22 reveal an amazingly complex nebular morphology with a s-shape thatcan be interpreted in terms of the 'warped disc' scenario of icke (2003).  combined naco and midi (the vlti mid-infrared interferometer) observations ofthe nebula oh 231.8+4.2 have enabled us to resolve a very compact (diameter of30-40 mas, corresponding to 40-50 a.u.) dusty structure in the core of thenebula. finally, recent observations of the agb star v hydrae show that thisstar present a departure from spherical symmetry in its inner shell and isprobably on its way to become an asymmetrical planetary nebula. theseobservations show that naco is a great instrument for the discovery and studyof small structures in circumstellar envelopes and pne and a good complement tointerferometric devices.

1011.5671	a disk inside the bipolar planetary nebula m2-9	bipolarity in proto-planetary and planetary nebulae is associated with eventsoccurring in or around their cores. past infrared observations have revealedthe presence of dusty structures around the cores, many in the form of disks.characterising those dusty disks provides invaluable constraints on thephysical processes that govern the final mass expulsion of intermediate-massstars. we focus this study on the famous m2-9 bipolar nebula, where the movinglighthouse beam pattern indicates the presence of a wide binary. the compactand dense dusty core in the center of the nebula can be studied by means ofoptical interferometry. m2-9 was observed with vlti/midi at 39-47 m baselineswith the ut2-ut3 and ut3-ut4 baseline configurations. these observations areinterpreted using a dust radiative transfer monte carlo code. a disk-likestructure is detected perpendicular to the lobes and a good fit is found with astratified disk model composed of amorphous silicates. the disk is compact,25$\times$35 mas at 8$\rm \mu m$, and 37$\times$46 mas at 13$\rm \mu m$. forthe adopted distance of 1.2 kpc, the inner rim of the disk is $\sim$15 au. themass represents a few percent of the mass found in the lobes. the compactnessof the disk puts strong constraints on the binary content of the system, givenan estimated orbital period 90-120yr. we derive masses of the binary componentsbetween 0.6--1.0m$_{\sun}$ for a white dwarf and 0.6--1.4m$_{\sun}$ for anevolved star. we present different scenarios on the geometric structure of thedisk accounting for the interactions of the binary system, which includes anaccretion disk as well.

1102.4561	a mid-infrared imaging catalogue of post-agb stars	post-agb stars are key objects for the study of the dramatic morphologicalchanges of low- to intermediate-mass stars on their evolution from theasymptotic giant branch (agb) towards the planetary nebula stage. there isgrowing evidences that binary interaction processes may very well have adetermining role in the shaping process of many objects, but so far directevidence is still weak. we aim at a systematic study of the dust distributionaround a large sample of post-agb stars as a probe of the symmetry breaking inthe nebulae around these systems. we used imaging in the mid-infrared to studythe inner part of these evolved stars to probe direct emission from dustystructures in the core of post-agb stars in order to better understand theirshaping mechanisms. we imaged a sample of 93 evolved stars and nebulae in themid-infrared using visir/vlt, t-recs/gemini south and michelle/gemini north. wefound that all the the proto-planetary nebulae we resolved show a cleardeparture from spherical symmetry. 59 out of the 93 observed targets appear tobe non resolved. the resolved targets can be divided in two categories. thenebulae with a dense central core, that are either bipolar and multipolar. thenebulae with no central core have an elliptical morphology.the dense centraltorus observed likely host binary systems which triggered fast outflows thatshaped the nebulae.

0709.2848	the interaction of planetary nebulae and their agb progenitors with the  interstellar medium	interaction with the interstellar medium (ism) cannot be ignored inunderstanding planetary nebula (pn) evolution and shaping. in an effort tounderstand the range of shapes observed in the outer envelopes of pne, we haverun a comprehensive set of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, from thebeginning of the asymptotic giant branch (agb) superwind phase until the end ofthe post--agb/pn phase. a 'triple-wind' model is used, including a slow agbwind, fast post--agb wind and third wind reflecting the linear movement throughthe ism. a wide range of stellar velocities, mass-loss rates and ism densitieshave been considered. we find ism interaction strongly affects outer pnstructures, with the dominant shaping occuring during the agb phase. thesimulations predict four stages of pn--ism interaction whereby the pn isinitially unaffected (1), then limb-brightened in the direction of motion (2),then distorted with the star moving away from the geometric centre (3) andfinally so distorted that the object is no longer recognisable as a pn and maynot be classed as such (4). parsec-size shells around pn are predicted to becommon. the structure and brightness of ancient pne is largely determined bythe ism interaction, caused by rebrightening during the second stage; thiseffect may address the current discrepancies in galactic pn abundance. themajority of pne will have tail structures. evidence for strong interaction isfound for all known planetary nebulae in globular clusters.

1104.5155	spitzer spectra of evolved stars in omega centauri and their  low-metallicity dust production	dust production is explored around 14 metal-poor ([fe/h] = -1.91 to -0.98)giant stars in the galactic globular cluster omega centauri using new spitzerirs spectra. this sample includes the cluster's post-agb and carbon stars andis thus the first representative spectral study of dust production in ametal-poor ([fe/h] &lt; -1) population. only the more metal rich stars v6 and v17([fe/h] = -1.08, -1.06) exhibit silicate emission, while the five other starswith mid-infrared excess show only a featureless continuum which we argue iscaused by metallic iron dust grains. we examine the metallicity of v42, andfind it is likely part of the metal-rich population ([fe/h] ~ -0.8). aside fromthe post-agb star v1, we find no star from the cluster's bulk, metal-poor([fe/h] &lt; -1.5) population - including the carbon stars - to be producingdetectable amounts of dust. we compare the dust production to the stars'h-alpha line profiles obtained at the magellan/clay telescope at las campanasobservatory, finding pulsation shocking in the strongest pulsators (v6, v17 andv42), but evidence of outflow in all other stars. we conclude that the onset ofdust production does not signify a fundamental change in the material leavingthe star. our data add to a growing body of evidence that metallic irondominates dust production in metal-poor, oxygen-rich stars, but that dust isprobably not the primary accelerant of winds in this mass-metallicity regime.

1105.3506	modelling the warm h2 infrared emission of the helix nebula cometary  knots	molecular hydrogen emission is commonly observed in planetary nebulae. imagestaken in infrared h2 emission lines show that at least part of the molecularemission is produced inside the ionised region. in the best-studied case, thehelix nebula, the h2 emission is produced inside cometary knots (cks),comet-shaped structures believed to be clumps of dense neutral gas embeddedwithin the ionised gas. most of the h2 emission of the cks seems to be producedin a thin layer between the ionised diffuse gas and the neutral material of theknot, in a mini photodissociation region (pdr). however, pdr models publishedso far cannot fully explain all the characteristics of the h2 emission of thecks. in this work, we use the photoionisation code \textsc{aangaba} to studythe h2 emission of the cks, particularly that produced in the interface h^+/h^0of the knot, where a significant fraction of the h2 1-0s(1) emission seems tobe produced. our results show that the production of molecular hydrogen in sucha region may explain several characteristics of the observed emission,particularly the high excitation temperature of the h2 infrared lines. we findthat the temperature derived from h2 observations even of a single knot, willdepend very strongly on the observed transitions, with much higher temperaturesderived from excited levels. we also proposed that the separation between theh_alpha and nii peak emission observed in the images of cks may be an effect ofthe distance of the knot from the star, since for knots farther from thecentral star the nii line is produced closer to the border of the ck thanh_alpha.

1106.1016	empirical determination of the integrated red giant and horizontal  branch stellar mass loss in omega centauri	we herein determine the average integrated mass loss from stars starsbelonging to the dominant metal-poor population ([fe/h] ~ --1.7) of thegalactic globular cluster omega centauri (ngc 5139) during their red giant andhorizontal branch evolution. masses are empirically calculated fromspectroscopic measurements of surface gravity and photometric measurements oftemperature and luminosity. systematic uncertainties prevent an absolutemeasurement of masses at a phase of evolution. however, the relative masses ofearly asymptotic giant branch stars and central red giant branch stars can bemeasured, and used to derive the mass loss between these two phases. this canthen be used as a physical check of models of horizontal branch (hb) stars. foromega cen, the average difference is found to be 26 +/- 4%. assuming initialand final masses of 0.83 and 0.53 solar masses, we determine that 0.21 +/- 0.03solar masses is lost on the rgb and 0.09 +/- ~0.05 solar masses is lost on theagb. the implied hb stellar mass of 0.62 +/- 0.04 solar masses is commensuratewith literature determinations of the masses of the cluster's hb stars. theaccuracy of this measurement can be improved through better selection of starsand spectral coverage, and applied to other clusters where horizontal branchmodels do not currently agree.

0710.0499	a silicate disk in the heart of the ant	we aim at getting high spatial resolution information on the dusty core ofbipolar planetary nebulae to directly constrain the shaping process. methods:we present observations of the dusty core of the extreme bipolar planetarynebula menzel 3 (mz 3, hen 2-154, the ant) taken with the mid-infraredinterferometer midi/vlti and the adaptive optics naco/vlt. the core of mz 3 isclearly resolved with midi in the interferometric mode, whereas it isunresolved from the ks to the n bands with single dish 8.2 m observations on ascale ranging from 60 to 250 mas. a striking dependence of the dust core sizewith the pa angle of the baselines is observed, that is highly suggestive of anedge-on disk whose major axis is perpendicular to the axis of the bipolarlobes. the midi spectrum and the visibilities of mz 3 exhibit a clear signatureof amorphous silicate, in contrast to the signatures of crystalline silicatesdetected in binary post-agb systems, suggesting that the disk might berelatively young. we used radiative-transfer monte carlo simulations of apassive disk to constrain its geometrical and physical parameters. itsinclination (74 degrees $\pm$ 3 degrees) and position angle (5 degrees $\pm$ 5degrees) are in accordance with the values derived from the study of the lobes.the inner radius is 9$\pm$ 1 au and the disk is relatively flat. the dust massstored in the disk, estimated as 1 x 10-5msun, represents only a small fractionof the dust mass found in the lobes and might be a kind of relic of anessentially polar ejection process.

1111.2753	the nuclear pah emission of merger system ngc 1614: rings within rings	it is important to understand the interplay between nuclear star-formationand nuclear activity when studying the evolution of gas rich galaxy mergers. wepresent here new spatially resolved l-band integral field unit observations ofthe inner kpc of the luminous ir galaxy ngc 1614. a broad ring of 3.3 um pahemission is found at a distance of approximately 200 pc from the core. thisring overlaps with a previously established star-forming ring detected withpa_alpha and radio continuum observations, but peaks outside it, especially ifdetermined using the pah equivalent width. using the characteristics of the pahemission and the ionised gas emission we argue that ngc 1614 features anoutward propagating ring of star formation, where the equivalent width of thepah emission localises the regions where the current star formation is justexpanding into the molecular gas outward of the nucleus. the core itself showsa highly luminous, slightly resolved (at ~80 pc) l-band continuum source. wefind no evidence of agn activity and rule out the presence of an obscured agnusing l-band diagnostics. furthermore, we detect the likely companion galaxyfrom archival hst/acs imaging. the star formation and dynamical characteristicsof the system are consistent with a relatively major merger just after itssecond passage. an outstanding question is how a gas-rich advanced merger suchas this one, with strong lirg level nuclear starburst and major merger-liketidal features, has not yet developed an active nucleus.

0710.4468	dust mass-loss rates from agb stars in the fornax and sagittarius dwarf  spheroidal galaxies	to study the effect of metallicity on the mass-loss rate of asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars, we have conducted mid-infrared photometric measurements ofsuch stars in the sagittarius (sgr dsph) and fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxieswith the 10-$\mu$m camera visir at the vlt. we derive mass-loss rates for 29agb stars in sgr dsph and 2 in fornax. the dust mass-loss rates are estimatedfrom the $k-[9]$ and $k-[11]$ colours. radiative transfer models are used tocheck the consistency of the method. published iras and spitzer data confirmthat the same tight correlation between $k-[12]$ colour and dust mass-lossrates is observed for agb stars from galaxies with different metallicities,i.e. the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.  the derived dust mass-loss rates are in the range 5$\times10^{-10}$ to3$\times10^{-8}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the observed agb stars in sgr dsphand around 5$\times10^{-9}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for those in fornax; whilevalues obtained with the two different methods are of the same order ofmagnitude. the mass-loss rates for these stars are higher than the nuclearburning rates, so they will terminate their agb phase by the depletion of theirstellar mantles before their core can grow significantly. some observed starshave lower mass-loss rates than the minimum value predicted by theoreticalmodels.

1204.2640	a close halo of large transparent grains around extreme red giant stars	intermediate-mass stars end their lives by ejecting the bulk of theirenvelope via a slow dense wind back into the interstellar medium, to form thenext generation of stars and planets. stellar pulsations are thought to elevategas to an altitude cool enough for the condensation of dust, which is thenaccelerated by radiation pressure from starlight, entraining the gas anddriving the wind. however accounting for the mass loss has been a problem dueto the difficulty in observing tenuous gas and dust tens of milliarcsecondsfrom the star, and there is accordingly no consensus on the way sufficientmomentum is transferred from the starlight to the outflow. here, we presentspatially-resolved, multi-wavelength observations of circumstellar dust shellsof three stars on the asymptotic giant branch of the hr diagram. when imaged inscattered light, dust shells were found at remarkably small radii (&lt;~ 2 stellarradii) and with unexpectedly large grains (~300 nm radius). this proximity tothe photosphere argues for dust species that are transparent to starlight andtherefore resistant to sublimation by the intense radiation field. whiletransparency usually implies insufficient radiative pressure to drive a wind,the radiation field can accelerate these large grains via photon scatteringrather than absorption - a plausible mass-loss mechanism for lower-amplitudepulsating stars.

1401.3558	vista variables in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy: pulsation-  vs. dust-driven winds on the giant branches	variability is examined in over 2.6 million stars covering 11 square degreesof the core of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgr dsph) from vistaz-band observations. generally, pulsation on the sgr dsph giant branchesappears to be excited by the internal kappa mechanism. pulsation amplitudesappear identical between red and asymptotic (rgb/agb) giant stars, and betweenunreddened carbon and oxygen-rich stars at the same luminosity. the lack ofcorrelation between infrared excess and variability among oxygen-rich starsindicates pulsations do not contribute significantly to wind driving inoxygen-rich stars in the sgr dsph, though the low amplitudes of these starsmean this may not apply elsewhere. the dust-enshrouded carbon stars have thehighest amplitudes of the stars we observe. only in these stars does anexternal kappa-mechanism-driven pulsation seem likely, caused by variations intheir more-opaque carbon-rich molecules or dust. this may allow pulsationdriving of winds to be effective in carbon stars. variability can be simplifiedto a power law (amplitude proportional to l/t^2), as in other systems. intotal, we identify 3026 variable stars (with r.m.s. variability of delta z &gt;~0.015 magnitudes), of which 176 are long-period variables associable with theupper giant branches of the sgr dsph. we also identify 324 candidate rr lyraevariables in the the sgr dsph and 340 in the outer galactic bulge.

1403.7201	a multi-wavelength view of the central kiloparsec region in the luminous  infrared galaxy ngc1614	the luminous infrared galaxy ngc1614 hosts a prominent circumnuclear ring ofstar formation. however, the nature of the dominant emitting mechanism in itscentral ~100 pc is still under debate. we present sub-arcsecond angularresolution radio, mid-infrared, pa-alpha, optical, and x-ray observations ofngc1614, aimed at studying in detail both the circumnuclear ring and thenuclear region. the 8.4 ghz continuum emission traced by the very large array(vla) and the gemini/t-recs 8.7 micron emission, as well as the pa-alpha lineemission, show remarkable morphological similarities within the star-formingring, suggesting that the underlying emission mechanisms are tightly related.we used an hst/nicmos pa-alpha map of similar resolution to our radio maps todisentangle the thermal free-free and non-thermal synchrotron radio emission,from which we obtained the intrinsic synchrotron power-law for each individualregion within the central kpc of ngc1614. the radio ring surrounds a relativelyfaint, steep-spectrum source at the very center of the galaxy, suggesting thatthe central source is not powered by an agn, but rather by a compact (r &lt; 90pc) starburst. chandra x-ray data also show that the central kpc region isdominated by starburst activity, without requiring the existence of an agn. wealso used publicly available infrared data to model-fit the spectral energydistribution of both the starburst ring and a putative agn in ngc1614. insummary, we conclude that there is no need to invoke an agn to explain theobserved bolometric properties of the galaxy.

1411.2365	evolution of the central stars of young planetary nebulae	the evolution of central stars of planetary nebulae was so far documented injust a few cases. however, spectra collected a few decades ago may provide agood reference for studying the evolution of central stars using the emissionline fluxes of their nebulae. we investigated evolutionary changes of the[oiii] 5007 a line flux in the spectra of planetary nebulae. we comparednebular fluxes collected during a decade or longer. we used literature data andnewly obtained spectra. a grid of cloudy models was computed using existingevolutionary models, and the models were compared with the observations. anincrease of the [oiii] 5007 a line flux is frequently observed in youngplanetary nebulae hosting h-rich central stars. the increasing nebularexcitation is the response to the increasing temperature and hardeningradiation of the central stars. we did not observe any changes in the nebularfluxes in the planetary nebulae hosting late-type wolf-rayet (wr) centralstars. this may indicate a slower temperature evolution (which may stem from adifferent evolutionary status) of late-[wr] stars. in young planetary nebulaewith h-rich central stars, the evolution can be followed using optical spectracollected during a decade or longer. the observed evolution of h-rich centralstars is consistent with the predictions of the evolutionary models provided inthe literature. late-[wr] stars possibly follow a different evolutionary path.

1412.4108	agb sodium abundances in the globular cluster 47 tucanae (ngc 104)	a recent analysis comparing the [na/fe] distributions of red giant branch(rgb) and asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the galactic globular clusterngc 6752 found that the ratio of na-poor to na-rich stars changes from 30:70 onthe rgb to 100:0 on the agb. the surprising paucity of na-rich stars on the agbin ngc 6752 warrants additional investigations to determine if the failure of asignificant fraction of stars to ascend the agb is an attribute common to allglobular clusters. therefore, we present radial velocities, [fe/h], and [na/fe]abundances for 35 agb stars in the galactic globular cluster 47 tucanae (47tuc; ngc 104), and compare the agb [na/fe] distribution with a similar rgbsample published previously. the abundances and velocities were derived fromhigh resolution spectra obtained with the michigan/magellan fiber system (m2fs)and mspec spectrograph on the magellan-clay 6.5m telescope. we find the averageheliocentric radial velocity and [fe/h] values to be &lt;rv_helio.&gt;=-18.56 km s^-1(sigma=10.21 km s^-1) and &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.68 (sigma=0.08), respectively, inagreement with previous literature estimates. the average [na/fe] abundance is0.12 dex lower in the 47 tuc agb sample compared to the rgb sample, and theratio of na-poor to na-rich stars is 63:37 on the agb and 45:55 on the rgb.however, in contrast to ngc 6752, the two 47 tuc populations have nearlyidentical [na/fe] dispersion and interquartile range values. the data presentedhere suggest that only a small fraction &lt;20% of na-rich stars in 47 tuc mayfail to ascend the agb. regardless of the cause for the lower average [na/fe]abundance in agb stars, we find that na-poor stars and at least some na-richstars in 47 tuc evolve through the early agb phase.

1508.03620	kathryns wheel: a spectacular galaxy collision discovered in the  galactic neighbourhood	we report the discovery of the closest collisional ring galaxy to the milkyway. such rare systems occur due to "bulls-eye" encounters between tworeasonably matched galaxies. the recessional velocity of about 840 km/s is lowenough that it was detected in the aao/ukst survey for galactic h$\alpha$emission. the distance is only 10.0 mpc and the main galaxy shows a full ringof star forming knots, 6.1 kpc in diameter surrounding a quiescent disk. thesmaller assumed "bullet" galaxy also shows vigorous star formation. thespectacular nature of the object had been overlooked because of its location inthe galactic plane and proximity to a bright star and even though it is the60$^{\rm th}$ brightest galaxy in the hi parkes all sky survey (hipass) hisurvey.  the overall system has a physical size of $\sim$15 kpc, a total mass of$m_\ast = 6.6\times 10^9$ m$_\odot$ (stars + hi), a metallicity of[o/h]$\sim-0.4$, and a star formation rate of 0.2-0.5 m$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$,making it a magellanic-type system. collisional ring galaxies therefore extendto much lower galaxy masses than commonly assumed. we derive a space densityfor such systems of $7 \times 10^{-5}\,\rm mpc^{-3}$, an order of magnitudehigher than previously estimated. this suggests kathryn's wheel is the nearestsuch system. we present discovery images, ctio 4-m telescope narrow-bandfollow-up images and spectroscopy for selected emission components. given itsproximity and modest extinction along the line of sight, this spectacularsystem provides an ideal target for future high spatial resolution studies ofsuch systems and for direct detection of its stellar populations.

0806.3557	molecules and dust production in the magellanic clouds	we present eso/vlt spectra in the 2.9-4.1 micron range for a large sample ofinfrared stars in the small magellanic cloud (smc), mainly carbon stars,massive oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars, and red supergiants.strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) is detected in thespectrum of the post-agb object msx smc 29. water ice is detected in at leastone young stellar object, iras 01042-7215, for the first time in the smc. thestrength and shapes of the molecular bands detected in the evolved stars arecompared with similar data for stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc).absorption from acetylene in carbon stars is found to be equally strong in thesmc as in the lmc, but the lmc stars show stronger dust emission in theirinfrared colours and veiling of the molecular bands. this suggests that acritical link exists in the formation of dust from the molecular atmosphere incarbon stars which scales with the initial metallicity. nucleation seeds basedon a secondary element such as titanium or silicon provide a plausibleexplanation. in oxygen-rich stars, both the nucleation seeds and molecularcondensates depend on secondary elements (in particular titanium, silicon,and/or aluminium). data for pulsating dusty agb stars and supergiants in thelmc are used to show that pulsation is likely the critical factor in drivingmass loss, as long as dust forms, rather than the stellar luminosity. finally,we suggest that the reduced dust production and consequently slower winds ofmetal-poor agb stars and red supergiants are more likely to result in chemicalinhomogeneities and small-scale structure in the interstellar medium.(abridged)

0807.3730	the trigger of the agb superwind: the importance of carbon	the driving mechanism of the agb superwind has become controversial in recentyears. the efficacy of dust-driven mass loss has been queried. spitzerobservation of agb stars in local group galaxies show the surprising resultthat at low metallicity, agb mass loss occurs at low luminosity, possibly lowerthan in the galaxy, but only for carbon-rich stars. oxygen-rich stars in thegalaxy and in lower metallicity galaxies have similar mass-loss rates only athigh luminosities. to explain this dichotomy, we propose that the superwind hasa dual trigger. the superwind starts either when sufficient excess carbonbuilds up for efficient formation of carbonaceous dust (which we propose occurswhen $x_{\rm co} = \rm (c - o)/ o_\odot = 0.1$), or when the luminosity reachesa value sufficient for a silicate-dust-driven wind (proposed at $l = 10^4z^{-4/3} \rm l_\odot)$. we show that this dual trigger fits the currentobservational constraints: the luminosity at which the superwind begins, andthe predominance of carbon superwind star at low metallicity. we use stellarevolution models to check the consistency of our explanations and presentdetailed predictions of the luminosities at which the superwind is triggeredfor different metallicities and initial stellar masses.

astro-ph;0010602	bipolar outflows in oh/ir stars	we investigate the development of bipolar outflows during the early post-agbevolution. a sample of ten oh/ir stars is observed at high angular resolution,including bipolar nebulae (oh231.8+4.2), bright post-agb stars (hd 101584) andreflection nebulae (e.g. roberts 22). the iras colour--colour diagram separatesthe sample into different types of objects. one group may contain theprogenitors to the (few) extreme bipolar planetary nebulae. two objects showcolours and chemistry very similar to the planetary nebulae with late ir-[wc]stars. one object is a confirmed close binary.  a model is presented consisting of an outer agb wind which is swept up by afaster post-agb wind, with either wind being non-spherically symetric. theinterface of the two winds is shown to exhibit a linear relation betweenvelocity and distance from the star. the oh data confirms the predicted linearvelocity gradients, and reveals torus-like, uniformly expanding components. allsources are discussed in detail using optical/hst images where available. isodata for roberts 22 reveal a chemical dichotomy, with both crystallinesilicates and pahs features being present. iras 16342-3814 shows a dense torus;hst data shows four point-like sources located symmetrically around the nebula,near the outer edge of the dense torus.  lifetimes for the bipolar oh/ir stars are shown to be in excess of 10^4 yr,longer than normal post-agb timescales. this suggests that the disks arenear-stationary. we suggest that accretion from such a disk slows down thepost-agb evolution. such a process could explain the link between thelong-lived bipolar nebular geometry and the retarded star.

astro-ph;0101125	circumstellar masers in the magellanic clouds	we have searched for 22 ghz h2o and 43/86/129 ghz sio masers in bright iraspoint sources in the smc and lmc, to test whether the kinematics of the massloss from these stars depends on metallicity. h2o masers were detected in thered supergiants iras04553-6825 and iras05280-6910, and tentatively in theluminous ir object iras05216-6753 and the agb star iras05329-6708. sio maserswere detected in iras04553-6825. the outflow velocity increases between the h2omasing zone near the dust-formation region and the more distant oh masing zonefrom 18 to 26 km/s for iras04553-6825 and from 6 to 17 km/s for iras05280-6910.the total sample of lmc targets is analysed in comparison with circumstellarmasers in the galactic centre. the photon fluxes of circumstellar masers in thelmc are very similar to those in the galactic centre. the expansion velocitiesin the lmc appear to be 20% lower than for similarly bright oh masers in thegalactic centre, but the data are consistent with no difference in expansionvelocity. oh/ir stars in the lmc appear to have slower accelerating envelopesthan oh/ir stars in the galactic centre. masers in the lmc have blue-asymmetricemission profiles. this may be due to the amplification of stellar and/orfree-free radiation, rather than the amplification of dust emission, and may bemore pronounced in low metallicity envelopes. sio maser strength increases withthe photometric amplitude at 2.2 micron but is independent of the photometricamplitude at 10 micron. this suggests a strong connection between shocks in thedust-free sio masing zone and the dust formation process. appendices describeh2o maser emission from r dor in the milky way, optical echelle spectroscopy ofiras04553-6825, and the properties of masers in the galactic centre (abridged).

astro-ph;0203326	a wall of dust around a proto-mira	we present the discovery of a huge (19$\arcmin$ $\times$ 16$\arcmin$) dustring surrounding a bright (v = 10.60) red star. the dust ring has, at d = 700pc, a diameter of 4 pc, and a central hole of ~1.5 pc across. part of the shellis also seen as an absorption nebulosity. the star is classified as a m3iii agbstar. among agb stars its detached shell is of unrivalled size. detached shellsaround agb stars are normally interpreted in terms of thermal pulses. however,in this case a significant fraction of the shell may consist of swept-up ism;the detached appearance can be explained with wind--ism interaction. we presenta model where the agb wind has been stopped by the surrounding ism, and theswept-up shell is now expanding at the sound speed. the model predicts that thering will disperse over a few times 10^5 yr, and eventually will leave a largehole in the ism surrounding the agb star or its future planetary nebula.

astro-ph;0203328	the evolution of the mira variable r hydrae	the mira variable r hydrae is well known for its declining period, which wood&amp; zarro (1981) attributed to a possible recent thermal pulse. here weinvestigate the long-term period evolution, covering 340 years, going back toits discovery in ad 1662. wavelets are used to determine both the period andsemi-amplitude. we show that the period decreased linearly between 1770 and1950; since 1950 the period has stabilized at 385 days. the semi-amplitudeclosely follows the period evolution. detailed analysis of the oldest datashows that before 1770 the period was about 495 days. we find no evidence foran increasing period during this time as found by wood &amp; zarro. iras data showsthat the mass loss dropped dramatically around ad 1750. the decline agrees withthe mass-loss formalism from vassiliadis &amp; wood, but is much larger thanpredicted by the bloecker mass-loss law. an outer detached iras shell suggeststhat r hya has experienced such mass-loss interruptions before. the periodevolution can be explained by a thermal pulse occuring around ad 1600, or by annon-linear instability leading to an internal relaxation of the stellarstructure. the elapsed time between the mass-loss decline giving rise to theouter detached shell, and the recent event, of approximately 5000 yr suggeststhat only one of these events could be due to a thermal pulse. furthermonitoring of r hya is recommended, as both models make strong predictions forthe future period evolution. r hya-type events, on time scales of 10^2-10^3 yr,could provide part of the explanation for the rings seen around some agb andpost-agb stars.

astro-ph;0211029	high-velocity regions in planetary nebulae	the internal velocity fields of planetary nebulae are studied with aresolution of 5 km s$^{-1}$. we analyze deep echelle spectra from three nebulaein the bulge, the sagittarius dwarf and the smc. no effects of metallicity isseen, except possibly a slower onset of the fast wind from the central star.robust evidence is found for the existence of a high-velocity shock at theinner edges of the nebulae. such a shock is predicted in hydrodynamical modelsbut had not previously been observed. the shock gas is accelerated by the fastwind from the central star. a similar shock at the outer edges traces theexpansion of the ionized shell into the ambient agb wind. evidence forlocalized regions of high velocity is also found from lines of intermediateexcitation, for two of nebulae. we explore several possible interpretations:(1) an embedded shock at intermediate radii, as predicted by hydrodynamicmodels at the position of the outer edge of the swept-up inner shell; (2)deviations form spherical symmetry, where in some directions theintermediate-excitation lines extend into the region of the outer shock; (3) anintermediate swept-up shell, as seen in some galactic planetary nebulae. theremaining nebula, with a [wc] star, shows strong turbulence. this may trace asuperposition of many embedded shock-lets. we suggest a relation to thetime-variable [wc] wind, giving a planetary nebula subjected to a multitude ofsound waves.

astro-ph;0301393	kinematics, turbulence and evolution of planetary nebulae	this paper discusses the location of a sample of planetary nebulae on the hrdiagram. we determine the internal velocity fields of 14 planetary nebulae fromhigh-resolution echelle spectroscopy, with the help of photoionization models.the mass averaged velocity is shown to be a robust, simple parameter describingthe outflow. the expansion velocity and radius are used to define the dynamicalage; together with the stellar temperature, this gives a measurement of theluminosity and core mass of the central star. the same technique is applied toother planetary nebulae with previously measured expansion velocities, giving atotal sample of 73 objects. the objects cluster closely around the schoenbernertrack of 0.61 m_sun, with a very narrow distribution of core masses. the massesare higher than found for local white dwarfs. the luminosities determined inthis way tend to be higher by a factor of a few than those derived from thenebular luminosities. the discrepancy is highest for the hottest (most evolved)stars. we suggest photon leakage as the likely cause. the innermost regions ofthe non-[wc] nebulae tend to show strong acceleration. together with theacceleration at the ionization front, the velocity field becomes 'u'-shaped.the presence of strong turbulent motions in [wc] nebulae is confirmed. exceptfor this, we find that the [wc] stars evolve on the same tracks as non-[wc]stars.

astro-ph;0302246	obscured asymptotic giant branch variables in the large magellanic cloud  and the period-luminosity relation	the characteristics of oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, large amplitude (dk&gt;0.4mag), asymptotic giant branch variables in the large magellanic clouds arediscussed, with an emphasis on those obscured by dust. near-infraredphotometry, obtained over about 8 years, is combined with publishedmid-infrared observations from iras and iso to determine bolometric magnitudesfor 42 stars. pulsation periods of the o-rich stars are in the range 116&lt;p&lt;1393days, while those for c-rich stars have 298&lt;p&lt;939 days. in addition to theregular pulsations, one o-rich star and four c-rich stars show large amplitude,dk&gt; 0.6 mag, secular or very long period variations which may be associatedwith changes in their mass-loss rates. we discuss and compare various methodsof determining the bolometric magnitudes and show, perhaps surprisingly, thatmost of the very long period stars seem to follow an extrapolation of theperiod-luminosity relation determined for stars with shorter periods - althoughthe details do depend on how the bolometric magnitudes are calculated. threestars with thin shells, which are clearly more luminous than the obscured agbstars, are undergoing hot bottom burning, while other stars with similarluminosities have yet to be investigated in sufficient detail to determinetheir status in this regard. we suggest that an apparent change in slope of theperiod luminosity relation around 400-420 days is caused by variables withluminosities brighter than the predictions of the core-mass luminosityrelation, due to excess flux from hot bottom burning.

astro-ph;0410120	the agb superwind speed at low metallicity	we present the results of a survey for oh maser emission at 1612 mhz fromdust-enshrouded agb stars and supergiants in the lmc and smc, with the parkesradio telescope, aimed at deriving the speed of the superwind from thedouble-peaked oh maser profiles. out of 8 targets in the lmc we detected 5, ofwhich 3 are new detections - no maser emission was detected in the two smctargets. we detected for the first time the redshifted components of the ohmaser profile in the extreme red supergiant iras 04553-6825, confirming thesuspicion that its wind speed had been severely underestimated. despite a muchimproved spectrum for iras 04407-7000, which was known to exhibit asingle-peaked oh maser, no complementary peak could be detected. the newdetection in iras 05003-6712 was also single-peaked, but for two other newdetections, iras 04498-6842 and iras 05558-7000, wind speeds could bedetermined from their double-peaked maser profiles. the complete sample ofknown oh/ir stars in the lmc is compared with a sample of oh/ir stars in thegalactic centre. the lmc sources generally show a pronounced asymmetry betweenthe bright blueshifted maser emission and weaker redshifted emission, which weattribute to the greater contribution of amplification of radiation comingdirectly from the star itself as the lmc sources are both more luminous andless dusty than their galactic centre counterparts. we confirm that the ohmaser strength is a measure of the dust (rather than gas) mass-loss rate. at agiven luminosity or pulsation period, the wind speed in lmc sources is lowerthan in galactic centre sources, and the observed trends confirm simpleradiation-driven wind theory if the dust-to-gas ratio is approximatelyproportional to the metallicity.

astro-ph;0504379	an empirical formula for the mass-loss rates of dust-enshrouded red  supergiants and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars	we present an empirical determination of the mass-loss rate as a function ofstellar luminosity and effective temperature, for oxygen-rich dust-enshroudedasymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants. to this aim we obtainedoptical spectra of a sample of dust-enshrouded red giants in the largemagellanic cloud, which we complemented with spectroscopic and infraredphotometric data from the literature. two of these turned out to be hotemission-line stars, of which one is a definite b[e] star. the mass-loss rateswere measured through modelling of the spectral energy distributions. we thusobtain the mass-loss rate formula log mdot = -5.65 + 1.05 log(l / 10,000 lsun)-6.3 log(teff / 3500 k), valid for dust-enshrouded red supergiants andoxygen-rich agb stars. despite the low metallicity of the lmc, both agb starsand red supergiants are found at late spectral types. a comparison withgalactic agb stars and red supergiants shows excellent agreement between themass-loss rate as predicted by our formula and that derived from the 60 micronflux density for dust-enshrouded objects, but not for optically bright objects.we discuss the possible implications of this for the mass-loss mechanism.

astro-ph;0510510	very large telescope three micron spectra of dust-enshrouded red giants  in the large magellanic cloud	we present eso/vlt spectra in the 2.9--4.1 micron range for a large sample ofinfrared stars in the large magellanic cloud (lmc), selected on the basis ofmsx and 2mass colours to be extremely dust-enshrouded agb star candidates. outof 30 targets, 28 are positively identified as carbon stars, significantlyadding to the known population of optically invisible carbon stars in the lmc.we also present spectra for six ir-bright stars in or near three clusters inthe lmc, identifying four of them as carbon stars and two as oxygen-richsupergiants. we analyse the molecular bands of c2h2 at 3.1 and 3.8 micron, hcnat 3.57 micron, and sharp absorption features in the 3.70--3.78 micron regionthat we attribute to c2h2. there is evidence for a generally high abundance ofc2h2 in lmc carbon stars, suggestive of high carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratiosat the low metallicity in the lmc. the low initial metallicity is also likelyto have resulted in less abundant hcn and cs. the sample of ir carbon starsexhibits a range in c2h2:hcn abundance ratio. we do not find strongcorrelations between the properties of the molecular atmosphere andcircumstellar dust envelope, but the observed differences in the strengths andshapes of the absorption bands can be explained by differences in excitationtemperature. high mass-loss rates and strong pulsation would then be seen to beassociated with a large scale height of the molecular atmosphere.

astro-ph;0512028	the shaping of planetary nebula sh 2-188 through interaction with the  interstellar medium	sh 2-188 is an example of strong interaction between a planetary nebula (pn)and the interstellar medium (ism). its structure is postulated to be the resultof motion through the ism. we present new h$\alpha$ images from the isaacnewton telescope photometric h$\alpha$ survey of the northern galactic planewhich reveal new structure. the nebula extends 15 arcmin on the sky in total.we have developed a `triple-wind' hydrodynamical model, comprising of theinitial `slow' asymptotic giant branch (agb) wind and the later `fast' stellarwind plus a third wind reflecting the motion through the ism. simulations atvarious velocities of the central star relative to the ism indicate that a highvelocity of 125 kms is required to reproduce the observed structure. we findmost of the structure already forms during the agb phase. the closure of thering arises from the slow--fast wind interaction. most of the mass lost on theagb has been swept downstream, providing a potential explanation of the missingmass problem in pne. we report a proper motion for the central star of 30 masyr^-1 in the direction of the bright limb, implying a distance to the nebula of850^{+500}_{-420} pc, consistent with a spectroscopic distances. expansionvelocities measured from spectroscopic data are consistent with velocitiesmeasured from the simulation. the model shows that the size of the pn wasalready set during the agb phase.

astro-ph;0602531	a spitzer mid-infrared spectral survey of mass-losing carbon stars in  the large magellanic cloud	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic survey of mass-losingcarbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the large magellanic cloud. thespectra cover the wavelength range 5--38 micron. they show varying combinationsof dust continuum, dust emission features (sic, mgs) and molecular absorptionbands (c2h2, hcn). a set of four narrow bands, dubbed the manchester system, isused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. the relationsbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecularfeatures are studied, and are compared to galactic stars of similar colours.the circumstellar 7-micron c2h2 band is found to be stronger at lowermetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.this is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher c/o ratios at lowmetallicity (less o). a possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in ourspectra may be due to c3. this band has also been identified with interstellarsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. the line-to-continuum ratio of thesic and mgsbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. the mgs band isonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 k. we discuss the selection of carbonversus oxygen-rich agb stars using the j-k vs. k-a colours, and show that thesecolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. metal-poor carbon starsform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. the formation efficiencyof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. we suggest that inlower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the interstellar medium byagb stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,as compare to the galaxy.

astro-ph;0606745	a close look into the carbon disk at the core of the planetary nebula  cpd-568032	we present high spatial resolution observations of the dusty core of theplanetary nebula with wolf-rayet central star cpd-568032. these observationswere taken with the mid-infrared interferometer vlti/midi in imaging modeproviding a typical 300 mas resolution and in interferometric mode usingut2-ut3 47m baseline providing a typical spatial resolution of 20 mas. thevisible hst images exhibit a complex multilobal geometry dominated by faintlobes. the farthest structures are located at 7" from the star. the mid-irenvironment of cpd-568032 is dominated by a compact source, barely resolved bya single ut telescope in a 8.7 micron filter. the infrared core is almost fullyresolved with the three 40-45m projected baselines ranging from -5 to 51 degreebut smooth oscillating fringes at low level have been detected in spectrallydispersed visibilities. this clear signal is interpreted in terms of a ringstructure which would define the bright inner rim of the equatorial disk.geometric models allowed us to derive the main geometrical parameters of thedisk. for instance, a reasonably good fit is reached with an achromatic andelliptical truncated gaussian with a radius of 97+/-11 au, an inclination of28+/-7 degree and a pa for the major axis at 345+/-7 degree. furthermore, weperformed some radiative transfer modeling aimed at further constraining thegeometry and mass content of the disk, by taking into account the mididispersed visibilities, spectra, and the large aperture sed of the source.these models show that the disk is mostly optically thin in the n band andhighly flared.

astro-ph;0610558	binary central stars of planetary nebulae	this paper reviews our knowledge on binary central stars of planetary nebulaeand presents some personal opinions regarding their evolution. three types ofinteractions are distinguished: type i, where the binary companion induces themass loss; type ii, where it shapes the mass loss but does not enhance it; typeiii, where a wide orbit causes the centre of mass to move, leading to a spiralembedded in the wind. surveys for binary central stars are discussed, and theseparations are compared to the distribution for binary post-agb stars. theeffect of close binary evolution on nebular morphology is discussed.post-common-envelope binaries are surrounded by thin, expanding disks, expelledin the orbital plane. wider binaries give rise to much thicker expanding torii.type i binary evolution predicts a wide distribution of masses of centralstars, skewed towards low masses. comparison with observed mass distributionssuggests that this is unlikely to be the only channel leading to the formationof a planetary nebula. a new sample of compact bulge nebulae shows about 40% ofnebulae with binary-induced morphologies.

astro-ph;0611071	spitzer spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we present spitzer space telescope spectroscopic observations of 14carbon-rich agb stars in the small magellanic cloud. sic dust is seen in mostof the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to lmc stars. the sic featureis strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what isobserved for galactic stars. we argue that in the smc, sic forms at lowertemperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in thegalaxy where sic condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. dust inputinto the interstellar medium by agb stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,with little sic or silicate dust. only the two coolest stars show a 30-micronband due to mgs dust. we suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the smc,mass-losing agb stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth andtherefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allowtemperatures below the 650 k necessary for mgs to exist as a solid. gas phasec$_2$h$_2$ bands are stronger in the smc than in the lmc or galaxy. this isattributed to an increasing c/o ratio at low metallicity. we present acolour-colour diagram based on spitzer irac and mips colours to discriminatebetween o- and c-rich stars. we show that agb stars in the smc become carbonstars early in the thermal-pulsing agb evolution, and remain optically visiblefor $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. for the lmc, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$yr. the superwind phase traced with spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. spitzerspectra of a k supergiant and a compact hii region are also given.

astro-ph;9403036	radio and infrared emission from a [wc]-type planetary nebula in the lmc	radio continuum emission has been detected from a planetary nebula in thelarge magellanic cloud: this is the first radio continuum detection for anyplanetary nebula outside our galaxy. the radio flux density is a factor of twolower than predicted from the \hbeta\ flux. this could be due either to atwo-component morphology or to a stellar contribution to the \hbeta\ emission.we have modeled the optical and infrared spectrum using the photo-ionisationcode cloudy: a very good fit is obtained if we assume the nebula is carbonrich. the derived diameter implies an evolutionary age of the nebula of$&lt;1000\yr$, similar to what is derived from the iras colours alone. the centralstar, which is of [wc] type, has a much higher stellar temperature thangalactic [wc] stars showing similar circumstellar iras colours. an explanationcould be that the expansion velocity of the nebula is lower than those of itsgalactic counterparts. this radio detection indicates that accurate nebularluminosities could be determined from their radio emission for many lmcplanetary nebulae.

astro-ph;9510069	obscured agb stars in the magellanic clouds ii. near-infrared and  mid-infrared counterparts	we have carried out an infrared search for obscured agb stars in themagellanic clouds. the survey uncovered a number of obscured agb stars as wellas some supergiants with infrared excess. we present photometry of the sourcesand discuss the colour diagrams and bolometric luminosities. most of the agbstars are luminous, often close to the classical limit of $m_{\rm bol}=-7.1$.  to determine whether the stars are oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, we haveacquired narrow-band mid-infrared photometry with the eso timmi camera forseveral sources. all but one are found to show the silicate feature andtherefore to have oxygen-rich dust: the colours of the remaining source areconsistent with either an oxygen-rich or a carbon-rich nature. a method todistinguish carbon and oxygen stars based on h$-$k versus k$-$[12] colours ispresented.  we discuss several methods of calculating the mass-loss rate: for the agbstars the mass-loss rates vary between approximately 5 times 10**-4 and 5 times10**-6 solar masses per year, depending on assumed dust-to-gas mass ratio. wepresent a new way to calculate mass-loss rates from the oh-maser emission. wefind no evidence for a correlation of the mass-loss rates with luminosity inthese obscured stars. neither do the mass-loss rates for the lmc and smc starsdiffer in any clear systematic way from each other. expansion velocities appearto be slightly lower in the lmc than in the galaxy.  period determinations are discussed for two sources: the periods arecomparable to those of the longer-period galactic oh/ir stars. all of theluminous stars for which periods are available, have significantly higherluminosities than predicted from the period--luminosity relations.

astro-ph;9601041	discovery of the first extra-galactic sio maser	we report on the detection of sio j=2--1 v=1 (86 ghz) maser emission from thered supergiant iras04553--6825 in the lmc. it has thereby become the firstknown source of sio maser emission outside the milky way. we used theswedish-eso submm telescope at the european southern observatory at la silla.with the help of good atmospheric conditions, the excellent performance of thebrand new 3~mm sis receiver, and 26 hours total observing time we reduced thenoise level to only 63~mjy rms. this allowed us to detect the 0.28~jy maserpeak. integrating the flux of the maser profile resulted in a 6.9~${\sigma}$detection. the sio maser peak was situated 16~km~s$^{-1}$ redward of the centerof the already known, double peaked oh maser emission. we argue that the siomaser peak velocity coincides with the stellar velocity, which is supported bya spectrum of h$\alpha$ that we took four months later. this would mean thatthe outflow velocity of the circumstellar matter around iras04553--6825 isv$_{\rm exp} \sim 26$~km~s$^{-1}$, which is typical for galactic redsupergiants, instead of the abnormally low 11~km~s$^{-1}$ inferred from the ohdata alone. the peak intensity of the sio maser emission is not incompatiblewith ranges found in galactic rsgs, but the total integrated photon flux islower than expected for this extremely red and luminous supergiant.

astro-ph;9704201	obscured asymptotic giant branch stars in the magellanic clouds iii. new  iras counterparts	we have searched for near-infrared stellar counterparts of iras point sourcesin the large magellanic cloud (lmc), in j and k-bands. this resulted in thedetection of 21 counterparts, of which 19 are new discoveries. usingcolour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams, we identify 13 asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars with thick circumstellar dust envelopes, 7 possible earlypost-agb stars or stars recovering from a thermal pulse, and 1 red supergiantor foreground star. for 10 of the iras targets we do not succeed in detectingand/or identifying a near-infrared counterpart. we serendipitously detect 14other red sources, of which 2 are known long period variables, and a fewgalaxies. the near-infrared and optical colours of the galaxies may indicateconsiderable interstellar extinction through the lmc, as much as a_v about 2-4mag. the relative number of agb carbon stars over oxygen stars is shown todecrease as the luminosity increases. yet amongst the faintest mass-losing agbstars oxygen-rich stars still exist, which puts constraints on currentconvection theories that predict the occurrence of third dredge-up and hotbottom burning. we investigate the nature of some lmc stars that have infraredproperties very similar to suspected galactic post-agb stars.

astro-ph;9709119	obscured asymptotic giant branch stars in the magellanic clouds iv.  carbon stars and oh/ir stars	we present n-band photometry for a sample of 21 dust- enshrouded agb stars inthe large magellanic cloud, and three additional sources in the smallmagellanic cloud. together with near-ir photometry, this is used to give atentative classification into carbon and oxygen-rich atmospheres. bolometricluminosities are also estimated for these stars. in addition, we present theresults of a survey for oh masers in the lmc, which resulted in the discoveryof oh maser emission from iras04407-7000. spectra between 600 and 1000 nm havebeen obtained for two heavily obscured agb stars in the lmc, confirming them tobe highly reddened very late m-type giants. because the dust-enshrouded starsare clearly undergoing heavy mass loss they are assumed to be very near thetermination of their respective asymptotic giant branch phases. the fraction ofmass-losing carbon stars decreases with increasing luminosity, as expected fromhot bottom burning. the best candidate carbon star, with m_bol = -6.8 mag, isthe most luminous mass-losing carbon star in the magellanic clouds, and amongstthe most luminous agb stars. at lower luminosities (m_bol = -5 mag) both oxygenand carbon stars are found. this may be explained by a range in metallicity ofthe individual mass-losing agb stars.

astro-ph;9812330	a dwarf irregular galaxy at the edge of the local group: stellar  populations and distance of ic 5152	we have obtained v and i-band photometry for about 700 stars in the field ofthe dwarf irregular galaxy ic 5152, previously considered a possible member ofthe local group. deep vi color-magnitude diagrams are presented of the mainbody of this galaxy and of a nearby field. we infer a distance by comparisonwith the vi color-magnitude diagrams of similar galaxies and with theoreticalisochrones. the distance modulus to ic 5152 is found to be m-mo = 26.15 +/-0.2, adopting e(v-i) = 0. this distance of d=1.7 mpc implies that ic 5152 isnot a certain member of the local group. we also construct a deep opticalluminosity function. by comparison with theoretical isochrones, we find ametallicity z of approximately 0.002, which is lower than previous estimates.using this metallicity and distance, ic 5152 now fits themetallicity-luminosity relation for dwarf galaxies. the youngest stars in thefield studied have an age of ~10^7 gyr, and there is a substantial populationof stars with log t&gt;7.8-8 yr. the central region of ic 5152 is an active siteof star formation, as found by comparing our optical photometry with hubblespace telescope ultraviolet images. several candidate globular clusters arefound, as well as a candidate for a potential nucleus.

astro-ph;9902284	luminous carbon stars in the magellanic clouds	we present ground-based 3 micron spectra of obscured asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars in the magellanic clouds (mcs). we identify the carbon stars on thebasis of the 3.1 micron absorption by hcn and c2h2 molecules.  we show evidence for the existence of carbon stars up to the highest agbluminosities (mbol=-7 mag, for a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.7 mag). thisproves that hot bottom burning (hbb) cannot, in itself, prevent massive agbstars from becoming carbon star before leaving the agb. it also sets an upperlimit to the distance modulus of the large magellanic cloud of 18.8 mag.  the equivalent width of the absorption band decreases with redder (k-l)colour when the dust continuum emission becomes stronger than the photosphericemission. carbon stars with similar (k-l) appear to have equally strong 3micron absorption in the mcs and the milky way. we discuss the implications forthe carbon and nitrogen enrichment of the stellar photosphere of carbon stars.

astro-ph;9909416	mass-loss rates and luminosity functions of dust-enshrouded agb stars  and red supergiants in the lmc	a radiative transfer code is used to model the spectral energy distributionsof 57 mass-losing asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and red supergiants(rsgs) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) for which iso spectroscopic andphotometric data are available. as a result we derive mass-loss rates andbolometric luminosities.  a gap in the luminosity distribution around m_bol = -7.5 mag separates agbstars from rsgs. the luminosity distributions of optically bright carbon stars,dust-enshrouded carbon stars and dust-enshrouded m-type stars have only littleoverlap, suggesting that the dust-enshrouded agb stars are at the very tip ofthe agb and will not evolve significantly in luminosity before mass loss endstheir agb evolution.  derived mass-loss rates span a range from mdot about 10^-7 to 10^-3 m_sun/yr.more luminous and cooler stars are found to reach higher mass-loss rates. thehighest mass-loss rates exceed the classical limit set by the momentum of thestellar radiation field, l/c, by a factor of a few due to multiple scatteringof photons in the circumstellar dust envelope. mass-loss rates are lower thanthe mass consumption rate by nuclear burning, mdot_nuc, for most of the rsgs.two rsgs have mdot &gt;&gt; mdot_nuc, however, suggesting that rsgs shed most oftheir stellar mantles in short phases of intense mass loss. stars on thethermal pulsing agb may also experience episodes of intensified mass loss, buttheir quiescent mass-loss rates are usually already higher than mdot_nuc.
