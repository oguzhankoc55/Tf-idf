0706.1500	x-ray flares in orion low mass stars	context. x-ray flares are common phenomena in pre-main sequence stars. theiranalysis gives insights into the physics at work in young stellar coronae. theorion nebula cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples ofyoung low mass stars. this work is part of the chandra orion ultradeep project(coup), an ~10 day long x-ray observation of the orion nebula cluster (onc).aims. our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variabilityof 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 m_sun) onc members in order to test and constrain thephysical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. methods.we adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed x-raylight curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude andtime derivative of the count-rate. we then derive the frequency and energydistribution of the flares. results. the high energy tail of the energydistribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index 2.2. we testthe hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares witha single power law energy distribution. we constrain the parameters of thissimple model for every single light curve. the analysis of synthetic lightcurves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observeddata. comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2m_sun),we establish that, at ~1 myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar x-rayluminosity have very similar flare frequencies. conclusions. our observationalresults are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves areentirely built by over- lapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution;the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge andform a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.

0904.1371	on the classification of flaring states of blazar	the time evolution of the electromagnetic emission from blazars, inparticular high frequency peaked sources (hbls), displays irregular activitynot yet understood. in this work we report a methodology capable ofcharacterizing the time behavior of these variable objects. the maximumlikelihood blocks (mlbs) is a model-independent estimator which sub-divides thelight curve into time blocks, whose length and amplitude are compatible withstates of constant emission rate of the observed source. the mlbs yields thestatistical significance in the rate variations and strongly suppresses thenoise fluctuations in the light curves. we apply the mlbs for the first time onthe long term x-ray light curves (rxte/asm) of mkn~421,mkn~501, 1es 1959+650and 1es 2155-304, which consist of more than 10 years of observational data(1996-2007). using the mlbs interpretation of rxte/asm data, the integratedtime flux distribution is determined for each single source considered. weidentify in these distributions the characteristic level as well as the flaringstates of the blazars. all the distributions show a significant component atnegative flux values, most probably caused by an uncertainty in the backgroundsubtraction and by intrinsic fluctuations of rxte/asm. this effect interests inparticular short time observations. in order to quantify the probability thatthe intrinsic fluctuations give rise to a false identification of a flare, westudy a population of very faint sources and their integrated time fluxdistribution. we determine duty cycle or fraction of time a source spent in theflaring state of the source mkn~421, mkn~501, 1es 1959+650 and 1es 2155-304.moreover, we study the random coincidences between flares and generic sporadicevents such as high energy neutrinos or flares in other wavelengths.

0905.1840	metallicity of low-mass stars in orion	determining the metal content of low-mass members of young associationsprovides a tool that addresses different issues, such as triggered starformation or the link between the metal-rich nature of planet-host stars andthe early phases of planet formation. the orion complex is a well known exampleof possible triggered star formation and is known to host a rich variety ofproto-planetary disks around its low-mass stars. available metallicitymeasurements yield discrepant results. we analyzed flames/uves and giraffespectra of low-mass members of three groups/clusters belonging to the orionassociation. our goal is the homogeneous determination of the metallicity ofthe sample stars, which allows us to look for [fe/h] differences between thethree regions and for the possible presence of metal-rich stars. nine membersof the onc and one star each in the $\lambda$ ori cluster and ob1b subgroupwere analyzed. after the veiling determination, we retrieved the metallicity bymeans of equivalent widths and/or spectral synthesis using moog. we obtain anaverage metallicity for the onc [fe/h]=-0.01\pm 0.04. no metal-rich stars weredetected and the dispersion within our sample is consistent with measurementuncertainties. the metallicity of the $\lambda$ ori member is also solar, whilethe ob1b star has an [fe/h] significantly below the onc average. if confirmedby additional [fe/h] determinations in the ob1b subgroup, this result wouldsupport the triggered star formation and the self-enrichment scenario for theorion complex.

0906.4700	results from droxo. ii. - [ne ii] and x-ray emission from rho ophiuchi  young stellar objects	the infrared [ne ii] and [ne iii] fine structure lines at 12.81um and 15.55umare predicted to trace the circumstellar disk gas subject to x-ray heating andionization. we investigate the origin of these lines by comparing observationswith models of x-ray irradiated disks and by searching for empiricalcorrelations between the line luminosities and stellar and circumstellarparameters. we measure neon line fluxes and x-ray luminosities for 28 youngstellar objects in the rho ophiuchi star formation region for which goodquality infrared spectra and x-ray data have been obtained, the former with thespitzer irs and the latter with the deep rho ophiuchi xmm-newton observation.  we detect the [ne ii] and the [ne iii] lines in 10 and 1 cases, respectively.line luminosities show no correlation with x-ray emission. the luminosity ofthe [ne ii] line for one star, and that of both the [ne ii] and [ne iii] linesfor a second star, match the predictions of published models of x-rayirradiated disks; for the remaining 8 objects the [ne ii] emission is 1-3 dexhigher than predicted on the basis of their l_x. class i objects showsignificantly stronger [ne ii] lines than class ii and class iii ones. acorrelation is moreover found between the [ne ii] line emission and the diskmass accretion rates. this might point toward a role of accretion-generated uvemission in the generation of the line or to other mechanisms related to massinflows from circumstellar disks and envelopes and/or to the associated massoutflows (winds and jets). we conclude that the x-ray luminosity is not theonly parameter that determines the [ne ii] emission. explaining the strong [neii] emission of class i objects likely requires the inclusion in the models ofadditional physical components such as the envelope, inflows, and outflows.

0906.5222	hard x-ray flux from low-mass stars in the cygnus ob2 association	context. the cygnus ob2 association, the central engine of the cygnus xstar-forming region, is the subject of an extensive integral key project thatwill accumulate 6ms of observations. analysis of 2ms of observations by debecker and co-workers provides the most sensitive limit yet obtained on hardx-ray emission from the cluster. aims. we investigate the x-ray emission in the20-40 kev band expected from the flaring low-mass stellar population in cygnusob2. we discuss whether such emission needs to be considered in theinterpretation of existing and future x-ray observations of the region, andwhether such observations might provide insight into the high-energy processeson low-mass pre-main sequence stars. methods. the total hard x-ray flux fromlow-mass stars is estimated by assuming the observed soft x-ray emission stemsfrom a superposition of flares. we further assume the ratio of hard x-ray tosoft x-ray emission is described by a scaling found for solar flares by isolaand co-workers. results. we estimate the low-mass stellar hard x-ray flux inthe 20-40 kev band to lie in the range ~2x10^31-6x10^32 erg/s and discuss somepotential biases that might affect this result. conclusions. hard x-rayemission could lie at a level not much below the current observed flux upperlimits for cygnus ob2. if this emission could be detected, it would provideinsight into the hard x-ray production of large flares on pre-main sequencestars. we highlight the penetrating power of hard x-rays from low-mass stellarpopulations as a possible pointer to our galaxy's hidden star-forming clustersand super-clusters using more sensitive observations from future missions.

1005.4384	accretion dynamics and disk evolution in ngc 2264: a study based on the  corot photometric observations	the young cluster ngc 2264 was observed with the corot satellite for 23 daysuninterruptedly in march 2008 with unprecedent photometric accuracy. we presenthere the first results of the analysis of the accreting population. we intendedto look for possible light curve variability of the same nature as thatobserved in the classical t tauri star aa tau, which was attributed to amagnetically controlled inner disk warp, which is directly associated with theinteraction between the stellar magnetic field and the inner disk region. weanalysed the corot light curves of 83 previously known classical t tauri starsthat belong to ngc 2264 and classified them according to their morphology. wealso studied the corot light curve morphology as a function of a spitzer-basedclassification of the star-disk systems. the classification derived on thebasis of the corot light curve morphology agrees very well with the spitzerirac-based classification of the systems. the percentage of aa tau-like lightcurves decreases as the inner disk dissipates, from 40% +- 10% in systems withthick inner disks to 36% +- 16% in systems with anemic disks and none in nakedphotosphere systems. indeed, 91% +- 29% of the ctts with naked photospheresexhibit pure spot-like variability, while only 18% +- 7% of the thick disksystems do so, presumably those seen at low inclination and thus free ofvariable obscuration. aa tau-like light curves are found to be fairly common,with a frequency of at least ~ 30 to 40% in young stars with inner dusty disks.the temporal evolution of the light curves indicates that the structure of theinner disk warp, located close to the corotation radius and responsible for theobscuration episodes, varies over a timescale of a few (~ 1-3) rotationalperiods. this probably reflects the highly dynamical nature of the star-diskmagnetospheric interaction.

1006.0041	correlated optical and x-ray variability in ctts - indications of  absorption-modulated emission	optical and x-ray emission from classical t tauri stars (cttss) has long beenknown to be highly variable. our long, uninterrupted optical observation of thengc2264 region with corot allows the optical variability in ctts to be studiedwith unprecedented accuracy and time coverage. two short chandra observationsobtained during the corot pointing with a separation of 16 days allow us tostudy whether there is a correlation between optical and x-ray variability onthis timescale, thus probing the physical mechanisms driving the variability inboth bands. we have computed the optical and x-ray fractional variabilitybetween the two 30 ks duration windows covered by both the chandra and corotobservations, for a sample of classical and weak line t tauri stars (wttss) inngc2264. a scatter plot clearly shows that the variability of cttss in theoptical and soft x-ray (0.5-1.5 kev) bands is correlated, while no correlationis apparent in the hard (1.5-8.0 kev) band. also, no correlation in either bandis present for wttss. we show that the correlation between soft x-ray andoptical variability of cttss can be naturally explained in terms oftime-variable shading (absorption) from circumstellar material orbiting thestar, in a scenario rather similar to the one invoked to explain the observedphenomenology in the ctts aa tau. the slope of the observed correlation implies(in the hypothesis of homogeneous shading) a significant dust depletion in thecircumstellar material (with a gas-to-dust ratio approximately 5 times lowerthan the standard value for interstellar material).

0708.2399	x-ray flaring from the young stars in cygnusob2	aims: we characterize individual and ensemble properties of x-ray flares fromstars in the cygob2 and onc star-forming regions. method: we analyzed x-raylightcurves of 1003 cygob2 sources observed with chandra for 100 ksec and of1616 onc sources detected in the ``chandra orion ultra-deep project'' 850 ksecobservation. we employed a binning-free maximum likelihood method to segmentthe light-curves into intervals of constants signal and identified flares onthe basis of both the amplitude and the time-derivative of the sourceluminosity. we then derived and compared the flare frequency and energydistribution of cygob2 and onc sources. the effect of the length of theobservation on these results was investigated by repeating the statisticalanalysis on five 100 ksec-long segments extracted from the onc data. results:we detected 147 and 954 flares from the cygob2 and onc sources, respectively.the flares in cygob2 have decay times ranging from ~0.5 to about 10 hours. theflare energy distributions of all considered flare samples are described athigh energies well by a power law with index alpha=-(2.1+-0.1). at lowenergies, the distributions flatten, probably because of detectionincompleteness. we derived average flare frequencies as a function of flareenergy. the flare frequency is seen to depend on the source's intrinsic x-rayluminosity, but its determination is affected by the length of the observation.the slope of the high-energy tail of the energy distribution is, however,affected little. a comparison of cygob2 and onc sources, accounting forobservational biases, shows that the two populations, known to have similarx-ray emission levels, have very similar flare activity.

0710.1947	results from droxo. i. the variability of fluorescent fe 6.4 kev  emission in the young star elias 29: high-energy electrons in the star's  accretion tubes?	aims. we study the variability of the fe 6.4 kev emission line from the classi young stellar object elias 29 in the rho-oph cloud. methods. we analysed thedata from elias 29 collected by xmm during a nine-day, nearly continuousobservation of the rho-oph star-forming region (the deep rho-oph x-rayobservation, named droxo). the data were subdivided into six homogeneous timeintervals, and the six resulting spectra were individually analysed. results.we detect significant variability in the equivalent width of the fe 6.4 kevemission line from elias 29. the 6.4 kev line is absent during the first timeinterval of observation and appears at its maximum strength during the secondtime interval (90 ks after elias 29 undergoes a strong flare). the x-raythermal emission is unchanged between the two observation segments, while linevariability is present at a 99.9% confidence level. given the significant linevariability in the absence of variations in the x-ray ionising continuum andthe weakness of the photoionising continuum from the star's thermal x-rayemission, we suggest that the fluorescence may be induced by collisionalionisation from an (unseen) population of non-thermal electrons. we speculateon the possibility that the electrons are accelerated in a reconnection eventof a magnetically confined accretion loop, connecting the young star to itscircumstellar disk.

1111.4420	x-ray view of ic348 in the light of an updated cluster census	we study the properties of the coronae of the low-mass stars in the young(~2-3myr), nearby (~310pc) open cluster ic348 combining x-ray andoptical/infrared data. the four existing chandra observations of ic348 aremerged, thus providing a deeper and spatially more complete x-ray view thanprevious x-ray studies of the cluster. we have compiled a comprehensive catalogof ic348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. ourdata collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excessindicating the presence of disks, halpha emission as a tracer of chromosphericemission or accretion and mass accretion rates. we have detected 290 x-raysources in four merged chandra exposures, of which 187 are associated withknown cluster members. only four of the x-ray sources are brown dwarfs(spectral type m6 and later). the detection rate is highest for diskless classiii stars and increases with stellar mass. this may be explained with higherx-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evidentin the x-ray luminosity functions. in particular, we find that for the lowestexamined masses (0.1-0.25 msun) there is a difference between the x-rayluminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on thebasis of their halpha emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing anddiskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energydistribution). these differences disappear for higher masses. this is relatedto our finding that the l_x/l_bol ratio is non-constant across themass/luminosity sequence of ic348 with a decrease towards lower luminositystars. our analysis of an analogous stellar sample in the orion nebula clustersuggests that the decline of l_x/l_ bol for young stars at the low-mass end ofthe stellar sequence is likely universal.

1201.0184	high resolution spectroscopy of ne ii emission from young stellar  objects	constraining the spatial and thermal structure of the gaseous component ofcircumstellar disks is crucial to understand star and planet formation. modelspredict that the [ne ii] line at 12.81 {\mu}m detected in young stellar objectswith spitzer traces disk gas and its response to high energy radiation, butsuch [ne ii] emission may also originate in shocks within powerful outflows. todistinguish between these potential origins for mid-infrared [ne ii] emissionand to constrain disk models, we observed 32 young stellar objects using thehigh resolution (r~30000) mid-infrared spectrograph visir at the vlt. wedetected the 12.81 {\mu}m [ne ii] line in 12 objects, tripling the number ofdetections of this line in young stellar objects with high spatial and spectralresolution spectrographs. we obtain the following main results: a) in class iobjects the [ne ii] emission observed from spitzer is mainly due to gas at adistance of more than 20-40 au from the star, where neon is, most likely,ionized by shocks due to protostellar outflows. b) in transition andpre-transition disks, most of the emission is confined to the inner disk,within 20-40 au from the central star. c) detailed analysis of line profilesindicates that, in transition and pre-transition disks, the line is slightlyblue-shifted (2-12 km s{^-1}) with respect to the stellar velocity, and theline width is directly correlated with the disk inclination, as expected if theemission is due to a disk wind. d) models of euv/x-ray irradiated disksreproduce well the observed relation between the line width and the diskinclination, but underestimate the blue-shift of the line.

1210.6770	x-ray variability of pms stars - toward an explanation of the different  x-ray properties of ctts and wtts	the intense x-ray emission from coronae and accretion shocks in young pmsstars is likely to play an important role in the evolution and dispersal ofcircumstellar disks. several aspects of the physics of this x-ray emissionremain mysterious, e.g., whether and how much accretion affects coronalemission.  we studied the x-ray variability of ~1 myr old low-mass pms stars as afunction of timescale, stellar rotation, and stellar characteristics, in orderto gain insights on the working of pms coronae, their x-ray emission, and thecircumstellar environment in which they are immersed.  we have exploited the ~850 ksec long chandra observation of the orion nebulacluster obtained by the coup collaboration in jan. 2003, and statisticallyanalyzed the x-ray lightcurves of low-mass stars in several subsamples. inparticular, we characterized the different x-ray behavior of stars with andwithout circumstellar accretion disks.  accreting stars (classical t tauri stars, cttss) are found to be morevariable than non accreting ones (weak-lined t tauri stars, wttss) at alltimescales and in all the x-ray energy bands considered. variability is seen toincrease with time-scale up to ~10 days, i.e. the longest probed. signatures ofrotational modulation are observed for both cttss and wttss, and most clearlyfor cttss in the soft x-ray band. lower mass stars are more variable thanhigher mass ones.  we propose that the difference in variability between cttss and wttss may beexplained assuming that the x-ray emission of ctts is affected by time-variableabsorption due circumstellar structures, such as warps in the inner disk and/oraccretion streams. this suggestion is appealing because, in the hypothesis thatthe coronae of cttss and wttss are similar, it may also explain why cttss havelower and more scattered x-ray emission levels with respect to wttss.

0712.2975	x-ray properties of protostars in the orion nebula	the origin and evolution of the x-rays in very young stellar objects (ysos)are not yet well understood since it is very hard to observe ysos in theprotostellar phase. we study the x-ray properties of class 0-i objects in theorion nebula cluster (onc) and compare them with those of the more evolvedclass ii and iii members. using chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) data, westudy the x-ray properties of stars in different evolutionary classes:luminosities, nh, temperatures and time variability are compared in order tounderstand if the interaction between the circumstellar material and thecentral object can influence the x-ray emission. we have assembled the deepestand most complete photometric catalog of objects in the onc region from the uvto 8 microns using data from hst, wfi@2.2m eso and ispi@4m ctio telescopes, andspitzer irac. we select high probability candidate class 0-i protostars,distinguishing between those having a spectral energy distribution which risesfrom k up to 8 microns (class 0-ia) from those where the sed rises from k up to4.5 microns and decreasing afterwards (class 0-ib). we select a sample of bonafide class ii stars and a set of class iii stars with ir emission consistentwith normal photospheres. our principal result is that class 0-ia objects aresignificantly less luminous in x-rays, both in the total and hard bands, thanthe more evolved class ii stars with mass larger than 0.5 msun; these lattershow x-ray luminosities similar to those of class 0-ib stars. this resultsupports the hypothesis that the onset of x-ray emission occurs at a very earlystage of star formation. temporal variability and spectral properties of class0-i stars are similar to those of the more evolved class ii and iii objects,except for a larger absorption likely due to gas in the circumstellar material.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

1405.6988	dynamical star-disk interaction in the young stellar system v354 mon	the main goal of this work is to characterize the mass accretion and ejectionprocesses of the classical t tauri star v354 mon, a member of the young stellarcluster ngc 2264. in march 2008, photometric and spectroscopic observations ofv354 mon were obtained simultaneously with the corot satellite, the 60 cmtelescope at the observat\'orio pico dos dias (lna - brazil) equipped with accd camera and johnson/cousins bvri filters, and the sophie \'echellespectrograph at the observatoire de haute-provence (cnrs - france). the lightcurve of v354 mon shows periodical minima (p = 5.26 +/- 0.50 days) that vary indepth and width at each rotational cycle. from the analysis of the photometricand spectroscopic data, it is possible to identify correlations between theemission line variability and the light-curve modulation of the young system,such as the occurrence of pronounced redshifted absorption in the h_alpha lineat the epoch of minimum flux. this is evidence that during photometric minimawe see the accretion funnel projected onto the stellar photosphere in our lineof sight, implying that the hot spot coincides with the light-curve minima. weapplied models of cold and hot spots and a model of occultation bycircumstellar material to investigate the source of the observed photometricvariations. we conclude that nonuniformly distributed material in the innerpart of the circumstellar disk is the main cause of the photometric modulation,which does not exclude the presence of hot and cold spots at the stellarsurface. it is believed that the distortion in the inner part of the disk iscreated by the dynamical interaction between the stellar magnetosphere,inclined with respect to the rotation axis, and the circumstellar disk, as alsoobserved in the classical t tauri star aa tau and predicted bymagnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations.

1407.1510	the gaia-eso survey: stellar content and elemental abundances in the  massive cluster ngc 6705	chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most globular clusters,but not in open clusters. cluster mass seems to play a key role in theexistence of multiple populations.  studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters isnecessary to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determinethe mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. here westudied ngc6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards theinner region of the milky way. this cluster is located inside the solar circle.this makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. thisstudy makes use of bvi and ri photometry and comparisons with theoreticalisochrones to derive the age of ngc6705. we study the density profile of thecluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. based on abundances ofthe chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of thegaia-eso survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of thered clump stars. radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internalkinematics of the cluster.  the estimated ages range from 250 to 316myr, depending on the adopted stellarmodel. luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of masssegregation. we derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function andfrom the kinematics, finding values between 3700 m$_{\odot}$ and 11 000m$_{\odot}$. after selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities,we obtain a metallicity of [fe/h]=0.10$\pm$0.06 based on 21 candidate members.moreover, ngc6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations oranti-correlations between al, mg, si, and na, that are expected in multiplepopulations. this is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lowerthan the required mass limit proposed in literature to develop multiplepopulations.

1408.4558	the gaia-eso survey: metallicity and kinematic trends in the milky way  bulge	(abridged) we analyzed the stellar parameters and radial velocities of ~1200stars in five bulge fields as determined from the gaia-eso survey data (idr1).we use vista variables in the via lactea (vvv) photometry to obtain reddeningvalues by using a semi-empirical t_eff-color calibration. from a gaussiandecomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clearbimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of thespecific position on the sky. in agreement with some previous studies, we finda mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b=-6 and b=-10)that arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poorcomponents. the number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poorstars with increasing b. the k-magnitude distribution of the metal-richpopulation splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersectsthe near and far branches of the x-shaped bulge structure. in addition, twolateral fields at (l,b)=(7,-9) and (l,b)=(-10,-8) present contrastingcharacteristics. in the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated bymetal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poorpopulation and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes. finally, wefind systematic differences in the velocity dispersion between the metal-richand the metal-poor components of each field. our chemo-kinematical analysis isconsistent with a varying field-to-field proportion of stars belonging to (i) ametal-rich boxy/peanut x-shaped component, with bar-like kinematics, and (ii) ametal-poor more extended rotating structure with a higher velocity dispersionthat dominates far from the galactic plane. these first ges data allow studyingthe detailed spatial dependence of the galactic bulge populations, thanks tothe analysis of individual fields with relatively high statistics.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

1504.02484	the gaia-eso survey: n-body modelling of the gamma velorum cluster	the gaia-eso survey has recently unveiled the complex kinematic signature ofthe gamma velorum cluster: this cluster is composed of two kinematicallydistinct populations (hereafter, population a and b), showing two differentvelocity dispersions and a relative ~2 km s^-1 radial velocity (rv) shift. inthis paper, we propose that the two populations of the gamma velorum clusteroriginate from two different sub-clusters, born from the same parent molecularcloud. we investigate this possibility by means of direct-summation n-bodysimulations. our scenario is able to reproduce not only the rv shift and thedifferent velocity dispersions, but also the different centroid (~0.5 pc), thedifferent spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5pc) of the two populations. the observed 1-2 myr age difference between the twopopulations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the twosub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. oursimulations suggest that population b is strongly supervirial, while populationa is close to virial equilibrium. we discuss the implications of our models forthe formation of young star clusters and ob associations in the milky way.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

1511.06900	the gaia-eso survey: stellar radii in the young open clusters ngc 2264,  ngc 2547 and ngc 2516	rapidly rotating, low-mass members of eclipsing binary systems have measuredradii significantly larger than predicted by standard models. it has beenproposed that magnetic activity is responsible for radius inflation. byestimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (ngc 2264, ngc2547, ngc 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 myr respectively), we aim toestablish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magneticallyactive stars. we use radial velocities from the gaia-eso survey (ges) andpublished photometry to establish cluster membership and combine gesmeasurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radiifor groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosityand age. the average radii are compared with the predictions of both standardevolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convectionand starspots. at a given luminosity, the stellar radii in ngc 2516 and ngc2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages ofthese clusters. the discrepancy is least pronounced and not significant ~10percent) in zams stars with radiative cores, but more significant inlower-mass, fully convective pre main-sequence cluster members, reaching30+/-10 percent. the uncertain age and distance of ngc 2264 preclude a reliabledetermination of any discrepancy for its members. the median radii we haveestimated for low-mass fully convective stars in the older clusters areinconsistent (at the 2-3 sigma level) with non-magnetic evolutionary models andmore consistent with models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields ordark starspots. the available models suggest this requires either surfacemagnetic fields exceeding 2.5 kg, spots that block about 30 per cent of thephotospheric flux, or a more moderate combination of both.

astro-ph;0208475	chandra x-ray observation of the orion nebula cluster. ii relationship  between x-ray activity indicators and stellar parameters	using the results of our first paper on the chandra hrc observation of theorion nebula cluster (onc), here we explore the relation between the coronalactivity of its 1-myr-old pre-main sequence population and stellar parameters.we find that median x-ray luminosities of low mass stars (m/m_sun &lt; 3) increasewith increasing mass and decreasing stellar age. brown dwarfs (0.03 &lt; m/m_sun &lt;0.08) follow the same trend with mass. from m~0.1 to m~0.5m_sun, medianl_x/l_bol values increase by about half an order of magnitude and then remainconstant at ~10^-3.5 for the mass range from 0.5 to 3.0 m/m_sun. in these sametwo mass ranges, l_x/l_bol remains roughly constant with age, until it drops bymore than two orders of magnitudes at the epoch when ~2-4m_sun stars areexpected to become fully radiative.  we find a dependence of l_x and l_x/l_bol on circumstellar accretionindicators and suggest three possible hypotheses for its origin. in spite ofimproved x-ray and rotational data, correlations between activity indicatorsand rotation remain elusive for these stars, possibly indicating that stars forwhich rotational periods have been measured have reached some saturation level.  our study of x-ray activity vs. stellar mass leads us to propose that the fewhrc x-ray sources not associated with any optical/infrared counterpart trace ayet to be discovered stellar population of deeply embedded, relatively massiveonc members.

astro-ph;0302329	time evolution of x-ray coronal activity in pms stars; a possible  relation with the evolution of accretion disks	we investigate the evolution of x-ray stellar activity from the age of theyoungest known star forming regions (sfr), &lt; 1myr, to about 100 myr, i.e. thezero age main sequence (zams) for a ~ 1m_sun star. we consider five sfr ofvarying age (rho ophiuchi, the orion nebula cluster, ngc 2264, chamaeleon i,and eta chamaeleontis) and two young clusters (the pleiades and ngc 2516).optical and x-ray data for these regions are retrieved both from archivalobservations and recent literature, and reanalyzed here in a consistent mannerso to minimize systematic differences in the results. we study trends of l_xand l_x/l_bol as a function of stellar mass and association age. for low massstars (m &lt; 1m_sun) we observe an increase in l_x/l_bol in the first 3-4 myr anda subsequent leveling off at the saturation level (l_x/l_bol ~ -3). slowlyevolving very low mass stars then retain saturated levels down to the oldestages here considered, while for higher mass stars activity begins to decline atsome age after ~10^7 years. we find our data consistent with the followingtentative picture: low mass pms stars with no circumstellar accretion disk havesaturated activity, consistently with the activity-rossby number relationderived for ms stars. accretion and/or the presence of disks somehow lowers theobserved activity levels; disk dissipation and/or the decrease of massaccretion rate in the first few myrs of pms evolution is therefore responsiblefor the observed increase of l_x/l_bol with time.

astro-ph;0309314	the weak-line t tauri star v410tau i. a multi-wavelength study of  variability	we present the results of an intensive coordinated monitoring campaign in theoptical and x-ray wavelength ranges of the low-mass, pre-main sequence starv410tau carried out with the aim to study the relation between variousindicators for magnetic activity that probe emission from different atmosphericlayers: optical photometric star spot (rotation) cycle, chromospheric halphaemission, and coronal x-rays. two x-ray pointings were carried out with thechandra satellite simultaneously with the optical observations, and centerednear the maximum and minimum levels of the optical lightcurve. a relation oftheir different count levels to the rotation period of the dominating spot isnot confirmed by a third chandra observation carried out some months later,during another minimum of the 1.87d cycle. similarly we find no indications fora correlation of the halpha emission with the spots' rotational phase. theextraordinary stability of the largest spot is confirmed by long-termphotometric and radial velocity measurements. joining our optical photometrywith previous data we provide a new estimate for the dominant periodicity ofv410tau. this updated value removes systematic offsets of the time of minimumobserved in data taken over the last decade. furthermore, the combination ofthe new data with published measurements taken during the last decade allows usto examine long-term changes in the mean light level of the photometry ofv410tau. a variation on the timescale of 5.4yr is suggested. assuming that thisbehavior is truely cyclic v410tau is the first pre-main sequence star on whichan activity cycle is detected.

astro-ph;0504204	coup census of x-ray stars in bn-kl and omc-1s	we present a study of the x-ray sources detected in the vicinity of twodensity peaks in the orion molecular cloud 1 (omc-1) behind the orion nebulacluster (onc), as seen in the exceptionally deep (~10 days) exposure of thechandra orion ultradeep project (coup). we focus on a 40"*50" region around thebecklin-neugebauer object and kleinmann-low nebula (collectively bn-kl) and a60"*75" region around omc-1s, a secondary star-forming peak some 90" south ofbn-kl. forty-three and sixty x-ray sources were detected in bn-kl and omc-1s,respectively, of which half and one-third, respectively, were found to beforeground members of the onc, while the remaining sources are identified asobscured x-ray sources with column densities 22&lt;log(nh)/cm^{-2})&lt;24. all but 5and 18 of these sources have near-infrared stellar counterparts, and 22 ofthese appear to be young stellar objects (ysos). x-ray sources are found closeto four luminous mid-ir sources namely bn, irc3-i2, irc2-c, and source n; theirx-ray variability and spectral properties are typical of coronal activity inlow-mass stars rather than wind emission from massive stars, suggesting thatthe x-ray emission may be arising from companions. the x-ray light curve of thex-ray source close to bn shows a periodicity of ~8.3 days and from an x-rayimage deconvolution of the region around bn, we conclude that either bn itselfor a low mass companion with a projected separation of ~200 au was detected. onthe other hand, no emission is seen from the bright radio source i, held bysome to be the main source of luminosity in bn-kl. in omc-1s, chandra unveils anew subcluster of seven ysos without infrared counterparts (abridged).

astro-ph;0506134	bright x-ray flares in orion young stars from coup: evidence for  star-disk magnetic fields?	we have analyzed a number of intense x-ray flares observed in the chandraorion ultradeep project (coup), a 13 days observation of the orion nebulacluster (onc). analysis of the flare decay allows to determine the size, peakdensity and magnetic field of the flaring structure. a total of 32 events (themost powerful 1% of coup flares), have sufficient statistics for the analysis.a broad range of decay times (from 10 to 400 ks) are present in the sample.peak flare temperatures are often very high, with half of the flares in thesample showing temperatures in excess of 100 mk. significant sustained heatingis present in the majority of the flares. the magnetic structures which arefound, are in a number of cases very long, with semi-lengths up to 10^12 cm,implying the presence of magnetic fields of hundreds of g extending tocomparable distance from the stellar photosphere. these very large sizes forthe flaring structures ($ &gt;&gt; r_*) are not found in more evolved stars, where,almost invariably, the same type of analysis results in structures with l &lt;=r_*. as the majority of young stars in the onc are surrounded by disks, wespeculate that the large magnetic structures which confine the flaring plasmaare actually the same type of structures which channel the plasma in themagnetospheric accretion paradigm, connecting the star's photosphere with theaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0506164	rotational modulation of x-ray emission in orion nebula young stars	we investigate the spatial distribution of x-ray emitting plasma in a sampleof young orion nebula cluster stars by modulation of their x-ray light-curvesdue to stellar rotation. the study, part of the chandra orion ultradeep project(coup), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 daysof acis integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616detected sources in the 17x17 arcmin field of view. we here focus on asubsample of 233 x-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. we searchfor x-ray modulation using the lomb normalized periodogram method.  x-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from20% to 70%. in 16 cases, the x-ray modulation period is similar to the stellarrotation period while in seven cases it is about half that value, possibly dueto the presence of x-ray emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes.these results constitute the largest sample of low mass stars in which x-rayrotational modulation has been observed. the detection of rotational modulationindicates that the x-ray emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously inlongitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellarradius. modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels(l_x/l_bol ~ 10^(-3)) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of thestellar surface with x-ray emitting regions.

astro-ph;0507151	stellar activity on the young suns of orion: coup observations of k5-7  pre-main sequence stars	in january 2003, the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) detected about1400 young stars during a 13.2 day observation of the orion nebula cluster(onc). this paper studies a well-defined sample of 28 solar-mass coup sourcesto characterize the magnetic activity of analogs of the young sun and therebyto improve understanding of the effects of solar x-rays on the solar nebuladuring the era of planet formation.  we find that active young suns spend 70% of their time in a characteristicstate with relatively constant flux and magnetically confined plasma withtemperatures kt_2 = 2.1 * kt_1. during characteristic periods, the 0.5-8 kevx-ray luminosity is about 0.03% of the bolometric luminosity. one or twopowerful flares per week with peak luminosities logl_x ~ 30-32 erg/s aretypically superposed on this characteristic emission accompanied by heating ofthe hot plasma component from ~2.4 kev to ~7 kev at the flare peak. the energydistribution of flares superposed on the characteristic emission level followsthe relationship dn/de ~ e^-1.7. the flare rates are consistent with theproduction of sufficiently energetic protons to spawn a spallogenic origin ofsome important short-lived radionuclides found in ancient meteorites. thex-rays can ionize gas in the circumstellar disk at a rate of 6 10^-9ionizations per second at 1 au from the central star, orders of magnitude abovecosmic ray ionization rates. the estimated energetic particle fluences aresufficient to a account for many isotopic anomalies observed in meteoriticinclusions.

astro-ph;0703439	coronal abundances in orion nebula cluster stars	following the chandra orion ultradeep project (coup) observation, we havestudied the chemical composition of the hot plasma in a sample of 146 x-raybright pre-main sequence stars in the orion nebula cluster. we reportmeasurements of individual element abundances for a subsample of 86slightly-absorbed and bright x-ray sources, using low resolution x-ray spectraobtained from the chandra acis instrument. the x-ray emission originates from aplasma with temperatures and elemental abundances very similar to those ofactive coronae in older stars. a clear pattern of abundances vs. firstionization potential (fip) is evident if solar photospheric abundances areassumed as reference. the results are validated by extensive simulations. theobserved abundance distributions are compatible with a single pattern ofabundances for all stars, although a weak dependence on flare loop size may bepresent. the abundance of calcium is the only one which appears to varysubstantially between stars, but this quantity is affected by relatively largeuncertainties. the ensemble properties of the x-ray bright coup sources confirmthat the iron in the emitting plasma is underabundant with respect to both thesolar composition and to the average stellar photospheric values. comparison ofthe present plasma abundances with those of the stellar photospheres and thoseof the gaseous component of the nebula, indicates a good agreement for all theother elements with available measurements, and in particular for the high-fipelements (ne, ar, o, and s) and for the low-fip element si. we conclude thatthere is evidence of a significant chemical fractionation effect only for iron,which appears to be depleted by a factor 1.5--3 with respect to the stellarcomposition.
