0904.0026	the stellar disk of m81	wide-field images obtained with the 3.6 meter canada-france-hawaii telescopeare used to investigate the spatial distribution and photometric properties ofthe brightest stars in the disk of m81 (ngc 3031). with the exception of thecentral regions of the galaxy and gaps between ccds, the survey is spatiallycomplete for stars with i' &lt; 24 and major axis distances of 18 kpc. a moremodest near-infrared survey detects stars with k &lt; 20 over roughly one third ofthe disk. bright main sequence (ms) stars and rsgs are traced out togalactocentric distances of at least 18 kpc. the spatial distribution of brightms stars tracks emission at far-ultraviolet, mid- and far-infrared wavelengths,although tidal features contain bright ms stars but have little or no infraredflux. the specific frequency of bright ms stars and rsgs, normalized to k-bandintegrated brightness, increases with radius, indicating that during the past30 myr the specific star formation rate (ssfr) has increased with increasingradius. the stellar content of the m81 disk undergoes a distinct change near r~ 14 kpc, and the luminosity-weighted mean age decreases with increasing radiusin the outer regions of the m81 disk.

0706.3464	the disk and extraplanar regions of ngc 2403	wide field images obtained with wircam and megacam on thecanada-france-hawaii telescope are used to probe the spatial distribution ofyoung stars in the sc galaxy ngc 2403. bright main sequence stars and bluesupergiants are detected out to projected galactocentric distances of ~14 kpc(~7 disk scale lengths) along the major axis. the star formation rate (sfr) inthe disk of ngc 2403 during the past 10 myr has been 1 solar masses per yearbased on the number of bright main sequence stars. the radially-averaged numberdensity of red supergiants (rsgs) per unit r-band surface brightness isconstant throughout the disk, indicating that (1) rsgs follow the integratedr-band light, and (2) the sfr per unit mass has been constant with radius whenaveraged over time scales of a few tens of millions of years. the mean color ofrsgs varies with galactocentric distance, suggesting that there is ametallicity gradient among recently formed stars. a comparison of theradially-averaged number density of bright main sequence stars also indicatesthat the sfr per unit stellar mass in ngc 2403 has been ~3 times higher than inngc 247 during recent epochs, and this is in rough agreement with what would bepredicted from the far infrared fluxes of these galaxies. finally, the data areused to investigate the extraplanar regions of ngc 2403. a population of mgiants with peak brightness m_k = -8 is detected at projected distances between12 and 14 kpc above the disk plane, and six new globular cluster candidates areidentified.

1001.0412	identifying bright stars in crowded environments using velocity  dispersion measurements, and an application to the center of m32	the identification of individual stars in crowded environments usingphotometric information alone is confounded by source confusion. however, withthe addition of spectroscopic information it is possible to distinguish betweenblends and areas where the light is dominated by a single star using the widthsof absorption features. we describe a procedure for identifying locations inkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,and apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution coveringthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of m32. targets fordetailed investigation are selected as areas of localized brightnessenhancement. three locations where at least 60% of the k-band light comes froma single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two starswith very different velocities, are identified. the dominant stars are evolvingnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (agb), and have m5 iii spectraltype. the lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper agbwithin the central arcsec of m32 has a dispersion in j-k of only a fewhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii. onestar has weaker atomic absorption lines than the others, such that [m/h] is 0.2dex lower. such a difference in metallicity is consistent with the metallicitydispersion inferred from the width of the agb in m32. the use of line width todistinguish between blends involving many relatively faint stars, none of whichdominate the light output, and areas that are dominated by a singleintrinsically bright star could be extended to crowded environments in othernearby galaxies.

1006.3817	the young outer disk of m83	deep near-infrared images recorded with nici on gemini south are used toinvestigate the evolved stellar content in the outer regions of the south eastquadrant of the spiral galaxy m83. a diffuse population of asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars is detected outside of the previously identified young andintermediate age star clusters in the outer disk. the brightest agb stars havem_k &gt; -8, and the agb luminosity function (lf) is well-matched by model lfsthat assume ages &lt; 1 gyr. the specific star formation rate (sfr) during thepast few gyr estimated from agb star counts is consistent with that computedfrom mid-infrared observations of star clusters at similar radii, and it isconcluded that the disruption timescale for star clusters in the outer disk is&lt;&lt; 1 gyr. the luminosity function and specific frequency of agb stars varieswith radius, in a manner that is indicative of lower luminosity-weighted agesat larger radii. modest numbers of red supergiants are also found, indicatingthat there has been star formation during the past 100 myr, while the ratio ofc stars to m giants is consistent with that expected for a solar metallicitysystem that has experienced a constant sfr for the past few gyrs.

1011.3006	shaken, not stirred: the disrupted disk of the starburst galaxy ngc 253	near-infrared images obtained with the cfht wircam are used to investigatethe recent history of the nearby sculptor group spiral ngc 253. thedistribution of stars in the disk is lop-sided, in the sense that the projecteddensity of agb stars in the north east portion of the disk between 10 and 20kpc from the galaxy center is ~ 0.5 dex higher than on the opposite side of thegalaxy. with the exception of the central 2 kpc, the north east portion of thedisk appears to have been the site of the highest levels of star-formingactivity in the galaxy during the past ~ 0.1 gyr. diffuse stellar structuresare found in the periphery of the disk, and the most prominent of these is tothe south and east of the galaxy. bright agb stars are detected out to 15 kpcabove the disk plane, and these are part of a diffusely distributed, flattenedextraplanar component. comparisons between observed and model luminosityfunctions suggest that the extraplanar regions contain stars that formedthroughout much of the age of the universe. it is suggested that the disk ofngc 253 was disrupted by a tidal encounter with a now defunct companion. theages of the youngest extraplanar stars suggests that the event that producedthe extraplanar population, and presumably induced the starburst, occuredwithin the past ~ 0.2 gyr.

1101.1486	young stars at the edge: stellar clustering in the outer regions of the  m33 disk	we investigate the distribution of bright main sequence stars near thenorthern edge of the m33 disk. clustering on sub-kpc scales is seen among starswith ages near 10 myr, and two large star-forming complexes are identified.similar large-scale grouping is not evident among stars with ages 100 myr.these stars are also distributed over a much larger area than those withyounger ages, and it is argued that random stellar motions alone, as opposed toorderly motions of the type spurred by large scale secular effects, canre-distribute stars out to distances of at least 2 kpc (i.e. one disk scalelength) from their birth places on 100 myr timescales. such random motions maythus play a significant role in populating the outer regions of the m33 disk.finally, it is suggested that - to the extent that the ambient properties ofthe outer disk mirror those in the main body of the disk - stars in this partof m33 may have formed in star clusters with masses 50 - 250 solar, which issubstantially lower than the peak of the solar neighborhood initial clustermass function.

1107.0077	the stellar archeology of the m33 disk: recent star-forming history and  constraints on the timing of an interaction with m31	images recorded with megacam are used to investigate the recent star-forminghistory (sfh) of the local group sc galaxy m33. the properties of the stellardisk change near r = 8 kpc. within this radius the star formation rate (sfr)has been constant with time during at least the past 250 myr, while at largerradii the sfr has declined during this same time period. that the recent sfr inthe inner disk has been constant suggests that m33 has evolved in isolation forat least the past ~ 0.5 gyr, thereby providing a constraint on the timing ofany recent interaction with m31. the fractional contribution that young starsmake to the total mass of the stellar disk changes with radius, peaking near 8kpc. evidence is also presented that the sfr during the past 100 myr in thesouthern half of the galaxy has been ~ 0.4 dex higher than in the northernhalf. finally, structures with sizes spanning many kpc that contain blueobjects - presumably main sequence stars that formed during intermediate epochs- are identified near the disk boundary. it is argued that these are tidalfeatures that were pulled from the main body of m33 and - in some cases - arethe fossil remnants of star formation that occured in an extended disk duringintermediate epochs.

1203.3986	a large group of asymptotic giant branch stars in the disk of m31: a  missing piece of the puzzle?	the properties of a stellar grouping that is ~ 3.5 kpc to the north east ofthe center of m31 is examined. this structure has (1) a surface brightness thatis lower than the surrounding disk, (2) a more-or-less round appearance, (3) asize of ~ 300 arcsec (~ 1 kpc), and (4) an integrated brightness m_k = 6.5. itis populated by stars with ages &gt; 100 myr and j-k colors that tend to be bluerthan those of stars in the surrounding disk. comparisons with model luminosityfunctions suggest that the star formation rate in this object has changed twicein the past few hundred myr. fitting a sersic function to the light profilereveals a power-law index and effective surface brightness that are similar tothose of dwarf galaxies with the same integrated brightness. two possibleorigins for this object are considered: (1) it is a heretofore undiscoveredsatellite of m31 that is seen against/in/through the m31 disk, or (2) it is afossil star-forming region in the m31 disk.

1203.6081	the recent stellar archeology of m31 - the nearest red disk galaxy	we examine the star-forming history (sfh) of the m31 disk during the past fewhundred myr. the luminosity functions (lfs) of main sequence stars at distancesr_gc &gt; 21 kpc (i.e. &gt; 4 disk scale lengths) are matched by models that assume aconstant star formation rate (sfr). however, at smaller r_gc the lfs suggestthat during the past ~10 myr the sfr was 2 - 3 times higher than during thepreceding ~100 myr. the rings of cool gas that harbor a significant fraction ofthe current star-forming activity are traced by stars with ages ~100 myr,indicating that (1) these structures have ages of at least 100 myr, and (2)stars in these structures do not follow the same relation between age andrandom velocity as their counterparts throughout the disks of other spiralgalaxies, probably due to the inherently narrow orbital angular momentumdistribution of the giant molecular clouds in these structures. thedistribution of evolved red stars is not azimuthally symmetric, in the sensethat their projected density along the north east segment of the major axis isroughly twice that on the opposite side of the galaxy. the north east arm ofthe major axis thus appears to be a fossil star-forming area that dates tointermediate epochs. such a structure may be the consequence of interactionswith a companion galaxy.

1301.6806	the open cluster ngc 2437 (messier 46)	the stellar content of the open cluster ngc 2437 (messier 46) is investigatedusing moderately deep u*,g', and r' megacam images. when compared with solarmetallicity isochrones, the (g', u'-g') and (r', g'-r') cmds are consistentwith an age log(t_yr) = 8.35 +/- 0.15, a distance modulus 11.05 +/- 0.05, and acolor excess e(b-v) = 0.115 +/- 0.035. the r' luminosity function (lf) of mainsequence stars in the magnitude range r' &lt; 17 (i.e. masses &gt; 0.8 solar) has ashape that follows solar neighborhood star counts. however, at faintermagnitudes the cluster lf is flat, in contrast with what would be expected fromsolar neighborhood counts. the clustering properties of stars in ngc 2437 areinvestigated by examining the two-point angular correlation functions of mainsequence stars in different brightness ranges. main sequence stars fainter thanr' = 17 are less centrally concentrated than brighter stars and are found overa larger area of the sky, suggesting that there is a corona of faint mainsequence stars around ngc 2437. based on the flat lf and extended spatialdistribution of faint stars, it is concluded that ngc 2437 is actively sheddingstars with masses &lt; 0.8 solar.

1407.6953	seeing red in m32: constraints on the stellar content from near- and  mid-infrared observations and applications for studies of more distant  galaxies	the properties of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the local groupgalaxy m32 are investigated using ground and space-based observations that spanthe 1 - 8um wavelength interval, with the goal of demonstrating the utility ofinfrared observations as probes of stellar content. comparisons with isochronesindicate that the brightest resolved stars in m32 have ages of a few gyr, andare younger on average than agb stars with the same intrinsic brightness in theouter disk of m31. accounting for stellar variability is shown to be essentialfor modelling agb luminosity functions (lfs). model lfs that assume thestar-forming history measured by monachesi et al. (2012, apj, 745, 97) and thevariability properties of galactic agb stars match both the k and [5.8] lfs ofm32. models also suggest that the slope of the [5.8] lf between m_[5.8] = -8.5and --10.0 is sensitive to the mix of stellar ages, and a sizeable fraction ofthe stars in m32 must have an age older than 7 gyr in order to match the [5.8]lf. the structural properties of m32 in the infrared are also investigated. theeffective radii that are computed from near-infrared and mid-infrared isophotesare similar to those measured at visible wavelengths, suggesting that thestellar content of m32 is well-mixed. however, isophotes at radii &gt; 16 arcsec(&gt; 60 parsecs) in the near and mid-infrared are flatter than those at visiblewavelengths. the coefficient of the fourth-order cosine term in the fourierexpansion of isophotes changes from `boxy' values at r &lt; 16 arcsec to `disky'values at r &gt; 48 arcsec in [3.6] and [4.5]. the mid-infrared colors near thecenter of m32 do not vary systematically with radius, providing evidence of awell-mixed stellar content in this part of the galaxy.

astro-ph;0007173	the evolved red stellar content of m32	near-infrared images obtained with the cfht aob are used to investigate thestellar content of the local group elliptical galaxy m32. observations of afield 2.3 arcmin from the galaxy center reveal a large population of agb stars,and comparisons with models indicate that these objects have an age log(t_gyr)&lt; 9.3. it is concluded that intermediate age stars account for roughly 25% ofthe total k light and 10% +/- 5% of the mass in this field.  the k lf of bright sources between 20 and 30 arcsec from the nucleus is wellmatched by the lf of the outer regions of the galaxy after accounting fordifferences in surface brightness and correcting for crowding. it is concludedthat the relative size of the intermediate age component with respect to otherpopulations does not change with radius over most of the galaxy. however, theintegrated j-k color and 2.3 micron co index change with radius within a fewtenths of an arcsec of the galaxy center indicating that, contrary to whatmight be inferred from observations at visible wavelengths, the integratedphotometric properties of the central regions of m32 differ from those of thesurrounding galaxy.

astro-ph;0010312	the peak brightness and spatial distribution of agb stars near the  nucleus of m32	the bright stellar content near the center of the local group ellipticalgalaxy m32 is investigated with 0.12 arcsec fwhm h and k images obtained withthe gemini mauna kea telescope. stars with k = 15.5, which are likely evolvingnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (agb), are resolved to within 2arcsec of the nucleus, and it is concluded that the peak stellar brightnessnear the center of m32 is similar to that in the outer regions of the galaxy.moreover, the projected density of bright agb stars follows the visible lightprofile to within 2 arcsec of the nucleus, indicating that the brightest starsare well mixed throughout the galaxy. thus, there is no evidence for an agegradient, and the radial variations in spectroscopic indices and ultravioletcolors that have been detected previously must be due to metallicity and/orsome other parameter. we suggest that either the bright agb stars formed aspart of a highly uniform and coherent galaxy-wide episode of star formation, orthey originated in a separate system that merged with m32.

astro-ph;0106433	the brightest agb stars in the inner bulge of m31	jhk images with angular resolutions approaching the diffraction limit of the3.6 meter canada-france-hawaii telescope are used to investigate the bright agbcontent of the m31 bulge. the agb-tip in a field 2.6 arcmin from the galaxycenter occurs at k = 15.6, which is significantly fainter than measured inprevious ground-based studies that sampled similar projected distances from thecenter of m31. within 2.6 arcmin of the center of m31 the number density ofbright agb stars scales with r-band surface brightness, and the k brightness ofthe agb-tip does not vary measureably with radius. it is concluded that theinfrared bright agb stars (1) belong to the bulge, and not the disk, and (2)are well mixed throughout the inner bulge, suggesting that they formed at atime when the overall structural properties of the m31 bulge were imprinted.the bolometric luminosity functions of the m31 bulge and baade's window are inexcellent agreement, while the brightest agb stars in the m31 bulge, thegalactic bulge, and m32 have similar m_k. these data suggest that the brighteststars in m32 and the bulges of m31 and the milky-way belong to an old,metal-rich population; these stars are bright not because they have a young orintermediate age, but because they have a high metallicity.

astro-ph;9803274	the evolved red stellar contents of the sculptor group galaxies ngc55,  ngc300, and ngc7793	deep j, h, and k images are used to probe the evolved stellar contents in thecentral regions of the sculptor group galaxies ngc55, ngc300, and ngc7793. thebrightest stars are massive red supergiants (rsgs) with k ~ 15 - 15.5. the peakrsg brightness is constant to within ~0.5 mag in k, suggesting that ngc55,ngc300, and ngc7793 are at comparable distances. comparisons with bright rsgsin the magellanic clouds indicate that the difference in distance modulus withrespect to the lmc is = 7.5. a rich population of asymptotic giant branch (agb)stars, which isochrones indicate have ages between 0.1 and 10 gyr, dominatesthe (k, j-k) color-magnitude diagram (cmd) of each galaxy. the detection ofsignificant numbers of agb stars with ages near 10 gyr indicates that the disksof these galaxies contain an underlying old population. the cmds and luminosityfunctions reveal significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations in stellar content.star-forming activity in the central arcmin of ngc300 has been suppressed forthe past gyr with respect to disk fields at larger radii. nevertheless,comparisons between fields within each galaxy indicate that star-formingactivity during intermediate epochs was coherent on spatial scales of a kpc ormore. a large cluster of stars, which isochrones suggest has an age near 100myr, is seen in one of the ngc55 fields. the luminosity function of thebrightest stars in this cluster is flat, as expected if a linearluminosity-core mass relation is present.

astro-ph;9803276	the near-infrared photometric properties of bright giants in the central  regions of the galactic bulge	images recorded through broad (j, h, k), and narrow (co, and 2.2microncontinuum) band filters are used to investigate the photometric properties ofbright (k &lt; 13.5) stars in a 6 x 6 arcmin field centered on the sgra complex.the giant branch ridgelines in the (k, j-k) and (k, h-k) color-magnitudediagrams are well matched by the baade's window (bw) m giant sequence if themean extinction is a_k ~ 2.8 mag. extinction measurements for individual starsare estimated using the m_k versus infrared color relations defined by m giantsin bw, and the majority of stars have a_k between 2.0 and 3.5 mag. theextinction is locally high in the sgra complex, where a_k ~ 3.1 mag.reddening-corrected co indices, co_o, are derived for over 1300 stars with j,h, and k brightnesses, and over 5300 stars with h and k brightnesses. thedistribution of co_o values for stars with k_o between 11.25 and 7.25 can bereproduced using the m_k versus co_o relation defined by m giants in bw. thedata thus suggest that the most metal-rich giants in the central regions of thebulge and in bw have similar photometric properties and 2.3micron co strengths.hence, it appears that the central region of the bulge does not contain apopulation of stars that are significantly more metal-rich than what is seen inbw.

astro-ph;9812078	high angular resolution jhk imaging of the centers of the metal-poor  globular clusters ngc5272 (m3), ngc6205 (m13), ngc6287, and ngc6341 (m92)	the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) adaptive optics bonnette (aob) hasbeen used to obtain high angular resolution jhk images of the centers of themetal-poor globular clusters ngc5272 (m3), ngc6205 (m13), ngc6287, and ngc6341(m92). the color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) derived from these data include theupper main sequence and most of the red giant branch (rgb), and the clustersequences agree with published photometric measurements of bright stars inthese clusters. the photometric accuracy is limited by psf variations, whichintroduce systematic errors of a few hundredths of a magnitude near the aoreference star.  the clusters are paired according to metallicity, and the near-infrared cmdsand luminosity functions are used to investigate the relative ages within eachpair. the near-infrared cmds provide the tightest constraints on the relativeages of the classical second parameter pair ngc5272 and ngc6205, and indicatethat these clusters have ages that differ by no more than +/- 1 gyr. theseresults thus support the notion that age is not the second parameter. wetentatively conclude that ngc6287 and ngc6341 have ages that differ by no morethan +/- 2 gyr. however, the near-infrared spectral energy distributions ofstars in ngc6287 appear to differ from those of stars in outer halo clusters,bringing into question the validity of this age estimate.

astro-ph;9903161	the central regions of m81	high angular resolution optical and near-infrared images are used toinvestigate the central regions of the nearby sb galaxy m81 (ngc3031). thespectral-energy distribution of the circumnuclear region, which extends out to1.5 arcsec (~ 24 pc if \mu_0 = 27.5) from the nucleus, can be modelled as acombination of an old metal-rich population and emission from hot dust. thermalemission has been detected near other agn, and simple models indicate that hotdust can account for ~20% of the light in k within 0.5 arcsec of the m81nucleus. an elongated structure with m_v ~ -7, which may be an area of activestar formation, is detected 0.45 arcsec from the nucleus. at distances inexcess of 1.5 arcsec from the nucleus the j-k color of the m81 bulge is notsignificantly different from what is seen in m31. the hst data are also used tosearch for bright globular clusters within 2kpc of the center of m81. the areawithin 0.26 kpc of the m81 nucleus is largely devoid of bright globularclusters, in agreement with what is seen in the central regions of the galaxyand m31. however, our survey indicates that there may be ~45 +/- 12 globularcluster candidates with m_v \leq -7 within 2 kpc of the galaxy center, which isconsistent with what would be infered from the milky-way cluster system.

astro-ph;9910333	near-infrared adaptive optics imaging of the central regions of nearby  sc galaxies: i. m33	near-infrared images obtained with the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht)adaptive optics bonnette (aob) are used to investigate the stellar contentwithin 18 arcsec of the center of the local group spiral galaxy m33. agb starswith near-infrared spectral-energy distributions similar to those of giants inthe solar neighborhood and baade's window are detected over most of the field.the bolometric luminosity function (lf) of these stars has a discontinuity nearm_{bol} = -5.25, and comparisons with evolutionary tracks suggest that most ofthe agb stars formed in a burst of star formation 1 - 3 gyr in the past. theimages are also used to investigate the integrated near-infrared photometricproperties of the nucleus and the central light concentration. the nucleus isbluer than the central light concentration, in agreement with previous studiesat visible wavelengths. the co index of the central light concentration 0.5arcsec from the galaxy center is 0.05, which corresponds to [fe/h] = -1.2 forsimple stellar systems. hence, the central light concentration could not haveformed from the chemically-enriched material that dominates the present-dayinner disk of m33.

0810.0843	and the rest: the stellar archeological record of m82 outside the  central starburst	deep images obtained with megacam and wircam on the canada-france-hawaiitelescope are used to probe the stellar content outside of the centralstar-forming regions of m82. stars evolving on the asymptotic giant branch(agb) are traced along the major axis out to projected distances of 12 kpc,which corresponds to 13 disk scale lengths. the specific frequency (sf) ofbright agb stars in the outer disks of m82 and the sc galaxy ngc 2403 areidentical, suggesting that the specific star formation rates (sfr) in thesegalaxies during intermediate epochs were similar. this similarity in stellarcontent, coupled with the presence of an extended stellar disk, is consistentwith m82 having been a late-type disk galaxy prior to interacting with m81.still, there is a paucity of red supergiants (rsgs) in the outer disk of m82when compared with ngc 2403, indicating that the sfr in the outer regions ofm82 during the past ~ 0.1 gyr has declined dramatically with respect to that inisolated late-type galaxies. a mixture of bright main sequence stars, rsgs, andagb stars are detected out to minor axis distances of 7 kpc along the outflow.it is suggested that the young and intermediate aged stars in the extraplanarregions formed in structures similar to m82 south, and that these weresubsequently disrupted by the tidal action of m82.

0810.0847	the identification of new stellar groupings in the m81 debris field	the stellar content of the debris field around m81 is investigated using deepimages obtained with megacam on the canada-france-hawaii telescope. three newconcentrations of bright main sequence stars and red supergiants are identifiedwithin ~ 20 kpc of m81. these systems have integrated brightnesses m_v ~ -11and surface brightnesses ~ 27 - 28 mag per arcsec^2 in v. the main sequenceturn-offs are consistent with an age of ~ 30 myr, while the presence of awell-developed red supergiant plume indicates that their stellar content is notcoeval, as they also formed stars ~ 100 myr in the past. the photometricproperties of the red supergiants indicate that the young stars in thesesystems have metallicities that are comparable to those of other objects in thedebris field. the hi density near these groupings comfortably exceeds thethreshold required to trigger star formation. based on the close proximity ofthese objects to m81, coupled with their extended sizes and low inferredmasses, it is argued that they will not be long-lived structures, but willprobably dissipate within the next ~ 1 gyr.
