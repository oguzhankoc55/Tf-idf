0812.4541	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. vii. relative ages	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters is a hubble space telescope(hst) treasury program designed to provide a new large, deep and homogeneousphotometric database. based on observations from this program, we have measuredprecise relative ages for a sample of 64 galactic globular clusters bycomparing the relative position of the clusters' main sequence turn offs, usingmain-sequence fitting to cross-compare clusters within the sample. this methodprovides relative ages to a formal precision of 2-7%. we demonstrate that thecalculated relative ages are independent of the choice of theoretical model. wefind that the galactic globular cluster sample can be divided into two groups-- a population of old clusters with an age dispersion of ~5% and noage-metallicity relation, and a group of younger clusters with anage-metallicity relation similar to that of the globular clusters associatedwith the sagittarius dwarf galaxy.  these results are consistent with the milky way halo having formed in twophases or processes. the first one would be compatible with a rapid (&lt;0.8 gyr)assembling process of the halo, in which the clusters in the old group wereformed. also these clusters could have been formed before reionization in dwarfgalaxies that would later merge to build the milky way halo as predicted bylambda-cdm cosmology. however, the galactocentric metallicity gradient shown bythese clusters seems difficult to reconcile with the latter. as for the youngerclusters, it is very tempting to argue that their origin is related to theirformation within milky way satellite galaxies that were later accreted, but theorigin of the age-metallicity relation remains unclear.

0902.2127	metallicities and ages of stellar populations at a high galactic  latitude field	we present an analysis of $ubvri$ data from the selected area sa 141. byapplying recalibrated methods of measuring ultraviolet excess (uvx), weapproximate abundances and absolute magnitudes for 368 stars over 1.3 squaredegrees out to distances over 10 kpc. with the density distribution constrainedfrom our previous photometric parallax investigations and with sufficientaccounting for the metallicity bias in the uvx method, we are able to comparethe vertical abundance distribution to those measured in previous studies. wefind that the abundance distribution has an underlying uniform componentconsistent with previous spectroscopic results that posit a monometallic thickdisk and halo with abundances of $[fe/h]$ = $-$0.8 and $-$1.4, respectively.however, there are a number of outlying data points that may indicatecontamination by more metal-rich halo streams. the absence of verticalabundance gradients in the galactic stellar populations and the possiblepresence of interloping halo streams would be consistent with expectations frommerger models of galaxy formation. we find that our uvx method has limitedsensitivity in exploring the metallicity distribution of the distant galactichalo, owing to the poor constraint on the $ubv$ properties of very metal-poorstars. the derivation of metallicities from broadband $ubv$ photometry remainsfundamentally sound for the exploration of the halo but is in need of bothimproved calibration and superior data.

0902.4742	2mass 22344161+4041387ab: a wide, young, accreting, low-mass binary in  the lkha233 group	we report the discovery of a young, 0.16" binary, 2m2234+4041ab, found as theresult of a keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging survey of young fieldultracool dwarfs. spatially resolved near-infrared photometry and spectroscopyindicate that the luminosity and temperature ratios of the system are nearunity. from optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we determine a compositespectral type of m6 for the system. gravity-sensitive spectral features in thespectra of 2m2234+4041ab are best matched to those of young objects (~1 myrold). a comparison of the teff and age of 2m2234+4041ab to evolutionary modelsindicates the mass of each component is 0.10 (+0.075-0.04) msun. emission linesof h alpha in the composite optical spectrum of the system and br gamma inspatially resolved near-ir spectra of the two components indicate that thesystem is actively accreting. both components of the system have ir excesses,indicating that they both harbor circumstellar disks. though 2m2234+4041ab wasoriginally identified as a young field dwarf, it lies 1.5' from thewell-studied herbig ae/be star, lkha 233. the distance to lkha 233 is typicallyassumed to be 880 pc. it is unlikely 2m2234+4041ab could be this distant, as itwould then be more luminous than any known taurus objects of similar spectraltype. we re-evaluate the distance to the lkha 233 group and find a value of 325(+72-50) pc, based on the hipparcos distance to a nearby b3-type group member(hd 213976). 2m2234+4041ab is the first low-mass star to be potentiallyassociated with the lkha 233 group. at a distance of 325 pc, its projectedphysical separation is 51 au, making it one of a growing number of wide,low-mass binaries found in young star-forming regions.

0904.3323	identifying the young low-mass stars within 25 pc. i. spectroscopic  observations	we have completed a high-resolution (r=60,000) optical spectroscopic surveyof 185 nearby m dwarfs identified using rosat data to select active, youngobjects with fractional x-ray luminosities comparable to or greater thanpleiades members. our targets are drawn from the nstars 20-pc census and themoving-m sample with distances determined from parallaxes or spectrophotometricrelations. nearly half of the resulting m dwarfs are not present in the gliesecatalog and have no previously published spectral types. we identified 30spectroscopic binaries (sbs) from the sample, which have strong x-ray emissiondue to tidal spin-up rather than youth. this is equivalent to a 16%spectroscopic binary fraction, with at most a handful of undiscovered sbs. weestimate upper limits on the age of the remaining m dwarfs using spectroscopicyouth indicators such as surface gravity-sensitive indices (cah and k i). wefind that for a sample of field stars with no metallicity measurements, asingle cah gravity index may not be sufficient, as higher metallicities mimiclower gravity. this is demonstrated in a sub-sample of metal-rich rv standards,which appear to have low surface gravity as measured by the cah index, yet showno other evidence of youth. we also use additional youth diagnostics such aslithium absorption and strong h-alpha emission to set more stringent agelimits. eleven m dwarfs with no h-alpha emission or absorption are likely old(&gt;400 myr) and were caught during an x-ray flare. we estimate that our finalsample of the 144 youngest and nearest low-mass objects in the field is lessthan 300 myr old, with 30% of them being younger than 150 myr and 4 very young(&lt;10 myr), representing a generally untapped and well-characterized resource ofm dwarfs for intensive planet and disk searches.

0905.4197	steady and transient radio emission from ultracool dwarfs	we detect radio emission in an additional two epochs of the ultracool dwarfbinary lp 349- 25, finding that the observed emission is broadband and steadyon timescales between 10s and 10.7 hours, as well as on timescales of 0.6 and1.6 years. this system is unusual for ultracool dwarfs with detectable radioemission, in exhibiting a lack of any large scale variability, particularly thebursting (periodic or aperiodic) behavior exhibited by the other objects withdetectable levels of radio emission. we explore the constraints that the lackof variability on long and short timescales, and flat spectral index, implyabout the radio-emitting structures and mechanism. the temporal constraintsargue for a high latitude emitting region with a large inclination so that itis always in view, and survives for at least 0.6 year. temporal constraintsalso limit the plasma conditions, implying that the electron density be n_e&lt;4x10^5 cm-3 and b &lt; 130 g in order not to see time variations due tocollisional or radiative losses from high energy particles. the observationsand constraints provided by them are most compatible with a nonthermal radioemission mechanism, likely gyrosynchrotron emission from a spatiallyhomogeneous or inhomogeneous source. this indicates that, similar to behaviorsnoted for chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasmas in ultracooldwarfs, the magnetic activity patterns observed in active higher mass stars cansurvive to the substellar boundary. we also present new epochs ofmulti-frequency radio observations for the the ultracool dwarfs 2mass05233822-140322 and 2mass14563831-2809473(=lhs 3003); each has been detected inat least one previous epoch but are not detected in the epochs reported here.

0911.2469	the acs survey of galactic globular clusters. ix. horizontal branch  morphology and the second parameter phenomenon	the horizontal branch (hb) morphology of globular clusters (gcs) is moststrongly influenced by metallicity. the second parameter phenomenonacknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the hb morphologyof all gcs. in particular, the outer galactic halo contains gcs with redder hbsat a given metallicity than are found inside the solar circle. thus, at least asecond parameter is required to characterize hb morphology. here we analyze themedian color difference between the hb and the red giant branch (rgb), d(v-i),measured from hst acs photometry of 60 gcs within ~20 kpc of the galacticcenter. analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influenceof metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(v-i) and age isstronger than that of any other parameter considered. expanding the sample toinclude hst photometry of the 6 most distant galactic gcs lends additionalsupport to the correlation between d(v-i) and age. this result is robust withrespect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination,but must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information isnot available for a significant fraction of the sample. when a subset of gcswith similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation betweend(v-i) and central luminosity density is exposed. with respect to the existenceof gcs with anomalously red hbs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age isthe second parameter and central density is most likely the third. importantproblems related to hb morphology in gcs, notably multi-modal distributions andfaint blue tails, remain to be explained.

1004.4644	thirty new low-mass spectroscopic binaries	as part of our search for young m dwarfs within 25 pc, we acquiredhigh-resolution spectra of 185 low-mass stars compiled by the nstars projectthat have strong x-ray emission. by cross-correlating these spectra with radialvelocity standard stars, we are sensitive to finding multi-lined spectroscopicbinaries. we find a low-mass spectroscopic binary fraction of 16% consisting of27 sb2s, 2 sb3s and 1 sb4, increasing the number of known low-mass sbs by 50%and proving that strong x-ray emission is an extremely efficient way to findm-dwarf sbs. wasp photometry of 23 of these systems revealed two low-mass ebs,bringing the count of known m dwarf ebs to 15. bd -22 5866, the sb4, is fullydescribed in shkolnik et al. 2008 and ccdm j04404+3127 b consists of a twomid-m stars orbiting each other every 2.048 days. wasp also provided rotationperiods for 12 systems, and in the cases where the synchronization time scalesare short, we used p_rot to determine the true orbital parameters. for thosewith no p_rot, we use differential radial velocities to set upper limits onorbital periods and semi-major axes. more than half of our sample hasnear-equal-mass components (q &gt; 0.8). this is expected since our sample isbiased towards tight orbits where saturated x-ray emission is due to tidalspin-up rather than stellar youth. increasing the samples of m dwarf sbs andebs is extremely valuable in setting constraints on current theories of stellarmultiplicity and evolution scenarios for low-mass multiple systems.

0704.2420	searching for earth analogues around the nearest stars: the disk  age-metallicity relation and the age distribution in the solar neighbourhood	the chemical composition of earth's atmosphere has undergone substantialevolution over the course of its history. it is possible, even likely, thatterrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;consequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an importantconsideration in designing surveys for earth-analogues. valenti &amp; fischer(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 fgk dwarfs in the solarneighbourhood. using the hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibratepotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars fromthe valenti-fischer dataset. unlike other recent investigations, our analysisshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeitwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. the mean metallicity increases from-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.supplementing the valenti-fischer measurements with literature data to give acomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby fgk dwarfs isbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of thegalactic disk. in striking contrast, most stars known to have planetarycompanions are younger than 5 gyrs; however, stars with planetary companionswithin 0.4 au have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating thatthose systems are stable on timescales of many gyrs. several of the older,lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/fe] ratios, implyingmembership of the thick disk. if the frequency of terrestrial planets is alsocorrelated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetarysystem is likely to be ~3 gyrs. we discuss the implications of this hypothesisin designing searches for earth analogues among the nearby stars.

1212.1159	ultra-deep hubble space telescope imaging of the small magellanic cloud:  the initial mass function of stars with m &lt;~ 1 msun	we present a new measurement of the stellar initial mass function (imf) basedon ultra-deep, high-resolution photometry of &gt;5,000 stars in the outskirts ofthe small magellanic cloud (smc) galaxy. the hubble space telescope (hst)advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations reveal this rich, co-spatialpopulation behind the foreground globular cluster 47 tuc, which we targeted for121 hst orbits. the stellar main sequence of the smc is measured in the f606w,f814w color-magnitude diagram (cmd) down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanlyseparated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. wesimulate the smc population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolvedbinaries) from specific imfs, and converting those masses to luminosities inour bandpasses. the corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawndirectly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accountingfor the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. over acontinuous and well populated mass range of m = 0.37 - 0.93 msun (i.e., down toa ~75% completeness limit at f606w = 28.7), we demonstrate that the imf is wellrepresented by a single power-law form with slope \alpha = -1.90(^{+0.15}_{-0.10}) (3 sigma error) (i.e., dn/dm \propto m^{\alpha}). this isshallower than the salpeter slope of \alpha = -2.35, which agrees with theobserved stellar luminosity function at higher masses. our results indicatethat the imf does {\it not} turn over to a more shallow power-law form withinthis mass range. we discuss implications of this result for the theory of starformation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation ofthe imf with metallicity.

1306.1233	the gemini nici planet-finding campaign: the frequency of giant planets  around young b and a stars	we have carried out high contrast imaging of 70 young, nearby b and a starsto search for brown dwarf and planetary companions as part of the gemini niciplanet-finding campaign. our survey represents the largest, deepest survey forplanets around high-mass stars (~1.5-2.5 m_sun) conducted to date and includesthe planet hosts beta pic and fomalhaut. we obtained follow-up astrometry ofall candidate companions within 400 au projected separation for stars inuncrowded fields and identified new low-mass companions to hd 1160 and hip79797. we have found that the previously known young brown dwarf companion tohip 79797 is itself a tight (3 au) binary, composed of brown dwarfs with masses58 (+21, -20) m_jup and 55 (+20, -19) m_jup, making this system one of the raresubstellar binaries in orbit around a star. considering the contrast limits ofour nici data and the fact that we did not detect any planets, we usehigh-fidelity monte carlo simulations to show that fewer than 20% of 2 m_sunstars can have giant planets greater than 4 m_jup between 59 and 460 au at 95%confidence, and fewer than 10% of these stars can have a planet more massivethan 10 m_jup between 38 and 650 au. overall, we find that large-separationgiant planets are not common around b and a stars: fewer than 10% of b and astars can have an analog to the hr 8799 b (7 m_jup, 68 au) planet at 95%confidence. we also describe a new bayesian technique for determining the agesof field b and a stars from photometry and theoretical isochrones. our methodproduces more plausible ages for high-mass stars than previous age-datingtechniques, which tend to underestimate stellar ages and their uncertainties.

1312.1641	the acs survey of globular clusters. xiii. photometric calibration in  comparison with stetson standards	in this study we compare the photometric data of 34 milky way globularclusters, observed within the acs treasury program (pi: ata sarajedini) withthe corresponding ground-based data, provided by the photometric standard fieldcatalogs of stetson (2000, 2005). we focus on the transformation between thehst/acs f606w to v-band and f814w to i-band only. the goal is to assess thevalidity of the filter transformation equations by sirianni et al.(2005) withrespect to their dependence on metallicity, horizontal branch morphology, massand integrated (v-i) colour of the various globular clusters. such a dependenceis expected due to the fact that the transformation equations are based on theobservations of only one globular cluster, i.e., ngc 2419. surprisingly, thecorrelation between offset and metallicity is found to be weak, with a lowlevel significance. the correlation between offset and horizontal branchstructure, as well as total cluster mass is still weaker. based on theavailable data we do not find the photometric offset to be linked to multiplestellar populations, e.g., as found in ngc 0288, ngc 1851, and ngc 5139. theresults of this study show that there are small systematic offsets between thetransformed acs- and observed ground based photometry, and that these are onlyweakly correlated, if at all, with various cluster parameters and theirunderlying stellar populations. as a result, investigators wishing to transformglobular cluster photometry from the sirianni et al.(2005) ground-based v, isystem onto the stetson (2000) system simply need to add 0.040 (+/-0.012) tothe v-band magnitudes and 0.047 (+/-0.011) to the i-band magnitudes. this inturn means that the transformed acs (v-i) colours match the ground-based valuesfrom stetson (2000) to within ~0.01 mag.

1312.5294	brown dwarf photospheres are patchy: a hubble space telescope  near-infrared spectroscopic survey finds frequent low-level variability	condensate clouds strongly impact the spectra of brown dwarfs and exoplanets.recent discoveries of variable l/t transition dwarfs argued for patchy cloudsin at least some ultracool atmospheres. this study aims to measure thefrequency and level of spectral variability in brown dwarfs and to search forcorrelations with spectral type. we used hst/wfc3 to obtain spectroscopic timeseries for 22 brown dwarfs of spectral types ranging from l5 to t6 at 1.1-1.7$\mu$m for $\approx$40 min per object. using bayesian analysis, we find 6 browndwarfs with confident $(p&gt;95\%)$ variability in the relative flux in at leastone wavelength region at sub-percent precision, and 5 brown dwarfs withtentative $(p&gt;68\%)$ variability. we derive a minimum variability fraction$f_{min}=27^{+11}_{-7}\%$ over all covered spectral types. the fraction ofvariables is equal within errors for mid l, late l and mid t spectral types;for early t dwarfs we do not find any confident variable but the sample is toosmall to derive meaningful limits. for some objects, the variability occursprimarily in the flux peak in the j or h band, others are variable throughoutthe spectrum or only in specific absorption regions. four sources may havebroad-band peak-to-peak amplitudes exceeding 1%. our measurements are notsensitive to very long periods, inclinations near pole-on and rotationallysymmetric heterogeneity. the detection statistics are consistent with mostbrown dwarf photospheres being patchy. while multiple-percent near-infraredvariability may be rare and confined to the l/t transition, low-levelheterogeneities are a frequent characteristic of brown dwarf atmospheres.

1409.3528	gender-based systematics in hst proposal selection	proposal success rates are calculated for hst cycles 11 through 21 as afunction of the gender of the principal investigator (pi). in each cycle,proposals with male pis have a higher success rate, with the disparity greatestfor cycles 12 and 18. the offsets are small enough that they might be ascribedto chance for any single cycle, but the consistent pattern suggests thepresence of a systematic effect. closer inspection of results from cycles 19,20 and 21 shows that the systematic difference does not appear to depend on thegeographic origin of the proposal nor does it depend on the gender distributionon the review panels. segregating proposals by the seniority of the pi, thesuccess rates by gender for more recent graduates (ph.d. since 2000) are moreclosely comparable. there is also a correlation between success by gender andthe average seniority of the review panel for cycles 19 and 20, but not cycle21. we discuss these results and some consequent changes to the proposal formatand additions to the hst tac orientation process.

1411.0003	cloud structure of the nearest brown dwarfs: spectroscopic variability  of luhman 16ab from the hubble space telescope	the binary brown dwarf wise j104915.57$-$531906.1 (also luhman 16ab),composed of a late l and early t dwarf, is a prototypical l/t transition fluxreversal binary located at only 2 pc distance. luhman 16b is a known variablewhose light curves evolve rapidly. we present spatially resolved spectroscopictime-series of luhman 16a and b covering 6.5 h using hst/wfc3 at 1.1 to 1.66$\mu$m. the small, count-dependent variability of luhman 16a at the beginningof the observations likely stems from instrumental systematics; luhman 16aappears non-variable above $\approx$0.4%. its spectrum is well fit by a singlecloud layer with intermediate cloud thickness (f_sed=2, teff=1200 k). luhman16b varies at all wavelengths with peak-to-valley amplitudes of 7-11%. theamplitude and light curve shape changes over only one rotation period. thelowest relative amplitude is found in the deep water absorption band at 1.4$\mu$m, otherwise it mostly decreases gradually from the blue to the red edgeof the spectrum. this is very similar to the other two known highly variableearly t dwarfs. a two-component cloud model accounts for most of thevariability, although small deviations are seen in the water absorption band.we fit the mean spectrum and relative amplitudes with a linear combination oftwo models of a warm, thinner cloud (teff=1300 k, fsed=3) and a cooler, thickercloud (teff=1000-1100 k, f_sed=1), assuming out-of-equilibrium atmosphericchemistry. a cloud as for luhman 16a but with holes cannot reproduce thevariability of luhman 16b, indicating more complex cloud evolution through thel/t transition. the projected separation of the binary has decreased by$\approx$0.3'' in 8 months.

0805.0312	bd-22 5866: a low-mass quadruple-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing  binary	we report our discovery of an extremely rare, low mass, quadruple-linedspectroscopic binary bd-22 5866 (=nltt 53279, integrated spectral type = m0 v),found during an ongoing search for the youngest m dwarfs in the solarneighborhood. from the cross-correlation function, we are able to measurerelative flux levels, estimate the spectral types of the components, and setupper limits on the orbital periods and separations. the resulting system ishierarchical composed of k7 + k7 binary and a m1 + m2 binary with semi-majoraxes of asini_{a}&lt;=0.06 au and asini_{b}&lt;=0.30 au. a subsequent search of thesuperwasp photometric database revealed that the k7 + k7 binary is eclipsingwith a period of 2.21 days and at an inclination angle of 85 degrees. withinuncertainties of 5%, the masses and radii of both components appear to be equal(0.59 msun, 0.61 rsun). these two tightly orbiting stars (a = 0.035 au) are insynchronous rotation causing the observed excess ca ii, halpha, x-ray and uvemission. the fact that the system was unresolved with published adaptiveoptics imaging, limits the projected physical separation of the two binaries atthe time of the observation to d_{ab} &lt; 4.1 au at the photometric distance of51 pc. the maximum observed radial velocity difference between the a and bbinaries limits the orbit to asini_{ab}&lt;=6.1 au. as this tight configuration isdifficult to reproduce with current formation models of multiple systems, wespeculate that an early dynamical process reduced the size of the system suchas the interaction of the two binaries with a circumquadruple disk. intensivephotometric, spectroscopic and interferometric monitoring as well as a parallaxmeasurement of this rare quadruple system is certainly warranted.

0807.2452	the luminosity and mass functions of low-mass stars in the galactic  disk: i. the calibration region	we present measurements of the luminosity and mass functions of low-massstars constructed from a catalog of matched sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and2 micron all sky survey (2mass) detections. this photometric catalog containsmore than 25,000 matched sdss and 2mass point sources spanning ~30 squaredegrees on the sky. we have obtained follow-up spectroscopy, complete to j=16,of more than 500 low mass dwarf candidates within a 1 square degree sub-sample,and thousands of additional dwarf candidates in the remaining 29 squaredegrees. this spectroscopic sample verifies that the photometric sample iscomplete, uncontaminated, and unbiased at the 99% level globally, and at the95% level in each color range. we use this sample to derive the luminosity andmass functions of low-mass stars over nearly a decade in mass (0.7 m_sun &gt; m_*&gt; 0.1 m_sun). we find that the logarithmically binned mass function is best fitwith an m_c=0.29 log-normal distribution, with a 90% confidence interval ofm_c=0.20--0.50. these 90% confidence intervals correspond to linearly binnedmass functions peaking between 0.27 m_sun and 0.12 m_sun, where the best fit mfturns over at 0.17 m_sun. a power law fit to the entire mass range sampledhere, however, returns a best fit of alpha=1.1 (where the salpeter slope isalpha = 2.35). these results agree well with most previous investigations,though differences in the analytic formalisms adopted to describe those massfunctions can give the false impression of disagreement. given the richness ofmodern-day astronomical datasets, we are entering the regime whereby strongerconclusions can be drawn by comparing the actual datapoints measured indifferent mass functions, rather than the results of analytic analyses thatimpose structure on the data a priori.

astro-ph;0003068	an improved red spectrum of the methane or t-dwarf sdss 1624+0029: role  of the alkali metals	a keck~ii low resolution spectrum shortward of ome-micron is presented forsdss 1624+0029, the first field methane or t dwarf discovered in the sloandigital sky survey. significant flux is detected down to the spectrum's shortwavelength limit of 6200\aa. the spectrum exhibits a broad absorption featurecentered at 7700\aa, which we interpret as the k~i 7665/7699 resonance doublet.the observed flux declines shortward of 7000\aa, due most likely to the redwing of the na~i doublet. both cs~i doublet lines are detected more stronglythan in an earlier red spectrum. neither li~i absorption nor h$\alpha$ emissionare detected. an exploratory model fit to the spectrum suggests that the shapeof the red spectrum can be primarily accounted for by the broad wings of thek~i and na~i doublets. this behavior is consistent with the argument profferedby burrows, marley and sharp that strong alkali absorption is principallyresponsible for depressing t dwarf spectra shortward of 1$\mu$m. in particular,there seems no compelling reason at this time to introduce dust or anadditional opacity source in the atmosphere of the sdss object. the width ofthe k~i and strengths of the cs~i lines also indicate that the sloan object iswarmer than gl~229b.

astro-ph;0108452	the spectra of t dwarfs i: near-infrared data and spectral  classification	we present near-infrared spectra for a sample of t dwarfs, including elevennew discoveries made using the two micron all sky survey. these objects aredistinguished from warmer (l-type) brown dwarfs by the presence of methaneabsorption bands in the 1--2.5 $\micron$ spectral region. a first attempt at anear-infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs is made, based on thestrengths of ch$_4$ and h$_2$o bands and the shapes of the 1.25, 1.6, and 2.1$\micron$ flux peaks. subtypes t1 v through t8 v are defined, and spectralindices useful for classification are presented. the subclasses appear tofollow a decreasing t$_{eff}$ scale, based on the evolution of ch$_4$ andh$_2$o bands and the properties of l and t dwarfs with known distances.however, we speculate that this scale is not linear with spectral type for cooldwarfs, due to the settling of dust layers below the photosphere and subsequentrapid evolution of spectral morphology around t$_{eff}$ $\sim$ 1300--1500 k.similarities in near-infrared colors and continuity of spectral featuressuggest that the gap between the latest l dwarfs and earliest t dwarfs has beennearly bridged. this argument is strengthened by the possible role of ch$_4$ asa minor absorber shaping the k-band spectra of the latest l dwarfs. finally, wediscuss one peculiar t dwarf, 2mass 0937+2931, which has very bluenear-infrared colors (j-k$_s$ = $-0.89\pm$0.24) due to suppression of the 2.1$\micron$ peak. the feature is likely caused by enhanced collision-inducedh$_2$ absorption in a high pressure or low metallicity photosphere.

astro-ph;0112402	on the nature of stars with planets	we consider the metallicities and kinematics of nearby stars known to haveplanetary-mass companions in the general context of the overall properties ofthe local galactic disk. we have used stromgren photometry to determineabundances for both the extrasolar-planet host stars and for a volume-limitedsample of 486 f, g and k stars selected from the hipparcos catalogue. thelatter data show that the sun lies near the modal abundance of the disk, withover 45% of local stars having super-solar metallicities. twenty of the latterstars (4.1%) are known to have planetary-mass companions. using that ratio toscale data for the complete sample of planetary host stars, we find that thefraction of stars with extrasolar planets rises sharply with increasingabundance, confirming previous results. however, the frequency remains at the3-4% level for stars within 0.15 dex of solar abundance, and falls to ~1% onlyfor stars with abundances less than half solar. given the present observationalconstraints, both in velocity precision and in the available time baseline,these numbers represent a lower limit to the frequency of extrasolar planetarysystems. a comparison between the kinematics of the planetary host stars and arepresentative sample of disk stars suggests that the former have an averageage which is ~60% of the latter.

astro-ph;0211470	binarity in brown dwarfs: t dwarf binaries discovered with the hubble  space telescope wpfc2	(abridged) we present the discovery of two t dwarf binaries, 2mass1225-2739ab and 2mass 1534-2952ab, identified in a sample of ten t dwarfsimaged with the hubble space telescope wide field planetary camera 2. theseparations of the two binary systems are 0{\farcs}282$\pm$0{\farcs}005 and0{\farcs}065$\pm$0{\farcs}007, implying projected separations of 3.17$\pm$0.14and 1.0$\pm$0.3 au, respectively. the observed binary fraction of our hstsample, 20$^{+17}_{-7}$%, is consistent with results obtained for late-m and lfield dwarfs, and implies a bias-corrected binary fraction of 9$^{+15}_{-4}$%for $a \gtrsim 1$ au and $q \gtrsim 0.4$, significantly lower than the binaryfractions of f--g and early-type m dwarf stars. neither of the t binaries haveseparations $a \gtrsim 10$ au, consistent with results from other brown dwarfbinary searches. we conclude that tidal disruption by passing stars or giantmolecular clouds, which limits the extent of wide stellar binaries, plays norole in eliminating wide brown dwarf binaries, implying either disruption veryearly in the formation process (ages $\lesssim 1-10$ myr) or a formationmechanism which precludes such systems. we find that the maximum binaryseparation in the brown dwarf regime appears to scale as m$_{total}^2$, apossible clue to the physical mechanism which restricts wide substellarsystems.

astro-ph;0602122	not alone: tracing the origins of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs  through multiplicity studies	the properties of multiple stellar systems have long provided importantempirical constraints for star formation theories, enabling (along with severalother lines of evidence) a concrete, qualitative picture of the birth and earlyevolution of normal stars. at very low masses (vlm; m &lt;~ 0.1 m_sun), down toand below the hydrogen burning minimum mass, our understanding of formationprocesses is not as clear, with several competing theories now underconsideration. one means of testing these theories is through the empiricalcharacterization of vlm multiple systems. here, we review the results ofvarious vlm multiplicity studies to date. these systems can be generallycharacterized as closely separated (93% have projected separations delta &lt; 20au) and near equal-mass (77% have m_2/m_1 &gt;= 0.8) occurring infrequently(perhaps 10-30%). both the frequency and maximum separation of stellar andbrown dwarf binaries steadily decrease for lower system masses, suggesting thatvlm binary formation and/or evolution may be a mass-dependent process. there isevidence for a fairly rapid decline in the number of loosely-bound systemsbelow ~0.3 m_sun, corresponding to a factor of 10-20 increase in the minimumbinding energy of vlm binaries as compared to more massive stellar binaries.this wide-separation ``desert'' is present among both field (~1-5 gyr) andolder (&gt; 100 myr) cluster systems, while the youngest (&lt;~10 myr) vlm binaries,particularly those in nearby, low-density star forming regions, appear to havesomewhat different systemic properties. we compare these empirical trends topredictions laid out by current formation theories, and outline futureobservational studies needed to probe the full parameter space of the lowestmass multiple systems.

astro-ph;0605577	hubble space telescope nicmos observations of t dwarfs: brown dwarf  multiplicity and new probes of the l/t transition	we present the results of a hubble space telescope nicmos imaging survey of22 t-type field brown dwarfs. five are resolved as binary systems with angularseparations of 0"05-0"35, and companionship is established on the basis ofcomponent f110w-f170m colors (indicative of ch4 absorption) and lowprobabilities of background contamination. prior ground-based observations show2mass 1553+1532ab to be a common proper motion binary. the properties of thesesystems - low multiplicity fraction (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected forsample selection baises), close projected separations (a = 1.8-5.0 au) andnear-unity mass ratios - are consistent with previous results for field browndwarf binaries. three of the binaries have components that span thepoorly-understood transition between l dwarfs and t dwarfs. spectraldecomposition analysis of one of these, sdss 1021-0304ab, reveals a peculiarflux reversal between its components, as its t5 secondary is ~30% brighter at1.05 and 1.27 micron than its t1 primary. this system, 2mass 0518-2828ab andsdss 1534+1615ab all demonstrate that the j-band brightening observed betweenlate-type l to mid-type t dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of this spectraltransition, albeit less pronounced than previously surmised. we also find thatthe resolved binary fraction of l7 to t3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other l andt dwarfs, an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid evolution ofbrown dwarfs through the l/t transition, perhaps driven by dynamic(nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric condensates.

astro-ph;0609799	a re-appraisal of the habitability of planets around m dwarf stars	stable, hydrogen-burning, m dwarf stars comprise about 75% of all stars inthe galaxy. they are extremely long-lived and because they are much smaller inmass than the sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 msun), their temperature and stellarluminosity are low and peaked in the red. we have re-examined what is known atpresent about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, ormigrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an mdwarf star. observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-buildingmaterials are common around m dwarfs, but n-body simulations differ in theirestimations of the likelihood of potentially-habitable, wet planets residingwithin their habitable zones, which are only ~ 1/5 to 1/50 of the width of thatfor a g star. particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planetswith masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 mearth orbiting m stars, there seems noreason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. tidally lockedsynchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone doesn't necessarily leadto atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of anevolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. weconclude that m dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which theorigin and evolution of life can occur. a number of planetary processes such ascessation of geothermal activity, or thermal and non-thermal atmospheric lossprocesses may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods farshorter than the extreme lifetime of the m dwarf star. nevertheless, it makessense to include m dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worldsand evidence of life.
