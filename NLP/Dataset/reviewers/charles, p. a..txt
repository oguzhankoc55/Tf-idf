0902.3385	discovery of long-term superorbital periodicities in the  pseudo-transient lmxbs: igr j17098-3628 and exo0748-676	long-term monitoring of the recently discovered x-ray transient, igrj17098-3628, by the all sky monitor on board the rossi x-ray timing explorer,has shown that it displays a long term (~163d) quasi-periodic modulation in thedata spanning its "active" state (i.e. approximately mjd 53450-54200).furthermore, this light-curve is not typical of "classical" soft x-raytransients, in that j17098-3628 has remained active since its initialdiscovery, and may be more akin to the pseudo-transient exo0748-676, which isnow classified as a persistent low mass x-ray binary. however, exo0748-676recently entered a more active phase (since approximately mjd 53050), sincewhen we find that it too displays a quasi-periodic modulation (~181d) in itslight-curve. this must be a "superorbital" modulation, as the orbital period ofexo0748-676 is well established (3.8hrs), and hence we interpret both objects'long periods as representing some intrinsic properties of the accretion disc(such as coupled precessional and warping effects). by analogy, we thereforesuggest that igr j17098-3628 is another member of this class ofpseudo-transient lmxbs and is likely to have a &lt;1d orbital period.

1006.4513	unveiling the nature of integral objects through optical spectroscopy.  viii. identification of 44 newly detected hard x-ray sources	(abridged) hard x-ray surveys performed by the integral satellite havediscovered a conspicuous fraction (up to 30%) of unidentified objects among thedetected sources. here we continue our identification program by selectingprobable optical candidates using positional cross-correlation with soft x-ray,radio, and/or optical archives, and performing optical spectroscopy on them. asa result, we identified or more accurately characterized 44 counterparts ofintegral sources: 32 active galactic nuclei, with redshift 0.019 &lt; z &lt; 0.6058,6 cataclysmic variables (cvs), 5 high-mass x-ray binaries (2 of which in thesmall magellanic cloud), and 1 low-mass x-ray binary. this was achieved byusing 7 telescopes of various sizes and archival data from two onlinespectroscopic surveys. the main physical parameters of these hard x-ray sourceswere also determined using the available multiwavelength information. agns arethe most abundant population among hard x-ray objects, and our results confirmthis tendency when optical spectroscopy is used as an identification tool. thedeeper sensitivity of recent integral surveys enables one to begin detectinghard x-ray emission above 20 kev from sources such as liner-type agns andnon-magnetic cvs.

1010.4184	correlated optical/x-ray long-term variability in lmxb 4u1636-536	we have conducted a 3-month program of simultaneous optical, soft and hardx-ray monitoring of the lmxb 4u1636-536/v801 ara using the smarts 1.3mtelescope and archival rxte/asm and swift/xrt data. 4u1636-536 has beenexhibiting a large amplitude, quasi-periodic variability since 2002 when itsx-ray flux dramatically declined by roughly an order of magnitude. we confirmedthat the anti-correlation between soft (2-12 kev) and hard (&gt; 20 kev) x-rays,first investigated by shih et al. (2005), is not an isolated event but afundamental characteristic of this source's variability properties. however,the variability itself is neither strictly stable nor changing on an evenlonger characteristic timescale. we also demonstrate that the opticalcounterpart varies on the same timescale, and is correlated with the soft, andnot the hard, x-rays. this clearly shows that x-ray reprocessing in lmxb discsis mainly driven by soft x-rays. the x-ray spectra in different epochs of thevariability revealed a change of spectral characteristics which resemble thestate change of black hole x-ray binaries. all the evidence suggests that4u1636-536 is frequently (~monthly) undergoing x-ray state transitions, acharacteristic feature of x-ray novae with their wide range of luminositiesassociated with outburst events. in its current behavioural mode, this makes4u1636-536 an ideal target for investigating the details of state changes inluminous x-ray binaries.

1111.6946	the nature of the x-ray transient maxi j0556-332	phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly discovered x-ray transient maxij0556-332 has revealed the presence of narrow emission lines in the bowenregion that most likely arise on the surface of the mass donor star in this lowmass x-ray binary. a period search of the radial velocities of these linesprovides two candidate orbital periods (16.43+/-0.12 and 9.754+/-0.048 hrs),which differ from any potential x-ray periods reported. assuming that maxij0556-332 is a relatively high inclination system that harbors a precessingaccretion disk in order to explain its x-ray properties, it is only possible toobtain a consistent set of system parameters for the longer period. theseassumptions imply a mass ratio of q~0.45, a radial velocity semi-amplitude ofthe secondary of k_2~190 km/s and a compact object mass of the order of thecanonical neutron star mass, making a black hole nature for maxi j0556-332unlikely. we also report the presence of strong n iii emission lines in thespectrum, thereby inferring a high n/o abundance. finally we note that thestrength of all emission lines shows a continuing decay over the ~1 month ofour observations.

(2001); this is possibly due to theproperties of dust in the circumnuclear obscuring torus of the agn.

astro-ph;0101104	optical studies of the x-ray transient xte j2123-058 - ii.  phase-resolved spectroscopy	we present time-resolved spectroscopy of the soft x-ray transient xtej2123-058 in outburst. a useful spectral coverage of 3700-6700a was achievedspanning two orbits of the binary, with single epoch coverage extending to\~9000a. the optical spectrum approximates a steep blue power-law, consistentwith emission on the rayleigh-jeans tail of a hot black body spectrum. thestrongest spectral lines are heii 4686a and ciii/niii 4640a (bowen blend) inemission. their relative strengths suggest that xte j2123-058 was formed in thegalactic plane, not in the halo. other weak emission lines of heii and civ arepresent and balmer lines show a complex structure, blended with heii. heii4686a profiles show a complex multiple s-wave structure with the strongestcomponent appearing at low velocities in the lower-left quadrant of a dopplertomogram. h alpha shows transient absorption between phases 0.35-0.55. both ofthese effects appear to be analogous to similar behaviour in sw sex typecataclysmic variables. we therefore consider whether the spectral linebehaviour of xte j2123-058 can be explained by the same models invoked forthose systems.

astro-ph;0102075	the optical counterpart to sax j1808.4-3658: observations in quiescence	we report the first extensive set of optical photometric observations of thecounterpart to sax j1808.4-3658 (v4580 sagittarius) in quiescence. the sourcewas detected at v~21, 5 magnitudes fainter than at the peak of its 1998outburst. however, a comparable ~6% semi-amplitude 2hr modulation of its fluxis revealed. this has the same phasing and approximately sinusoidal modulationas seen during outburst and with photometric minimum when the pulsar is behindthe companion. the lack of a double-humped morphology rules out an ellipsoidalorigin, implying that the bulk of the optical flux does not arise from thecompanion. moreover, applying crude modelling to the disc and x-ray irradiatedface of the donor shows that the internal energy release of a remnant disc(with mass transfer driven by gravitational radiation) is sufficient to explainmost of the optical emission, and with the modulation due to the varyingcontribution of the heated star's face. we note that this model is alsoconsistent with the much lower x-ray to optical flux ratio in quiescence versusoutburst, and with the phasing of the optical modulation.

astro-ph;0111218	halpha flares from v404 cyg in quiescence	we present a spectrophotometric study of short-term optical variability inthe quiescent black hole x-ray transient v404 cyg. this includes two nights ofhigh time-resolution halpha spectroscopy with which we resolve much of thetime-variability, and a further six nights of archival spectroscopy with lowertime-resolution but higher spectral-resolution. we find significant variabilityin most of the data considered, with both the halpha line and the continuumoften varying in a correlated way. this includes both dramatic flares lasting afew hours in which the line flux nearly doubles and lower-level flickering. thestrongest flares involve development of asymmetry in the line profile, with thered wing usually strongest independent of orbital phase. it is unclear why thisis the case, but we discuss several possible explanations. we consider theenergetics of the flares and compare with plausible models includingchromospheric activity on the companion star, local magnetic reconnectionevents within the disc and a varying irradiation from close to the black hole.based on the line profile changes during the flares, we conclude that the mostlikely origin for the variability is variable photoionisation by the centralsource, although local flares within the disc cannot be ruled out.

(1997, hereafter d97). d97 presentedfokker-planck models for the collapsed-core globular cluster m15 that include adense, centrally concentrated population of neutron stars and massive whitedwarfs, but do not include a central black hole. in this addendum, we presentcorrected versions of figures 9, 10, and 12, and an expanded version of figure6. this latter figure, which shows the full run of the velocity dispersionprofile, indicates that the d97 model predictions are in good agreement withthe moderately rising hst-stis velocity dispersion profile for m15 reported bygerssen et al. (2002, astro-ph/0209315). thus, a central black hole is notrequired to fit the new stis velocity measurements, provided that there is asufficient population of neutron stars and massive white dwarfs. thisconclusion is consistent with the findings of gerssen et al. (2002,astro-ph/0210158), based on a reapplication of their jeans equation analysisusing the corrected mass-to-light profile (figure 12) for the d97 models.

astro-ph;0211154	the optical light curves of xte j2123--058: the mass of the binary  components and the structure of the quiescent accretion disk	we present optical photometry of xte j2123-058 during its quiescent statetaken in 1999 and 2000. the dominant feature of our r-band light curve is theellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star, however, in order to fit thissatisfactorily we require additional components which comprise an x-ray heatedroche-lobe filling secondary star, and an accretion disk bulge, i.e. where thegas stream impacts the accretion disk. the observed dip near phase 0.8 isinterpreted as the eclipse of inner parts of the accretion disk by the bulge.this scenario is highly plausible given the high binary inclination. our fitsallow us to constrain the size of the quiescent accretion disk to lie in therange 0.26-0.56r_l1 (68% confidence). using the distance of 9.6 kpc and thex-ray flux inferred from the heated hemisphere of the companion, we obtain anunabsorbed x-ray luminosity of 1.2x10^33 erg/s for xte j2123-058 in quiescence.  from the observed quiescent optical/ir colors we find that the power-lawindex (-1.4) for the spectral distribution of the accretion disk compares wellwith other quiescent x-ray transients. we also re-analyse the optical lightcurves of the soft x-ray transient xte j2123-058 taken during its outburst anddecay in 1998. we use a robust method to fit the data using a refined x-raybinary model. the model computes the light arising from a roche-lobe fillingstar and flared accretion disk irradiated by x-rays, and calculates the effectsof shadowing and mutual star/disk eclipses. we obtain relatively accuratevalues for the binary inclination and mass ratio, which when combined withspectroscopic results obtained in paper ii gives a neutron star mass in therange 1.04-1.56mo (68% confidence).

astro-ph;0301127	dynamical evidence for a black hole in gx 339-4	we present outburst spectroscopy of gx339-4 which may reveal the motion ofits elusive companion star. niii lines exhibit sharp emission components movingover ~300 km/s in a single night. the most plausible interpretation of thesecomponents is that they are formed by irradiation of the companion star and thevelocities indicate its orbital motion. we also detect motion of the wings ofthe heii 4686a line and changes in its morphology. no previously proposedperiod is consistent with periodic behavior of all of these measures. however,consistent and sensible solutions are obtained for periods around 1.7 days. forthe best period, 1.7557 days, we estimate a mass function of 5.8 +/- 0.5 msun.even allowing for aliases, the 95% confidence lower-limit on the mass functionis 2.0 msun. gx339-4 can therefore be added to the list of dynamical black holecandidates. this is supported by the small motion in the wings of the heiiline; if the compact object velocity is not larger than the observed motionthen the mass ratio is q &lt; 0.08, similar to other systems harboring blackholes. finally, we note that the sharp components are not always present, butdo seem to occur within a repeating phase range. this appears to migratebetween our epochs of observation, and may indicate shielding of the companionstar by a variable accretion geometry such as a warp.

astro-ph;0402075	x-ray behaviour of circinus x-1 - i: x-ray dips as a diagnostic of  periodic behaviour	we examine the periodic nature of detailed structure (particularly dips) inthe rxte/asm lightcurve of circinus x-1. the significant phase wandering of thex-ray maxima suggests their identification with the response on a viscoustimescale of the accretion disk to perturbation. we find that the x-ray dipsprovide a more accurate system clock than the maxima, and thus use these asindicators of the times of periastron passage. we fit a quadratic ephemeris tothese dips, and find its predictive power for the x-ray lightcurve to besuperior to ephemerides based on the radio flares and the full archival x-raylightcurve. under the hypothesis that the dips are tracers of the mass transferrate from the donor, we use their occurrence rate as a function of orbitalphase to explore the (as yet unconstrained) nature of the donor. the high$\dot{p}$ term in the ephemeris provides another piece of evidence that cir x-1is in a state of dynamical evolution, and thus is a very young post-supernovasystem. we further suggest that the radio ``synchrotron nebula'' immediatelysurrounding cir x-1 is in fact the remnant of the event that created thecompact object, and discuss briefly the evidence for and against such aninterpretation.

astro-ph;0402408	the distance and interstellar sight line to gx339-4	the distance to the black hole binary gx339-4 remains a topic of debate. weexamine high-resolution optical spectra of the nad lines resolving the velocitystructure along the line of sight. we find this to be complex, with at leastnine components, mostly blue-shifted, spanning a velocity range of nearly200km/s. the presence of components with a large blue-shift rules out a nearbylocation and requires that the binary be located at or beyond the tangentpoint, implying a lower limit to the distance of ~6kpc. the presence of asignificant red-shifted component at +30km/s is even more intriguing as gx339-4also has a slightly positive systemic velocity, suggesting that the source, andthis cloud, could be on the far side of the galaxy, where the radial velocitiesdue to galactic rotation become positive again. if this is the case, we requirea distance of ~15kpc. this is less secure than the 6kpc lower limit however. wediscuss the implications of these possible distances for the outburst andquiescent luminosities, and the nature of the companion star, and argue that alarge distance is consistent with these characteristics. in particular, itwould explain the non-detection of the companion star during the fainteststates.

astro-ph;0408057	optical spectroscopy of flares from the black hole x-ray transient  a0620-00 in quiescence	we present a time-resolved spectrophotometric study of the opticalvariability in the quiescent soft x-ray transient a0620-00. superimposed on thedouble-humped continuum lightcurve are the well known flare events which lasttens of minutes. some of the flare events that appear in the continuumlightcurve are also present in the emission line lightcurves. from the balmerline flux and variations, we find that the persistent emission is opticallythin. during the flare event at phase 1.15 the balmer decrement droppedsuggesting either a significant increase in temperature or that the flares aremore optically thick than the continuum. the data suggests that there are twohi emitting regions, the accretion disc and the accretion stream/disc region,with different balmer decrements. the orbital modulation of h$\alpha$ with thecontinuum suggests that the steeper decrement is most likely associated withthe stream/disc impact region. we construct doppler images of the h$\alpha$ andh$\beta$ emission lines. apart from showing enhanced blurred emission at theregion where the stream impacts the accretion disc, the maps also showsignificant extended structure from the opposite side of the disc. the trailedspectra show characteristic s-wave features that can be interpreted in thecontext of an eccentric accretion disc (abridged).

astro-ph;0408331	evidence for a black hole in the x-ray transient gs 1354-64 (=bw cir)	we present the first radial velocity curve of the companion star to bw cirwhich demonstrates the presence of a black hole in this x-ray transient whichrecorded outbursts in 1987 and 1997 (and possibly 1971-2). we identify weakabsorption features corresponding to a g0-5iii donor star, strongly veiled by aresidual accretion disc which contributes 61-65 % of the total light at lambda6300. the doppler motions of these features trace an orbit of p=2.54448 days(or its 1-yr alias of p=2.56358 days) and velocity semi-amplitude k2=279 +- 5km/s (or k2=292 +- 5 km/s). both solutions are equally possible. the massfunction implied by the shorter period solution is f(m)= 5.75 +- 0.30 msunwhich, combined with the rotational broadening of the tidally locked companion(v sin i =71 +- 4 km/s), yields a compact object mass of m1 sin3 i = 7.34 +-0.46 msun. this is substantially above the mass of a neutron star under anystandard equation of state of nuclear matter. the companion star is probably ag subgiant which has evolved off the main sequence in order to fill its rochelobe. remarkably, a distance of &gt; 27 kpc is inferred by the companion'sluminosity and this is supported by the large observed systemic velocity (gamma= 103 +- 4 km/s) which requires such a distance in order to be consistent withthe galactic rotation curve.

astro-ph;0508583	doppler tomography of the transient x-ray binary centaurus x-4 in  quiescence	we present eso-ntt low resolution spectroscopy of the neutron star x-raytransient cen x-4 in quiescence over a complete orbital cycle. our data revealthe presence of a k3-7 v companion which contributes 63% to the 5600-6900a fluxand orbits the neutron star with a velocity semi-amplitude of k_2=145.8 +/- 1.0km s^{-1}. this, combined with a previous determination of the inclinationangle and mass ratio, yields a neutron star and companion mass of m_1=1.5 +/-1.0 m_sun and m_2=0.31 +/- 0.27 m_sun, respectively. the mass donor is thusundermassive for the inferred spectral type indicating it is probably evolved,in agreement with previous studies. doppler tomography of the h_alpha lineshows prominent emission located on the companion and a slightly asymmetricaccretion disc distribution similar to that seen in systems with precessingeccentric discs. strong h_alpha emission from the companion can be explained byx-ray irradiation from the primary. no evidence is found for a hot spot inh_alpha, whereas one is revealed via doppler tomography of the hei lines. thiscan be interpreted as the hot spot and outer regions of the disc being at ahigher temperature than in other systems.

astro-ph;0509638	a "combination nova" outburst in z andromedae: nuclear shell burning  triggered by a disk instability	we describe observational evidence for a new kind of interacting-binary-staroutburst that involves both an accretion instability and an increase inthermonuclear shell burning on the surface of an accreting white dwarf. werefer to this new type of eruption as a combination nova. in late 2000, theprototypical symbiotic star z andromedae brightened by roughly two magnitudesin the optical. we observed the outburst in the radio with the vla and merlin,in the optical both photometrically and spectroscopically, in the farultraviolet with fuse, and in the x-rays with both chandra and xmm. thetwo-year-long event had three distinct stages. during the first stage, theoptical rise closely resembled an earlier, small outburst that was caused by anaccretion-disk instability. in the second stage, the hot component ejected anoptically thick shell of material. in the third stage, the shell cleared toreveal a white dwarf whose luminosity remained on the order of 10^4 lsun forapproximately one year. the eruption was thus too energetic to have beenpowered by accretion alone. we propose that the initial burst of accretion waslarge enough to trigger enhanced nuclear burning on the surface of the whitedwarf and the ejection of an optically thick shell of material. this outbursttherefore combined elements of both a dwarf nova and a classical nova. ourresults have implications for the long-standing problem of producing shellflashes with short recurrence times on low-mass white dwarfs in symbioticstars.

astro-ph;9807174	soft x-ray transient light curves as standard candles: exponential  versus linear decays	a recent paper by king and ritter (1998: hereafter kr) proposed that thelight curves of soft x-ray transients (sxts) are dominated by the effect ofirradiation of the accretion disc by the central x-rays. this prevents theonset of the cooling wave which would otherwise return the disc to thequiescent state, and so prolongs the outbursts beyond those in dwarf novadiscs. kr show that the decay of the resulting x-ray light curve should beexponential or linear depending on whether or not the observed peak x-rayluminosity is sufficient to ionize the outer edge of the accretion disc. herewe examine the observed x-ray decays, and show that they are exponential orlinear according as the peak luminosity is greater or smaller than the criticalvalue defined by kr, strongly suggesting that the light curves are indeedirradiation--dominated. we show further that the occurrence of an exponentialor linear decay tends to favour the same type of decay in subsequent outbursts,so that systems usually show only one or the other type. we use the equationsof kr and the observed x-ray light curve to determine the size $r_{h}$ of thehot disc at the peak of the outburst. for exponential decays, $r_{h}$ is foundto be comparable to the circularization radius, as expected since the discconsists entirely of material transferred from the secondary since the previousoutburst. further, $r_h$ is directly proportional to the time at which one seesthe secondary maximum ($t_{s}$), as expected if $t_{s}$ is the viscoustimescale of the irradiated disc. this implies that the orders of magnitude ofthe viscosity parameter alpha and disc aspect ratio h/r are such that alpha(h/r)~0.01. observation of a secondary maximum calibrates the peak luminosityand gives an eqaution for the distance to the source.

0812.3032	phase resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsar  sax j1808.4-3658 during the 2008 outburst	aims: we obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecondx-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 during its outburst in 2008 to find a signatureof the donor star, constrain its radial velocity semi-amplitude (k_2), andderive estimates on the pulsar mass. methods: using doppler images of the bowenregion we find a significant (&gt;8sigma) compact spot at a position where thedonor star is expected. if this is a signature of the donor star, we measurek_em=248+/-20 km/s (1sigma confidence) which represents a strict lower limit tok_2. also, the doppler map of he ii lambda4686 shows the characteristicsignature of the accretion disk, and there is a hint of enhanced emission thatmay be a result of tidal distortions in the accretion disk that are expected invery low mass ratio interacting binaries. results: the lower-limit on k_2 leadsto a lower-limit on the mass function of f(m_1)&gt;0.10m_sun. applying the maximumk-correction gives 228&lt;k_2&lt;322 km/s and a mass ratio of 0.051&lt;q&lt;0.072.conclusions: despite the limited s/n of the data we were able to detect asignature of the donor star in sax j1808.4-3658, although future observationsduring a new outburst are still warranted to confirm this. if the derived k_emis correct, the largest uncertainty in the determination of the mass of theneutron star in sax j1808.4-3658 using dynamical studies lies with the poorlyknown inclination.
