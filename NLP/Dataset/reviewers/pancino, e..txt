0901.4476	radial extent of the sgb in ngc 1851	recent hst-acs observations revealed the presence of a double subgiant branch(sgb) in the core of the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851. this peculiaritywas tentatively explained by the presence of a second population with either anage difference of about 1 gyr, or a higher c+n+o abundance, probably due topollution by the first generation of stars.  in the present letter, we analyze vlt-fors v,i images, covering 12.7x12.7arcmin, in the southwest quadrant of the cluster, allowing us to probe theextent of the double sgb from ~1.4 to ~13 arcmin from the cluster center. ourstudy reveals, for the first time, that the "peculiar" population is the oneassociated to the fainter sgb. indeed, while the percentage of stars in thissequence is about 45% in the cluster core (as previously found on the basis ofhst-acs data), we find that it drops sharply, to a level consistent with zeroin our data, at ~2.4 arcmin from the cluster center, where the brighter sgb, inour sample, still contains ~100 stars. implications for the proposed scenariosare discussed.

0902.4778	looking outside the galaxy: the discovery of chemical anomalies in 3 old  large magellanic cloud clusters	by using the multifiber spectrograph flames mounted at the eso-vlt, we haveobtained high-resolution spectra for 18 giant stars, belonging to 3 oldglobular clusters of the large magellanic cloud (namely ngc 1786, 2210 and2257). while stars in each cluster showed quite homogeneous iron content,within a few cents of dex (the mean values being fe/h]= -1.75+-0.01 dex,-1.65+-0.02 dex and -1.95+-0.02 dex for ngc 1786, 2210 and 2257, respectively),we have detected significant inhomogeneities for the [na/fe], [al/fe], [o/fe]and [mg/fe] abundance ratios, with evidence of [o/fe] vs [na/fe] and [mg/fe] vs[al/fe] anticorrelations. the trends detected nicely agree with those observedin galactic globular clusters, suggesting that such abundance anomalies areubiquitous features of old stellar systems and they do not depend on the parentgalaxy environment. in ngc 1786 we also detected two extreme o-poor, na-richstars. this is the first time that a firm signature of extreme chemicalabundance anomalies has been found in an extragalactic stellar cluster.

0904.0571	the non-peculiar velocity dispersion profile of the stellar system omega  centauri	we present the results of a survey of radial velocities over a wide regionextending from r~10 arcmin out to r~80 arcmin (~1.5 tidal radii) within themassive star cluster omega centauri. the survey was performed with flames@vlt,to study the velocity dispersion profile in the outer regions of this stellarsystem. we derived accurate radial velocities for a sample of 2557 newlyobserved stars, identifying 318 bona-fide cluster red giants. merging our datawith those provided by pancino et al. (2007), we assembled a final homogeneoussample of 946 cluster members that allowed us to trace the velocity dispersionprofile from the center out to r~32 arcmin. the velocity dispersion appears todecrease monotonically over this range, from a central value of sigma_{v}~17.2km/s down to a minimum value of sigma_{v}~5.2 km/s. the observed surfacebrightness profile, rotation curve, velocity dispersion profile and ellipticityprofile are simultaneously well reproduced by a simple dynamical model in whichmass follows light, within the classical newtonian theory of gravitation. thecomparison with an n-body model of the evolution of a system mimicking omegacen during the last 10 orbits into the galactic potential suggests that (a) therotation of stars lying in the inner ~20 arcmin of the clusters is not due tothe effects of the tidal field of the milky way, as hypothized by otherauthors, and (b) the overall observational scenario is still compatible withthe possibility that the outer regions of the cluster are subject to some tidalstirring.

0909.2938	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vii. the chemical composition of first and  second-generation stars in 15 globular clusters from giraffe spectra	we present abundances of fe, na, and o for 1409 red giant stars in 15galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of highresolution flames/giraffe spectra. combining the present data with previousresults, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largestand most homogeneous database of this kind to date. our gcs have [fe/h] from-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of thehorizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). for all clusters we find the na-oanticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions inh-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,now extinct. using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension ofthe na-o anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar populationin gcs: a primordial component (p) of first-generation stars, and 2 componentsof second-generation stars (intermediate i and extreme e populations from theirdifferent chemical composition). the p component is present in all gcs, and itsfraction is almost constant at about one third. the i component represents thebulk of the cluster population. the e component is not present in all gcs, andit is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. wediscuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in oursample and in two additional clusters (m3 and m13) from the literature. we alsofind that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum o andmaximum na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that isrepresented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.this second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of pollutersand cluster mass.

0910.1299	on the origin of the helium-rich population in omega centauri	to study the possible origin of the huge helium enrichment attributed to thestars on the blue main sequence of omega centauri, we make use of a chemicalevolution model that has proven able to reproduce other major observedproperties of the cluster, namely, its stellar metallicity distributionfunction, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios withmetallicity. in this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the availableobservational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a muchmore massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosionsin a shallow potential well. this galactic wind must carry out preferentiallythe metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereaselements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar windsby both asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massive stars must be mostlyretained. assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both agb starsand fast rotating massive stars (frmss), the interstellar medium of omegacentauri's parent galaxy gets naturally enriched in helium in the course of itsevolution.

1008.1817	the lithium content of omega centauri. new clues to the cosmological li  problem from old stars in external galaxies	a discrepancy has emerged between the cosmic lithium abundance inferred bythe wmap satellite measurement coupled with the prediction of the standardbig-bang nucleosynthesis theory, and the constant li abundance measured inmetal-poor halo dwarf stars (the so-called spite plateau). several models arebeing proposed to explain this discrepancy, involving either new physics, insitu depletion, or the efficient depletion of li in the pristine galaxy by ageneration of massive first stars. the realm of possibilities may be narrowedconsiderably by observing stellar populations in different galaxies, which haveexperienced different evolutionary histories.  the wcen stellar system is commonly considered as the remnant of a dwarfgalaxy accreted by the milky way (mw). we investigate the li content of aconspicuous sample of unevolved stars in this object.  we obtained moderate resolution (r=17000) spectra for 91 main-sequence/earlysub-giant branch (ms/sgb) wcen stars using the flames-giraffe/vlt spectrograph.li abundances were derived by matching the equivalent width of the liiresonance doublet at 6708a, to the prediction of synthetic spectra computedwith different li abundances. synthetic spectra were computed using the synthecode along with atlas9 model atmospheres. the stars effective temperatures arederived by fitting the wings of the ha line with synthetic profiles.  we obtain a mean content of a(li)=2.19+-0.14~dex for wcen ms/sgb stars. thisis comparable to what is observed in galactic halo field stars of similarmetallicities and temperatures.  the spite plateau seems to be an ubiquitous feature of old, warm metal-poorstars. it exists also in external galaxies, if we accept the current view aboutthe origin of wcen. this implies that the mechanism(s) that causes the"cosmological lithium problem" may be the same in the mw and other galaxies.

1009.1589	low-resolution spectroscopy of main sequence stars belonging to 12  galactic globular clusters. i. ch and cn band strength variations	globular clusters show abundance variations for light elements that are notyet well understood. the preferred explanation involves a self-enrichmentscenario, with two subsequent generations of stars. observations of mainsequence stars allow us to investigate the signature of this chemicallyprocessed material without the complicating effects of internal mixing. ourgoal is to investigate the c-n anti-correlation with low-resolutionspectroscopy of 20-50 stars fainter than the first dredge-up in seven globularclusters (ngc288, ngc1851, ngc5927, ngc6352, ngc6388, and pal12) with differentproperties. we complemented our observations with 47~tuc archival data, withfour additional clusters from the literature (m15, m22, m55, ngc362), and withadditional literature data on ngc288. in this first paper, we measured thestrength of cn and ch band indices, and we investigated the anti-correlationand bimodality of these indices. we compared r_cn, the ratio of stars belongingto the cn-strong and weak groups, with 15 different cluster parameters. weclearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the ch and cn band stregths in themetal-rich clusters (pal12, 47tuc, ngc6352, ngc5927). only m15 among themetal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal anti-correlation. we found weakcorrelations (sligthly above 1 sigma) of r_cn with the cluster orbitalparameters, present-day total mass, cluster concentration, and age. ourfindings support the self-enrichment scenario, and suggest that the occurrenceof more than two major generations of stars in a ggc should be rare. smalladditional generations (&lt;10-20% of the total) would be difficult to detect withour samples. the first generation, which corresponds to the cn-weak stars,usually contains more stars than the second one (&lt;r_cn&gt;=0.82+/-0.29), asopposed to results based on the na-o anti-correlations.

1012.4756	the subgiant branch of omega cen seen through high-resolution  spectroscopy. i. the first stellar generation in omega centauri?	we analysed high-resolution uves spectra of six stars belonging to thesubgiant branch of omega centauri, and derived abundance ratios of 19 chemicalelements (namely al, ba, c, ca, co, cr, cu, fe, la, mg, mn, n, na, ni, sc, si,sr, ti, and y). a comparison with previous abundance determinations for redgiants provided remarkable agreement and allowed us to identify thesub-populations to which our targets belong. we found that three targets belongto a low-metallicity population at [fe/h]~-2.0 dex, [alpha/fe]~+0.4 dex and[s/fe]~0 dex. stars with similar characteristics were found in small amounts bypast surveys of red giants. we discuss the possibility that they belong to aseparate sub-population that we name vmp (very metal-poor, at most 5% of thetotal cluster population), which - in the self-enrichment hypothesis - is thebest-candidate first stellar generation in omega cen. two of the remainingtargets belong to the dominant metal-poor population (mp) at [fe/h]~-1.7 dex,and the last one to the metal-intermediate (mint) one at [fe/h]~-1.2 dex. theexistence of the newly defined vmp population could help to understand somepuzzling results based on low-resolution spectroscopy (sollima et al.,villanova et al.) in their age differences determinations, because themetallicity resolution of these studies was probably not enough to detect thevmp population. the vmp could also correspond to some of the additionalsubstructures of the subgiant-branch region found in the latest hst photometry(bellini et al.). after trying to correlate chemical abundances withsubstructures in the subgiant branch of omega cen, we found that the agedifference between the vmp and mp populations should be small (0+/-2 gyr),while the difference between the mp and mint populations could be slightlylarger (2+/-2~gyr).

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1401.4979	the gaia-eso survey: kinematic structure in the gamma velorum cluster	context: a key science goal of the gaia-eso survey (ges) is to use thekinematics of low-mass stars in young clusters to probe their dynamicalhistories and how they populate the field as they become unbound. theclustering of low-mass stars around the massive w-r binary gamma^2 velorum wasone of the first ges targets. aims: to empirically determine the radialvelocity (rv) precision of ges data, construct a kinematically unbiased sampleof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. methods: targetswere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolutionspectroscopy used to derive rvs and assess membership from the strength of theli6708a line. the rv distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihoodtechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. results: the ges rv precisionis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-masspopulation around gamma^2 vel. the structure is well fitted by two kinematiccomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsicdispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. the secondhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by~2km/s. the first population is older by 1-2myr based on a greater level of lidepletion seen among its m-stars and is probably more centrally concentratedaround gamma^2 vel. conclusions: we consider several formation scenarios,concluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of theoriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 vel, and a dispersed populationfrom the wider vela ob2 association, of which gamma^2 vel is the most massivemember. the apparent youth of gamma^2 vel compared to the older (&gt;=10myr)low-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binaryformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of thelow-mass stars.[abridged]

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1406.2548	the gaia-eso survey: metallicity of the chamaeleon i star forming region	context. recent metallicity determinations in young open clusters andstar-forming regions suggest that the latter may be characterized by a slightlylower metallicity than the sun and older clusters in the solar vicinity.however, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneousanalyses. the gaia-eso survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing largesamples of stars in several young clusters and star-forming regions, henceallowing us to further investigate this issue.  aims. we present a new metallicity determination of the chamaeleon istar-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internalrelease of the gaia-eso survey.  methods. 48 candidate members of chamaeleon i have been observed with thehigh-resolution spectrograph uves. we use the surface gravity, lithium lineequivalent width and position in the hertzsprung-russell diagram to confirm thecluster members and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity ofthe region.  results. out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members.considering the metallicity measurements for 9 of them, we find that the ironabundance of chamaeleon i is slightly subsolar with a mean value[fe/h]=-0.08+/-0.04 dex. this result is in agreement with the metallicitydetermination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that thechemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed moremetal-poor than the sun. we argue that this evidence may be related to thechemical distribution of the gould belt that contains most of the nearbystar-forming regions and young clusters.

1407.1510	the gaia-eso survey: stellar content and elemental abundances in the  massive cluster ngc 6705	chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most globular clusters,but not in open clusters. cluster mass seems to play a key role in theexistence of multiple populations.  studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters isnecessary to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determinethe mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. here westudied ngc6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards theinner region of the milky way. this cluster is located inside the solar circle.this makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. thisstudy makes use of bvi and ri photometry and comparisons with theoreticalisochrones to derive the age of ngc6705. we study the density profile of thecluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. based on abundances ofthe chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of thegaia-eso survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of thered clump stars. radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internalkinematics of the cluster.  the estimated ages range from 250 to 316myr, depending on the adopted stellarmodel. luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of masssegregation. we derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function andfrom the kinematics, finding values between 3700 m$_{\odot}$ and 11 000m$_{\odot}$. after selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities,we obtain a metallicity of [fe/h]=0.10$\pm$0.06 based on 21 candidate members.moreover, ngc6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations oranti-correlations between al, mg, si, and na, that are expected in multiplepopulations. this is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lowerthan the required mass limit proposed in literature to develop multiplepopulations.

1408.4558	the gaia-eso survey: metallicity and kinematic trends in the milky way  bulge	(abridged) we analyzed the stellar parameters and radial velocities of ~1200stars in five bulge fields as determined from the gaia-eso survey data (idr1).we use vista variables in the via lactea (vvv) photometry to obtain reddeningvalues by using a semi-empirical t_eff-color calibration. from a gaussiandecomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clearbimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of thespecific position on the sky. in agreement with some previous studies, we finda mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b=-6 and b=-10)that arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poorcomponents. the number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poorstars with increasing b. the k-magnitude distribution of the metal-richpopulation splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersectsthe near and far branches of the x-shaped bulge structure. in addition, twolateral fields at (l,b)=(7,-9) and (l,b)=(-10,-8) present contrastingcharacteristics. in the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated bymetal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poorpopulation and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes. finally, wefind systematic differences in the velocity dispersion between the metal-richand the metal-poor components of each field. our chemo-kinematical analysis isconsistent with a varying field-to-field proportion of stars belonging to (i) ametal-rich boxy/peanut x-shaped component, with bar-like kinematics, and (ii) ametal-poor more extended rotating structure with a higher velocity dispersionthat dominates far from the galactic plane. these first ges data allow studyingthe detailed spatial dependence of the galactic bulge populations, thanks tothe analysis of individual fields with relatively high statistics.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1504.02484	the gaia-eso survey: n-body modelling of the gamma velorum cluster	the gaia-eso survey has recently unveiled the complex kinematic signature ofthe gamma velorum cluster: this cluster is composed of two kinematicallydistinct populations (hereafter, population a and b), showing two differentvelocity dispersions and a relative ~2 km s^-1 radial velocity (rv) shift. inthis paper, we propose that the two populations of the gamma velorum clusteroriginate from two different sub-clusters, born from the same parent molecularcloud. we investigate this possibility by means of direct-summation n-bodysimulations. our scenario is able to reproduce not only the rv shift and thedifferent velocity dispersions, but also the different centroid (~0.5 pc), thedifferent spatial concentration and the different line-of-sight distance (~5pc) of the two populations. the observed 1-2 myr age difference between the twopopulations is also naturally explained by our scenario, in which the twosub-clusters formed in two slightly different star formation episodes. oursimulations suggest that population b is strongly supervirial, while populationa is close to virial equilibrium. we discuss the implications of our models forthe formation of young star clusters and ob associations in the milky way.

1505.07019	the gaia-eso survey: empirical determination of the precision of stellar  radial velocities and projected rotation velocities	the gaia-eso survey (ges) is a large public spectroscopic survey at theeuropean southern observatory very large telescope. a key aim is to provideprecise radial velocities (rvs) and projected equatorial velocities (v sin i)for representative samples of galactic stars, that will complement informationobtained by the gaia astrometry satellite. we present an analysis toempirically quantify the size and distribution of uncertainties in rv and v sini using spectra from repeated exposures of the same stars. we show that theuncertainties vary as simple scaling functions of signal-to-noise ratio (s/n)and v sin i, that the uncertainties become larger with increasing photospherictemperature, but that the dependence on stellar gravity, metallicity and age isweak. the underlying uncertainty distributions have extended tails that arebetter represented by student's t-distributions than by normal distributions.parametrised results are provided, that enable estimates of the rv precisionfor almost all ges measurements, and estimates of the v sin i precision forstars in young clusters, as a function of s/n, v sin i and stellar temperature.the precision of individual high s/n ges rv measurements is 0.22-0.26 km/s,dependent on instrumental configuration.

1507.01596	a chemical trompe-l'\oe{}il: no iron spread in the globular cluster m22	we present the analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with uves anduves-flames at the very large telescope of 17 giants in the globular clusterm22, a stellar system suspected to have an intrinsic spread in the ironabundance. we find that when surface gravities are derived spectroscopically(by imposing to obtain the same iron abundance from fei and feii lines) the[fe/h] distribution spans ~0.5 dex, according to previous analyses. however,the gravities obtained in this way correspond to unrealistic low stellar masses(0.1-0.5 msun) for most of the surveyed giants. instead, when photometricgravities are adopted, the [feii/h] distribution shows no evidence of spread atvariance with the [fei/h] distribution. this difference has been recentlyobserved in other clusters and could be due to non-local thermodynamicalequilibrium effects driven by over-ionization mechanisms, that mainly affectthe neutral species (thus providing lower [fei/h]) but leave [feii/h]unaltered. we confirm that the s-process elements show significant star-to-starvariations and their abundances appear to be correlated with the differencebetween [fei/h] and [feii/h]. this puzzling finding suggests that the peculiarchemical composition of some cluster stars may be related to effects able tospuriously decrease [fei/h]. we conclude that m22 is a globular cluster with noevidence of intrinsic iron spread, ruling out that it has retained thesupernovae ejecta in its gravitational potential well.

1507.08066	the gaia-eso survey: characterisation of the [alpha/fe] sequences in the  milky way discs	we investigate, using the gaia-eso survey internal data-release 2, theproperties of the double sequence of the milky way discs (defined chemically asthe high-alpha and low-alpha populations), and discuss their compatibility withdiscs defined by other means such as metallicity, kinematics or positions.  this investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for starslocated in the extended solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars atdifferent ranges of galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. theseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novelmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifyingthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of theirmetallicity distribution functions. then, using the separation in chemicalspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/fe] -[fe/h] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relativeproportions of the two discs change across the galaxy.  we find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [fe/h]~ +0.2and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [fe/h]~ -0.8. radialand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, withmild spatial variations in its [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths, whereas for the thickdisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.  the small variations in the spatial [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths of the thindisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.on the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/fe] - [fe/h]variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for themixing of the metals in the young galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration orturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin discstarted forming.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

astro-ph;0104114	a step toward the calibration of the rgb tip as a standard candle	the absolute i magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch m_i(trgb) is oneof the most promising standard candles actually used in astrophysics as afundamental pillar for the cosmological distance scale. with the aim ofimproving the observational basis of its calibration, we have obtained anaccurate estimate of the m_i(trgb) for the globular cluster omega centauri,based (a) on the largest photometric database ever assembled for a globular, bypancino et al.(2000), and (b) on a direct distance estimate for omega cen,recently obtained by thompson et al.(2001) from a detached eclipsing binary.the derived value m_i(trgb) =-4.04\pm 0.12 provides, at present, the mostaccurate empirical zero-point for the calibration of the m_i(trgb) - [fe/h]relation, at [fe/h] ~ -1.7. we also derived a new empirical m_i(trgb) - [fe/h]relation, based on the large ir dataset of red giants in galactic globularclusters recently presented by ferraro et al.(2000). this database (extendingup to [fe/h]=-0.2) covers a more appropriate metallicity range, forextragalactic applications, than previous empirical calibrations (limited to[fe/h]&lt;= -0.7). the proposed relation is in excellent agreement with the newlydetermined zero-point.

(abridged) we demonstrate that the inner region of umi issignificantly structured, at odds with what expected for a system in dynamicalequilibrium. in particular we show that the main density peak of umi isoff-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and itshows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy.moreover, umi stars are shown to be clustered according to two differentcharacteristic clustering scales, as opposite to draco, which instead has avery symmetric and smooth density profile. the possible consequences of thisstriking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are brieflydiscussed. combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of thetotal luminosity of umi, we find that the mass to light (m/l) ratio of thisgalaxy may be as low as m/l ~ 7, a factor 5-10 lower than current estimates.

astro-ph;0303601	a near-infrared spectroscopic screening of the red giant populations in  omega centauri	near-infrared spectra of 21 giants in omega centauri, spanning the wholerange of metallicities observed in this cluster, are presented. this work ispart of a coordinated photometric and spectroscopic campaign in the optical andin the infrared, aimed at studying the complex stellar population of omegacentauri and understanding its formation and chemical evolution. by analyzingthe several co and oh molecular bands and atomic lines in the spectra of theselected giants, metal abundances and abundance ratios have been obtained. theexistence of three major metallicity regimes at [fe/h]=-1.6, -1.2 and[fe/h]&lt;-0.5 has been confirmed. the most metal-rich stars in our sample show alower (if any) alpha-enhancement when compared to the more metal-poorcomponents, suggesting that they should have formed in a medium significantlypolluted by type ia supernova ejecta. isotopic carbon abundances have been alsoinferred, providing an average 13c/12c=4, which clearly indicates thatextra-mixing processes occurred in the stellar interiors during the ascent onthe red giant branch.

astro-ph;0401540	discovery of an anomalous sub giant branch in the color magnitude  diagram of omega centauri	using deep high-resolution multi-band images taken with the very largetelescope and the hubble space telescope, we discovered a new anomaloussequence in the color magnitude diagram of omega cen. this feature appears as anarrow, well-defined sub giant branch (sgb-a), which merges into the mainsequence of the dominant cluster population at a magnitude significantlyfainter than the cluster turn-off (to). the simplest hypothesis assumes thatthe new feature is the extension of the anomalous red giant branch (rgb-a)metal-rich population discovered by lee et al. (1999) and pancino et al.(2000). however, under this assumption the interpretation of the sgb-a does noteasily fit into the context of a self-enrichment scenario within omega cen. infact, its to magnitude, shape and extension are not compatible with a young,metal-rich population, as required by the self-enrichment process. the to levelof the sgb-a suggests indeed an age as old as the main cluster population,further supporting the extra-cluster origin of the most metal rich stars, assuggested by ferraro, bellazzini &amp; pancino (2002). only accurate measurementsof radial velocities and metal abundances for a representative sample of starswill firmly establish whether or not the sgb-a is actually related to the rgb-aand will finally shed light on the origin of the metal rich population of omegacen.

astro-ph;0510280	the pure non-collisional blue straggler population in the giant stellar  system omega centauri	we have used high spatial resolution data from the hubble space telescope andwide-field ground-based observations to search for blue straggler stars (bss)over the entire radial extent of the large stellar system omega centauri. wehave detected the largest population of bss ever observed in any stellarsystem. even though the sample is restricted to the brightest portion of thebss sequence, more than 300 candidates have been identified. bss are thought tobe produced by the evolution of binary systems (either formed by stellarcollisions or mass exchange in binary stars). since systems like galacticglobular clusters (ggc) and omega cen evolve dynamically on time-scalessignificantly shorter than their ages, binaries should have settled toward thecenter, showing a more concentrated radial distribution than the ordinary, lessmassive single stars. indeed, in all ggcs which have been surveyed for bss, thebss distribution is peaked at the center. conversely, in omega cen we find thatthe bss share the same radial distribution as the adopted referencepopulations. this is the cleanest evidence ever found that such a stellarsystem is not fully relaxed even in the central region. we further argue thatthe absence of central concentration in the bss distribution rules out acollisional origin. thus, the omega cen bss are the purest and largestpopulation of non-collisional bss ever observed. our results allow the firstempirical quantitative estimate of the production rate of bss via this channel.bss in omega cen may represent the best local template for modeling the bsspopulations in distant galaxies where they cannot be individually observed.

astro-ph;0701162	the chemical evolution of omega centauri's progenitor system	chemical evolution models are presented for the anomalous globular clusteromega centauri. after demonstrating that the chemical features of omega cen cannot be reproduced in the framework of the closed-box self-enrichment scenario,we discuss a model in which this cluster is the remnant of a dwarf spheroidalgalaxy evolved in isolation and then swallowed by the milky way. both infall ofprimordial matter and metal-enriched gas outflows have to be considered inorder to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, theage-metallicity relation and several abundance ratios. yet, as long as anordinary stellar mass function and standard stellar yields are assumed, we failby far to get the enormous helium enhancement required to explain the blue mainsequence (and, perhaps, the extreme horizontal branch) stellar data. rotatingmodels of massive stars producing stellar winds with large helium excesses atlow metallicities have been put forward as promising candidates to solve the`helium enigma' of omega cen (maeder &amp; meynet, 2006, a&amp;a, 448, l37). however,we show that for any reasonable choice of the initial mass function thehelium-to-metal enrichment of the integrated stellar population is unavoidablymuch lower than 70 and conclude that the issue of the helium enhancement inomega cen still waits for a satisfactory explanation. we briefly speculate uponpossible solutions.
