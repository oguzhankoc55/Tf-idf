0901.4046	an orbit fit for the grillmair dionatos cold stellar stream	we use velocity and metallicity information from sdss and segue stellarspectroscopy to fit an orbit to the narrow $63^\circ$ stellar stream ofgrillmair and dionatos. the stars in the stream have a retrograde orbit witheccentricity $e = 0.33$ (perigalacticon of 14.4 kpc and apogalacticon of 28.7kpc) and inclination approximately $i \sim 35^\circ$. in the region of theorbit which is detected, it has a distance of about 7 to 11 kpc from the sun.assuming a standard disk plus bulge and logarithmic halo potential for themilky way stars plus dark matter, the stream stars are moving with a largespace velocity of approximately $276 \rm km s^{-1}$ at perigalacticon. usingthis stream alone, we are unable to determine if the dark matter halo is oblateor prolate. the metallicity of the stream is [fe/h] $= -2.1\pm0.1$. observedproper motions for individual stream members above the main sequence turnoffare consistent with the derived orbit. none of the known globular clusters inthe milky way have positions, radial velocities, and metallicities that areconsistent with being the progenitor of the gd-1 stream.

0902.1781	segue: a spectroscopic survey of 240,000 stars with g=14-20	the segue survey obtained 240,000 moderate resolution (r = 1800) spectra from3900 - 9000 angstroms of fainter milky way stars (14.0 &lt; g &lt; 20.3) of a widevariety of spectral types, both main sequence and evolved objects, with thegoal of studying the kinematics and populations of our galaxy and its halo. thespectra are clustered in 212 regions spaced over three-quarters of the sky.radial velocity accuracies for stars are 4 km/s at g &lt; 18, degrading to 15 km/sat g = 20. for stars with s/n &gt; 10 per resolution element, stellar atmosphericparameters are estimated, including metallicity, surface gravity, and effectivetemperature. segue obtained 3500 square degrees of additional ugriz imaging(primarily at low galactic latitudes) providing precise multi-color photometry(g,r,i = 2%), (u,z = 3%) and astrometry (0.1 arcsec) for spectroscopic targetselection. the stellar spectra, imaging data, and derived parameter catalogsfor this survey are publicly available as part of sdss data release 7 (dr7).

0706.3391	the overdensity in virgo, sagittarius debris, and the asymmetric  spheroid	we investigate the relationship between several previously identifiedgalactic halo stellar structures in the direction of virgo using imaging andspectroscopic observations of f turnoff stars and blue horizontal branch starsfrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the sloan extension for galacticunderstanding and exploration (segue). we show that the sagittarius dwarfleading tidal tail does not pass through the solar neighborhood; it misses thesun by more than 15 kpc, passing through the galactic plane outside the solarcircle. it also is not spatially coincident with the large stellar overdensitys297+63-20.5 in the virgo constellation. s297+63-20.5 has a distinct turnoffcolor and kinematics. faint (g ~ 20.3) turnoff stars in s297+63-20.5 haveline-of-sight, galactic standard of rest velocities v(gsr)= 130 +/- 10 km/s,opposite in sign to infalling sgr tail stars. the path of the sgr leading tidaltail is also inconsistent with the positions of some of the nearer stars withwhich it has been associated, and whose velocities have favored models withprolate milky way potentials. we additionally show that the number densities ofbrighter (g ~ 19.8) f turnoff stars are not symmetric about the galacticcenter, and that this discrepancy is not primarily due to the s297+63-20.5moving group. either the spheroid is asymmetric about the galactic center, orthere are additional substructures that conspire to be on the same side of thegalaxy as s297+63-20.5. the s297+63-20.5 overdensity in virgo is likelyassociated with two other previously identified virgo substructures: the virgostellar stream (vss) and the virgo overdensity (vod). however, the velocitydifference between the vss and s297+63-20.5 and the difference in distanceestimates between the vod and s297+63-20.5 must be reconciled.

0905.4502	tracing sagittarius structure with sdss and segue imaging and  spectroscopy	we show that the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very redk/m-giant stars selected from sdss photometry. a subset of these stars arespectroscopically confirmed with segue and sdss spectra, and the distance scaleof 2mass and sdss m giants is calibrated to the rr lyrae distance scale. theabsolute g band magnitude of the k/m-giant stars at the tip of the giant branchis m_g=-1.0. the line-of-sight velocities of the m giant and bhb stars that arespatially coincident with the sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with thoseof previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain allof the sgr tidal debris stream observations. we estimate stellar densitiesalong the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. thek/m-giant, bhb, and f-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidalstream that is adjacent to the main leading sgr dwarf tidal tail havevelocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in theleading tidal tail. the ratio of k/m giants to bhbs and bhbs to f-turnoff starsare also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. we show thatthere is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the sgr trailing tidaltail.

0908.2627	insight into the formation of the milky way through cold halo  substructure. i. the echos of milky way formation	we identify ten -- seven for the first time -- elements of cold halosubstructure (echos) in the volume within 17.5 kpc of the sun in the inner haloof the milky way. our result is based on the observed spatial and radialvelocity distribution of metal-poor main sequence turnoff (mpmsto) stars in 137sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) lines ofsight. we point out that the observed radial velocity distribution isconsistent with a smooth stellar component of the milky way's inner halooverall, but disagrees significantly at the radial velocities that correspondto our detections. we show that all of our detections are statisticallysignificant and that we expect no false positives. we also use our detectionsand completeness estimates to infer a formal upper limit of 0.34 +/- 0.02 onthe fraction of the mpmsto population in the inner halo that belong to echos.our detections and completeness calculations suggest that there is asignificant population of low fractional overdensity echos in the inner halo,and we predict that 1/3 of the inner halo (by volume) harbors echos with mpmstostar number densities n ~ 15 kpc^-3. echos are likely older than known surfacebrightness substructure, so our detections provide us with a direct measure ofthe accretion history of the milky way in a region and time interval that hasyet to be fully explored. in concert with previous studies, our result suggeststhat the level of merger activity has been roughly constant over the past fewgyr and that there has been no accretion of single stellar systems more massivethan a few percent of a milky way mass in that interval.

0909.3019	structure and kinematics of the stellar halos and thick disks of the  milky way based on calibration stars from sdss dr7	the structure and kinematics of the recognized stellar components of themilky way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters andkinematic quantities for 32360 calibration stars from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and its first extension, (sdss-ii), which included the sub-surveysegue: sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration. full spacemotions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpcof the sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- andouter-halo components of the galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-diskand proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. we first examine the questionof whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo inorder to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the localvolume, and whether more than two components are needed. we also address thequestion of whether the proposed metal-weak thick disk is kinematically andchemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. in addition, we consider thefractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observedkinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the galaxy as a function ofdistance from the plane. scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk andmetal-weak thick-disk components are determined. spatial density profiles forthe inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a jeans theoremanalysis. the full set of calibration stars (including those outside the localvolume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellarmetallicity distribution function with distance above the galactic planein-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellarpopulations.

0910.4731	metallicity mapping with gri photometry: the virgo overdensity and the  halos of the galaxy	we describe the methodology required for estimation of photometric estimatesof metallicity based on the sdss gri passbands, which can be used to probe theproperties of main-sequence stars beyond ~ 10 kpc, complementing studies ofnearby stars from more metallicity-sensitive color indices that involve the upassband. as a first application of this approach, we determine photometricmetal abundance estimates for individual main-sequence stars in the virgooverdensity, which covers almost 1000 square degrees on the sky, based on acalibration of the metallicity sensitivity of stellar isochrones in the grifilter passbands using field stars with well-determined spectroscopic metalabundances. despite the low precision of the method for individual stars,internal errors of in [fe/h] ~ +/- 0.1 dex can be achieved for bulk stellarpopulations. the global metal abundance of the virgo overdensity determined inthis way is &lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -2.0 +/- 0.1 (internal) +/- 0.5 (systematic), fromphotometric measurements of 0.7 million stars with heliocentric distances from~ 10 kpc to ~ 20 kpc. a preliminary metallicity map, based on results for 2.9million stars in the northern sdss dr-7 footprint, exhibits a shift to lowermetallicities as one proceeds from the inner- to the outer-halo population,consistent with recent interpretation of the kinematics of local samples ofstars with spectroscopically available metallicity estimates and full spacemotions.

0911.3900	mapping the stellar structure of the milky way thick disk and halo using  segue photometry	we map the stellar structure of the galactic thick disk and halo by applyingcolor-magnitude diagram (cmd) fitting to photometric data from the seguesurvey, allowing, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of theirstructure at both high and low latitudes using uniform sdss photometry.incorporating photometry of all relevant stars simultaneously, cmd fittingbypasses the need to choose single tracer populations. using old stellarpopulations of differing metallicities as templates we obtain a sparse 3d mapof the stellar mass distribution at |z|&gt;1 kpc. fitting a smooth milky way modelcomprising exponential thin and thick disks and an axisymmetric power-law haloallows us to constrain the structural parameters of the thick disk and halo.the thick-disk scale height and length are well constrained at 0.75+-0.07 kpcand 4.1+-0.4 kpc, respectively. we find a stellar halo flattening within ~25kpc of c/a=0.88+-0.03 and a power-law index of 2.75+-0.07 (for 7&lt;r_{gc}&lt;~30kpc). the model fits yield thick-disk and stellar halo densities at the solarlocation of rho_{thick,sun}=10^{-2.3+-0.1} m_sun pc^{-3} andrho_{halo,sun}=10^{-4.20+-0.05} m_sun pc^{-3}, averaging over anysubstructures. our analysis provides the first clear in situ evidence for aradial metallicity gradient in the milky way's stellar halo: within r&lt;~15 kpcthe stellar halo has a mean metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.6, which shifts to[fe/h]=-2.2 at larger radii. subtraction of the best-fit smooth and symmetricmodel from the overall density maps reveals a wealth of substructures at alllatitudes, some attributable to known streams and overdensities, and some new.a simple warp cannot account for the low latitude substructure, asoverdensities occur simultaneously above and below the galactic plane.(abridged)

1001.0576	the orbit of the orphan stream	we use recent segue spectroscopy and sdss and segue imaging data to measurethe sky position, distance, and radial velocities of stars in the tidal debrisstream that is commonly referred to as the "orphan stream." we fit orbitalparameters to the data, and find a prograde orbit with an apogalacticon,perigalacticon, and eccentricity of 90 kpc, 16.4 kpc and 0.7, respectively.neither the dwarf galaxy uma ii nor the complex a gas cloud have velocitiesconsistent with a kinematic association with the orphan stream. it is possiblethat segue-1 is associated with the orphan stream, but no other known galacticclusters or dwarf galaxies in the milky way lie along its orbit. the detectedportion of the stream ranges from 19 to 47 kpc from the sun and is an indicatorof the mass interior to these distances. there is a marked increase in thedensity of orphan stream stars near (l,b)=(253,49) deg., which could indicatethe presence of the progenitor at the edge of the sdss data. if this is theprogenitor, then the detected portion of the orphan stream is a leading tidaltail. we find blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars and f turnoff stars associatedwith the orphan stream. the turnoff color is (g-r)_0=0.22. the bhb stars have alow metallicity of [fe/h]=-2.1. the orbit is best fit to a halo potential witha halo plus disk mass of about 2.6x10^11 solar masses, integrated to 60 kpcfrom the galactic center. our best fit is found with a logarithmic halo speedof v_halo=73+/-24 km/s, a disk+bulge mass of m(r&lt; 60 kpc) = 1.3x10^11 solarmasses, and a halo mass of m(r&lt; 60 kpc) = 1.4x10^11 solar masses. the orphanstream is projected to extend to 90 kpc from the galactic center, andmeasurements of these distant parts of the stream would be a powerful probe ofthe mass of the milky way (truncated).

1002.0001	binary contamination in the segue sample: effects on sspp determinations  of stellar atmospheric parameters	using numerical modeling and a grid of synthetic spectra, we examine theeffects that unresolved binaries have on the determination of various stellaratmospheric parameters for segue targets measured using the segue stellarparameter pipeline (sspp). to model undetected binaries that may be in thesegue sample, we use a variety of mass distributions for the primary andsecondary stars in conjunction with empirically determined relationships fororbital parameters to determine the fraction of g-k dwarf stars, as defined bysdss color cuts, that will be blended with a secondary companion. we focus onthe g-k dwarf sample in segue as it records the history of chemical enrichmentin our galaxy. to determine the effect of the secondary on the spectroscopicparameters, we synthesize a grid of model spectra from 3275 to 7850 k (~0.1 to1.0 \msun) and [fe/h]=-0.5 to -2.5 from marcs model atmospheres usingturbospectrum. we analyze both "infinite" signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) modelsand degraded versions, at median s/n of 50, 25 and 10. by running individualand combined spectra (representing the binaries) through the sspp, we determinethat ~10% of the blended g-k dwarf pairs with s/n&gt;=25 will have theiratmospheric parameter determinations, in particular temperature andmetallicity, noticeably affected by the presence of an undetected secondary. toaccount for the additional uncertainty from binary contamination at a s/n~10,uncertainties of ~140 k and ~0.17 dex in [fe/h] must be added in quadrature tothe published uncertainties of the sspp. (abridged)

1002.3607	statistical properties of blue horizontal branch stars in the spheroid:  detection of a moving group approximately 50 kpc from the sun	a new moving group comprising at least four blue horizontal branch (bhb)stars is identified at (l,b) = (65 deg, 48 deg). the horizontal branch atg0=18.9 magnitude implies a distance of 50 kpc from the sun. the heliocentricradial velocity is rv = -157 +/- 4 km/s, corresponding to v(gsr) = -10 km/s;the dispersion in line-of-sight velocity is consistent with the instrumentalerrors for these stars. the mean metallicity of the moving group is [fe/h]approximately -2.4, which is significantly more metal poor than the stellarspheroid. we estimate that the bhb stars in the outer halo have a meanmetallicity of [fe/h] = -2.0, with a wide scatter and a distribution that doesnot change much as a function of distance from the sun. we explore thesystematics of sdss dr7 surface gravity metallicity determinations for faintbhb stars, and present a technique for estimating the significance of clumpsdiscovered in multidimensional data. this moving group cannot be distinguishedin density, and highlights the need to collect many more spectra of galacticstars to unravel the merger history of the galaxy.

1011.1925	quantifying kinematic substructure in the milky way's stellar halo	we present and analyze the positions, distances, and radial velocities forover 4000 blue horizontal-branch (bhb) stars in the milky way's halo, drawnfrom sdss dr8. we search for position-velocity substructure in these data, asignature of the hierarchical assembly of the stellar halo. using a cumulative"close pair distribution" (cpd) as a statistic in the 4-dimensional space ofsky position, distance, and velocity, we quantify the presence ofposition-velocity substructure at high statistical significance among the bhbstars: pairs of bhb stars that are close in position on the sky tend to havemore similar distances and radial velocities compared to a random sampling ofthese overall distributions. we make analogous mock-observations of 11numerical halo formation simulations, in which the stellar halo is entirelycomposed of disrupted satellite debris, and find a level of substructurecomparable to that seen in the actually observed bhb star sample. this resultquantitatively confirms the hierarchical build-up of the stellar halo through asignature in phase (position-velocity) space. in detail, the structure presentin the bhb stars is somewhat less prominent than that seen in most simulatedhalos, quite possibly because bhb stars represent an older sub-population. bhbstars located beyond 20 kpc from the galactic center exhibit strongersubstructure than at $\rm r_{gc} &lt; 20$ kpc.

1104.2513	the case for the dual halo of the milky way	carollo et al. have recently resolved the stellar population of the milky wayhalo into at least two distinct components, an inner halo and an outer halo.this result has been criticized by schoenrich et al., who claim that theretrograde signature associated with the outer halo is due to the adoption offaulty distances. we refute this claim, and demonstrate that the schoenrich etal. photometric distances are themselves flawed because they adopted anincorrect main-sequence absolute magnitude relationship from the work ofivezi\'c et al. when compared to the recommended relation from ivezi\'c et al.,which is tied to a milky way globular cluster distance scale and accounts forage and metallicity effects, the relation adopted by schoenrich et al. yieldsup to 18% shorter distances for stars near the main-sequence turnoff (to). useof the correct relationship yields agreement between the distances assigned bycarollo et al. and ivezi\'{c} et al. for low-metallicity dwarfs to within6-10%. schoenrich et al. also point out that intermediate-gravity stars (3.5 &lt;=log g &lt;= 4.0) with colors redder than the to region are likely misclassified,with which we concur. we implement a new procedure to reassign luminosityclassifications for the to stars that require it. new derivations of therotational behavior demonstrate that the retrograde signature and high velocitydispersion of the outer-halo population remains. we summarize additional linesof evidence for a dual halo, including a test of the retrograde signature basedon proper motions alone, and conclude that the preponderance of evidencestrongly rejects the single-halo interpretation.

1104.3114	formation and evolution of the disk system of the milky way: [alpha/fe]  ratios and kinematics of the segue g-dwarf sample	we employ measurements of the [alpha/fe] ratio derived from low-resolution(r~2000) spectra of 17,277 g-type dwarfs from the segue survey to separate theminto likely thin- and thick-disk subsamples. both subsamples exhibit stronggradients of orbital rotational velocity with metallicity, of opposite signs,-20 to -30 km/s/dex for the thin-disk and +40 to +50 km/s/dex for thethick-disk population. the rotational velocity is uncorrelated withgalactocentric distance for the thin-disk subsample, and exhibits a small trendfor the thick-disk subsample. the rotational velocity decreases with distancefrom the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\pm} 1.0km/s/kpc). thick-disk stars exhibit a strong trend of orbital eccentricity withmetallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change withmetallicity for the thin-disk subsample. the eccentricity is almost independentof galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginalgradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity withdistance from the galactic plane. the shapes of the eccentricity distributionsfor the thin- and thick-disk populations are independent of distance from theplane, and include no significant numbers of stars with eccentricity above 0.6.among several contemporary models of disk evolution we consider, radialmigration appears to have played an important role in the evolution of thethin-disk population, but possibly less so for the thick disk, relative to thegas-rich merger or disk heating scenarios. we emphasize that more physicallyrealistic models and simulations need to be constructed in order to carry outthe detailed quantitative comparisons that our new data enable.

1111.4985	milky way tomography iv: dissecting dust	we use sdss photometry of 73 million stars to simultaneously obtain best-fitmain-sequence stellar energy distribution (sed) and amount of dust extinctionalong the line of sight towards each star. using a subsample of 23 millionstars with 2mass photometry, whose addition enables more robust results, weshow that sdss photometry alone is sufficient to break degeneracies betweenintrinsic stellar color and dust amount when the shape of extinction curve isfixed. when using both sdss and 2mass photometry, the ratio of the total toselective absorption, $r_v$, can be determined with an uncertainty of about 0.1for most stars in high-extinction regions. these fits enable detailed studiesof the dust properties and its spatial distribution, and of the stellar spatialdistribution at low galactic latitudes. our results are in good agreement withthe extinction normalization given by the schlegel et al. (1998, sfd) dust mapsat high northern galactic latitudes, but indicate that the sfd extinction mapappears to be consistently overestimated by about 20% in the southern sky, inagreement with schlafly et al. (2010). the constraints on the shape of the dustextinction curve across the sdss and 2mass bandpasses support the models byfitzpatrick (1999) and cardelli et al.

1111.6619	the sdss coadd: 275 deg^2 of deep sdss imaging on stripe 82	we present details of the construction and characterization of the coadditionof the sloan digital sky survey stripe 82 \ugriz\ imaging data. this surveyconsists of 275 deg$^2$ of repeated scanning by the sdss camera of $2.5\arcdeg$of $\delta$ over $-50\arcdeg \le \alpha \le 60\arcdeg$ centered on thecelestial equator. each piece of sky has $\sim 20$ runs contributing and thusreaches $\sim2$ magnitudes fainter than the sdss single pass data, i.e. to$r\sim 23.5$ for galaxies. we discuss the image processing of the coaddition,the modeling of the psf, the calibration, and the production of standard sdsscatalogs. the data have $r$-band median seeing of 1.1\arcsec, and arecalibrated to $\le 1%$. star color-color, number counts, and psf size vsmodelled size plots show the modelling of the psf is good enough for precision5-band photometry. structure in the psf-model vs magnitude plot show minor psfmis-modelling that leads to a region where stars are being mis-classified asgalaxies, and this is verified using vvds spectroscopy. as this is a wide areadeep survey there are a variety of uses for the data, including galacticstructure, photometric redshift computation, cluster finding and crosswavelength measurements, weak lensing cluster mass calibrations, and cosmicshear measurements.

1112.2214	the metallicity distribution functions of segue g and k dwarfs:  constraints for disk chemical evolution and formation	we present the metallicity distribution function (mdf) for 24,270 g and16,847 k dwarfs at distances from 0.2 to 2.3 kpc from the galactic plane, basedon spectroscopy from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey. this stellar sample is significantly larger in bothnumber and volume than previous spectroscopic analyses, which were limited tothe solar vicinity, making it ideal for comparison with local volume-limitedsamples and galactic models. for the first time, we have corrected the mdf forthe various observational biases introduced by the segue target selectionstrategy. the segue sample is particularly notable for k dwarfs, which are toofaint to examine spectroscopically far from the solar neighborhood. the mdf ofboth spectral types becomes more metal-poor with increasing |z|, which reflectsthe transition from a sample with small [alpha/fe] values at small heights toone with enhanced [alpha/fe] above 1 kpc. comparison of our segue distributionsto those of two different milky way models reveals that both are moremetal-rich than our observed distributions at all heights above the plane. ourunbiased observations of g and k dwarfs provide valuable constraints over the|z|-height range of the milky way disk for chemical and dynamical galaxyevolution models, previously only calibrated to the solar neighborhood, withparticular utility for thin- and thick-disk formation models.

1211.0549	the segue k giant survey ii: a catalog of distance determinations for  the segue k giants in the galactic halo	we present an online catalog of distance determinations for $\rm 6036$ kgiants, most of which are members of the milky way's stellar halo. theirmedium-resolution spectra from sdss/segue are used to derive metallicities andrough gravity estimates, along with radial velocities. distance moduli arederived from a comparison of each star's apparent magnitude with the absolutemagnitude of empirically calibrated color-luminosity fiducials, at the observed$(g-r)_0$ color and spectroscopic [fe/h]. we employ a probabilistic approachthat makes it straightforward to properly propagate the errors inmetallicities, magnitudes, and colors into distance uncertainties. we also foldin ${\it prior}$ information about the giant-branch luminosity function and thedifferent metallicity distributions of the segue k-giant targetingsub-categories. we show that the metallicity prior plays a small role in thedistance estimates, but that neglecting the luminosity prior could lead to asystematic distance modulus bias of up to 0.25 mag, compared to the case ofusing the luminosity prior. we find a median distance precision of $16\%$, withdistance estimates most precise for the least metal-poor stars near the tip ofthe red-giant branch. the precision and accuracy of our distance estimates arevalidated with observations of globular and open clusters. the stars in ourcatalog are up to 125 kpc distant from the galactic center, with 283 starsbeyond 50 kpc, forming the largest available spectroscopic sample of distanttracers in the galactic halo.

0712.0776	identification of rr lyrae variables in sdss from single-epoch  photometric and spectroscopic observations	we describe a new rr lyrae identification technique based on out-of-phasesingle-epoch photometric and spectroscopic observations contained in sdss datarelease 6 (dr-6). this technique detects variability by exploiting the largedisparity between the g-r color and the strength of the hydrogen balmer lineswhen the two observations are made at random phases. comparison with a largesample of known variables in the sdss equatorial stripe (stripe 82) shows thatthe discovery efficiency for our technique is ~85%. analysis of stars withmultiple spectroscopic observations suggests a similar efficiency throughoutthe entire dr-6 sample. we also develop a technique to estimate the average gapparent magnitude (over the pulsation cycle) for individual rr lyrae stars,using the &lt;g-r&gt; for the entire sample and measured colors for each star. theresulting distances are found to have precisions of ~14%. finally, we explorethe properties of our dr-6 sample of n = 1087 variables, and recover portionsof the sagittarius northern and southern stream. analysis of the distance andvelocity for the southern stream are consistent with previously published datafor blue horizontal-branch stars. in a sample near the north galactic polarcap, we find evidence for the descending leading northern arm, and a possibledetection of the trailing arm.

1304.1476	a spatial characterization of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal tails	we measure the spatial density of f turnoff stars in the sagittarius dwarftidal stream, from sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data, using statisticalphotometric parallax. we find a set of continuous, consistent parameters thatdescribe the leading sgr stream's position, direction, and width for 15 stripesin the north galactic cap, and 3 stripes in the south galactic cap. we producea catalog of stars that has the density characteristics of the dominant leadingsgr tidal stream that can be compared with simulations. we find that the widthof the leading (north) tidal tail is consistent with recent triaxial andaxisymmetric halo model simulations. the density along the stream is roughlyconsistent common disruption models in the north, but possibly not in thesouth. we explore the possibility that one or more of the dominant sgr streamshas been mis-identified, and that one or more of the `bifurcated' pieces is thereal sgr tidal tail, but we do not reach definite conclusions. if two dwarfprogenitors are assumed, fits to the planes of the dominant and `bifurcated'tidal tails favor an association of the sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy with thedominant southern stream and the `bifurcated' stream in the north. in the northgalactic cap, the best fit hernquist density profile for the smooth componentof the stellar halo is oblate, with a flattening parameter q = 0.53, and ascale length of r_0 = 6.73. the southern data for both the tidal debris and thesmooth component of the stellar halo do not match the model fits to the north,although the stellar halo is still overwhelmingly oblate. finally, we verifythat we can reproduce the parameter fits on the asynchronous milkyway@homevolunteer computing platform.

1310.3276	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars in sdss/segue. i. carbon abundance  estimation and frequency of cemp stars	we describe a method for the determination of stellar [c/fe] abundance ratiosusing low-resolution (r = 2000) stellar spectra from the sdss and segue. bymeans of a star-by-star comparison with a set of sdss/segue spectra withavailable estimates of [c/fe] based on published high-resolution analyses, wedemonstrate that we can measure [c/fe] from sdss/segue spectra with s/n &gt; 15 toa precision better than 0.35 dex. using the measured carbon-to-iron abundanceratios obtained by this technique, we derive the frequency of carbon-enhancedstars ([c/fe] &gt; +0.7) as a function of [fe/h], for both the sdss/segue starsand other samples from the literature. we find that the differential frequencyslowly rises from almost zero to about 14% at [fe/h] ~ -2.4, followed by asudden increase, by about a factor of three, to 39% from [fe/h] ~ -2.4 to[fe/h] ~ -3.7. we also examine how the cumulative frequency of cemp starsvaries across different luminosity classes. the giant sample exhibits acumulative cemp frequency of 32% for [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, 31% for [fe/h] &lt; -3.0, and33% for [fe/h] &lt; -3.5. for the main-sequence turnoff stars, we obtain a lowercumulative cemp frequency, around 10% for [fe/h] &lt; -2.5. the dwarf populationdisplays a large change in the cumulative frequency for cemp stars below [fe/h]= -2.5, jumping from 15% for [fe/h] &lt; -2.5 to about 75% for [fe/h] &lt; -3.0. whenwe impose a restriction with respect to distance from the galactic mid-plane(|z| &lt; 5 kpc), the frequency of the cemp giants does not increase at lowmetallicity ([fe/h] &lt; -2.5), but rather, decreases, due to the dilution ofc-rich material in stars that have undergone mixing with cno-processed materialfrom their interiors. the frequency of cemp stars near the main-sequenceturnoff, which are not expected to have experienced mixing, increases for[fe/h] &lt; -3.0.

1405.6724	the vertical metallicity gradient of the milky way disk: transitions in  [a/fe] populations	using g dwarfs from the sloan extension for galactic understanding andexploration (segue) survey, we have determined a vertical metallicity gradientover a large volume of the milky way's disk, and examined how this gradientvaries for different [a/fe] subsamples. this sample contains over 40,000 starswith low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. we employ the seguestellar parameter pipeline (sspp) to obtain estimates of effective temperature,surface gravity, [fe/h], and [a/fe] for each star and extract multiplevolume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each. based on thesurvey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample todetermine an unbiased picture of the disk in [fe/h] and [a/fe]; consequently,each individual star represents the properties of many. the segue sample allowsus to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient for a large number of starsover a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from thegalactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previousanalyses which are more limited in scope. this work does not pre-suppose a diskstructure, whether composed of a single complex population or a distinct thinand thick disk component. the metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039 -0.053dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literatureresults. each [a/fe] subsample dominates at a different range of heights abovethe plane of the galaxy, which is exhibited in the gradient found in the sampleas a whole. stars over a limited range in [a/fe] show little change in median[fe/h] with height. if we associate [a/fe] with age, our consistent verticalmetallicity gradients with [a/fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochsexhibit comparable vertical structure, implying similar star-formationprocesses and evolution.

0704.0655	exploring the variable sky with the sloan digital sky survey	we quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using acatalog based on multiple sdss imaging observations. the catalog covers sdssstripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the sdss ugrizsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. in each photometric bandpass wecompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select andstudy variable sources. we find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighterthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the gand r bands. the majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (&lt;2)quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adoptedflux-limited sample. we find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method forfinding low-redshift quasars as is the uv excess color selection (at highgalactic latitudes). we analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness forquasars and find that is centered on zero. we find that about 1/4 of thevariable stars are rr lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the mainstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. the distribution oflightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellarlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with algol-likebehavior). using over six hundred rr lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halosubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. we extrapolate these results toexpected performance by the large synoptic survey telescope and estimate thatit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 millionlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

1503.00257	rings and radial waves in the disk of the milky way	we show that in the anticenter region, between galactic longitudes of$110^\circ&lt;l&lt;229^\circ$, there is an oscillating asymmetry in the main sequencestar counts on either side of the galactic plane using data from the sloandigital sky survey. this asymmetry oscillates from more stars in the north atdistances of about 2 kpc from the sun to more stars in the south at 4-6 kpcfrom the sun to more stars in the north at distances of 8-10 kpc from the sun.we also see evidence that there are more stars in the south at distances of12-16 kpc from the sun. the three more distant asymmetries form roughlyconcentric rings around the galactic center, opening in the direction of themilky way's spiral arms. the northern ring, 9 kpc from the sun, is easilyidentified with the previously discovered monoceros ring. parts of the southernring at 14 kpc from the sun (which we call the triand ring) have previouslybeen identified as related to the monoceros ring and others have been calledthe triangulum andromeda overdensity. the two nearer oscillations areapproximated by a toy model in which the disk plane is offset by of the order100 pc up and then down at different radii. we also show that the disk is notazimuthally symmetric around the galactic anticenter and that there could be acorrespondence between our observed oscillations and the spiral structure ofthe galaxy. our observations suggest that the triand and monoceros rings (whichextend to at least 25 kpc from the galactic center) are primarily the result ofdisk oscillations.

1505.05521	estimation of distances to stars with stellar parameters from lamost	we present a method to estimate distances to stars with spectroscopicallyderived stellar parameters. the technique is a bayesian approach withlikelihood estimated via comparison of measured parameters to a grid of stellarisochrones, and returns a posterior probability density function for eachstar's absolute magnitude. this technique is tailored specifically to data fromthe large sky area multi-object fiber spectroscopic telescope (lamost) survey.because lamost obtains roughly 3000 stellar spectra simultaneously within each~5-degree diameter "plate" that is observed, we can use the stellar parametersof the observed stars to account for the stellar luminosity function and targetselection effects. this removes biasing assumptions about the underlyingpopulations, both due to predictions of the luminosity function from stellarevolution modeling, and from galactic models of stellar populations along eachline of sight. using calibration data of stars with known distances and stellarparameters, we show that our method recovers distances for most stars within~20%, but with some systematic overestimation of distances to halo giants. weapply our code to the lamost database, and show that the current precision oflamost stellar parameters permits measurements of distances with ~40% errorbars. this precision should improve as the lamost data pipelines continue to berefined.

astro-ph;0301029	a low latitude halo stream around the milky way	we present evidence for a ring of stars in the plane of the milky way,extending at least from l = 180 deg to l = 227 deg with turnoff magnitude $g\sim 19.5$; the ring could encircle the galaxy. we infer that the low galacticlatitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of r = 18 +/- 2 kpc fromthe galactic center above the galactic plane, and has r = 20 +/- 2 kpc in theregion sampled below the galactic plane. the evidence includes five hundredsdss spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30 degrees of the plane.the velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found tobe 27 km/s at (l,b) = (198, -27), 22 km/s at (l,b) = (225, 28), 30 km/s at(l,b) = (188, 24), and 30 km/s at (l,b) = (182, 27) degrees. the structurerotates in the same prograde direction as the galactic disk stars, but with acircular velocity of 110+/-25 km/s. the narrow measured velocity dispersion isinconsistent with power law spheroid or thick disk populations. we compare thevelocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars inthe sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocitydispersion of 20 km/s at (l, b) = (165, -55) deg. we estimate a preliminarymetallicity from the ca ii (k) line and color of the turnoff stars of [fe/h] =-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistentwith that of the spheroid population. we interpret our measurements as evidencefor a tidally disrupted satellite of $2 \times 10^7$ to $5 \times 10^8 \rmm_\odot$ which rings the galaxy.

astro-ph;0305093	a large, uniform sample of x-ray emitting agn: selection approach and an  initial catalog from the rosat all-sky and sloan digital sky surveys	many open questions in x-ray astronomy are limited by the relatively smallnumber of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when raresubclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution orcorrelations between wavebands. we describe initial results of a program aimedto ultimately yield 10^4 x-ray source identifications--a sample about an orderof magnitude larger than earlier efforts. the technique employs x-ray data fromthe rosat all-sky survey (rass), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followupfrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical objects in the sdss catalogsare automatically cross-correlated with rass x-ray source positions; thenpriorities for follow-on sdss optical spectra of candidate counterparts areautomatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios forvarious classes of x-ray emitters. sdss parameters for optical morphology,magnitude, colors, plus first radio data, serve as proxies for object class.  initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalogof 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/agn that are probable rassidentifications. most of the ids are new, and only a few percent of the agn arelikely to be random superpositions. the magnitude and redshift ranges of thecounterparts extend over 15&lt;m&lt;21 and 0.03&lt;z&lt;3.6. although most ids are quasarsand sy 1s, a variety of other agn subclasses are also sampled. substantialnumbers of rare agn are found, including more than 130 narrow-line seyfert 1sand 45 bl lac candidates. these results already provide a sizeable set of newids, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate thecapability of the rass/sdss approach to efficiently proceed towards the largesthomogeneously selected/observed sample of x-ray emitting agn. abridged abstract

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0502386	the halo of the milky way	we show that the star counts in the spheroid of the milky way are notsymmetric about the l=0, l=180 deg. plane. the minimum counts are found towardsl=155 deg. the galactic longitude of maximum star counts depends on themagnitude and color selection of the halo stars. we interpret this as evidencethat the spheroid population is triaxial with a major axis oriented 65 deg fromthe line of sight from the sun to the galactic center, and approximatelyperpendicular to the galactic bar. large local star concentrations from tidaldebris and possible tidal debris are also observed. a full understanding of thegalactic spheroid population awaits position information and three dimensionalspace velocities for a representative set of stars in every substructure.tangential velocities for many stars will be provided by current and plannedastrometry missions, but no planned mission will measure stars faint enough tounravel the more distant parts of the spheroid, which contain the majority ofthe spatial substructure. this paper uses data from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) public data release dr3.

astro-ph;0506022	the sdss view of the palomar-green bright quasar survey	we investigate the extent to which the palomar-green (pg) bright quasarsurvey (bqs) is complete and representative of the general quasar population bycomparing with imaging and spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey. acomparison of sdss and pg photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the needto apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the pg data. using the sdssphotometric catalog, we define the pg's parent sample of objects that are notmain-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parentsample using the pg photometric criteria and errors. this simulation shows thatthe effective u-b cut in the pg survey is u-b &lt; -0.71 (rather than the intendedu-b &lt; -0.44), implying a color-related incompleteness. as the colordistribution of bright quasars peaks near u-b=-0.7 and the 2-sigma error in u-bis comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the colorincompleteness of the bqs is approximately 50% and essentially random withrespect to u-b color for z&lt;0.5. there is, however, a bias against brightquasars at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation ofquasars (although quasars at z&gt;0.5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in anycase). we find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness whencomparing the distributions in color, redshift, and first radio properties ofthe bqs and a bqs-like subsample of the sdss quasar sample. however, theapplication of a bright magnitude limit biases the bqs toward the inclusion ofobjects which are blue in g-i, in particular compared to the full range of g-icolors found among the i-band limited sdss quasars, and even at i-bandmagnitudes comparable to those of the bqs objects.
