0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0706.4088	a study of the type ia/iin supernova 2005gj from x-ray to the infrared:  paper i	we present extensive ugrizyhjk photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn2005gj obtained by the sdss-ii and csp supernova projects, which give excellentcoverage during the first 150 days after the time of explosion. these data showthat sn 2005gj is the second clear case, after sn 2002ic, of a thermonuclearexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. both the presence of singly anddoubly ionized iron-peak elements (feiii and weak sii, siii) near maximum lightas well as the spectral evolution show that sn 2002ic-like events are type iaexplosions. independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosityof sn 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium isstronger than in sn 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the balmeremission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higherclose to maximum light. the velocity evolution of the halpha components suggestthat the csm around sn 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter densitydistribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with sn2002ic. an early x-ray observation with chandra gives an upper-limit on themass loss rate from the companion of &lt; 2x10^{-4} msun/yr.

0908.4276	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  constraints on non-standard cosmological models	we use the new sne ia discovered by the sdss-ii supernova survey togetherwith additional supernova datasets as well as observations of the cosmicmicrowave background and baryon acoustic oscillations to constrain cosmologicalmodels. this complements the analysis presented by kessler et al. in that wediscuss and rank a number of the most popular non-standard cosmology scenarios.when this combined data-set is analyzed using the mlcs2k2 light-curve fitter,we find that more exotic models for cosmic acceleration provide a better fit tothe data than the lambda-cdm model. for example, the flat dgp model is rankedhigher by our information criteria tests than the standard model. when thedataset is instead analyzed using the salt-ii light-curve fitter, the standardcosmological constant model fares best. our investigation also includesinhomogeneous lemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) models. while our ltb models can bemade to fit the supernova data as well as any other model, the extra parametersthey require are not supported by our information criteria analysis.

1111.1969	supernova simulations and strategies for the dark energy survey	we present an analysis of supernova light curves simulated for the upcomingdark energy survey (des) supernova search. the simulations employ a code suitethat generates and fits realistic light curves in order to obtain distancemodulus/redshift pairs that are passed to a cosmology fitter. we investigatedseveral different survey strategies including field selection, supernovaselection biases, and photometric redshift measurements. using the results ofthis study, we chose a 30 square degree search area in the griz filter set. weforecast 1) that this survey will provide a homogeneous sample of up to 4000type ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;1.2, and 2) that the increasedred efficiency of the des camera will significantly improve high-redshift colormeasurements. the redshift of each supernova with an identified host galaxywill be obtained from spectroscopic observations of the host. a supernovaspectrum will be obtained for a subset of the sample, which will be utilizedfor control studies. in addition, we have investigated the use of combinedphotometric redshifts taking into account data from both the host andsupernova. we have investigated and estimated the likely contamination fromcore-collapse supernovae based on photometric identification, and have foundthat a type ia supernova sample purity of up to 98% is obtainable givenspecific assumptions. furthermore, we present systematic uncertainties due tosample purity, photometric calibration, dust extinction priors, filter-centroidshifts, and inter-calibration. we conclude by estimating the uncertainty on thecosmological parameters that will be measured from the des supernova data.

1212.4864	improved photometric calibration of the snls and the sdss supernova  surveys	we present a combined photometric calibration of the snls and the sdsssupernova survey, which results from a joint effort of the sdss and the snlscollaborations. we deliver fluxes calibrated to the hst spectrophotometric starnetwork for large sets of tertiary stars that cover the science fields of bothsurveys in all photometric bands. we also cross-calibrate directly the twosurveys and demonstrate their consistency. for each survey the flat-fielding isrevised based on the analysis of dithered star observations. the calibrationtransfer from the hst spectrophotometric standard stars to the multi-epochtertiary standard star catalogs in the science fields follows three differentpaths: observations of primary standard stars with the sdss pt telescope;observations of landolt secondary standard stars with snls megacam instrumentat cfht; and direct observation of faint hst standard stars with megacam. inaddition, the tertiary stars for the two surveys are cross-calibrated usingdedicated megacam observations of stripe 82. this overlap enables thecomparison of these three calibration paths and justifies using theircombination to improve the calibration accuracy. flat-field corrections haveimproved the uniformity of each survey as demonstrated by the comparison ofphotometry in overlapping fields: the rms of the difference between the twosurveys is 3 mmag in gri, 4 mmag in z and 8 mmag in u. we also find aremarkable agreement (better than 1%) between the sdss and the snls calibrationin griz. the cross-calibration and the introduction of direct calibrationobservations bring redundancy and strengthen the confidence in the resultingcalibration. we conclude that the surveys are calibrated to the hst with aprecision of about 0.4% in griz. this precision is comparable to the externaluncertainty affecting the color of the hst primary standard stars.

0801.3297	a measurement of the rate of type-ia supernovae at redshift $z\approx$  0.1 from the first season of the sdss-ii supernova survey	we present a measurement of the rate of type ia supernovae (sne ia) from thefirst of three seasons of data from the sdss-ii supernova survey. for thismeasurement, we include 17 sne ia at redshift $z\le0.12$. assuming a flatcosmology with $\omega_m = 0.3=1-\omega_\lambda$, we find a volumetric sn iarate of $[2.93^{+0.17}_{-0.04}({\rm systematic})^{+0.90}_{-0.71}({\rmstatistical})] \times 10^{-5} {\rm sne} {\rm mpc}^{-3} h_{70}^3 {\rmyear}^{-1}$, at a volume-weighted mean redshift of 0.09. this result isconsistent with previous measurements of the sn ia rate in a similar redshiftrange. the systematic errors are well controlled, resulting in the most precisemeasurement of the sn ia rate in this redshift range. we use a maximumlikelihood method to fit sn rate models to the sdss-ii supernova survey data incombination with other rate measurements, thereby constraining models for theredshift-evolution of the sn ia rate. fitting the combined data to a simplepower-law evolution of the volumetric sn ia rate, $r_v \propto (1+z)^{\beta}$,we obtain a value of $\beta = 1.5 \pm 0.6$, i.e. the sn ia rate is determinedto be an increasing function of redshift at the $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ level.fitting the results to a model in which the volumetric sn rate,$r_v=a\rho(t)+b\dot \rho(t)$, where $\rho(t)$ is the stellar mass density and$\dot \rho(t)$ is the star formation rate, we find $a = (2.8 \pm 1.2) \times10^{-14} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1} \mathrm{year}^{-1}$, $b =(9.3^{+3.4}_{-3.1})\times 10^{-4} \mathrm{sne} \mathrm{m}_{\sun}^{-1}$.

1504.02936	automated transient identification in the dark energy survey	we describe an algorithm for identifying point-source transients and movingobjects on reference-subtracted optical images containing artifacts ofprocessing and instrumentation. the algorithm makes use of the supervisedmachine learning technique known as random forest. we present results from itsuse in the dark energy survey supernova program (des-sn), where it was trainedusing a sample of 898,963 signal and background events generated by thetransient detection pipeline. after reprocessing the data collected during thefirst des-sn observing season (sep. 2013 through feb. 2014) using thealgorithm, the number of transient candidates eligible for human scanningdecreased by a factor of 13.4, while only 1 percent of the artificial type iasupernovae (sne) injected into search images to monitor survey efficiency werelost, most of which were very faint events. here we characterize thealgorithm's performance in detail, and we discuss how it can inform pipelinedesign decisions for future time-domain imaging surveys, such as the largesynoptic survey telescope and the zwicky transient facility. an implementationof the algorithm and the training data used in this paper are available athttp://portal.nersc.gov/project/dessn/autoscan.

1505.07707	type ia supernova cosmology in the near-infrared	we main goal of this paper is to test whether the nir peak magnitudes of sneia could be accurately estimated with only a single observation obtained closeto maximum light, provided the time of b band maximum and the optical stretchparameter are known. we obtained multi-epoch ubvri and single-epoch j and hphotometric observations of 16 sne ia in the redshift range z=0.037-0.183,doubling the leverage of the current sn ia nir hubble diagram and the number ofsne beyond redshift 0.04. this sample was analyzed together with 102 nir and458 optical light curves (lcs) of normal sne ia from the literature.  the analysis of 45 well-sampled nir lcs shows that a single templateaccurately describes them if its time axis is stretched with the opticalstretch parameter. this allows us to estimate the nir peak magnitudes even withone observation obtained within 10 days from b-band maximum. we find that thenir hubble residuals show weak correlation with dm_15 and e(b-v), and for thefirst time we report a possible dependence on the j_max-h_max color. theintrinsic nir luminosity scatter of sne ia is estimated to be less than0.08-0.10 mag, which is smaller than what can be derived for a similarlyheterogeneous sample at optical wavelengths. in conclusion, we find that sne iaare at least as good standard candles in the nir as in the optical. we showedthat it is feasible to extended the nir sn ia hubble diagram to z=0.2 with verymodest sampling of the nir lcs, if complemented by well-sampled optical lcs.our results suggest that the most efficient way to extend the nir hubblediagram to high redshift would be to obtain a single observation close to thenir maximum.

1507.05090	weak lensing by galaxy troughs in des science verification data	we measure the weak lensing shear around galaxy troughs, i.e. the radialalignment of background galaxies relative to underdensities in projections ofthe foreground galaxy field over a wide range of redshift in scienceverification data from the dark energy survey. our detection of the shearsignal is highly significant (10 to 15$\sigma$ for the smallest angular scales)for troughs with the redshift range z in [0.2,0.5] of the projected galaxyfield and angular diameters of 10 arcmin...1{\deg}. these measurements probethe connection between the galaxy, matter density, and convergence fields. byassuming galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density with poissoniannoise, we find agreement of our measurements with predictions in a fiduciallambda cold dark matter model. the prediction for the lensing signal on largetrough scales is virtually independent of the details of the underlying modelfor the connection of galaxies and matter. our comparison of the shear aroundtroughs with that around cylinders with large galaxy counts is consistent witha symmetry between galaxy and matter over- and underdensities. in addition, wemeasure the two-point angular correlation of troughs with galaxies which, incontrast to the lensing signal, is sensitive to galaxy bias on all scales. thelensing signal of troughs and their clustering with galaxies is therefore apromising probe of the statistical properties of matter underdensities andtheir connection to the galaxy field.

1507.05137	the difference imaging pipeline for the transient search in the dark  energy survey	we describe the difference imaging pipeline (diffimg) used to detecttransients in deep images from the dark energy survey supernova program(des-sn) in its first observing season from aug 2013 through feb 2014. des-snis a search for transients in which ten 3-deg^2 fields are repeatedly observedin the g,r,i,z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. the observing strategyhas been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts forthousands of type ia supernova (sn ia) with the goal of measuring dark energyparameters. the essential diffimg functions are to align each search image to adeep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine thesubtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects.the vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selectionrequirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are130 detections per deg^2 per observation in each band, of which only 25% areartifacts. of the 7500 transients discovered by des-sn in its first observingseason, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, monte carlosimulations predict that 27% are expected to be supernova. another 30% of thetransients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are agn andvariable stars. fake sne ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluatedetection efficiencies, and to understand the diffimg performance. the diffimgefficiency measured with fake sne agrees well with expectations from a montecarlo simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and theiruncertainties. in our 8 "shallow" fields with single-epoch 50% completenessdepth 23.5, the sn ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z 0.7, in our 2"deep" fields with mag-depth 24.5, the efficiency falls to 1/2 at z 1.1.

1507.05360	galaxy clustering, photometric redshifts and diagnosis of systematics in  the des science verification data	we study the clustering of galaxies detected at $i&lt;22.5$ in the scienceverification observations of the dark energy survey (des). two-pointcorrelation functions are measured using $2.3\times 10^6$ galaxies over acontiguous 116 deg$^2$ region in five bins of photometric redshift width$\delta z = 0.2$ in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2.$ the impact of photometricredshift errors are assessed by comparing results using a template-basedphoto-$z$ algorithm (bpz) to a machine-learning algorithm (tpz). a companionpaper (leistedt et al 2015) presents maps of several observational variables(e.g. seeing, sky brightness) which could modulate the galaxy density. here wecharacterize and mitigate systematic errors on the measured clustering whicharise from these observational variables, in addition to others such asgalactic dust and stellar contamination. after correcting for systematiceffects we measure galaxy bias over a broad range of linear scales relative tomass clustering predicted from the planck $\lambda$cdm model, finding agreementwith cfhtls measurements with $\chi^2$ of 4.0 (8.7) with 5 degrees of freedomfor the tpz (bpz) redshifts. we test a "linear bias" model, in which the galaxyclustering is a fixed multiple of the predicted non-linear dark-matterclustering. the precision of the data allow us to determine that the linearbias model describes the observed galaxy clustering to $2.5\%$ accuracy down toscales at least $4$ to $10$ times smaller than those on which linear theory isexpected to be sufficient.

1512.04535	cross-correlation of gravitational lensing from des science verification  data with spt and planck lensing	we measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb). the effects of gravitational lensing ondifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same massfluctuations. we use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the darkenergy survey (des) science verification data and overlapping cmb lensing fromthe south pole telescope (spt) and planck. the des source galaxies have amedian redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the cmb lensing kernel isbroad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. the resulting cross-correlation is maximallysensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. assuming the planck 2015best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the des$\times$spt cross-power is found tobe $a = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from des$\times$planck to be $a = 0.86 \pm0.39$, where $a=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. these areconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. we demonstrate that our results arerobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shearmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and cmblensing systematics. significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes wouldincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate avalue of $a = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for des$\times$spt when we correct theobservations with a simple ia model. with three measurements of thiscross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliableevidence for any deviation from the expected lcdm level of cross-correlation,given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact ofsystematic errors, particularly ias. we provide forecasts for the expectedsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year des survey and spt-3g.

astro-ph;0112436	can a dusty warm absorber model reproduce the soft x-ray spectra of  mcg-6-30-15 and mrk 766?	xmm-newton rgs spectra of mcg-6-30-15 and mrk 766 exhibit complex discretestructure, which was interpreted in a paper by branduardi-raymont et al. (2001)as evidence for the existence of relativistically broadened lyman alphaemission from carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, produced in the inner-most regionsof an accretion disk around a kerr black hole. this suggestion was subsequentlycriticized in a paper by lee et al. (2001), who argued that for mcg-6-30-15,the chandra hetg spectrum, which is partially overlapping the rgs in spectralcoverage, is adequately fit by a dusty warm absorber model, with norelativistic line emission. we present a reanalysis of the original rgs datasets in terms of the lee et al. (2001) model, and demonstrate that spectralmodels consisting of a smooth continuum with ionized and dust absorption alonecannot reproduce the rgs spectra of both objects. the original relativisticline model with warm absorption proposed by branduardi-raymont et al. (2001)provides a superior fit to the rgs data, both in the overall shape of thespectrum and in the discrete absorption lines. limits on the amount of x-rayabsorption by dust particles are discussed. we also discuss a possibletheoretical interpretation for the putative relativistic lyman alpha lineemission in terms of the photoionized surface layers of the inner regions of anaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0203290	xmm-newton reflection grating spectrometer observations of discrete  soft-x-ray emission features from ngc 1068	we present the first high-resolution, soft-x-ray spectrum of the prototypicalseyfert 2 galaxy, ngc 1068. this spectrum was obtained with the xmm-newtonreflection grating spectrometer. emission lines from h-like and he-like low-zions (from c to si) and fe-l-shell ions dominate the spectrum. strong, narrowradiative recombination continua (rrc) for several ions are also present,implying that most of the observed soft-x-ray emission arises inlow-temperature (few ev) plasma. this plasma is photoionized by the inferrednuclear continuum (obscured along our line of sight), as in the unified modelof active galactic nuclei (agn). we find excess emission (compared with purerecombination) in all resonance lines (np to 1s) up to the photoelectric edge,demonstrating the importance of photoexcitation as well. we introduce a simplemodel of a cone of plasma irradiated by the nuclear continuum; the lineemission we observe along our line of sight perpendicular to the cone isproduced through recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization andradiative decay following photoexcitation. a remarkably good fit is obtained tothe h-like/he-like ionic line series, with inferred radial ionic columndensities consistent with recent observations of warm absorbers in seyfert 1galaxies. previous chandra imaging revealed a large (extending out to 500 pc)ionization cone containing most of the x-ray flux, implying that the warmabsorber in ngc 1068 is a large-scale outflow. to explain the ionic columndensities, a broad, flat distribution in the logarithm of the ionizationparameter ($\xi=l_x/n_e r^2$) is necessary, spanning $\log\xi=0$--3. thissuggests either radially-stratified ionization zones or the existence of abroad density distribution (spanning a few orders of magnitude) at each radius.

astro-ph;0206316	multi-wavelength study of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 with xmm-newton	we present the analysis of multi-wavelength xmm-newton data from the seyfertgalaxy ngc 3783, including uv imaging, x-ray and uv lightcurves, the 0.2-10 kevx-ray continuum, the iron k-alpha emission line, and high-resolutionspectroscopy and modelling of the soft x-ray warm absorber. the 0.2-10 kevspectral continuum can be well reproduced by a power-law at higher energies; wedetect a prominent fe k-alpha emission line, with both broad and narrowcomponents, and a weaker emission line at 6.9 kev which is probably acombination of fe k-beta and fe xxvi. we interpret the significant deficit ofcounts in the soft x-ray region as being due to absorption by ionised gas inthe line of sight. this is demonstrated by the large number of narrowabsorption lines in the rgs spectrum from iron, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, neon,argon, magnesium, silicon and sulphur. the wide range of iron states present inthe spectrum enables us to deduce the ionisation structure of the absorbingmedium. we find that our spectrum contains evidence of absorption by at leasttwo phases of gas: a hotter phase containing plasma with a log ionisationparameter xi (where xi is in erg cm/s) of 2.4 and greater, and a cooler phasewith log xi centred around 0.3. the gas in both phases is outflowing at speedsof around 800 km/s. the main spectral signature of the cold phase is theunresolved transition array (uta) of m-shell iron, which is the deepest yetobserved; its depth requires either that the abundance of iron, in the coldphase, is several times that of oxygen, with respect to solar abundances, orthat the absorption lines associated with this phase are highly saturated. thecold phase is associated with ionisation states that would also absorb in theuv.

astro-ph;0211403	the soft x-ray spectrum from ngc 1068 observed with letgs on chandra	using the combined spectral and spatial resolving power of the low energytransmission grating (letgs) on board chandra, we obtain separate spectra fromthe bright central source of ngc 1068 (primary region), and from a fainterbright spot 4" to the ne (secondary region). both spectra are dominated by lineemission from h- and he-like ions of c through s, and from fe l-shell ions, butalso include narrow radiative recombination continua, indicating that most ofthe soft x-ray emission arises in low-temperature (kt few ev) photoionizedplasma. we confirm the conclusions of kinkhabwala et al. (2002), based onxmm-newton rgs observations, that the entire nuclear spectrum can be explainedby recombination/radiative cascade following photoionization, and radiativedecay following photoexcitation, with no evidence for hot, collisionallyionized plasma. in addition, this model also provides an excellent fit to thespectrum of the secondary region, albeit with radial column densities a factorof three lower, as would be expected given its distance from the source of theionizing continuum. the remarkable overlap and kinematical agreement of theoptical and x-ray line emission, coupled with the need for a distribution ofionization parameter to explain the x-ray spectra, collectively imply thepresence of a distribution of densities (over a few orders of magnitude) ateach radius in the ionization cone. relative abundances of all elements areconsistent with solar abundance, except for n, which is 2-3 times solar. thelong wavelength spectrum beyond 30 a is rich of l-shell transitions of mg, si,s, and ar, and m-shell transitions of fe. the velocity dispersion decreaseswith increasing ionization parameter, as deduced from these long wavelengthlines and the fe-l shell lines.

astro-ph;0302551	multiwavelength studies of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc7469. ii - x-ray and  uv observations with xmm-newton	we present an xmm-newton observation of ngc 7469, including studies of thex-ray and uv variability, 0.2-10 kev spectral continuum, fe k-alpha emissionline and the first-ever high-resolution x-ray spectrum of the soft x-ray warmabsorber. we compare the properties of this x-ray warm absorber with the uvwarm absorber as seen in a fuse observation one year previously. the 0.2-10 kevspectral continuum is best fitted by a power-law plus two blackbody model. anfe k-alpha emission line is visible which consists of a single narrow componentand is well-modelled by a simple gaussian. narrow absorption and emission linesin the soft x-ray rgs spectrum demonstrate the existence of a multi-phase warmabsorber with a range in log xi of ~ 2 to ~ -2 where xi is in erg cm s^-1. thewarm absorber is blueshifted by several hundred km s^-1. the highest-ionisationphase of the absorber is the best constrained and has an overall equivalenthydrogen column of order 10^20 cm^-2; we find that its ionisation parameter isconsistent with that of the warm emitter which generates the narrow emissionlines. we identify this high ionisation absorber with the low-velocity phase ofthe uv absorber observed by fuse.

astro-ph;0304332	atomic calculations and spectral models of x-ray absorption and emission  features from astrophysical photoionized plasmas	we present a detailed model of the discrete x-ray spectroscopic featuresexpected from steady-state, low-density photoionized plasmas. we apply theflexible atomic code (fac) to calculate all of the necessary atomic data forthe full range of ions relevant for the x-ray regime. these calculations havebeen incorporated into a simple model of a cone of ions irradiated by a pointsource located at its tip (now available as the xspec model photoion). for eachionic species in the cone, photoionization is balanced by recombination andensuing radiative cascades, and photoexcitation of resonance transitions isbalanced by radiative decay. this simple model is useful for diagnosing x-rayemission mechanisms, determining photoionization/photoexcitation/recombinationrates, fitting temperatures and ionic emission measures, and probinggeometrical properties (covering factor/column densities/radial fillingfactor/velocity distributions) of absorbing/reemitting regions in photoionizedplasmas. such plasmas have already been observed in diverse astrophysical x-raysources, including active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, cataclysmicvariables, and stellar winds of early-type stars, and may also provide asignificant contribution to the x-ray spectra of gamma-ray-burst afterglows andthe intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0309503	structure and dynamics of stellar winds in high-mass x-ray binaries	a review of spectroscopic results obtained from chandra high energytransmission grating spectrometer and xmm-newton reflection gratingspectrometer observations of several wind-fed high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs)is presented. these observations allow us to study the structure of the stellarwind in more detail and provide, for the first time, a dyanmical view of thex-ray photoionized wind that surrounds the compact object. at the same time,however, they are also providing us with numerous puzzles that cannot beexplained in terms of simple models. for example, simple spherically-symmetricwind models cannot explain the observed orbital-phase variability of the lineintensities and shapes, which may be caused by intrinsic asymmetries due to thepresence of the compact object and/or more complicated radiative transfereffects. the observed line shifts are smaller than those expected fromextensions of simple wind models of isolated ob supergiants. in addition,several novel spectroscopic discoveries have been made, including: (1) p-cygnilines from an expanding wind, (2) detection of multiple si k fluorescent linesfrom a wide range of charge states, (3) compton scattered fe k lines from acold medium. we discuss how these spectroscopic diagnostics can be used tounderstand some of the global properties of stellar winds in hmxbs.

astro-ph;0403608	the j-band light curve of sn 2003lw, associated with grb 031203	at z=0.1055, the gamma-ray burst grb 031203 is one of the two nearest grbsknown. using observations from the very large array (vla) and chandra x-rayobservatory, we derive sub-arcsecond localizations of the radio and x-rayafterglow of this grb. we present near-infrared observations of the supernovasn 2003lw, which exploded in the host galaxy of the grb 031203. our deep, highresolution magellan/panic data establish that this sn is spatially coincidentwith the radio and x-ray localizations of the afterglow of grb 031203 tosub-arcsecond precision, and is thus firmly associated with the grb. we useimage differencing to subtract the bright emission from the host galaxy, andmeasure the time evolution of the sn between ~5 and ~50 days after the grb. theresulting light curve has a shape which is quite different from that of the twosne previously associated with grbs, sn 1998bw and sn 2003dh. with sn 2003lwsecurely associated with this burst, we confirm that all three grbs withredshifts z&lt;0.3 were accompanied by sn explosions.

astro-ph;0408096	the sub-energetic grb 031203 as a cosmic analogue to grb 980425	over the six years since the discovery of the gamma-ray burst grb 980425,associated with the nearby (distance, ~40 mpc) supernova 1998bw, astronomershave fiercely debated the nature of this event. relative to bursts located atcosmological distances, (redshift, z~1), grb 980425 was under-luminous ingamma-rays by three orders of magnitude. radio calorimetry showed the explosionwas sub-energetic by a factor of 10. here, we report observations of the radioand x-ray afterglow of the recent z=0.105 grb 031203 and demonstrate that ittoo is sub-energetic. our result, when taken together with the low gamma-rayluminosity, suggest that grb 031203 is the first cosmic analogue to grb 980425.we find no evidence that this event was a highly collimated explosion viewedoff-axis. like grb 980425, grb 031203 appears to be an intrinsicallysub-energetic gamma-ray burst. such sub-energetic events have faint afterglows.intensive follow-up of faint bursts with smooth gamma-ray light curves (commonto both grbs 031203 and 980425) may enable us to reveal their expected largepopulation.

astro-ph;0411232	xmm-newton observations of the heavily absorbed seyfert 1 galaxy ic  4329a	we detect seven distinct absorbing systems in the high-resolution x-rayspectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ic 4329a, taken with xmm-newton. firstly wedetect absorption due to cold gas in our own galaxy and warm gas in thegalactic halo or the local group. this local warm gas is only detected througho vii absorption, from which we deduce a temperature between 0.03 and 0.2 kev.in ic 4329a we detect absorption from the host galaxy as well as from a warmabsorber, close to the nucleus, which has 4 components. the absorption from thehost galaxy is well modeled by neutral material. the warm absorber detected inic 4329a is photoionized and has an ionization range between log $\xi$ = -1.37and log $\xi$ = 2.7. a broad excess is measured at the o viii ly$\alpha$ and nvii ly$\alpha$ emission lines, which can be modeled by either disklines ormultiple gaussians. from the lightcurve we find that the source changedluminosity by about 20 % over the 140 ks observation, while the spectral shape,i.e. the softness ratio did not vary. in the epic spectra a narrow fe k$\alpha$and fe xxvi ly$\alpha$ emission line are detected. the narrowness of the fek$\alpha$ line and the fact that there is no evidence for flux variabilitybetween different observations leads us to conclude that the fe k$\alpha$ lineis formed at a large distance from the central black hole.

astro-ph;0503181	tentative detection of warm intervening gas towards pks 0548-322 with  xmm-newton	we present the results of a long (~93 ksec) xmm-newton observation of thebright bl-lac object pks 0548-322 (z=0.069). our reflection gratingspectrometer (rgs) spectrum shows a single absorption feature at an observedwavelength lambda=23.33 a, which we interpret as ovi ka absorption at z=0.058,i.e., ~3000 km/s from the background object. the observed equivalent width ofthe absorption line ~30 ma, coupled with the lack of the correspondingabsorption edge in the epic pn data, implies an ovi column density ~ 2 10^{16}cm-2 and turbulence with a doppler velocity parameter b&gt;100 km/s. within thelimitations of our rgs spectrum, no ovii or ov ka absorption are detected.under the assumption of ionisation equilibrium by both collisions and theextragalactic background, this is only marginally consistent if the gastemperature is ~250,000 k, with significantly lower or higher values beingexcluded by our limits on ov or ovii. if confirmed, this would be the firstx-ray detection of a large amount of intervening warm absorbing gas through oviabsorption. the existence of such a high column density absorber, much strongerthan any previously detected one in ovi, would place stringent constraints onthe large-scale distribution of baryonic gas in the universe.

astro-ph;0606283	capella corona revisited: a combined view from \textit{xmm-newton} rgs,  \textit{chandra} hetgs, and letgs	we present a combined analysis of the x-ray emission of the capella coronaobtained with \textit{xmm-newton} rgs, \textit{chandra} hetgs, and letgs. animproved atomic line database and a new differential emission measure (dem)deconvolution method are developed for this purpose. our new atomic database isbased on the astrophysical plasma emission database and incorporates improvedcalculations of ionization equilibrium and line emissivities for l-shell ionsof abundant elements using the flexible atomic code. the new dem deconvolutionmethod uses a markov chain monte-carlo (mcmc) technique which differs fromexisting mcmc or $\chi^2$-fitting based methods. we analyze the advantages anddisadvantages of each individual instrument in determining the dem andelemental abundances. we conclude that results from either rgs or hetgs dataalone are not robust enough due to their failure to constrain dem in sometemperature region or the lack of significant continuum emission in thewavelength band of the spectrometers, and that the combination of hetgs and rgsgives more stringent constraints on the dem and abundance determinations. usingthe letgs data, we show that the recently discovered inconsistencies betweenthe euv and x-ray lines of fe xviii and xix also exist in more highly chargediron ions, up to fe xxiii, and that enhanced interstellar absorption due topartially ionized plasma along the capella line of sight may explain some, butnot all, of these discrepancies.
