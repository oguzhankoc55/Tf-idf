0902.1124	the impact of mergers on the survival and abundance of disk-dominated  galaxies	we study the formation of disk-dominated galaxies in a lcdm universe. theirexistence is considered to be a challenge for the lcdm cosmology, becausegalaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentum transportin gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellar spheroids. here,we postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from gasrich disks iscontrolled by two parameters that characterize galaxy mergers, the mass ratioof merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity of the larger merginghalo. we utilize merger histories generated from realizations of thecosmological density field to calculate the fraction of dark matter halos thathave avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived statistics with thespheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby galaxies. we find, forexample, that the survival rate of disk-dominated galaxies in lcdm is just highenough to explain the observed fractional representation of disk-dominatedgalaxies in the universe if the only mergers which lead to central spheroidformation are those with mass ratios m2/m1 &gt; 0.3 and virial velocities vvir,1 &gt;55 km/s. we discuss the physical origin of this criterion, and show that thedependence of the disk-dominated fraction on galaxy mass provides a furthertest of the merger hypothesis.

0905.2920	cosmological radiative transfer comparison project ii: the  radiation-hydrodynamic tests	the development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to followgas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution ofmany problems in numerical astrophysics. such fluid flows are highly complex,rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against whichnumerical codes can be tested. an alternative validation procedure is tocompare different methods against each other on common problems, in order toassess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for themethods. previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiativetransfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). this is thesecond paper of the cosmological radiative transfer (rt) comparison project, inwhich we compare 9 independent rt codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of anh ii region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (i-front) in a 1/r^2density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniformdense clump. results show a broad agreement between the different methods andno big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certainlevel of maturity and reliability. however, many details still do differ, andvirtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in onerespect or another, with the majority of the results. this underscores the factthat no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particularfeatures which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

0906.4552	the cosmic near infrared background ii: fluctuations	the near infrared background (nirb) is one of a few methods that can be usedto observe the redshifted light from early stars at a redshift of six andabove. fluctuations of the nirb can provide information on the firststructures, such as halos and their surrounding ionized regions in the igm. wecombine, for the first time, n-body simulations, radiative transfer code, andanalytic calculations of luminosity of early structures to predict the angularpower spectrum (c_l) of fluctuations in the nirb. we study the effects ofvarious assumptions about the stellar mass, the initial mass spectrum of stars,metallicity, the star formation efficiency (f_*), the escape fraction ofionizing photons (f_esc), and the star formation timescale (t_sf), on theamplitude as well as the shape of c_l. the power spectrum of nirb fluctuationsis maximized when f_* is the largest (as c_l ~ (f_*)^2) and f_esc is thesmallest. a significant uncertainty in the predicted amplitude of c_l existsdue to our lack of knowledge of t_sf of these galaxies, which is equivalent toour lack of knowledge of the mass-to-light ratio. we do not see a turnover inthe nirb angular power spectrum of the halo contribution and explain this asthe effect of high levels of non-linear bias. this is partly due to our choiceof the minimum mass of halos contributing to nirb, and a smaller minimum mass,which has a smaller non-linear bias, may still exhibit a turn over. therefore,both the amplitude and shape of the nirb power spectrum provide importantinformation regarding the nature of sources contributing to the cosmicreionization. the angular power spectrum of the igm, in most cases, is muchsmaller than the halo angular power spectrum. in addition, low levels of theobserved mean background intensity tend to rule out high values of f_* &gt; 0.2.

1006.2016	topology and sizes of hii regions during cosmic reionization	we use the results of large-scale simulations of reionization to exploremethods for characterizing the topology and sizes of hii regions duringreionization. we use four independent methods for characterizing the sizes ofionized regions. three of them give us a full size distribution: thefriends-of-friends (fof) method, the spherical average method (spa) and thepower spectrum (ps) of the ionized fraction. these latter three methods arecomplementary: while the fof method captures the size distribution of the smallscale h ii regions, which contribute only a small amount to the totalionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measurefor the average size of the h ii regions constituting the main contribution tothe ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining moredetails on the size distribution. our fourth method for characterizing thesizes of the h ii regions is the average size which results if we divide thetotal volume of the h ii regions by their total surface area, (i.e. 3v/a),computed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding minkowski functionals ofthe ionized fraction field. to characterize the topology of the ionizedregions, we calculate the evolution of the euler characteristic. we find thatthe evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization isconsistent with inside-out reionization of a gaussian density field. we usethese techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on somebasic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibilityof haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass forsources to form. we find that suppression of ionizing sources within ionizedregions slows the growth of h ii regions, and also changes their sizedistribution. additionally, the topology of simulations including suppressionis more complex.

1101.3097	gravothermal collapse of isolated self-interacting dark matter haloes:  n-body simulation versus the fluid model	self-interacting dark matter (sidm) is a collisional form of cold dark matter(cdm), originally proposed to solve problems that arose when the collisionlesscdm theory of structure formation was compared with observations of galaxies onsmall scales. the quantitative impact of the proposed elastic collisions onstructure formation has been estimated previously by monte carlo n-bodysimulations and by a conducting fluid model, with apparently diverging results.to improve this situation, we make direct comparisons between new monte carlon-body simulations and solutions of the conducting fluid model, for isolatedsidm haloes of fixed mass. this allows us to separate cleanly the effects ofgravothermal relaxation from those of continuous mass accretion in an expandingbackground universe. when these two methods were previously applied to haloformation with cosmological boundary conditions, they disagreed by an order ofmagnitude about the size of the scattering cross section required to solve theso-called 'cusp-core problem.' we show here, however, that the methods agreewith each other within 20 per cent for isolated haloes. this suggests that thetwo methods are consistent, and that their disagreement for cosmological haloesis not caused by a breakdown of their validity.  the isolated haloes studied here undergo gravothermal collapse. we comparethe solutions calculated by these two methods for gravothermal collapsestarting from several initial conditions. this allows us to calibrate the heatconduction which accounts for the effect of elastic hard-sphere scattering inthe fluid model. the amount of tuning of the thermal conductivity parametersrequired to bring the two methods into close agreement for isolated haloes,however, is too small to explain the discrepancy found previously in thecosmological context.

1104.2094	redshift space distortion of the 21cm background from the epoch of  reionization i: methodology re-examined	the peculiar velocity of the intergalactic gas responsible for the cosmic21cm background from the epoch of reionization and beyond introduces ananisotropy in the three-dimensional power spectrum of brightness temperaturefluctuations. measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is apromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. however,previous attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity oronly approximated it crudely. this paper re-examines the effects of peculiarvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment andaddressing several issues for the first time. (1) we show that properlyaccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the igm found by previouswork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) theapproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightnesstemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the powerspectrum on all scales. (3) the observed power spectrum in redshift-spaceremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properlyaccounts for the redshift-space distortion. however, results that take fullaccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accuratein the limit of high spin temperature. (4) the linear theory for redshift-spacedistortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumberrange, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) we describe and test two numerical schemesto calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporatepeculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately. oneis particle-based, the other grid-based, and while the former is most accurate,we demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and canachieve sufficient accuracy.

1107.4772	can 21-cm observations discriminate between high-mass and low-mass  galaxies as reionization sources?	the prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on theintergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leadsus to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing whichtypes of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. we attempt to answerthis by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations ofreionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningfulpredictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving allatomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 m_solar. we focus here on predictions ofthe 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable ofdistinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one inwhich both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how theseresults depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. we find that 21-cmfluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation eor/21-cm radiointerferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization byhigh-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.some reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolutionand thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization historyand 21-cm pdf distributions. we find that the skewness of the 21-cm pdfdistribution smoothed over lofar-like window shows a clear feature correlatedwith the rise of the rms due to patchiness. measurements of the meanphotoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions beingstudied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases.

1109.1284	light cone effect on the reionization 21-cm power spectrum	observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen during theepoch of reionization (eor) are considered to constitute the most promisingtool to probe that epoch. one of the major goals of the first generation of lowfrequency radio telescopes is to measure the 3d 21-cm power spectrum. however,the 21-cm signal could evolve substantially along the line of sight (los)direction of an observed 3d volume, since the received signal from differentplanes transverse to the los originated from different look-back times andcould therefore be statistically different. using numerical simulations weinvestigate this so-called light cone effect on the spherically averaged 3d21-cm power spectrum. for this version of the power spectrum, we find that theeffect mostly `averages out' and observe a smaller change in the power spectrumcompared to the amount of evolution in the mean 21-cm signal and its rmsvariations along the los direction. nevertheless, changes up to 50% at largescales are possible. in general the power is enhanced/suppressed at large/smallscales when the effect is included. the cross-over mode below/above which thepower is enhanced/suppressed moves toward larger scales as reionizationproceeds. when considering the 3d power spectrum we find it to be anisotropicat the late stages of reionization and on large scales. the effect is dominatedby the evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen during reionization andincluding peculiar velocities hardly changes these conclusions. we presentsimple analytical models which explain qualitatively all the features we see inthe simulations.

1112.2064	the cosmic near infrared background iii: fluctuations, reionization and  the effects of minimum mass and self-regulation	current observations suggest that the universe was reionized sometime beforez~6. one way to observe this epoch of the universe is through the near infraredbackground (nirb), which contains information about galaxies which may be toofaint to be observed individually. we calculate the angular power spectrum(c_l) of the nirb fluctuations caused by the distribution of these galaxies.assuming a complete subtraction of any post-reionization component, c_l will bedominated by galaxies responsible for completing reionization (e.g., z~6). theshape of c_l at high l is sensitive to the amount of non-linear bias of darkmatter halos hosting galaxies. as the non-linear bias depends on the mass ofthese halos, we can use the shape of c_l to infer typical masses of dark matterhalos responsible for completing reionization. we extend our previous study byusing a higher-resolution n-body simulation, which can resolve halos down to10^8 m_sun. we also include improved radiative transfer, which allows for thesuppression of star formation in small-mass halos due to photo-ionizationheating. as the non-linear bias enhances the dark-matter-halo power spectrum onsmall scales, we find that c_l is steeper for the case with a completesuppression of small sources or partial suppression of star formation in smallhalos (the minimum galaxy mass is m_min=10^9 m_sun in ionized regions andm_min=10^8 m_sun in neutral regions) than the case in which these small haloswere unsuppressed. in all cases, we do not see a turn-over toward high l in theshape of l^2 c_l.

1201.0602	radiative transfer of energetic photons: x-rays and helium ionization in  c2-ray	we present an extension to the short-characteristic ray-tracing andnon-equilibrium photon-ionization code c2ray. the new version includes theeffects of helium and improved multi-frequency heating. the motivation for thiswork is to be able to deal with harder ionizing spectra, such as for examplefrom quasar-like sources during cosmic reionization. we review the basicalgorithmic ingredients of c2-ray before describing the changes implemented,which include a treatment of the full on the spot (ots) approximation,secondary ionization, and multi-frequency photo-ionization and heating. weperformed a series of tests against equilibrium solutions from cloudy as wellas comparisons to the hydrogen only solutions by c2-ray in the extensive codecomparison in iliev et al. (2006). we show that the full, coupled otsapproximation is more accurate than the simplified, uncoupled one. we find thatalso with helium and a multi-frequency set up, long timesteps (up to ~10% ofthe recombination time) still give accurate results for the ionizationfractions. on the other hand, accurate results for the temperature set strongconstrains on the timestep. the details of these constraints depend however onthe optical depth of the cells. we use the new version of the code to confirmthat the assumption made in many reionization simulations, namely that heliumis singly ionized everywhere were hydrogen is, is indeed valid when the sourceshave stellar-like spectra.

1203.0517	prospects of observing a quasar hii region during the epoch of  reionization with redshifted 21cm	we present a study of the impact of a bright quasar on the redshifted 21cmsignal during the epoch of reionization (eor). using three differentcosmological radiative transfer simulations, we investigate if quasars arecapable of substantially changing the size and morphology of the h ii regionsthey are born in. we choose stellar and quasar luminosities in a way that isfavourable to seeing such an effect. we find that even the most luminous of ourquasar models is not able to increase the size of its native h ii regionsubstantially beyond those of large h ii regions produced by clustered stellarsources alone. however, the quasar h ii region is found to be more spherical.we next investigate the prospects of detecting such h ii regions in theredshifted 21cm data from the low frequency array (lofar) by means of a matchedfilter technique. we find that h ii regions with radii ~ 25 comoving mpc orlarger should have a sufficiently high detection probability for 1200 hours ofintegration time. although the matched filter can in principle distinguishbetween more and less spherical regions, we find that when including realisticsystem noise this distinction can no longer be made. the strong foregrounds arefound not to pose a problem for the matched filter technique. we alsodemonstrate that when the quasar position is known, the redshifted 21cm datacan still be used to set upper limits on the ionizing photon rate of thequasar. if both the quasar position and its luminosity are known, theredshifted 21 cm data can set new constrains on quasar lifetimes.

1206.3305	halo statistics in non-gaussian cosmologies: the collapsed fraction,  conditional mass function, and halo bias from the path-integral excursion set  method	characterizing the level of primordial non-gaussianity (png) in the initialconditions for structure formation is one of the most promising ways to testinflation and differentiate among different scenarios. the scale-dependentimprint of png on the large-scale clustering of galaxies and quasars hasalready been used to place significant constraints on the level of png in ourobserved universe. such measurements depend upon an accurate and robust theoryof how png affects the bias of galactic halos relative to the underlying matterdensity field. we improve upon previous work by employing a more generalanalytical method - the path-integral extension of the excursion set formalism- which is able to account for the non-markovianity caused by png in therandom-walk model used to identify halos in the initial density field. thisnon-markovianity encodes information about environmental effects on haloformation which have so far not been taken into account in analytical biascalculations. we compute both scale-dependent and -independent corrections tothe halo bias, along the way presenting an expression for the conditionalcollapsed fraction for the first time, and a new expression for the conditionalhalo mass function. to leading order in our perturbative calculation, werecover the halo bias results of desjacques et. al. (2011), including the newscale-dependent correction reported there. however, we show that thenon-markovian dynamics from png can lead to marked differences in halo biaswhen next-to-leading order terms are included. we quantify these differenceshere.

1206.4028	on the use of ly-alpha emitters as probes of reionization	we use numerical simulations to study the effects of the patchiness of apartly reionized intergalactic medium (igm) on the observability of ly-alphaemitters (laes) at high redshifts (z ~ 6). we present a new model that dividesthe ly-alpha radiative transfer into a (circum-)galactic and an extragalactic(igm) part, and investigate how the choice of intrinsic line model affects theigm transmission results. we use our model to study the impact of neutralhydrogen on statistical observables such as the ly-alpha restframe equivalentwidth (rew) distribution, the lae luminosity function and the two-pointcorrelation function. we find that if the observed changes in lae luminosityfunctions and equivalent width distributions between z ~ 6 and z ~ 7 are to beexplained by an increased igm neutral fraction alone, we require an extremelylate and rapid reionization scenario, where the universe was ~ 40 % ionized atz = 7, ~ 50 % ionized at z = 6.5 and ~ 100 % ionized at z = 6. this is inconflict with other observations, suggesting that intrinsic lae evolution at z&gt; 6 cannot be completely neglected. we show how the two-point correlationfunction can provide more robust constraints once future observations obtainlarger lae samples, and provide predictions for the sample sizes needed to telldifferent reionization scenarios apart.

1206.5007	detecting the rise and fall of the first stars by their impact on cosmic  reionization	the intergalactic medium was reionized before redshift z~6, most likely bystarlight which escaped from early galaxies. the very first stars formed whenhydrogen molecules (h2) cooled gas inside the smallest galaxies, minihalos ofmass between 10^5 and 10^8 solar masses. although the very first stars beganforming inside these minihalos before redshift z~40, their contribution has, todate, been ignored in large-scale simulations of this cosmic reionization. herewe report results from the first reionization simulations to include thesefirst stars and the radiative feedback that limited their formation, in avolume large enough to follow the crucial spatial variations that influencedthe process and its observability. we show that, while minihalo stars stoppedfar short of fully ionizing the universe, reionization began much earlier withminihalo sources than without, and was greatly extended, which boosts theintergalactic electron-scattering optical depth and the large-anglepolarization fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background significantly.although within current wmap uncertainties, this boost should be readilydetectable by planck. if reionization ended as late as z_ov&lt;~7, as suggested byother observations, planck will thereby see the signature of the first stars athigh redshift, currently undetectable by other probes.

0711.2944	effect of the intergalactic environment on the observability of ly-alpha  emitters during reionization	observations of high-redshift ly-alpha sources are a major tool for studyingthe high-redshift universe. we discuss the effect of the reionizingintergalactic medium on the observability of ly-alpha sources based on largesimulations of early structure formation with radiative transfer. this takesinto account self-consistently the reionization history, density, velocity andionization structures and nonlinear source clustering. we find that all fieldsare highly anisotropic and as a consequence there are very large variations inopacity among the different lines-of-sight. the velocity effects, from bothinfall and source peculiar velocity are most important for the luminoussources, affecting the line profile and depressing the bright end of theluminosity function. the line profiles are generally asymmetric and the linecenters of the luminous sources are always absorbed due to the high density ofthe local igm. for both luminous and average sources the damping wing effectsare of similar magnitude and remain significant until fairly late.  the ionizing flux in the ionized patch surrounding a high density peak isgenerally strongly dominated, particularly at late times, by the cluster offaint sources, rather than the central massive galaxy. the igm absorption doesnot change appreciably the correlation function of sources at high redshift.our derived luminosity function assuming constant mass-to-light ratio providesan excellent match to the shape of the observed luminosity function at z=6.6with faint-end slope of alpha=-1.5. the resulting mass-to-light ratio impliesthat the majority of sources responsible for reionization are too faint to beobserved by the current surveys.

1301.3607	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect as a probe of the physics of  cosmic reionization: the effect of self-regulated reionization	we calculate the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) temperature fluctuations induced by the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect from the epoch of reionization (eor). we use detailed n-body+radiativetransfer simulations to follow inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalacticmedium (igm). for the first time we take into account the "self-regulation" ofreionization: star formation in low-mass dwarf galaxies (10^8 m_\sun \lesssim m\lesssim 10^9 m_\sun) or minihalos (10^5 m_\sun \lesssim m \lesssim 10^8m_\sun) is suppressed if these halos form in the regions that were alreadyionized or lyman-werner dissociated. some previous work suggested that theamplitude of the ksz power spectrum from the eor can be described by atwo-parameter family: the epoch of half ionization and the duration ofreionization. however, we argue that this picture applies only to simple formsof the reionization history which are roughly symmetric about thehalf-ionization epoch. in self-regulated reionization, the universe begins tobe ionized early, maintains a low level of ionization for an extended period,and then finishes reionization as soon as high-mass atomically-cooling halosdominate. while inclusion of self-regulation affects the amplitude of the kszpower spectrum only modestly (\sim 10 %), it can change the duration ofreionization by a factor of more than two. we conclude that the simpletwo-parameter family does not capture the effect of a physical, yet complex,reionization history caused by self-regulation. when added to thepost-reionization ksz contribution, our prediction for the total ksz powerspectrum is below the current upper bound from the south pole telescope.therefore, the current upper bound on the ksz effect from the eor is consistentwith our understanding of the physics of reionization.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

1304.6411	the scale-dependent signature of primordial non-gaussianity in the  large-scale structure of cosmic reionization	(abridged)the rise of cosmic structure depends upon the statisticaldistribution of initial density fluctuations generated by inflation. while thesimplest models predict an almost perfectly gaussian distribution, more-generalmodels predict a level of primordial non-gaussianity (png) that observationsmight yet be sensitive enough to detect. recent planck collaborationmeasurements of the cmb temperature anisotropy bispectrum significantly tightenthe observational limits, but they are still far from the png level predictedby the simplest models of inflation. probing levels below cmb sensitivitieswill require other methods, such as searching for the statistical imprint ofpng on galactic halo clustering. during the epoch of reionization (eor), thefirst stars and galaxies released radiation into the intergalactic medium (igm)that created ionized patches whose large-scale geometry and evolution reflectedthe underlying abundance and large-scale clustering of the star-forminggalaxies. this statistical connection between ionized patches in the igm andgalactic halos suggests that observing reionization may be another way toconstrain png. we employ the linear perturbation theory of reionization andsemi-analytic models based on the excursion-set formalism to model the effectsof png on the eor. we quantify the effects of png on the large-scale structureof reionization by deriving the ionized density bias, i.e. ratio of ionizedatomic to total matter overdensities in fourier space, at small wavenumber.just as previous studies found that png creates a scale-dependent signature inthe halo bias, so, too, we find a scale-dependent signature in the ionizeddensity bias. our results, which differ significantly from previous attempts inthe literature to characterize this png signature, will be applied elsewhere topredict its observable consequences, e.g. in the cosmic 21cm background.

1310.6061	cosmological constraints on bose-einstein-condensed scalar field dark  matter	(abridged) despite the success of cold dark matter (cdm) in explaining a widerange of observations, the microscopic nature of dark matter is still unknown.attempts to detect wimps, the most commonly studied form, have not yetsucceeded. some predictions are even in apparent conflict with observations(e.g. cuspy-cored halos and `missing satellite problem'). therefore, it isimportant to consider different forms of cdm. we focus on dark matter comprisedof ultralight bosons that form a bose-einstein condensate (bec), described by acomplex scalar field, and solve the klein-gordon and einstein field equationsto evolve the friedmann-robertson-walker universe. we find, in addition tophases of radiation-, matter- and \lambda-domination, an earlier phase ofscalar-field-domination. moreover, while wimp cdm is non-relativistic at alltimes after it decouples, bec scalar field dark matter (sfdm) is relativisticat early times, evolving from stiff to radiation-like, before it becomesnon-relativistic (cdm-like) at late times. the timing of transitions betweenthese phases yields fundamental constraints on sfdm model parameters, particlemass m and self-interaction coupling strength \lambda. we derive the range ofparticle parameters required to match observations of the evolving backgrounduniverse, including the cmb and abundances of light elements produced by bbn,characterized by n_eff, the effective number of neutrino species, and the epochof matter-radiation equality z_eq. this yields m &gt;= 2.4*10^{-21} ev/c^2 and9.5*10^{-19} ev^{-1}cm^3 &lt;= \lambda/(mc^2)^2 &lt;= 4*10^{-17} ev^{-1}cm^3. ourmodel accommodates current observations in which n_eff at bbn is higher than atz_eq, as probed by the cmb, otherwise unexplained by wimp cdm. sfdm withoutself-interaction (`fuzzy dark matter') cannot satisfy current bbn constraintswithin 68% confidence and is therefore disfavored.

1310.7463	simulating cosmic reionization: how large a volume is large enough?	we present the largest-volume (425 mpc/h=607 mpc on a side) full radiativetransfer simulation of cosmic reionization to date. we show that there issignificant additional power in density fluctuations at very large scales. wesystematically investigate the effects this additional power has on theprogress, duration and features of reionization, as well as on selectedreionization observables. we find that comoving simulation volume of ~100 mpc/hper side is sufficient for deriving a convergent mean reionization history, butthat the reionization patchiness is significantly underestimated. we usejackknife splitting to quantify the convergence of reionization properties withsimulation volume for both mean-density and variable-density sub-regions. wefind that sub-volumes of ~100 mpc/h per side or larger yield convergentreionization histories, except for the earliest times, but smaller volumes of~50 mpc/h or less are not well converged at any redshift. reionization historymilestones show significant scatter between the sub-volumes, of delta z=0.6-1for ~50 mpc/h volumes, decreasing to delta z=0.3-0.5 for ~100 mpc/h volumes,and $\delta z$~0.1 for ~200 mpc/h volumes. if we only consider mean-densitysub-regions the scatter decreases, but remains at delta z~0.1-0.2 for thedifferent size sub-volumes. consequently, many potential reionizationobservables like 21-cm rms, 21-cm pdf skewness and kurtosis all show goodconvergence for volumes of ~200 mpc/h, but retain considerable scatter forsmaller volumes. in contrast, the three-dimensional 21-cm power spectra atlarge scales (k&lt;0.25 h/mpc) do not fully converge for any sub-volume size.these additional large-scale fluctuations significantly enhance the 21-cmfluctuations, which should improve the prospects of detection considerably,given the lower foregrounds and greater interferometer sensitivity at higherfrequencies.

1311.1614	the effect of large-scale structure on the magnification of  high-redshift sources by cluster-lenses	cluster gravitational lensing surveys like the hubble space telescopefrontier fields survey will detect distant galaxies 10-50 times fainter thanany yet discovered. using these surveys to measure the luminosity function ofsuch faint, distant galaxies, however, requires that magnification maps builtfrom the constraints of strongly-lensed images be accurate. for models thatassume the cluster and nearby (correlated) structures are the only significantsources of lensing, a potential source of error in these maps comes from thefact that light rays also suffer weak deflections by uncorrelated large-scalestructure along the line-of-sight, i.e. cosmic weak lensing (cwl). todemonstrate the magnitude of this effect, we calculate the magnification changewhich results when the same cluster-lens is placed along different lines ofsight. using a simple density profile for a cluster-lens at z~0.3-0.5 and thepower spectrum of the matter density fluctuations responsible for cwl, we showthat the typical magnifications of ~5(10) of sources at z=6-10 can differ by~10-20(20-30)% from one line-of-sight to another. however, these fluctuationsrise to greater than order unity near critical curves, indicating that cwltends to make its greatest contribution to the most magnified images. weconclude that the neglect of cwl in determining the intrinsic luminosities ofhighly-magnified galaxies may introduce errors significant enough to warrantfurther effort to include this contribution in cluster-lens modeling. wesuggest that methods of modeling cwl in galaxy-strong-lensing systems should begeneralized to cluster-lensing systems.

0803.1803	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56	the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-56, known as the "bullet cluster," is oneof the hottest clusters known. the x-ray emitting plasma exhibitsbow-shock-like temperature and density jumps. the segregation of this plasmafrom the peaks of the mass distribution determined by gravitational lensing hasbeen interpreted as a direct proof of collisionless dark matter. if the highshock speed inferred from the shock jump conditions equals the relative speedof the merging cdm halos, however, this merger is predicted to be such a rareevent in a lcdm universe that observing it presents a possible conflict withthe lcdm model.  we examined this question using high resolution, 2d simulations of gasdynamics in cluster collisions to analyze the relative motion of the clusters,the bow shock, and the contact discontinuity, and relate these to the x-raydata for the bullet cluster. we find that the velocity of the fluid shock neednot equal the relative velocity of the cdm components. an illustrativesimulation finds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16%lower than that of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to thedetailed initial mass and gas density profiles of the colliding clusters, sucha decrease of the inferred halo relative velocity would significantly increasethe likelihood of finding 1e 0657-56 in a lcdm universe.

1407.2637	nonlinear bias of cosmological halo formation in the early universe	we present estimates of the nonlinear bias of cosmological halo formation,spanning a wide range in the halo mass from $\sim 10^{5} m_\odot$ to $\sim10^{12} m_\odot$, based upon both a suite of high-resolution cosmologicaln-body simulations and theoretical predictions. the halo bias is expressed interms of the mean bias and stochasticity as a function of local overdensity($\delta$), under different filtering scales, which is realized as the densityof individual cells in uniform grids. the sampled overdensities span a rangewide enough to provide the fully nonlinear bias effect on the formation ofhaloes. a strong correlation between $\delta$ and halo population overdensity$\delta_h$ is found, along with sizable stochasticity. we find that theempirical mean halo bias matches, with good accuracy, the prediction by thepeak-background split method based on the excursion set formalism, as long asthe empirical, globally-averaged halo mass function is used. consequently, thisbias formalism is insensitive to uncertainties caused by varying haloidentification schemes, and can be applied generically. we also find that theprobability distribution function of biased halo numbers has wider distributionthan the pure poisson shot noise, which is attributed to the sub-cell scalehalo correlation. we explicitly calculate this correlation function and showthat both overdense and underdense regions have positive correlation, leadingto stochasticity larger than the poisson shot noise in the range of haloes andhalo-collapse epochs we study.

astro-ph;0208547	a model for the formation and evolution of cosmological halos	adaptive sph and n-body simulations were carried out to study the collapseand evolution of dark matter halos that result from the gravitationalinstability and fragmentation of cosmological pancakes. such halos resemblethose formed by hierarchical clustering in a cdm universe and serve as aconvenient test-bed model for studying halo dynamics. our halos are inapproximate virial equilibrium and roughly isothermal, as in cdm simulations.their density profiles agree quite well with the fit to n-body results for cdmhalos by navarro, frenk, &amp; white (nfw). this test-bed model enables us to studythe evolution of individual halos. the masses of our halos evolve in threestages: an initial collapse, continuous infall, and a final stage in whichinfall tapers off as a result of finite mass supply. in the continuous infallstage, halo mass grows at the rate expected for self-similar spherical infall,with m(a) proportional to the scale factor a. after the end of initial collapseat a=a_0, the concentration parameter grows linearly with a, c(a)~4a/a_0. thevirial ratio 2t/|w| just after virialization is about 1.35, as predicted by thetruncated isothermal sphere model and consistent with the value expected for avirialized halo in which mass infall contributes an effective surface pressure.thereafter, the virial ratio evolves towards the value expected for an isolatedhalo, 2t/|w|~1. this mass accretion history and evolution of concentrationparameter are very similar to those reported recently in n-body simulations ofcdm. we therefore conclude that the fundamental properties of halo formationand evolution are generic to the formation of cosmological halos bygravitational instability and are not limited to hierarchical collapsescenarios or even to gaussian-random-noise initial conditions.

astro-ph;0209216	nonlinear clustering during the cosmic dark ages and its effect on the  21-cm background from minihalos	hydrogen atoms inside virialized minihalos generate a radiation backgroundfrom redshifted 21-cm line emission whose angular fluctuations reflectclustering during before and during reionization. we have shown elsewhere thatthis emission may be detectable with the planned low frequency array (lofar)and square kilometer array (ska) in a flat lambdacdm. this is a direct probe ofstructure during the ``dark ages'' at redshifts z&gt;6 and down to smaller scalesthan have previously been constrained. in our original calculation, we used astandard approximation known as the ``linear bias'' [e.g. mo &amp; white (1996)].here we improve upon that treatment by considering the effect of nonlinearclustering. to accomplish this, we develop a new analytical method forcalculating the nonlinear eulerian bias of halos, which should be useful forother applications as well. predictions of this method are compared with theresults of lambdacdm n-body simulations, showing significantly better agreementthan the standard linear bias approximation. when applied to the 21-cmbackground from minihalos, our formalism predicts fluctuations that differ fromour original predictions by up to 30% at low frequencies and small scales.however, within the range of frequencies and angular scales at which the signalcould be observable by lofar and ska as currently planned, the differences aresmall and our original predictions prove robust. our results indicate thatwhile a smaller frequency bandwidth of observation leads to a higher signalthat is more sensitive to nonlinear effects, this effect is counteracted by thelowered sensitivity of the radio arrays. we calculate the best frequencybandwidth for these observations to be delta nu~2 mhz.(abbreviated)

astro-ph;0302336	density profiles of dark halos from their mass accretion histories	we use the universal mass accretion history recently reported for simulationsof halo formation in the cold dark matter model (cdm) to analyze the formationand growth of a single halo. we derive the time-dependent density profile threedifferent ways, based upon three approximations of successively greaterrealism: equilibrium, radial orbits, and a fluid approximation. for theequilibrium model, the density profile is well-fit by either an nfw or mooreprofile over a limited range of radii and scale factors. for the radial orbitmodel, we find profiles which are generally steeper than the nfw profile, withan inner logarithmic slope approaching -2, consistent with a purely radialcollisionless system. in the fluid approximation, we find good agreement withthe nfw and moore profiles for radii resolved by n-body simulations (r/r_200 &gt;0.01), and an evolution of concentration parameter nearly identical to thatfound in n-body simulations. the evolving structure of cosmological halos istherefore best understood as the effect of a time-varying rate of mass infallon a smoothly distributed, isotropic, collisionless fluid.

astro-ph;0305174	gravitational lensing by cdm halos: singular versus nonsingular profiles	the gravitational lensing properties of cosmological halos depend upon themass distribution within each halo. the description of halos as nonsingular,truncated isothermal spheres, a particular solution of the isothermallane-emden equation (suitably modified for lambda nonzero), has proved to be auseful approximation for the halos which form from realistic initial conditionsin a cdm universe. the nonsingular tis model reproduces many of thequantitative features of the n-body results for cdm halos, except in the verycenter, where cdm n-body halos show density profiles which vary as rho ~r^(-alpha), alpha&gt;1, instead of a small flat core. possible discrepanciesbetween these cuspy halo predictions of the cdm n-body simulations andobservations of the inner mass profiles of dwarf and lsb disk galaxies basedupon their rotation curves and of clusters based upon strong lensingmeasurements have led to a search for other diagnostics. a description of thelensing by tis halos would be useful in this regard, as a self-consistent modelfor cdm halos in a proper cosmological context, nonsingular but otherwiseconsistent with the cdm n-body results. we derive here the basic lensingproperties of individual tis halos. for comparison, we also consider threesingular profiles: the navarro-frenk-white density profile, the singularisothermal sphere, and the schwarzschild lens. for all profiles, we compute thecritical curves and caustics, the image separation, the magnification andbrightness ratio, the shear, the time delay, and the average shear inside thetidal radius. this provides tools for studying the statistical properties oflensing by tis and other lenses in the context of a theory of cosmologicalstructure formation.

astro-ph;0408408	minihalo photoevaporation during cosmic reionization: evaporation times  and photon consumption rates	the weak, r-type ionization fronts (i-fronts) which swept across theintergalactic medium (igm) during the reionization of the universe often foundtheir paths blocked by cosmological minihaloes. when this happened, the neutralgas which filled each minihalo was photoevaporated; as the i-front burned itsway through the halo, decelerating from r-type to d-type, all the gas was blownback into the igm as an ionized, supersonic wind. in a previous paper (shapiro,iliev and raga 2004), we described this process and presented our results ofthe first simulations of it by numerical gas dynamics with radiation transportin detail. for illustration we focused on the particular case of a 10^7 solarmasses minihalo overrun at z=9 by an intergalactic i-front caused by a distantsource of ionizing radiation, for different source spectra (either stellar frommassive pop. ii or iii stars, or qso-like) and a flux level typical of thatexpected during reionization. in a lambdacdm universe, minihaloes formed inabundance before and during reionization and, thus, their photoevaporation isan important, possibly dominant, feature of reionization, which slowed it downand wasted ionizing photons. we have now performed a larger set ofhigh-resolution simulations to determine and quantify the dependence ofminihalo photoevaporation times and photon consumption rates on halo mass,redshift, ionizing flux level and spectrum. we find that the average number ofionizing photons each minihalo atom absorbs during its photoevaporation istypically in the range 2-10. for the collapsed fraction in minihaloes expectedduring reionization, this can add about 1 photon per total atom to therequirements for completing reionization, potentially doubling the minimumnumber of photons required to reionize the universe.

astro-ph;0411035	the impact of small-scale structure on cosmological ionization fronts  and reionization	the propagation of cosmological ionization fronts during the reionization ofthe universe is strongly influenced by small-scale gas inhomogeneities due tostructure formation. these inhomogeneities include both collapsed minihalos,which are generally self-shielding, and lower-density structures, which arenot. the minihalos are dense and sufficiently optically-thick to trapintergalactic ionization fronts, blocking their path and robbing them ofionizing photons until the minihalo gas is expelled as an evaporative wind. thelower-density structures do not trap these fronts, but they can slow them downby increasing the overall recombination rate in the intergalactic medium. inthis paper we study the effects of both types of inhomogeneities, includingnonlinear clustering effects, and we find that both igm clumping and collapsedminihalos have significant yet qualitatively different impacts on reionization.while the number density of minihalos on average increases strongly with time,the density of minihalos inside h ii regions around ionizing sources is largelyconstant. thus the impact of minihalos is essentially to decrease the number ofionizing photons available to the igm at all epochs, which is equivalent to areduction in the luminosity of each source. on the other hand, the effect ofigm clumping increases strongly with time, slowing down reionization andextending it. thus while the impact of minihalos is largely degenerate with theunknown source efficiency, igm clumping can help significantly in reconcilingthe recent observations of cosmic microwave background polarization with quasarabsorption spectra at z~6, which together point to an early but extendedreionization epoch.

astro-ph;0512010	the cosmic reionization history as revealed by the cmb doppler--21-cm  correlation	we show that the epoch(s) of reionization when the ionization fraction of theuniverse is about half can be determined by correlating cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) temperature maps with 21-cm line maps at degree scales ($l\sim100$). during reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces thedoppler anisotropy of the cmb, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogeninduce the 21-cm line anisotropy. in our simplified model of inhomogeneousreionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas anegative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlationprovides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained bypresently. the signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 mpc^-1) wherelinear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionizationis averaged out. since the doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) inredshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.furthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,especially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: thisis analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the cmb being moreimmune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. therefore, weargue that the doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detectedsignals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides thestrongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin. we show thatthe square kilometer array can easily measure the predicted correlation signalfor 1~year of survey observation.

astro-ph;0512516	the 21 centimeter background from the cosmic dark ages: minihalos and  the intergalactic medium before reionization	the h atoms inside minihalos (i.e. halos with virial temperatures t_vir &lt;10^4 k, in the mass range roughly from 10^4 m_sun to 10^8 m_sun) during thecosmic dark ages in a lambdacdm universe produce a redshifted background ofcollisionally-pumped 21-cm line radiation which can be seen in emissionrelative to the cosmic microwave background (cmb). previously, we usedsemi-analytical calculations of the 21-cm signal from individual halos ofdifferent mass and redshift and the evolving mass function of minihalos topredict the mean brightness temperature of this 21-cm background and itsangular fluctuations. here we use high-resolution cosmological n-body andhydrodynamic simulations of structure formation at high redshift (z&gt;8) tocompute the mean brightness temperature of this background from both minihalosand the intergalactic medium (igm) prior to the onset of ly-alpha radiativepumping. we find that the 21-cm signal from gas in collapsed, virializedminihalos dominates over that from the diffuse shocked gas in the igm.

astro-ph;0603199	cosmological radiative transfer codes comparison project i: the static  density field tests	radiative transfer simulations are now at the forefront of numericalastrophysics. they are becoming crucial for an increasing number ofastrophysical and cosmological problems; at the same time their computationalcost has come to the reach of currently available computational power. furtherprogress is retarded by the considerable number of different algorithms(including various flavours of ray-tracing and moment schemes) developed, whichmakes the selection of the most suitable technique for a given problem anon-trivial task. assessing the validity ranges, accuracy and performances ofthese schemes is the main aim of this paper, for which we have compared 11independent rt codes on 5 test problems: (0) basic physics, (1) isothermal h iiregion expansion and (2) h ii region expansion with evolving temperature, (3)i-front trapping and shadowing by a dense clump, (4) multiple sources in acosmological density field. the outputs of these tests have been compared anddifferences analyzed. the agreement between the various codes is satisfactoryalthough not perfect. the main source of discrepancy appears to reside in themulti-frequency treatment approach, resulting in different thicknesses of theionized-neutral transition regions and different temperature structure. thepresent results and tests represent the most complete benchmark available forthe development of new codes and improvement of existing ones. to this aim alltest inputs and outputs are made publicly available in digital form.

astro-ph;0604447	implications of wmap 3 year data for the sources of reionization	new results on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) andits polarization based on the first 3 years of data from the wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe (wmap) have revised the electron scattering opticaldepth downward from tau_es=0.17+0.08-0.07 to tau_es=0.09+/-0.03. this implies ashift of the effective reionization redshift from z_r~17 to z_r~11. previousattempts to explain the high redshift of reionization inferred from the wmap 1year data have led to widespread speculation that the sources of reionizationmust have been much more efficient than those associated with the starformation observed at low redshift. this is consistent, for example, with thesuggestion that early star formation involved massive, population iii starsthat early on produced most of the ionizing radiation escaping from halos. itis therefore tempting to interpret the new wmap results as implying that we cannow relax those previous high demands on the efficiency of the sources ofreionization and perhaps even turn the argument around as evidence against suchhigh efficiency. we show that this is not the case, however. the new wmapresults also find that the primordial density fluctuation power spectrum has alower amplitude, sigma_8, and departs substantially from the scale-invariantspectrum. we show that these effects combine to cancel the impact of the laterreionization implied by the new value of tau_es on the required ionizingefficiency per collapsed baryon. the delay of reionization is surprisingly wellmatched by a comparable delay (by a factor of ~1.4 in scale factor) in theformation of the halos responsible for reionization.

astro-ph;0607209	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from patchy reionization: the view  from the simulations	we present the first calculation of the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect due to the inhomogeneus reionization of the universe based on detailedlarge-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization. the resulting skypower spectra peak at l=2000-8000 with maximum values ofl(l+1)c_l/(2pi)_{max}~4-7x10^{-13}. the scale roughly corresponds to thetypical ionized bubble sizes observed in our simulations, of ~5-20 mpc. the kszanisotropy signal from reionization dominates the primary cmb signal abovel=3000. at large scales the patchy ksz signal depends only on the sourceefficiencies. it is higher when sources are more efficient at producingionizing photons, since such sources produce larger ionized regions, onaverage, than less efficient sources. the introduction of sub-grid gas clumpingin the radiative transfer simulations produce significantly more power at smallscales, but has little effect at large scales. the patchy reionization kszsignal is dominated by the post-reionization signal from fully-ionized gas, butthe two contributions are of similar order at scales l~3000-10^4, indicatingthat the ksz anisotropies from reionization are an important component of thetotal ksz signal at these scales.

astro-ph;0607517	self-regulated reionization	recently, we have presented the first large-scale radiative transfersimulations of reionization. here we present new simulations which extend thesource halo mass range downward to 10^8m_solar, to capture the full range ofhalo masses thought to be primarily responsible for reionization by their starformation following atomic hydrogen radiative cooling and gravitationalcollapse. haloes below about 10^9m_solar, however, are subject to jeans-massfiltering in the ionized regions, which suppresses their baryonic content andtheir ability to release ionizing radiation. by including these smaller-masshaloes but accounting for their suppression, too, we find that reionization is``self-regulating,'' as follows. as the mean ionized fraction rises, so doesthe fraction of the volume within which suppression occurs. hence, the degreeof suppression is related to the mean ionized fraction. since low-mass haloeswith high emissivity achieve a given mean ionized fraction earlier than dothose with low efficiency, jeans-mass filtering compensates for the differencein the emissivity of the suppressible haloes in these two cases. as a result,in the presence of lower-mass source haloes, reionization begins earlier, butthe later stages of reionization and the time of overlap are dictated by theefficiency of the higher-mass haloes, independent of the efficiency of thesuppressible, lower-mass haloes. reionization histories consistent with currentobservational constraints are shown to be achievable with standard stellarsources in haloes above 10^8m_solar. neither minihalos nor exotic sources arerequired, and the phenomenon of ``double reionization'' previously suggesteddoes not occur.

astro-ph;0607642	does radiative feedback by the first stars promote or prevent second  generation star formation?	we study the effect of starlight from the first stars on the ability of otherminihaloes in their neighborhood to form additional stars. the question of whatthe dynamical consequences were for these target minihaloes, of their exposureto the ionizing and dissociating starlight from the pop iii star requires afull radiation-hydrodynamics calculation. towards this end, we have performed aseries of detailed, 1d, radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. we have variedthe distance to the source (and, hence, the flux) and the mass and evolutionarystage of the target haloes to quantify this effect. we find: (1) trapping ofthe i-front and its transformation from r-type to d-type, preceded by a shockfront; (2) photoevaporation of the ionized gas (i.e. all gas originally locatedoutside the trapping radius); (3) formation of an h_2 precursor shell whichleads the i-front, stimulated by partial photoionization; and (4) theshock-induced formation of h_2 in the minihalo neutral core when the shockspeeds up and partially ionizes the gas. the fate of the neutral core is mostlydetermined by the response of the core to this shock front, which leads tomolecular cooling and collapse that, when compared to the same halo withoutexternal radiation, is either: (a) expedited, (b) delayed, (c) unaltered, or(d) reversed or prevented, depending upon the flux (i.e. distance to thesource) and the halo mass and evolutionary stage. roughly speaking, most haloesthat were destined to cool, collapse, and form stars in the absence of externalradiation are found to do so even when exposed to the first pop iii star intheir neighborhood, while those that would not have done so are still not ableto.

astro-ph;0609592	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from radiative transfer  simulations of patchy reionization	we present the first calculation of the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect due to the inhomogeneous reionization of the universe based on detailedlarge-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization. the resulting skypower spectra peak at l=2000-8000 with maximum values ofl^2c_l~1\times10^{-12}. the peak scale is determined by the typical size of theionized regions and roughly corresponds to the ionized bubble sizes observed inour simulations, ~5-20 mpc. the ksz anisotropy signal from reionizationdominates the primary cmb signal above l=3000. this predicted ksz signal atarcminute scales is sufficiently strong to be detectable by upcomingexperiments, like the atacama cosmology telescope and south pole telescopewhich are expected to have ~1' resolution and ~muk sensitivity. the extendedand patchy nature of the reionization process results in a boost of the peaksignal in power by approximately one order of magnitude compared to a uniformreionization scenario, while roughly tripling the signal compared with thatbased upon the assumption of gradual but spatially uniform reionization. atlarge scales the patchy ksz signal depends largely on the ionizing sourceefficiencies and the large-scale velocity fields: sources which produce photonsmore efficiently yield correspondingly higher signals. the introduction ofsub-grid gas clumping in the radiative transfer simulations producessignificantly more power at small scales, and more non-gaussian features, buthas little effect at large scales. the patchy nature of the reionizationprocess roughly doubles the total observed ksz signal for l~3000-10^4 comparedto non-patchy scenarios with the same total electron-scattering optical depth.

astro-ph;0702099	current models of the observable consequences of cosmic reionization and  their detectability	a number of large current experiments aim to detect the signatures of thecosmic reionization at redshifts z&gt;6. their success depends crucially onunderstanding the character of the reionization process and its observableconsequences and designing the best strategies to use. we use large-scalesimulations of cosmic reionization to evaluate the reionization signatures atredshifted 21-cm and small-scale cmb anisotropies in the best current model forthe background universe, with fundamental cosmological parameters given by wmap3-year results (wmap3). we find that the optimal frequency range for observingthe ``global step'' of the 21-cm emission is 120-150 mhz, while statisticalstudies should aim at 140-160 mhz, observable by gmrt. somestrongly-nongaussian brightness features should be detectable at frequencies upto ~190 mhz. in terms of sensitivity-signal trade-off relatively lowresolutions, corresponding to beams of at least a few arcminutes, arepreferable. the cmb anisotropy signal from the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect from reionized patches peaks at tens of muk at arcminute scales and hasan rms of ~1 muk, and should be observable by the atacama cosmology telescopeand the south pole telescope. we discuss the various observational issues andthe uncertainties involved, mostly related to the poorly-known reionizationparameters and, to a lesser extend, to the uncertainties in the backgroundcosmology.

astro-ph;0703199	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56: faster than the speeding bullet?	shock waves driven in the intergalactic medium during the merging of galaxyclusters have been observed in x-ray imaging and spectroscopy. fluid motionsinferred from the shock strength and morphology can be compared to the colddark matter (cdm) distribution inferred from gravitational lensing. a detailedreconstruction of the cdm kinematics, however, must take into account thenontrivial response of the fluid intracluster medium to the collisionless cdmmotions. we have carried out two-dimensional simulations of gas dynamics incluster collisions. we analyze the relative motion of the clusters, the bowshock wave, and the contact discontinuity and relate these to x-ray data. wefocus on the "bullet cluster," 1e 0657-56, a near head-on collision ofunequal-mass clusters, for which the gas density and temperature jumps acrossthe prominent bow shock imply a high shock velocity 4,700 km/s. the velocity ofthe fluid shock has been widely interpreted as the relative velocity of the cdmcomponents. this need not be the case, however. an illustrative simulationfinds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16% lower thanthat of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to the detailed initialmass and gas density profile of the colliding clusters, such a decrease of theinferred halo relative velocity would increase the likelihood of finding 1e0657-56 in a lambdacdm universe.

astro-ph;9512078	adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics: methodology ii	this paper presents an alternative formulation of the asph algorithm forevolving anisotropic smoothing kernels, in which the geometric approach ofshapiro et al. (1996; paper i) is replaced by an approach involving a localtransformation of coordinates to those in which the underlying anisotropicvolume changes appear to be isotropic. the asph method is presented in 2d and3d, including a number of details not previously included in paper i, some ofwhich represent either advances or different choices with respect to paper i.among the advances included here are an asynchronous time-integration schemewith different time steps for different particles and the generalization of theasph method to 3d. the shock-tracking algorithm described in paper i forlocally adapting the artificial viscosity to restrict viscous heating just toparticles encountering shocks, is not included here. instead, we adopt adifferent interpolation kernel for use with the artificial viscosity, which hasthe effect of spatially localizing effects of the artificial viscosity. thisversion of the asph method in 2d and 3d is then applied to a series of 1d, 2d,and 3d test problems, and the results are compared to those of standard sphapplied to the same problems. these include the problem of cosmological pancakecollapse, the riemann shock tube, cylindrical and spherical sedov blast waves,the collision of two strong shocks, and problems involving shearing disksintended to test the angular momentum conservation properties of the method.these results further support the idea that asph has significantly betterresolving power than standard sph for a wide range of problems, including thatof cosmological structure formation.

astro-ph;9610228	gravitational instability in collisionless cosmological pancakes	the gravitational instability of cosmological pancakes composed ofcollisionless dark matter in an einstein-de sitter universe is investigatednumerically to demonstrate that pancakes are unstable with respect tofragmentation and the formation of filaments. a ``pancake'' is defined here asthe nonlinear outcome of the growth of a 1d, sinusoidal, plane-wave, adiabaticdensity perturbation. we have used high resolution, 2d, n-body simulations bythe particle-mesh (pm) method to study the response of pancakes to perturbationby either symmetric (density) or antisymmetric (bending or rippling) modes,with corresponding wavevectors k_s and k_a transverse to the wavevector k_p ofthe unperturbed pancake plane-wave. we consider dark matter which is initially``cold'' (i.e. with no random thermal velocity in the initial conditions). wealso investigate the effect of a finite, random, isotropic, initial velocitydispersion (i.e. initial thermal velocity) on the fate of pancake collapse andinstability. pancakes are shown to be gravitationally unstable with respect toall perturbations of wavelength l&lt;l_p (where l_p= 2pi/k_p). these results arein contradiction with the expectations of an approximate, thin-sheet energyargument.

astro-ph;9701099	likely values of the cosmological constant	in theories in which the cosmological constant lambda takes a variety ofvalues in different ``subuniverses,'' the probability distribution of itsobserved values is conditioned by the requirement that there must be someone tomeasure it. this probability is proportional to the fraction of matter which isdestined to condense out of the background into mass concentrations largeenough to form observers. we calculate this ``collapsed fraction'' by a simple,pressure-free, spherically symmetric, nonlinear model for the growth of densityfluctuations in a flat universe with arbitrary value of the cosmologicalconstant, applied in a statistical way to the observed spectrum of densityfluctuations at recombination. from this, the probability distribution for thevacuum energy density rho_v=lambda/8pi g for gaussian random densityfluctuations is derived analytically. it is shown that the results depend ononly one quantity, sigma^3 rho, where sigma^2 and rho are the variance and meanvalue of the fluctuating matter density field at recombination, respectively.to calculate sigma, we adopt the flat cdm model with nonzero cosmologicalconstant and fix the amplitude and shape of the primordial power spectrum inaccordance with data on cosmic microwave background anisotropy from the cobesatellite dmr experiment. a comparison of the results of this calculation ofthe likely values of rho_v with present observational bounds on thecosmological constant indicates that the small, positive value of rho_v (up to3 times greater than the present cosmic mass density) suggested recently byseveral lines of evidence is a reasonably likely value to observe, even if allvalues of rho_v are equally likely a priori.

astro-ph;9710119	a convenient set of comoving cosmological variables and their  application	we present a set of cosmological variables, called "supercomoving variables,"which are particularly useful for describing the gas dynamics of cosmicstructure formation. for ideal gas with gamma=5/3, the supercomoving position,velocity, density, temperature, and pressure are constant in time in a uniform,isotropic, adiabatically expanding universe. expressed in terms of thesesupercomoving variables, the cosmological fluid conservation equations and thepoisson equation closely resemble their noncosmological counterparts. thismakes it possible to generalize noncosmological results and techniques tocosmological problems, for a wide range of cosmological models. these variableswere initially introduced by shandarin for matter-dominated models only. wegeneralize supercomoving variables to models with a uniform componentcorresponding to a nonzero cosmological constant, domain walls, cosmic strings,a nonclumping form of nonrelativistic matter (e.g. massive nettrinos), orradiation. each model is characterized by the value of the density parameteromega0 of the nonrelativistic matter component in which density fluctuation ispossible, and the density parameter omegax of the additional, nonclumpingcomponent. for each type of nonclumping background, we identify families withinwhich different values of omega0 and omegax lead to fluid equations andsolutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of omega0 andomegax. we also include the effects of heating, radiative cooling, thermalconduction, viscosity, and magnetic fields. as an illustration, we describe 3familiar cosmological problems in supercomoving variables: the growth of lineardensity fluctuations, the nonlinear collapse of a 1d plane-wave densityfluctuation leading to pancake formation, and the zel'dovich approximation.

astro-ph;9810164	a model for the postcollapse equilibrium of cosmological structure:  truncated isothermal spheres from top-hat density perturbations	the postcollapse structure of objects which form by gravitationalcondensation out of the expanding cosmological background universe is a keyelement in the theory of galaxy formation. towards this end, we havereconsidered the outcome of the nonlinear growth of a uniform, sphericaldensity perturbation in an unperturbed background universe - the cosmological``top-hat'' problem. we adopt the usual assumption that the collapse toinfinite density at a finite time predicted by the top-hat solution isinterrupted by a rapid virialization caused by the growth of small-scaleinhomogeneities in the initial perturbation. we replace the standarddescription of the postcollapse object as a uniform sphere in virialequilibrium by a more self-consistent one as a truncated, nonsingular,isothermal sphere in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium, including for thefirst time a proper treatment of the finite-pressure boundary condition on thesphere. the results differ significantly from both the uniform sphere and thesingular isothermal sphere approximations for the postcollapse objects. theseresults will have a significant effect on a wide range of applications of thepress-schechter and other semi-analytical models to cosmology. the truncatedisothermal sphere solution presented here predicts the virial temperature andintegrated mass distribution of the x-ray clusters formed in the cdm model asfound by detailed, 3d, numerical gas and n-body dynamical simulationsremarkably well. this solution allows us to derive analytically thenumerically-calibrated mass-temperature and radius-temperature scaling laws forx-ray clusters which were derived empirically by evrard, metzler and navarrofrom simulation results for the cdm model.

astro-ph;9903425	the asymptotic collapsed fraction in an eternal universe	we calculate the maximum fraction of matter which is able to condense out ofthe expanding background universe, for any universe which will expand forever.we use a simple spherical model for the growth of density fluctuations in theuniverse. this model includes open, matter-dominated universe and universes inwhich there is an uniform background component (e.g. the cosmological constantor "quintessence"). in these background universes, omega eventually dropssignificantly below unity. when this happens, gravitational instability issuppressed and, with it, so is the growth of the collapsed fraction.  we identify a limitation of the press-schechter (ps) approximation. in thisapproximation, the mass function determined from the predicted collapse ofoverdense regions is multiplied by a correction factor of 2, assuming that eachbound fluctuation will accrete an equal share of mass from nearby underdenseregions. our model determines the actual value of the correction factor. weshow that, while the factor of 2 adopted by the ps approximation is correct foran einstein-de sitter universe, it is not correct when the freeze-out offluctuation growth inherent in the more general class of background universesdescribed above occurs. when freeze-out occurs, the correction factor reducesto unity and the ps approximation must overestimate the collapsed fraction.  we apply our model to open cdm and flat lambda-cdm models. for h0=70 andomega0=0.3, these models yield asymptotic collapsed fractions of 0.0361 and0.0562, respectively, on the galaxy cluster mass-scale, only 55% of the valuesdetermined by the ps approximation. these results have implications for the useof the latter approximation to compare the observed space density of x-rayclusters today with that predicted by cosmological models.

astro-ph;9904121	explosions during galaxy formation. scale-free simulations	when density fluctuations collapse gravitationally out of the expandingcosmological background universe to form galaxies, the secondary energy releasewhich results can affect their subsequent evolution profoundly. we focus hereon the effects of one form of such energy release - explosions, such as mightresult from the supernovae which end the lives of the first generation ofmassive stars to form inside protogalaxies. we are particularly interested inthe consequences of the nonspherical geometry and continuous infall which arecharacteristic of galaxy formation from realistic initial and boundaryconditions. as an idealized model which serves to illustrate and quantify theimportance of these effects, we study the effect of explosions on thequasi-spherical objects which form at the intersections of filaments in theplane of a cosmological pancake, as a result of gravitational instability andfragmentation of the pancake. we study the formation and evolution of these"galaxies," subject to the explosive injection of energy at their centers, bynumerical gas dynamical simulation in 3d utilizing our new, anisotropic versionof smoothed particle hydrodynamics, adaptive sph ("asph"), with a p3m gravitysolver.
