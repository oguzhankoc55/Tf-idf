(i) the shock velocity, the post-shocktemperature and the gas cooling timescale depend on the preshock gas density.the collision velocity is the shock velocity in the low density volume fillingintercloud gas. this produces a ~ 5 10^6 k, dust-free, x-ray emitting plasma.the shock velocity is smaller in clouds. we show that gas heated totemperatures less than 10^6 k cools, keeps its dust content and becomes h2within the sq collision age (~ 5 10^6 years). (ii) since the bulk kineticenergy of the h2 gas is the dominant energy reservoir, we consider that the h2emission is powered by the dissipation of kinetic turbulent energy. (abridged)

0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0707.0896	shocked molecular hydrogen in the 3c 326 radio galaxy system	the spitzer spectrum of the giant fr ii radio galaxy 3c 326 is dominated byvery strong molecular hydrogen emission lines on a faint ir continuum. the h2emission originates in the northern component of a double-galaxy systemassociated with 3c 326. the integrated luminosity in h2 pure-rotational linesis 8.0e41 erg/s, which corresponds to 17% of the 8-70 micron luminosity of thegalaxy. a wide range of temperatures (125-1000 k) is measured from the h2 0-0s(0)-s(7) transitions, leading to a warm h2 mass of 1.1e9 msun. low-excitationionic forbidden emission lines are consistent with an optical linerclassification for the active nucleus, which is not luminous enough to powerthe observed h2 emission. the h2 could be shock-heated by the radio jets, butthere is no direct indication of this. more likely, the h2 is shock-heated in atidal accretion flow induced by interaction with the southern companion galaxy.the latter scenario is supported by an irregular morphology, tidal bridge, andpossible tidal tail imaged with irac at 3-9 micron. unlike ulirgs, which insome cases exhibit h2 line luminosities of comparable strength, 3c 326 showslittle star-formation activity (~0.1 msun/yr). this may represent an importantstage in galaxy evolution. starburst activity and efficient accretion onto thecentral supermassive black hole may be delayed until the shock-heated h2 cankinematically settle and cool

0912.0282	powerful h$_2$ line-cooling in stephan's quintet : i - mapping the  significant cooling pathways in group-wide shocks	we present results from the mid-infrared spectral mapping of stephan'squintet using the spitzer space telescope. a 1000 km/s collision has produced agroup-wide shock and for the first time the large-scale distribution of warmmolecular hydrogen emission is revealed, as well as its close association withknown shock structures. in the main shock region alone we find 5.0$\times10^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$ of warm h$_2$ spread over $\sim$ 480 kpc$^2$ andadditionally report the discovery of a second major shock-excited h$_2$feature. this brings the total h$_2$ line luminosity of the group in excess of10$^42$ erg/s. in the main shock, the h$_2$ line luminosity exceeds, by afactor of three, the x-ray luminosity from the hot shocked gas, confirming thatthe h$_2$-cooling pathway dominates over the x-ray. [si ii]34.82$\mu$memission, detected at a luminosity of 1/10th of that of the h$_2$, appears totrace the group-wide shock closely and in addition, we detect weak[feii]25.99$\mu$m emission from the most x-ray luminous part of the shock.comparison with shock models reveals that this emission is consistent withregions of fast shocks (100 &lt; $v_{s}$ &lt; 300 km/s) experiencing depletion ofiron and silicon onto dust grains. star formation in the shock (as traced viaionic lines, pah and dust emission) appears in the intruder galaxy, but moststrikingly at either end of the radio shock. the shock ridge itself showslittle star formation, consistent with a model in which the tremendous h$_{2}$power is driven by turbulent energy transfer from motions in a post-shockedlayer. the significance of the molecular hydrogen lines over other measuredsources of cooling in fast galaxy-scale shocks may have crucial implicationsfor the cooling of gas in the assembly of the first galaxies.

1004.0677	observations and modeling of the dust emission from the h2-bright  galaxy-wide shock in stephan's quintet	spitzer space telescope observations revealed powerful mid-infrared (mid-ir)h2 rotational line emission from the stephan's quintet (sq) x-ray emittinglarge scale shock associated with a collision between two galaxies. because h2forms on dust grains, the presence of h2 is physically linked to the survivalof dust, and we expect some dust emission to come from the molecular gas. totest this interpretation, ir observations and dust modeling are used toidentify and characterize the thermal dust emission from the shocked moleculargas. the spatial distribution of the ir emission allows us to isolate the faintpah and dust continuum emission associated with the molecular gas in the sqshock. we model the spectral energy distribution (sed) of this emission, andfit it to spitzer observations. faint pah and dust continuum emission aredetected in the sq shock, outside star-forming regions. the 12/24um flux ratioin the shock is remarkably close to that of the diffuse galactic interstellarmedium, leading to a galactic pah/vsg abundance ratio. however, the propertiesof the pah emission spectrum in the shock differ from that of the galaxy, whichmay suggest an enhanced fraction of large and neutrals pahs. the ir sed isconsistent with the expected emission from dust associated with the warm(&gt;150k) h2 gas, heated by a uv radiation field of intensity comparable to thatof the solar neighborhood, in agreement with galex uv observations. thepresence of pahs and dust grains in the high-speed (1000km/s) galaxy collisionsuggests that dust survives. we propose that the dust that survived destructionwas in pre-shock gas at densites larger than a few 0.1cm-3, which was notshocked at velocities larger than 200km/s.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1009.0038	the spatial extent of (u)lirgs in the mid-infrared i: the continuum  emission	we present an analysis of the extended mid-infrared (mir) emission of thegreat observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) sample based on 5-15um lowresolution spectra obtained with the irs on spitzer. we calculate the fractionof extended emission as a function of wavelength for the galaxies in thesample, fee_lambda. we can identify 3 general types of fee_lambda: one where itis constant, one where features due to emission lines and pahs appear moreextended than the continuum, and a third which is characteristic of sourceswith deep silicate absorption at 9.7um. more than 30% of the galaxies have amedian fee_lambda larger than 0.5 implying that at least half of their miremission is extended. luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) display a wide rangeof fee in their warm dust continuum (0&lt;=fee_13.2um&lt;=0.85). the large values offee_13.2um that we find in many lirgs suggest that their extended mir continuumemission originates in scales up to 10kpc. the mean size of the lirg cores at13.2um is 2.6kpc. however, once the lir of the systems reaches the threshold of~10^11.8lsun, all sources become clearly more compact, with fee_13.2um&lt;=0.2,and their cores are unresolved. our estimated upper limit for the core size ofulirgs is less than 1.5kpc. the analysis indicates that the compactness ofsystems with lir&gt;~10^11.25lsun strongly increases in those classified asmergers in their final stage of interaction. the fee_13.2um is also related tothe contribution of an active galactic nucleus (agn) to the mir. galaxies whichare more agn-dominated are less extended, independently of their lir. wefinally find that the extent of the mir continuum emission is correlated withthe far-ir iras log(f_60um/f_100um) color. this enables us to place a lowerlimit to the area in a galaxy from where the cold dust emission may originate,a prediction which can be tested soon with the herschel space telescope.

1010.2201	star formation in collision debris: insights from the modeling of their  spectral energy distribution	during galaxy-galaxy interactions, massive gas clouds can be injected intothe intergalactic medium which in turn become gravitationally bound, collapseand form stars, star clusters or even dwarf galaxies. the objects resultingfrom this process are both "pristine", as they are forming their firstgeneration of stars, and chemically evolved because the metallicity inheritedfrom their parent galaxies is high. such characteristics make them particularlyinteresting laboratories to study star formation. after having investigatedtheir star-forming properties, we use photospheric, nebular and dust modelingto analyze here their spectral energy distribution (sed) from thefar-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared regime for a sample of 7 star-formingregions. our analysis confirms that the intergalactic star forming regions instephan's quintet, around arp 105, and ngc 5291, appear devoid of stellarpopulations older than 10^9 years. we also find an excess of light in thenear-infrared regime (from 2 to 4.5 microns) which cannot be attributed tostellar photospheric or nebular contributions. this excess is correlated withthe star formation rate intensity suggesting that it is probably due toemission by very small grains fluctuating in temperature as well as thepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) line at 3.3 micron. comparing theattenuation via the balmer decrement to the mid-infrared emission allows us tocheck the reliability of the attenuation estimate. it suggests the presence ofembedded star forming regions in ngc 5291 and ngc 7252. overall the sed ofstar-forming regions in collision debris (and tidal dwarf galaxies) resemblemore that of dusty star-forming regions in galactic disks than to that oftypical star-forming dwarf galaxies.

1203.4203	detection of powerful mid-ir h2 emission in the bridge between the taffy  galaxies	we report the detection of strong, resolved emission from warm h2 in thetaffy galaxies and bridge. relative to the continuum and faint pah emission,the h2 emission is the strongest in the connecting bridge, approachingl(h2)/l(pah8{\mu}m) = 0.1 between the two galaxies, where the purely rotationallines of h2 dominate the mid-infrared spectrum in a way very reminiscent of thegroup-wide shock in the interacting group stephan's quintet. the surfacebrightness in the 0-0 s(0) and s(1) h2 lines in the bridge is more than twicethat observed at the center of the stephan's quintet shock. we observe a warmh2 mass of 4.2 \times 108 m\odot in the bridge, but taking into account theunobserved bridge area, the total warm mass is likely to be twice this value.we use excitation diagrams to characterize the warm molecular gas, finding anaverage surface mass of 5 \times 106 m\odot kpc-2 and typical excitationtemperatures of 150-175 k. h2 emission is also seen in the galaxy disks,although there the emission is more consistent with normal star forminggalaxies. we investigate several possible heating mechanisms for the bridgegas, but favor the conversion of kinetic energy from the head-on collision viaturbulence and shocks as the main heating source. since the cooling time forthe warm h2 is short (5000 yr), shocks must be permeating the molecular gas inbridge region in order to continue heating the h2.

1204.0554	a study of heating and cooling of the ism in ngc 1097 with herschel-pacs  and spitzer-irs	ngc 1097 is a nearby seyfert 1 galaxy with a bright circumnuclear starburstring, a strong large-scale bar and an active nucleus. we present a detailedstudy of the spatial variation of the far infrared (fir) [cii]158um and[oi]63um lines and mid-infrared h2 emission lines as tracers of gas cooling,and of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) bands as tracers of thephotoelectric heating, using herschel-pacs, and spitzer-irs infrared spectralmaps. we focus on the nucleus and the ring, and two star forming regions (enucn and enuc s). we estimated a photoelectric gas heating efficiency([cii]158um+[oi]63um)/pah in the ring about 50% lower than in enuc n and s. theaverage 11.3/7.7um pah ratio is also lower in the ring, which may suggest alarger fraction of ionized pahs, but no clear correlation with[cii]158{\mu}m/pah(5.5 - 14um) is found. pahs in the ring are responsible for afactor of two more [cii]158um and [oi]63um emission per unit mass than pahs inthe enuc s. sed modeling indicates that at most 25% of the fir power in thering and enuc s can come from high intensity photodissociation regions (pdrs),in which case g0 ~ 10^2.3 and nh ~ 10^3.5 cm^-3 in the ring. for these valuesof g0 and nh pdr models cannot reproduce the observed h2 emission. much of thethe h2 emission in the starburst ring could come from warm regions in thediffuse ism that are heated by turbulent dissipation or shocks.

0711.3310	spatially resolved spitzer-irs spectroscopy of the central region of m82	we present high spatial resolution (~ 35 parsec) 5-38 um spectra of thecentral region of m82, taken with the spitzer infrared spectrograph. from thesespectra we determined the fluxes and equivalent widths of key diagnosticfeatures, such as the [neii]12.8um, [neiii]15.5um, and h_2 s(1)17.03um lines,and the broad mid-ir polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features insix representative regions and analysed the spatial distribution of these linesand their ratios across the central region. we find a good correlation of thedust extinction with the co 1-0 emission. the pah emission follows closely theionization structure along the galactic disk. the observed variations of thediagnostic pah ratios across m82 can be explained by extinction effects, withinsystematic uncertainties. the 16-18um pah complex is very prominent, and itsequivalent width is enhanced outwards from the galactic plane. we interpretthis as a consequence of the variation of the uv radiation field. the ews ofthe 11.3um pah feature and the h_2 s(1) line correlate closely, and we concludethat shocks in the outflow regions have no measurable influence on the h_2emission. the [neiii]/[neii] ratio is on average low at ~0.18, and shows littlevariations across the plane, indicating that the dominant stellar population isevolved (5 - 6 myr) and well distributed. there is a slight increase of theratio with distance from the galactic plane of m82 which we attribute to adecrease in gas density. our observations indicate that the star formation ratehas decreased significantly in the last 5 myr. the quantities of dust andmolecular gas in the central area of the galaxy argue against starvation andfor negative feedback processes, observable through the strong extra-planaroutflows.

1301.4549	enhanced warm h2 emission in the compact group mid-infrared "green  valley"	we present results from a spitzer, mid-infrared spectroscopy study of asample of 74 galaxies located in 23 hickson compact groups, chosen to be at adynamically-active stage of hi depletion. we find evidence for enhanced warm h2emission (i.e. above that associated with uv excitation in star-formingregions) in 14 galaxies (~20%), with 8 galaxies having extreme values of l(h2s(0)-s(3))/l(7.7micron pah), in excess of 0.07. such emission has been seenpreviously in the compact group hcg 92 (stephan's quintet), and was shown to beassociated with the dissipation of mechanical energy associated with alarge-scale shock caused when one group member collided, at high velocity, withtidal debris in the intragroup medium. similarly, shock excitation or turbulentheating is likely responsible for the enhanced h2 emission in the compact groupgalaxies, since other sources of heating (uv or x-ray excitation from starformation or agn) are insufficient to account for the observed emission. thegroup galaxies fall predominantly in a region of mid-infrared color-color spaceidentified by previous studies as being connected to rapid transformations inhcg galaxy evolution. furthermore, the majority of h2-enhanced galaxies lie inthe optical "green valley" between the blue cloud and red-sequence, and areprimarily early-type disk systems. we suggest that h2-enhanced systems mayrepresent a specific phase in the evolution of galaxies in dense environmentsand provide new insight into mechanisms which transform galaxies onto theoptical red sequence.

1402.1470	herschel observations of hickson compact groups of galaxies: unveiling  the properties of cold dust	we present a herschel far-ir and sub-mm study of a sample of 120 galaxies in28 hickson compact groups. fitting their uv to sub-mm spectral energydistributions with the model of da cunha et al. (2008), we accurately estimatethe dust masses, luminosities and temperatures of the individual galaxies. wefind that nearly half of the late-type galaxies in dynamically "old" groups,those with more than 25% of early-type members and redder uv-optical colours,have also significantly lower dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to those ofactively star-forming galaxies of the same mass found both in hcgs and thefield. examining their dust-to-gas mass ratios we conclude that dust wasstripped out of these systems as a result of the gravitational and hydrodynamicinteractions, experienced due to previous encounters with other group members.about 40% of the early-type galaxies (mostly lenticulars), in dynamically "old"groups, display dust properties similar to those of the uv-optical redlate-type galaxies. given their stellar masses, star formation rates anduv-optical colours, we suggest that red late-type and dusty lenticular galaxiesrepresent transition populations between blue star-forming disk galaxies andquiescent early-type ellipticals. [...abridged...] our deep herschelobservations also allow us to detect the presence of diffuse cold intragroupdust in 4 hcgs. we also find that the fraction of 250micron emission which islocated outside of the main bodies of the red late-type galaxies as well as ofthe dusty lenticulars is 15-20% of their integrated emission at this band. allthese findings are consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which gasdissipation, shocks and turbulence in addition to tidal interactions, shape theevolution of galaxies in compact groups.

1407.4731	co in hickson compact group galaxies with enhanced warm \htwo\ emission:  evidence for galaxy evolution?	galaxies in hickson compact groups (hcgs) are believed to experiencemorphological transformations from blue, star-forming galaxies to red,early-type galaxies. galaxies with a high ratio between the luminosities of thewarm h2 to the 7.7mu pah emission ("molecular hydrogen emission galaxies",mohegs) are predominantly in an intermediate phase, the green valley. theirenhanced h2 emission suggests that the molecular gas is affected in thetransition. we study the properties of the molecular gas traced by co ingalaxies in hcgs with measured warm h2 emission in order to look for evidenceof the perturbations affecting the warm h2 in the kinematics, morphology andmass of the molecular gas. we analyzed the molecular gas mass derived fromco(1-0), mh2, and its kinematics, and then compared it to the mass of the warmmolecular gas, the stellar mass and star formation rate (sfr). our results arethe following. (i) the mass ratio between the co-derived and the warm h2molecular gas is in the same range as for field galaxies. (ii) some galaxies,mostly mohegs, have very broad co linewidths of up to 1000 kms. the line shapesare irregular and show various components. (iii) the mapped objects showasymmetric distributions of the cold molecular gas. (iv) the star formationefficiency (= sfr/mh2) of galaxies in hcgs is similar to isolated galaxies. nosignificant difference between mohegs and non-mohegs or between early-types andspirals has been found. (v) the molecular gas masses, mh2, and mh2/lk are lowerin mohegs (predominantly early-types) than in non-mohegs (predominantlyspirals). this trend remains when comparing mohegs and non-mohegs of the samemorphological type. the differences in the molecular gas properties of mohegssupport the view that they are suffering perturbations of the molecular gas, aswell as a decrease in the molecular gas content and associated sfr.

1409.5482	strong far-ir cooling lines, peculiar co kinematics and possible star  formation suppression in hickson compact group 57	we present [c ii] and [o i] observations from herschel and co(1-0) maps fromthe combined array for{\dag} research in millimeter astronomy (carma) of thehickson compact group hcg 57, focusing on the galaxies hcg 57a and hcg 57d. hcg57a has been previously shown to contain enhanced quantities of warm molecularhydrogen consistent with shock and/or turbulent heating. our observations showthat hcg 57d has strong [c ii] emission compared to l$_{\rm fir}$ and weakco(1-0), while in hcg 57a, both the [c ii] and co(1-0) are strong. hcg 57a liesat the upper end of the normal distribution of [c ii]/co and [c ii]/fir ratios,and its far-ir cooling supports a low density warm diffuse gas that falls closeto the boundary of acceptable pdr models. however, the power radiated in the [cii] and warm h$_2$ emission have similar magnitudes, as seen in othershock-dominated systems and predicted by recent models. we suggest thatshock-heating of the [c ii] is a viable alternative to photoelectric heating inviolently disturbed diffuse gas. the existence of shocks is also consistentwith peculiar co kinematics in the galaxy, indicating highly non-circularmotions are present. these kinematically disturbed co regions also showevidence of suppressed star formation, falling a factor of 10-30 below normalgalaxies on the kennicutt-schmidt relation. we suggest that the peculiarproperties of both galaxies are consistent with a highly dissipative off-centercollisional encounter between hcg 57d and 57a, creating ring-like morphologiesin both systems. highly dissipative gas-on-gas collisions may be more common indense groups because of the likelihood of repeated multiple encounters. thepossibility of shock-induced sf suppression may explain why a subset of thesehcg galaxies have been found previously to fall in the mid-infrared greenvalley.

1410.4556	suppression of star formation in ngc 1266	ngc1266 is a nearby lenticular galaxy that harbors a massive outflow ofmolecular gas powered by the mechanical energy of an active galactic nucleus(agn). it has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation (sf) intheir host galaxies, providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxyformation. previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremelyrare, high power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback ontheir hosts. here we present detailed observations of the gas and dustcontinuum of ngc1266 at millimeter wavelengths. our observations show thatmolecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at $\dot{m}_{\rm out}\approx 110 m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, of which the vast majority cannot escape thenucleus. only 2 $m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is actually capable of escaping the galaxy.most of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars.the far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact ($\lesssim50$pc)source that could either be powered by an agn or by an ultra-compact starburst.the ratio of the sf surface density ($\sigma_{\rm sfr}$) to the gas surfacedensity ($\sigma_{\rm h_2}$) indicates that sf is suppressed by a factor of$\approx 50$ compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is formingstars, and $\approx$150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if thecentral region is is powered by an ultra-compact starburst. the agn-driven bulkoutflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering thefragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through aprocess of turbulent injection. this result suggests that even relativelycommon, low-power agns are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxiesas their black holes grow onto the m-$\sigma$ relation.

1510.02107	warm molecular hydrogen at high redshift with the james webb space  telescope	the build-up of galaxies is regulated by a complex interplay betweengravitational collapse, galaxy merging and feedback related to agn and starformation. the energy released by these processes has to dissipate for gas tocool, condense, and form stars. how gas cools is thus a key to understandgalaxy formation. \textit{spitzer space telescope} infrared spectroscopyrevealed a population of galaxies with weak star formation and unusuallypowerful h$_2$ line emission. this is a signature of turbulent dissipation,sustained by large-scale mechanical energy injection. the cooling of themultiphase interstellar medium is associated with emission in the h$_2$ lines.these results have profound consequences on our understanding of regulation ofstar formation, feedback and energetics of galaxy formation in general. thefact that h$_2$ lines can be strongly enhanced in high-redshift turbulentgalaxies will be of great importance for the \textit{james webb spacetelescope} observations which will unveil the role that h$_2$ plays as acooling agent in the era of galaxy assembly.

astro-ph;0405634	spitzer 24micron observations of optical/near-ir selected extremely red  galaxies: evidence for assembly of massive galaxies at z~1-2 ?	we carried out the direct measurement of the fraction of dusty sources in asample of extremely red galaxies with (r - ks) &gt; 5.3mag and ks &lt; 20.2mag, using24um data from the spitzer space telescope. combining deep 24um, ks- and r-banddata over an area of 64sq.arcmin in elais n1, we find that 50%+-6% of our erosample have measurable 24um flux above the 3sigma flux limit of 40ujy. thisflux limit corresponds to a sfr of 12msun/yr at z~1. the 24um-detected eroshave 24-to-2.2 and 24-to-0.7um flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous,dusty sources at z&gt;1, and an order of magnitude too red to be explained by aninfrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift.keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected eros in the flsfield suggests that most of the eros in elais n1 are probably at z~1. the mean24um flux (167ujy) of the 24um-detected ero sample roughly corresponds to thetotal infrared luminosity of (3-10)x10^(11)lsun at z=1-1.5, which is similar tothat of local lirgs and uligs. the corresponding sfr is ~(50-170)msun/yr. ifthe time scale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 10^8yr as inferredfor the local lirgs and uligs, the lower limit on the masses of these24um-detected eros is (5-20)x10^9msun. it is plausible that some of thestarburst eros are in the midst of violent transformation to become massiveearly type galaxies at the epoch of z ~ 1-2.

astro-ph;0405635	extragalactic source counts at 24 microns in the spitzer first look  survey	we present the spitzer mips 24 micron source counts in the extragalacticfirst look survey main, verification and elais-n1 fields. spitzer's increasedsensitivity and efficiency in large areal coverage over previous infraredtelescopes, coupled with the enhanced sensitivity of the 24 micron band tosources at intermediate redshift, dramatically improve the quality andstatistics of number counts in the mid-infrared. the first look surveyobservations cover areas of, respectively, 4.4, 0.26 and 0.015 sq.deg. andreach 3-sigma depths of 0.11, 0.08 and 0.03 mjy. the extragalactic countsderived for each survey agree remarkably well. the counts can be fitted by asuper-euclidean power law of index alpha=-2.9 from 0.2 to 0.9 mjy, with aflattening of the counts at fluxes fainter than 0.2 mjy. comparison withinfrared galaxy evolution models reveals a peak's displacement in the 24 microncounts. this is probably due to the detection of a new population of galaxieswith redshift between 1 and 2, previously unseen in the 15 micron deep counts.

astro-ph;0405637	characterization of extragalactic 24micron sources in the spitzer first  look survey	in this letter, we present the initial characterization of extragalactic 24umsources in the spitzer first look survey (fls) by examining their counterpartsat 8um and r-band. the color-color diagram of 24-to-8 vs. 24-to-0.7um ispopulated with 18,734 sources brighter than the 3sigma flux limit of 110ujy,over an area of 3.7sq.degrees. the 24-to-0.7um colors of these sources spanalmost 4 orders of magnitudes, while the 24-to-8um colors distribute at leastover 2 orders of magnitudes. in addition to identifying ~30% of the totalsample with infrared quiescent, mostly low redshift galaxies, we also foundthat: (1) 23% of the 24um sources (~1200/sq.degrees) have very red 24-to-8 and24-to-0.7 colors and are probably infrared luminous starbursts withl(ir)&gt;3x10^(11)lsun at z&gt;1. in particular, 13% of the sample (660/sq.degrees)are 24um detected only, with no detectable emission in either 8um or r-band.these sources are the candidates for being ulirgs at z&gt;2. (2) 2% of the sample(85/sq.degrees) have colors similar to dust reddened agns, like mrk231 atz~0.6-3. (3) we anticipate that some of these sources with extremely red colorsmay be new types of sources, since they can not be modelled with any familiartype of spectral energy distribution. we find that 17% of the 24um sources haveno detectable optical counterparts brighter than r limit of 25.5mag. opticalspectroscopy of these optical extremely faint 24um sources would be verydifficult, and mid-infrared spectroscopy from the spitzer would be critical forunderstanding their physical nature (abridged).

astro-ph;0507669	using spitzer colors as diagnostics of star formation regions: the  interacting galaxy arp 107	we present spitzer infrared imaging of the peculiar galaxy pair arp 107, andcompare with an optical h-alpha map and a numerical model of the interaction.the [3.6 micron] - [4.5 micron] colors of clumps in the galaxy do not varyaround the ring-like primary spiral arm and are consistent with those of stars,thus these bands are dominated by starlight. in contrast, the [5.8 micron] -[8.0 micron] colors are consistent with those of interstellar dust, and vary byabout 0.2 magnitudes around the ring/spiral, with redder colors associated withregions with stronger star formation as indicated by h-alpha and mid-infraredluminosity. the [4.5 micron] - [5.8 micron] colors for clumps in this arm arebluer than dust and redder than stars, and vary by 1.3 magnitudes around thearm. this color is therefore a measure of the relative number of young stars toold stars, with a redder color indicating a higher proportion of young stars.there is a clear azimuthal sequence in the [4.5] - [5.8] color around the arm,indicating a sequence in average stellar age. the l(h-alpha)/l(8.0 micron)ratio varies around the arm by a factor of ~7; this variation may be due toextinction or to pah excitation by non-ionizing photons. our model of arp 107accounts for the general morphology of the system, and explains the agevariation along the arm as the result of differences in the time of maximumcompression in the arm. using spitzer colors, we are able to distinguishbackground quasars and foreground stars from star forming regions associatedwith arp 107.

astro-ph;9510003	the neutral hydrogen disk of arp 10 (=vv 362) : a non-equilibrium disk  associated with a galaxy with rings and ripples	we present vla \ion{h}{1} and optical spectra of the peculiar galaxy arp~10.originally believed to be an example of a classical colliding ring galaxy withmultiple rings, the new observations show a large disturbed neutral hydrogendisk extending 2.7 times the radius of the bright optical ring. we also presentevidence for optical shells or ripples in the outer isophotes of the galaxyreminiscent of the ripples seen in some early type systems. the smallelliptical originally believed to be the companion is shown to be a backgroundgalaxy. the \ion{h}{1} disk consists of two main parts: a very irregular outerstructure, and a more regular inner disk associated with the main brightoptical ring. in both cases, the \ion{h}{1} structures do not exactly trace theoptical morphology. in the outer parts, the \ion{h}{1} distribution does notcorrelate well with the optical ripples. even the inner \ion{h}{1} disk doesnot correspond well morphologically nor kinematically to the optical rings.these peculiarities lead us to believe that the potential in which the\ion{h}{1} disk resides is significantly out of equilibrium --- a situationwhich would inherently produce rings of star formation. we suggest that arp~10is the result of the intermediate stage of a merger between a large \ion{h}{1}rich disk and a gas-poor disk system. as such, it may represent an example of aclass of mergers which lies intermediate between the ``ripple and shell''accretion systems and the head-on collisional ring galaxies.

astro-ph;9605063	the head-on collision between two gas-rich galaxies: neutral hydrogen  debris from the centrally-smooth ring galaxy viizw466	we present vla observations of the distribution and kinematics of the hi gasin the classical ring galaxy viizw466 and its immediate surroundings. the higas corresponding to the bright optical star forming ring exhibits the typicalprofile of a rotating-expanding ring. the systemic velocity of the galaxy isfound to be 14,468km/s. a formal fit to the hi kinematics in the ring isconsistent with both ring rotation and expansion (expansion velocity 32 km/s).however, h\,i in the northeast quadrant of the ring is severely disturbed,showing evidence of tidal interaction. we also detect a hydrogen plume from thesouthern edge-on companion galaxy (g2) pointing towards the ring galaxy. this,and other peculiarities associated with g2 suggest that it is the intrudergalaxy which recently collided with viizw466 and formed the ring. numericalhydrodynamic models are presented which show that most of the observed featurescan be accounted for as a result of the impact splash between two gas disks.the resultant debris is stretched by ring wave motion in the bridge and laterforms accretion streams onto the two galaxies.finally, we detect hi emissionfrom two previously unknown dwarf galaxies located northeast and southeast ofviizw466 respectively. this brings the total number of members of the viizw466group to five. using the projected mass method, the upper limit of thedynamical mass of the group was estimated to be mo =3.5x10^{12} m_sun, whichimplies that the mass to light ratio of the group is (m/l)_{group} \approx$ 70.this rather low value of m/l, as compared with other loose groups, suggests thegroup may be in a state of collapse at the present time. plunging orbits wouldnaturally lead to an enhanced probability of head-on collisions and ring galaxyformation.

astro-ph;9711016	radio-luminous southern seyfert galaxies. i. radio images and selected  optical/near-infrared spectroscopy	this is the first of two papers in which a study is made of a sample of 12southern radio-luminous seyfert galaxies. our aim is to investigate possiblecorrelations between radio morphology and nuclear/circumnuclear emission-lineproperties. in this paper we present radio images at 13, 6, and 3 cm taken withthe australia telescope compact array (atca), global far-infrared (fir)properties for the whole sample, and optical and near-infrared (nir)spectroscopy of an interesting subset. we find a mixture of radio morphologies,including linear, diffuse and compact sources. when the fir colors of thegalaxies are considered there is an indication that the compact radio sourceshave warmer fir colors than the diffuse sources, whereas the linear sourcesspan a wide range of fir colors. there is a wide variation in radiospectral-indices, suggesting that free-free absorption is significant in somesystems, particularly iras 11249-2859, ngc 4507, and ngc 7213. detailedemission-line studies are presented of 4 galaxies ic 3639, ngc 5135, ngc 3393 &amp;iras 11249-2859. in ic 3639 we present evidence of vigorous, compact starformation enclosed by very extended [oi]6300 emission, suggestive of theboundary between a diffuse outflow and the surrounding ism. in another galaxy,ic 5063, we see evidence for the possible interaction of a highly collimatedoutflow and the surrounding rotating inner disk. of the 5 galaxies which showcompact radio emission, 4 have radio/fir flux ratios consistent with anenergetically dominant agn, whereas ic 4995 exhibits evidence for a verycompact starburst.

astro-ph;9810276	dust in the wheel: the cartwheel galaxy in the mid-ir	we present mid-infrared images at $6.7 \mu m$ and $15 \mu m$ of ``thecartwheel'' (am~0035-33), the prototypical collisional ring galaxy. theobservations, taken with isocam, reveal the distribution of hot dust in thegalaxy and its two companions in the north-east. the intensity of the mid-iremission from the outer star forming ring of the cartwheel shows considerableazimuthal variation and peaks at the most active h$\alpha$ region of the ring.the 15 $\mu m$ to 6.7 $\mu m$ flux ratio of 5.2 is the highest among all thegalaxies of our sample. a surprising result of our observations is thediscovery of significant emission from the inner regions of the galaxy,including the inner ring, spokes and nucleus, where previously only low levelh$\alpha$ emission had been reported. at 6.7 $\mu m$, this emission is strongerthan the one from the outer star forming ring, and at 15 $\mu m$, it represents40% of the emission from the outer ring. the h$\alpha$ to mid-ir flux ratiosfrom the inner regions are consistent with the heating of grains from weak starformation activity.

astro-ph;9905300	the hi and ionized gas disk of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1144 = arp 118: a  violently interacting galaxy with peculiar kinematics	we present observations of the distribution and kinematics of neutral andionized gas in ngc 1144, a galaxy that forms part of the arp 118 system.ionized gas is present over a huge spread in velocity (1100 km/s) in the diskof ngc 1144, but hi emission is detected over only 1/3 of this velocity range,in an area that corresponds to the nw half of the disk. in the nuclear regionof ngc 1144, a jump in velocity in the ionized gas component of 600 km/s isobserved. faint, narrow hi absorption lines are also detected against radiosources in the se part of the disk of ngc 1144, which includes regions ofmassive star formation and a seyfert nucleus. the peculiar hi distribution,which is concentrated in the nw disk, seems to be the inverse of the moleculardistribution which is concentrated in the se disk. although this may partly bethe result of the destruction of hi clouds in the se disk, there iscircumstantial evidence that the entire hi emission spectrum of ngc 1144 isaffected by a deep nuclear absorption line covering a range of 600 km/s, and islikely blueshifted with respect to the nucleus. in this picture, a highcolumn-density hi stream is associated with the nuclear ionized gas velocitydiscontinuity, and the absorption effectively masks any hi emission that wouldbe present in the se disk of ngc 1144.

astro-ph;9907122	plasma and warm dust in the collisional ring galaxy viizw466 from vla  and iso observations	we present the first mid-infrared (mid-ir) ($\lambda5-15\mu$m) and radiocontinuum ($\lambda\lambda$20,~6 and 3.6 cm) observations of the star-formingcollisional ring galaxy vii zw 466 and its host group made with the infraredspace observatory and the nrao very large array. a search was also made for coline emission in two of the galaxies with the onsala 20m radio telescope andupper limits were placed on the mass of molecular gas in those galaxies. thering galaxy is believed to owe its morphology to a slightly off-centercollision between an `intruder' galaxy and a disk. an off-center collision ispredicted to generate a radially expanding density wave in the disk whichshould show large azimuthal variations in overdensity, and have observationalconsequences. the radio continuum emission shows the largest asymmetry,exhibiting a crescent-shaped distribution consistent with either the trappingof cosmic-ray particles in the target disk, or an enhanced supernova rate inthe compressed region. on the other hand, the iso observations (especiallythose made at $\lambda9.6\mu$m) show a more scattered distribution, withemission centers associated with powerful star formation sites distributed moreuniformly around the ring. low-signal to noise observations at$\lambda15.0\mu$m show possible emission inside the ring, with little emissiondirectly associated with the \ion{h}{2} regions. the observations emphasize thecomplex relationship between the generation of radio emission and thedevelopment of star formation even in relatively simple and well understoodcollisional scenarios.

0812.0450	powerful h$_2$ emission and star formation on the interacting galaxy  system arp 143: observations with spitzer and galex	we present new mid-infrared ($5 - 35\mu$m) and ultraviolet (1539 -- 2316 \aa)observations of the interacting galaxy system arp 143 (ngc 2444/2445) from thespitzer space telescope and galex. in this system, the central nucleus of ngc2445 is surrounded by knots of massive star-formation in a ring-like structure.we find unusually strong emission from warm h$_2$ associated with an expandingshock wave between the nucleus and the western knots. at this ridge, the fluxratio between h$_2$ and pah emission is nearly ten times higher than in thenucleus. arp 143 is one of the most extreme cases known in that regard. fromour multi-wavelength data we derive a narrow age range of the star-formingknots between 2 myr and 7.5 myr, suggesting that the ring of knots was formedalmost simultaneously in response to the shock wave traced by the h$_2$emission. however, the knots can be further subdivided in two age groups: thosewith an age of 2--4 myr (knots a, c, e, and f), which are associated with$8\mu$m emission from pahs, and those with an age of 7-8 myr (knots d and g),which show little or no $8\mu$m emission shells surrounding them. we attributethis finding to an ageing effect of the massive clusters which, after about 6myr, no longer excite the pahs surrounding the knots.
