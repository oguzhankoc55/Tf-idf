0901.3357	a candidate tidal disruption event in the galaxy cluster abell 3571	tidal disruption events are possible sources of temporary nuclear activity ingalactic nuclei and can be considered as good indicators of the existence ofsuper massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. a new x-ray source hasbeen serendipitously detected with rosat in a pspc pointed observation of thegalaxy cluster a3571. given the strong flux decay of the object in subsequentdetections, the tidal disruption scenario is investigated as possibleexplanationof the event. we followed up the evolution of the x-ray transientwith rosat, xmm-newton and chandra for a total period of ~13 years. we alsoobtained 7-band optical/nir photometry with grond at the eso/mpi 2.2mtelescope. we report a very large decay of the x-ray flux of rosat sourceidentified with the galaxy leda 095953 a member of the cluster abell 3571. wemeasured a maximum 0.3-2.4 kev luminosity log(l_x)=42.8 erg s^-1. the highstate of the source lasted at least 150 ks, afterwards l_x declined as ~t^-2.the spectrum of the brightest epoch is consistent with a black body withtemperature kt ~0.12 kev. the total energy released by this event in 10 yr wasestimated to be delta_e&gt;2x10^50 erg. we interpret this event as a tidaldisruption of a solar type star by the central supermassive black hole (i.e.~10^7 m_sun) of the galaxy.

0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0902.3248	ntt, spitzer and chandra spectroscopy of sdssj095209.56+214313.3: the  most luminous coronal-line supernova ever observed, or a stellar tidal  disruption event ?	the galaxy sdssj0952+2143 showed remarkable emission-line properties firstreported in 2008 (paper i), which are the consequence of a powerful high-energyflare. here we report follow-up observations of sdssj0952+2143, and discussoutburst scenarios in terms of stellar tidal disruption by a smbh, peculiarvariability of an agn, and a supernova explosion. the optical spectrum ofsdssj0952+2143 exhibits several peculiarities: an exceptional ratio of [fevii]transitions over [oiii], a dramatic decrease by a factor of 10 of thehighest-ionization lines, a very unusual and variable balmer line profileincluding a triple-peaked narrow component with two unresolved horns, and alarge balmer decrement. the mir emission measured with the spitzer irs in thenarrow 10-20mu band is extraordinarily luminous (3.5 x 10^{43} erg\s). the irsspectrum shows a bump around ~11mu and an increase towards longer wavelengths,reminiscent of silicate emission. the strong mir excess over the nir impliesthe dominance of relatively cold dust. the x-ray luminosity of 10^{41} erg\smeasured with chandra is below that typically observed in agn. similarities ofsdssj0952+2143 with some extreme supernovae suggest the explosion of asupernova of type iin. however, an extreme accretion event in a low-luminosityagn or inactive galaxy, especially stellar tidal disruption, remainpossibilities, which could potentially produce a very similar emission-lineresponse. if indeed a supernova, sdssj0952+2143 is one of the most distantx-ray and mir detected sne known so far, the most mir luminous, and one of themost x-ray luminous. it is also by far the most luminous (&gt;10^{40} erg\s) inhigh-ionization coronal lines, exceeding previous sne by at least a factor of100 [abridged].

0905.0472	the evolution of swift/bat blazars and the origin of the mev background	we use 3 years of data from the swift/bat survey to select a complete sampleof x-ray blazars above 15 kev. this sample comprises 26 flat-spectrum radioquasars (fsrqs) and 12 bl lac objects detected over a redshift range of0.03&lt;z&lt;4.0. we use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15--55kev band, the evolution of blazars. we find that, contrary to the seyfert-likeagns detected by bat, the population of blazars shows strong positiveevolution. this evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous opticalqsos and luminous x-ray selected agns. we also find evidence for anepoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quietagns. we interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion andjet activity. in our sample, the fsrqs evolve strongly, while our best-fitshows that bl lacs might not evolve at all. the blazar population accounts for10-20 % (depending on the evolution of the bl lacs) of the cosmic x-raybackground (cxb) in the 15--55 kev band. we find that fsrqs can explain theentire cxb emission for energies above 500 kev solving the mystery of thegeneration of the mev background. the evolution of luminous fsrqs shows a peakin redshift ($z_c$=4.3$\pm0.5$) which is larger than the one observed in qsosand x-ray selected agns. we argue that fsrqs can be used as tracers of massiveelliptical galaxies in the early universe.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

0912.2721	swift bat, fermi lat, and the blazar sequence	using public \fermi lat and \swift bat observations, we constructed the firstsample of blazars selected at both hard x-rays and gamma-rays. studying itsspectral properties, we find a luminosity dependence of the spectral slopes atboth energies. specifically, luminous blazars, generally classified as fsrqs,have {\it hard} continua in the medium-hard x-ray range but {\it soft} continuain the lat gamma-ray range (photon indices $\gamma_x$ \ltsima 2 and $\gamma_g$\gtsima 2), while lower luminosity blazars, classified as bl lacs, haveopposite behavior, i.e., {\it soft} x-ray and {\it hard} gamma-ray continua($\gamma_x$ \gtsima 2.4 and $\gamma_g &lt; 2$). the trends are confirmed bydetailed monte carlo simulations explicitly taking into account theobservational biases of both instruments. our results support the so-called``blazar sequence'' which was originally based on radio samples of blazars andradio luminosities. we also argue that the x-ray-to-gamma-ray continua ofblazars may provide independent insights into the physical conditions aroundthe jet, complementing/superseding the ambiguities of the traditionalclassification based on optical properties.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1005.4968	agn clustering in the local universe: an unbiased picture from swift-bat	we present the clustering measurement of hard x-ray selected agn in the localuniverse. we used a sample of 199 sources spectroscopically confirmed detectedby swift-bat in its 15-55 kev all-sky survey. we measured the real spaceprojected auto-correlation function and detected a signal significant onprojected scales lower than 200 mpc/h. we measured a correlation length ofr0=5.56+0.49-0.43 mpc/h and a slope {\gamma}=1.64-0.08 -0.07. we also measuredthe auto-correlation function of type i and type ii agn and found highercorrelation length for type i agn. we have a marginal evidence of luminositydependent clustering of agn, as we detected a larger correlation length ofluminous agn than that of low luminosity sources. the corresponding typicalhost dm halo masses of swift-bat are log(mdmh) 12-14 h^-1 m/m_sun, depending onthe subsample. for the whole sample we measured log(mdmh)\sim 13.15 h-1 m/m_sunwhich is the typical mass of a galaxy group. we estimated that the local agnpopulation has a typical lifetime tau_agn \sim 0.7 gyr, it is powered by smbhwith mass mbh \sim 1-10x10^8 m_\odot and accreting with very low efficiency,log(epsilon)-2.0. we also conclude that local agn host galaxies are typicallyred-massive galaxies with stellar mass of the order 2-80x10^10 h^-1 m_sun. wecompared our results with clustering predictions of merger-driven agntriggering models and found a good agreement.

1009.4699	galaxy clusters in the swift/bat era ii: 10 more clusters detected above  15 kev	we report on the discovery of 10 additional galaxy clusters detected in theongoing swift/bat all-sky survey. among the newly bat-discovered clusters thereare: bullet, abell 85, norma, and pks 0745-19. norma is the only cluster, amongthose presented here, which is resolved by bat. for all the clusters we performa detailed spectral analysis using xmm-newton and swift/bat data to investigatethe presence of a hard (non-thermal) x-ray excess. we find that in most casesthe clusters' emission in the 0.3-200kev band can be explained by amulti-temperature thermal model confirming our previous results. for twoclusters (bullet and abell 3667) we find evidence for the presence of a hardx-ray excess. in the case of the bullet cluster, our analysis confirms thepresence of a non-thermal, power-law like, component with a 20-100 kev flux of3.4 \times 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 as detected in previous studies. for abell 3667the excess emission can be successfully modeled as a hot component (kt=~13kev).we thus conclude that the hard x-ray emission from galaxy clusters (except thebullet) has most likely thermal origin.

1012.0302	three years swift-bat survey of agn: reconciling theory and  observations?	it is well accepted that unabsorbed as well as absorbed agn are needed toexplain the nature and the shape of the cosmic x-ray background, even if thefraction of highly absorbed objects (dubbed compton-thick sources)substantially still escapes detection. we derive and analyze the absorptiondistribution using a complete sample of agn detected by swift-bat in the firstthree years of the survey. the fraction of compton-thick agn represents only4.6% of the total agn population detected by swift-bat. however, we show thatonce corrected for the bias against the detection of very absorbed sources thereal intrinsic fraction of compton-thick agn is 20$^{+9}_{-6}$%. we proved forthe first time (also in the bat band) that the anti-correlation of the fractionof absorbed agn and luminosity it tightly connected to the different behaviorof the luminosity functions (xlfs) of absorbed and unabsorbed agn. this pointstowards a difference between the two subsamples of objects with absorbed agnbeing, on average, intrinsically less luminous than unobscured ones. moreoverthe xlfs show that the fraction of obscured agn might also decrease at very lowluminosity. this can be successfully interpreted in the framework of a diskcloud outflow scenario as the disappearance of the obscuring region below acritical luminosity. our results are discussed in the framework of populationsynthesis models and the origin of the cosmic x-ray background.

1108.6017	hard x-ray spectral variability of the brightest seyfert agn in the  swift/bat sample	aims: we used data from the 58 month long, continuous swift/burst alerttelescope (bat) observations of the five brightest seyfert galaxies at hardx-rays, to study their flux and spectral variability in the 20-100 kev energyband. the column density in these objects is less than 10^24 cm-2, whichimplies that the swift/bat data allow us to study the "true" variability of thecentral source. results: all objects show significant variations, with anamplitude which is similar to the agn variability amplitude at energies below10 kev. we found evidence for an anti-correlation between variability amplitudeand black hole mass. the light curves in both bands are well correlated, withno significant delays on time scales as short as 2 days. ngc 4151 and ngc 2110do not show spectral variability, but we found a significant anti-correlationbetween hardness ratios and source flux in ngc 4388 (and ngc 4945, ic 4329, toa lesser extent). this "softer when brighter" behaviour is similar to what hasbeen observed at energies below 10 kev, and cannot be explained if thecontinuum varies only in flux; the intrinsic shape should also steepen withincreasing flux. conclusions: the presence of significant flux variationsindicate that the central source in these objects is intrinsically variable ontime scales as short as 1-2 days. the intrinsic slope of the continuum varieswith the flux (at least in ngc 4388). the positive "spectral slope-flux"correlation can be explained if the temperature of the hot corona decreaseswith increasing flux. the lack of spectral variations in two objects, could bedue to the fact that they may operate in a different "state", as theiraccretion rate is less than 1% of the eddington limit (significantly smallerthan the rate of the other three objects in the sample).

1110.3787	the luminosity function of fermi-detected flat-spectrum radio quasars	fermi has provided the largest sample of {\gamma}-ray selected blazars todate. in this work we use a complete sample of fsrqs detected during the firstyear of operation to determine the luminosity function (lf) and its evolutionwith cosmic time. the number density of fsrqs grows dramatically up to redshift\sim0.5-2.0 and declines thereafter. the redshift of the peak in the density isluminosity dependent, with more luminous sources peaking at earlier times; thusthe lf of {\gamma}-ray fsrqs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolutionsimilarly to that of radio-quiet agn. also using data from the swift burstalert telescope we derive the average spectral energy distribution of fsrqs inthe 10 kev-100 gev band and show that there is no correlation of the peak{\gamma}-ray luminosity with {\gamma}-ray peak frequency. the coupling of thesed and lf allows us to predict that the contribution of fsrqs to the fermiisotropic {\gamma}-ray background is 9.3(+1.6/-1.0) (\pm3% systematicuncertainty) in the 0.1-100gev band. finally we determine the lf of unbeamedfsrqs, finding that fsrqs have an average lorentz factor of {\gamma} =11.7(+3.3/-2.2), that most are seen within 5\circ of the jet axis, and thatthey represent only ~0.1 % of the parent population.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1203.1330	the wise gamma-ray strip parametrization: the nature of the gamma-ray  active galactic nuclei of uncertain type	despite the large number of discoveries made recently by fermi, the originsof the so called unidentified gamma-ray sources remain unknown. the largenumber of these sources suggests that among them there could be a populationthat significantly contributes to the isotropic gamma-ray background and istherefore crucial to understand their nature. the first step toward a completecomprehension of the unidentified gamma-ray source population is to identifythose that can be associated with blazars, the most numerous class ofextragalactic sources in the gamma-ray sky. recently, we discovered thatblazars can be recognized and separated from other extragalactic sources usingthe infrared (ir) wise satellite colors. the blazar population delineates aremarkable and distinctive region of the ir color-color space, the wise blazarstrip. in particular, the subregion delineated by the gamma-ray emittingblazars is even narrower and we named it as the wise gamma-ray strip (wgs). inthis paper we parametrize the wgs on the basis of a single parameter s that wethen use to determine if gamma-ray active galactic nuclei of the uncertain type(agus) detected by fermi are consistent with the wgs and so can be consideredblazar candidates. we find that 54 agus out of a set 60 analyzed have ir colorsconsistent with the wgs; only 6 agus are outliers. this result implies that avery high percentage (i.e., in this sample about 90%) of the agus detected byfermi are indeed blazar candidates.

1203.3801	unidentifed gamma-ray sources: hunting gamma-ray blazars	one of the main scientific objectives of the ongoing fermi mission isunveiling the nature of the unidentified gamma-ray sources (ugss). despite thelarge improvements of fermi in the localization of gamma-ray sources withrespect to the past gamma-ray missions, about one third of the fermi-detectedobjects are still not associated to low energy counterparts. recently, usingthe wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) survey, we discovered thatblazars, the rarest class of active galactic nuclei and the largest populationof gamma-ray sources, can be recognized and separated from other extragalacticsources on the basis of their infrared (ir) colors. based on this result, wedesigned an association method for the gamma-ray sources to reognize if thereis a blazar candidate within the positional uncertainty region of a genericgamma-ray source. with this new ir diagnostic tool, we searched for gamma-rayblazar candidates associated to the ugs sample of the second fermi gamma-raycatalog (2fgl). we found that our method associates at least one gamma-rayblazar candidate as a counterpart each of 156 out of 313 ugss analyzed. thesenew low-energy candidates have the same ir properties as the blazars associatedto gamma-ray sources in the 2fgl catalog.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1308.0595	fermi large area telescope detection of two very-high-energy (e&gt;100 gev)  gamma-ray photons from the z = 1.1 blazar pks 0426-380	we report the fermi large area telescope (lat) detection of twovery-high-energy (vhe, e&gt;100 gev) gamma-ray photons from the directionalvicinity of the distant (redshift, z = 1.1) blazar pks 0426-380. the nullhypothesis that both the 134 and 122 gev photons originate from unrelatedsources can be rejected at the 5.5 sigma confidence level. we therefore claimthat at least one of the two vhe photons is securely associated with theblazar, making pks 0426-380 the most distant vhe emitter known to date. theresults are in agreement with the most recent fermi-lat constraints on theextragalactic background light (ebl) intensity, which imply a $z \simeq 1$horizon for $\simeq$ 100 gev photons. the lat detection of the two vhegamma-rays coincided roughly with flaring states of the source, although we didnot find an exact correspondence between the vhe photon arrival times and theflux maxima at lower gamma-ray energies. modeling the gamma-ray continuum ofpks 0426-380 with daily bins revealed a significant spectral hardening aroundthe time of detection of the first vhe event (lat photon index \gamma\ $\simeq$1.4) but on the other hand no pronounced spectral changes near the detectiontime of the second one. this combination implies a rather complex variabilitypattern of the source in gamma rays during the flaring epochs. an additionalflat component is possibly present above several tens of gev in theebl-corrected fermi-lat spectrum accumulated over the ~8-month high state.

1308.5654	search for cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission in galaxy clusters	current theories predict relativistic hadronic particle populations inclusters of galaxies in addition to the already observed relativistic leptons.in these scenarios hadronic interactions give rise to neutral pions which decayinto $\gamma$ rays, that are potentially observable with the large areatelescope (lat) on board the fermi space telescope. we present a jointlikelihood analysis searching for spatially extended $\gamma$-ray emission atthe locations of 50 galaxy clusters in 4 years of fermi-lat data under theassumption of the universal cosmic-ray model proposed by pinzke &amp; pfrommer(2010). we find an excess at a significance of $2.7\sigma$ which upon closerinspection is however correlated to individual excess emission towards threegalaxy clusters: abell 400, abell 1367 and abell 3112. we discuss these casesin detail and conservatively attribute the emission to unmodeled background(for example, radio galaxies within the clusters). through the combinedanalysis of 50 clusters we exclude hadronic injection efficiencies in simplehadronic models above 21% and establish limits on the cosmic-ray to thermalpressure ratio within the virial radius, $r_{200}$, to be below 1.2-1.4%depending on the morphological classification. in addition we derive new limitson the $\gamma$-ray flux from individual clusters in our sample.

1309.4494	first results from nustar observations of mkn 421	mkn 421 is a nearby active galactic nucleus dominated at all wavelengths by avery broad non-thermal continuum thought to arise from a relativistic jet seenat a small angle to the line of sight. its spectral energy distribution peaksin the x-ray and tev gamma-ray bands, where the energy output is dominated bycooling of high-energy electrons in the jet. in order to study the electrondistribution and its evolution, we carried out a dedicated multi-wavelengthcampaign, including extensive observations by the recently launched highlysensitive hard x-ray telescope nustar, between december 2012 and may 2013. herewe present some initial results based on nustar data from january through march2013, as well as calibration observations conducted in 2012. although theobservations cover some of the faintest hard x-ray flux states ever observedfor mkn 421, the sensitivity is high enough to resolve intra-day spectralvariability. we find that in this low state the dominant flux variations aresmooth on timescales of hours, with typical intra-hour variations of less than5%. we do not find evidence for either a cutoff in the hard x-ray spectrum, ora rise towards a high-energy component, but rather that at low flux thespectrum assumes a power law shape with a photon index of approximately 3. thespectrum is found to harden with increasing brightness.

1310.0006	the cosmic evolution of fermi bl lacertae objects	fermi has provided the largest sample of gamma-ray selected blazars to date.in this work we use a uniformly selected set of 211 bl lacertae (bl lac)objects detected by it fermi during its first year of operation. we haveobtained redshift constraints for 206 out of the 211 bl lacs in our samplemaking it the largest and most complete sample of bl lacs available in theliterature. we use this sample to determine the luminosity function of bl lacsand its evolution with cosmic time. we find that for most bl lac classes, theevolution is positive with a space density peaking at modest redshift (z~1.2).the low-luminosity, high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lacs are an exception,showing strong negative evolution, with number density increasing forz$\lesssim$0.5. since this rise corresponds to a drop-off in the density offlat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), a possible interpretation is that thesehsps represent an accretion-starved end-state of an earlier merger-drivengas-rich phase. we additionally find that the known bl lac correlation betweenluminosity and photon spectral index persists after correction for thesubstantial observational selection effects with implications for the so called`blazar sequence'. finally, estimating the beaming corrections to theluminosity function, we find that bl lacs have an average lorentz factor of$\gamma=6.1^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$, and that most are seen within 10$^{\circ}$ of thejet axis.

1401.0548	fermi-lat detection of gravitational lens delayed gamma-ray flares from  blazar b0218+357	using data from the fermi large area telescope (lat), we report the firstclear gamma-ray measurement of a delay between flares from the gravitationallylensed images of a blazar. the delay was detected in b0218+357, a knowndouble-image lensed system, during a period of enhanced gamma-ray activity withpeak fluxes consistently observed to reach &gt;20-50 times its previous averageflux. an auto-correlation function analysis identified a delay in the gamma-raydata of 11.46 +/- 0.16 days (1 sigma) that is ~1 day greater than previousradio measurements. considering that it is beyond the capabilities of the latto spatially resolve the two images, we nevertheless decomposed individualsequences of superposing gamma-ray flares/delayed emissions. in three such~8-10 day-long sequences within a ~4-month span, considering confusion due tooverlapping flaring emission and flux measurement uncertainties, we found fluxratios consistent with ~1, thus systematically smaller than those from radioobservations. during the first, best-defined flare, the delayed emission wasdetailed with a fermi pointing, and we observed flux doubling timescales of~3-6 hrs implying as well extremely compact gamma-ray emitting regions.

1409.0392	exploring the multiband emission of txs 0536+145: the most distant  gamma-ray flaring blazar	we report results of a multiband monitoring campaign of the flat spectrumradio quasar txs 0536+145 at redshift 2.69. this source was detected during avery high gamma-ray activity state in 2012 march by the large area telescope onboard fermi, becoming the gamma-ray flaring blazar at the highest redshiftdetected so far. at the peak of the flare the source reached an apparentisotropic gamma-ray luminosity of 6.6 x 10^49 erg/s which is comparable to thevalues achieved by the most luminous blazars. this activity triggeredradio-to-x-rays monitoring observations by swift, very long baseline array,european vlbi network, and medicina single-dish telescope. significantvariability was observed from radio to x-rays supporting the identification ofthe gamma-ray source with txs 0536+145. both the radio and gamma-ray lightcurves show a similar behaviour, with the gamma-rays leading the radiovariability with a time lag of about 4-6 months. the luminosity increase isassociated with a flattening of the radio spectrum. no new superluminalcomponent associated with the flare was detected in high resolutionparsec-scale radio images. during the flare the gamma-ray spectrum seems todeviate from a power law, showing a curvature that was not present during theaverage activity state. the gamma-ray properties of txs 0536+145 are consistentwith those shown by the high-redshift gamma-ray blazar population.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1501.05301	the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background and implications  for dark-matter annihilation	the origin of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (egb) has beendebated for some time. { the egb comprises the $\gamma$-ray emission fromresolved and unresolved extragalactic sources, such as blazars, star-forminggalaxies and radio galaxies, as well as radiation from truly diffuseprocesses.} this letter focuses on the blazar source class, the most numerousdetected population, and presents an updated luminosity function and spectralenergy distribution model consistent with the blazar observations performed bythe {\it fermi} large area telescope (lat). we show that blazars account for50$^{+12}_{-11}$\,\% of the egb photons ($&gt;$0.1\,gev), and that {\it fermi}-lathas already resolved $\sim$70\,\% of this contribution. blazars, and inparticular low-luminosity hard-spectrum nearby sources like bl lacs, areresponsible for most of the egb emission above 100\,gev. we find that theextragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission,is responsible for the high-energy cut-off observed in the egb spectrum.finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies and radio galaxies cannaturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the0.1--820\,gev range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. thisallows us to set competitive constraints on the dark-matter annihilation crosssection.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

1511.04186	the nustar extragalactic surveys: initial results and catalog from the  extended chandra deep field south	we present initial results and the source catalog from the nustar survey ofthe extended chandra deep field south (hereafter, ecdfs) - currently thedeepest contiguous component of the nustar extragalactic survey program. thesurvey covers the full ~30 arcmin x 30 arcmin area of this field to a maximumdepth of ~360 ks (~220 ks when corrected for vignetting at 3-24 kev), reachingsensitivity limits of ~1.3 x 10^-14 erg/cm2/s (3-8 kev), ~3.4 x 10^-14erg/cm2/s (8-24 kev) and ~3.0 x 10^-14 erg/cm2/s (3-24 kev). fifty four (54)sources are detected over the full field, although five of these are found tolie below our significance threshold once contaminating flux from neighboring(i.e., blended) sources is taken into account. of the remaining 49 that aresignificant, 19 are detected in the 8-24 kev band. the 8-24 kev to 3-8 kev bandratios of the twelve sources that are detected in both bands span the range0.39-1.7, corresponding to a photon index range of gamma ~ 0.5-2.3, with amedian photon index of 1.70 +/- 0.52. the redshifts of the 49 sources in ourmain sample span the range z = 0.21-2.7, and their rest-frame 10-40 kevluminosities (derived from the observed 8-24 kev fluxes) span the range l(10-40kev) ~ (0.7-300) x 10^43 erg/s, sampling below the "knee" of the x-rayluminosity function out to z ~ 0.8-1. finally, we identify one nustar sourcethat has neither a chandra nor an xmm-newton counterpart, but that showsevidence of nuclear activity at infrared wavelengths, and thus may represent agenuine, new x-ray source detected by nustar in the ecdfs.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

0810.1523	the 2007 outburst of the x-ray binary xte j1856+053	on 28 february 2007 a new outburst of the previously known transient sourcexte j1856+053 was detected with rxte/asm. we present here the results of anxmm-newton (0.5-10.0 kev) target of opportunity observation performed on 14march 2007, aimed at constraining the mass of the compact object in this x-raybinary and determining its main properties. the epic-pn camera was used intiming mode and its spectrum fit together with the rgs data. ir observationswith grond at the 2.2 m telescope in la silla provide further information onthe system. the x-ray light curve shows that both the 1996 and the 2007outbursts had two peaks. the x-ray spectrum is well fit with a thermalaccretion disk model, with kt=0.75+/-0.01 kev and foreground absorptionn_h=4.5(+/-0.1)e22 cm**-2. the low disk temperature favours a black-hole asaccreting object, with an estimated mass in the range 1.3-4.2 m_sun. from their upper limits we argue that xte j1856+053 is a low mass x-ray binary. weestimate the orbital period of the system to be between 3 and 12 hours.

0811.1444	a new measurement of the cosmic x-ray background	we present a new measurement of the cosmic x-ray background (cxrb) in the1.5-7 kev energy band, performed by exploiting the swift x-ray telescope (xrt)data archive. we also present a cxrb spectral model in a wider energy band(1.5-200 kev), obtained by combining these data with the recently publishedswift-bat measurement. from the xrt archive we collect a complete sample of 126high galactic latitude gamma-ray burst (grb) follow-up observations. thisprovides a total exposure of 7.5 ms and a sky-coverage of 7 square degreeswhich represents a serendipitous survey, well suited for a direct measurementof the cxrb in the 1.5-10 kev interval. our work is based on a completecharacterization of the instrumental background and an accurate measurement ofthe stray-light contamination and vignetting calibration. we find that the cxrbspectrum in the 1.5-7 kev energy band can be equally well fitted by a singlepower-law with photon index gamma=1.47+/-0.07 or a single power-law with photonindex gamma=1.41+/-0.06 and an exponential roll-off at 41 kev. the measuredflux in the 2-10 kev energy band is 2.18+/-0.13 e-11 erg/(cm2 s deg2) in the2-10 kev band. combining swift-xrt with swift-bat (15-200 kev) we find that, inthe 1.5-200 kev band, the cxrb spectrum can be well described by twosmoothly-joined power laws with the energy break at 29.0+/-0.5 kevcorresponding to a nu f_nu peak located at 22.4+/-0.4 kev. taking advantage ofboth the swift high energy instruments (xrt and bat), we produce an analyticaldescription of the cxrb spectrum over a wide (1.5-200 kev) energy band. thismodel is marginally consistent with the heao1 measurement (~10% higher atenergies higher than 20 kev, while it is significantly (30%) higher at lowenergies (2-10 kev).
