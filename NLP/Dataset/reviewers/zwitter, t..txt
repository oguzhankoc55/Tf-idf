0904.0739	fully automated approaches to analyze large-scale astronomy survey data	observational astronomy has changed drastically in the last decade: manuallydriven target-by-target instruments have been replaced by fully automatedrobotic telescopes. data acquisition methods have advanced to the point thatterabytes of data are flowing in and being stored on a daily basis. at the sametime, the vast majority of analysis tools in stellar astrophysics still rely onmanual expert interaction. to bridge this gap, we foresee that the next decadewill witness a fundamental shift in the approaches to data analysis:case-by-case methods will be replaced by fully automated pipelines that willprocess the data from their reduction stage, through analysis, to storage.while major effort has been invested in data reduction automation, automateddata analysis has mostly been neglected despite the urgent need. scientificdata mining will face serious challenges to identify, understand and eliminatethe sources of systematic errors that will arise from this automation. as aspecial case, we present an artificial intelligence (ai) driven pipeline thatis prototyped in the domain of stellar astrophysics (eclipsing binaries inparticular), current results and the challenges still ahead.

0907.0177	rave spectroscopy of luminous blue variables in the large magellanic  cloud	context: the rave spectroscopic survey for galactic structure and evolutionobtains 8400-8800 ang spectra at 7500 resolving power at the uk schmidttelescope using the 6df multi-fiber positioner. more than 300,000 9&lt;i&lt;12 and|b|&gt;25 deg southern stars have been observed to date. aims: this paper presentsthe first intrinsic examination of stellar spectra from the rave survey, aimedat evaluating their diagnostic potential for peculiar stars and at contributingto the general understanding of luminous blue variables (lbvs). methods: weused the multi-epoch spectra for all seven lbvs observed, between 2005 and2008, in the large magellanic cloud (lmc) by the rave survey. results: wedemonstrate that rave spectra possess significant diagnostic potential whenapplied to peculiar stars and, in particular, lbvs. the behaviour of the radialvelocities for both emission and absorption lines, and the spectral changesbetween outburst and quiescence states are described and found to agree withevidence gathered at more conventional wavelengths. the wind outflow signaturesand their variability are investigated, with multi-components detected in sdoradus. photoionisation modelling of the rich emission line spectrum of r 127shows evidence of a massive detached ionised shell that was ejected during the1982-2000 outburst. surface inhomogeneities in the nuclear-processed material,brought to the surface by heavy mass loss, could have been observed in sdoradus, even if alternative explanations are possible. we also detect thetransition from quiescence to outburst state in r 71. finally, our spectrum ofr 84 offers one of the clearest views of its cool companion.

1003.0758	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models	(abridged) aims:we develop a method for deriving distances from spectroscopicdata and obtaining full 6d phase-space coordinates for the rave survey's seconddata release. methods: we used stellar models combined with atmosphericproperties from rave (teff, logg and [fe/h]) and (j-ks) photometry fromarchival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. we are able to derive the full6d phase-space coordinates for a large sample of rave stars. this method istested with artificial data, hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes andobservations of the open cluster m67. results: when we applied our method to aset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative(statistical) distance errors of &lt; 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) haverelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively. ourvarious tests show that we can reliably estimate distances for main-sequencestars, but there is an indication of potential systematic problems with giantstars. for the main-sequence star sample (defined as those with log(g) &gt; 4),25% (1 744) have relative distance errors &lt; 31%, while 50% (3 488) and 75% (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36% and 42%, respectively. our fulldataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a functionof distance from the galactic plane. the known kinematic substructures in the uand v velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset,confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. weprovide independent measurements of the orientation of the uv velocityellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement withprevious work. conclusions: the distance catalogue for the rave second datarelease is available at http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave

1006.2517	double-lined spectroscopic binary stars in the radial velocity  experiment survey	we devise a new method for the detection of double-lined binary stars in asample of the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey spectra. the method isboth tested against extensive simulations based on synthetic spectra, andcompared to direct visual inspection of all rave spectra. it is based on theproperties and shape of the cross-correlation function, and is able to recover~80% of all binaries with an orbital period of order 1 day. systems withperiods up to 1 year are still within the detection reach. we have applied themethod to 25,850 spectra of the rave second data release and found 123double-lined binary candidates, only eight of which are already marked asbinaries in the simbad database. among the candidates, there are seven thatshow spectral features consistent with the rs cvn type (solar type with activechromosphere) and seven that might be of w uma type (over-contact binaries).one star, hd 101167, seems to be a triple system composed of three nearlyidentical g-type dwarfs. the tested classification method could also beapplicable to the data of the upcoming gaia mission.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

0709.4219	is the sky falling? searching for stellar streams in the local milky way  disc in the coravel and rave surveys	we have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local milky waydisc in the coravel and rave surveys. the coravel survey consists of localdwarf stars (nordstrom et al. geneva-copenhagen survey) and local famaey et al.giant stars. we select rave stars with radial velocities that are sensitive tothe galactic vertical space velocity (galactic latitude b &lt; -45 deg). kuiperstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the galactic verticalvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net verticalflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with verticallycoherent kinematics. in contrast to the `field of streams' found in the outerhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by thecoravel dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), coravel giants (completewithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and rave (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoidof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. this issufficiently sensitive to allow our rave sample to rule out the passing of thetidal stream of the disrupting sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solarneighbourhood. this agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit anddissociates it from the helmi et al. halo stream. our constraints on theabsence of the sgr stream near the sun could prove a useful tool fordiscriminating between galactic potential models. the lack of a net verticalflow through the solar neighbourhood in the coravel giants and rave samplesargues against the virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the sun. there areno vertical streams in the coravel giants and rave samples with stellardensities &gt;1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore noevidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

1107.1256	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models iii: the  nature of the rave survey and milky way chemistry	we apply the method of burnett &amp; binney (2010) for the determination ofstellar distances and parameters to the internal catalogue of the radialvelocity experiment (steinmetz et al. 2006). subsamples of stars that eitherhave hipparcos parallaxes or belong to well-studied clusters, inspireconfidence in the formal errors. distances to dwarfs cooler than ~6000 k appearto be unbiased, but those to hotter dwarfs tend to be too small by ~10% of theformal errors. distances to giants tend to be too large by about the sameamount. the median distance error in the whole sample of 216,000 stars is 28%and the error distribution is similar for both giants and dwarfs. roughly halfthe stars in the rave survey are giants. the giant fraction is largest at lowlatitudes and in directions towards the galactic centre. near the plane themetallicity distribution is remarkably narrow and centred on [m/h]-0.04 dex;with increasing |z| it broadens out and its median moves to [m/h] ~ -0.5. meanage as a function of distance from the galactic centre and distance |z| fromthe galactic plane shows the anticipated increase in mean age with |z|.

1204.6502	exploring the morphology of rave stellar spectra	the radial velocity experiment (rave) is a medium resolution r~7500spectroscopic survey of the milky way which already obtained over half amillion stellar spectra. they present a randomly selected magnitude-limitedsample, so it is important to use a reliable and automated classificationscheme which identifies normal single stars and discovers different types ofpeculiar stars. to this end we present a morphological classification of350,000 rave survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, adimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectralmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving theproperties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. we find that the majority ofall spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there isalso a significant population of several types of peculiars. among them themost populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary andchromospherically active stars. both of them include several thousands ofspectra. particularly the latter group offers significant further investigationopportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single starsalone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional spacecorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

1205.0028	international observational campaigns of the last two eclipses in ee  cephei: 2003 and 2008/9	two observational campaigns were carried out during the eclipses of ee cep in2003 and 2008/9 to verify whether the eclipsing body in the system is indeed adark disk and to understand the observed changes in the depth and durations ofthe eclipses. multicolour photometric data and spectroscopic observations atboth low and high resolution were collected. we numerically modelled thevariations in brightness and colour during the eclipses. we tested models withdifferent disk structure. we considered the possibility of disk precession. thecomplete set of observational data collected during the last three eclipses aremade available to the astronomical community. two blue maxima in the colourindices were detected during these two eclipses, one before and one after thephotometric minimum. the first (stronger) blue maximum is simultaneous with a"bump" that is very clear in all the ubvri light curves. variations in thespectral line profiles seem to be recurrent during each cycle. nai lines alwaysshow at least three absorption components during the eclipse minimum and strongabsorption is superimposed on the h_alpha emission. these observations confirmthat the eclipsing object in ee cep system is indeed a dark, dusty disk arounda low luminosity object. the primary appears to be a rapidly rotating be starthat is strongly darkened at the equator and brightened at the poles. some ofthe conclusions of this work require verification in future studies: (i) acomplex, possibly multi-ring structure of the disk in ee cep; (ii) ourexplanation of the "bump" observed during the last two eclipses in terms of thedifferent times of obscuration of the hot polar regions of the be star by thedisk; and (iii) our suggested period of the disk precession (~11-12 p_orb) andpredicted depth of about 2 mag the forthcoming eclipse in 2014.

1205.0546	kinematic groups beyond the solar neighbourhood with rave	we analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the rave survey in andbeyond the solar neighbourhood.we detect significant overdensities in thevelocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.we findthat the main local kinematic groups are large scale features, surviving atleast up to ~1 kpc from the sun in the direction of anti-rotation, and also at~700 pc below the galactic plane.we also find that for regions located atdifferent radii than the sun, the known groups appear shifted in the velocityplane. for example, the hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity forregions inside the solar circle and a lower value outside. we have alsodiscovered a new group at (u, v) = (92,-22) km/s in the solar neighbourhood andconfirmed the significance of other previously found groups. some of thesetrends detected for the first time are consistent with dynamical models of theeffects of the bar and the spiral arms. more modelling is required todefinitively characterise the non-axisymmetric components of our galaxy usingthese groups.

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1209.0456	thick disk kinematics from rave and the solar motion	radial velocity surveys such as the radial velocity experiment (rave) provideus with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby stars most of whichbelong to the galactic thin, thick disk or halo. ideally, to study the galacticdisks (both thin and thick) one should make use of the multi-dimensionalphase-space and the whole pattern of chemical abundances of their stellarpopulations. in this paper, with the aid of the rave survey, we study the thinand thick disks of the milky way, focusing on the latter. we present atechnique to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on thekinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of thestars. using the padova galaxy model, we checked the ability of our method tocorrectly isolate the thick disk component from the galaxy mixture of stellarpopulations. we introduce selection criteria in order to clean the observedradial velocities from the galactic differential rotation and to take intoaccount the partial sky coverage of rave. we developed a numerical technique tostatistically disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. we deducethe components of the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest (lsr)in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag of the thick diskcomponent relative to the lsr, and the square root of the absolute value of thevelocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk alone. the analysis of the thindisk is presented in another paper. we find good agreement with previousindependent parameter determinations. in our analysis we used photometricallydetermined distances. in the appendix we show that similar values can be foundfor the thick disk alone as derived in the main sections of our paper evenwithout the knowledge of photometric distances.

1307.6073	the asymmetric drift, the local standard of rest, and implications from  rave data	the determination of the lsr is still a matter of debate. the classical valueof the tangential peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr waschallenged in recent years, claiming a significantly larger value. we show thatthe radial velocity experiment (rave) sample of dwarf stars is an excellentdata set to derive tighter boundary conditions to chemodynamical evolutionmodels of the extended solar neighbourhood. we present an improved jeansanalysis, which allows a better interpretation of the measured kinematics ofstellar populations in the milky way disc. we propose an improved version ofthe str\"omberg relation with the radial scalelengths as the only unknown.binning rave stars in metallicity reveals a bigger asymmetric drift(corresponding to a smaller radial scalelength) for more metal-richpopulations. with the standard assumption of velocity-dispersion independentradial scalelengths in each metallicity bin, we redetermine the lsr. the newstr\"omberg equation yields a joint lsr value of v_\sun=3.06 \pm 0.68 km/s,which is even smaller than the classical value based on hipparcos data. thecorresponding radial scalelength increases from 1.6 kpc for the metal-rich binto 2.9 kpc for the metal-poor bin, with a trend of an even larger scalelengthfor young metal-poor stars. when adopting the recent sch\"onrich value ofv_\sun=12.24 km/s for the lsr, the new str\"omberg equation yields much largerindividual radial scalelengths of the rave subpopulations, which seemunphysical in part. the new str\"omberg equation allows a cleanerinterpretation of the kinematic data of disc stars in terms of radialscalelengths. lifting the lsr value by a few km/s compared to the classicalvalue results in strongly increased radial scalelengths with a trend of smallervalues for larger velocity dispersions.

1309.4272	constraints on the galactic bar from the hercules stream as traced with  rave across the galaxy	non-axisymmetries in the galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) inducekinematic groups such as the hercules stream. assuming that hercules is causedby the effects of the outer lindblad resonance of the galactic bar, we modelanalytically its properties as a function of position in the galaxy and itsdependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. using data from the ravesurvey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the hercules structure decreasesas a function of galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with ouranalytical model. this allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters ofthe milky way's bar. the combined likelihood function of the bar's patternspeed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\omega_b=(1.89 \pm0.08) \times \omega_0$ where $\omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.assuming a solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,this corresponds to $\omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. on the other hand, the bar'sorientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. in fact,the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between thepattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of ourbest fit results is given by the linear relation $\omega_b/\omega_0=1.91 +0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. for example, for anangle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. theseresults are not very sensitive to the other galactic parameters such as thecircular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the sun, and are robust tobiases in distance.

1309.4274	chromospherically active stars in the rave survey. i. the catalogue	rave, the unbiased magnitude limited survey of the southern sky stars,contained 456,676 medium-resolution spectra at the time of our analysis.spectra cover the caii irt range which is a known indicator of chromosphericactivity. our previous work (matijevi\v{c} et al. 2012) classified all spectrausing locally linear embedding. it identified 53,347 cases with a suggestedemission component in calcium lines. here we use a spectral subtractiontechnique to measure the properties of this emission. synthetic templates arereplaced by the observed spectra of non-active stars to bypass the difficultcomputations of non-lte profiles of the line cores and stellar parameterdependence. we derive both the equivalent width of the excess emission for eachcalcium line on a 5\aa\ wide interval and their sum ew_irt for ~44,000candidate active dwarf stars with s/n&gt;20 and with no respect to the source oftheir emission flux. from these ~14,000 show a detectable chromospheric fluxwith at least 2\sigma\ confidence level. our set of active stars vastlyenlarges previously known samples. atmospheric parameters and in some casesradial velocities of active stars derived from automatic pipeline suffer fromsystematic shifts due to their shallower calcium lines. we re-estimate theeffective temperature, metallicity and radial velocities for candidate activestars. the overall distribution of activity levels shows a bimodal shape, withthe first peak coinciding with non-active stars and the second with the premain-sequence cases. the catalogue will be publicly available with the nextrave public data releases.

1309.4279	chemical gradients in the milky way from the rave data. i. dwarf stars	aim: we aim at measuring the chemical gradients of the elements mg, al, si,and fe along the galactic radius to provide new constraints on the chemicalevolution models of the galaxy and galaxy models such as the besancon model.  methods: we analysed three different samples selected from three independentdatasets: a sample of 19,962 dwarf stars selected from the rave database, asample of 10,616 dwarf stars selected from the geneva-copenhagen survey (gcs)dataset, and a mock sample (equivalent to the rave sample) created by using thegalaxia code, which is based on the besancon model. we measured the chemicalgradients as functions of the guiding radius (rg) at different distances fromthe galactic plane reached by the stars along their orbit (zmax).  results: the chemical gradients of the rave and gcs samples are negative andshow consistent trends, although they are not equal: at zmax&lt;0.4 kpc and4.5&lt;rg(kpc)&lt;9.5, the iron gradient for the rave sample is d[fe/h]/drg=-0.065dex kpc^{-1}, whereas for the gcs sample it is d[fe/h]/drg=-0.043 dex kpc^{-1}with internal errors +-0.002 and +-0.004 dex kpc^{-1}, respectively. thegradients of the rave and gcs samples become flatter at larger zmax.conversely, the mock sample has a positive iron gradient ofd[fe/h]/drg=+0.053+-0.003 dex kpc^{-1} at zmax&lt;0.4 kpc and remains positive atany zmax. these positive and unrealistic values originate from the lack ofcorrelation between metallicity and tangential velocity in the besancon model.the discrepancies between the observational samples and the mock sample can bereduced by i) decreasing the density, ii) decreasing the vertical velocity, andiii) increasing the metallicity of the thick disc in the besancon model.

1309.4293	the rave survey: the galactic escape speed and the mass of the milky way	we construct new estimates on the galactic escape speed at variousgalactocentric radii using the latest data release of the radial velocityexperiment (rave dr4). compared to previous studies we have a database largerby a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selectedsample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from rave and a previously published dataset. we calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of milky way-sized galaxies. our best estimate ofthe local galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed requiredto reach three virial radii $r_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $r_{340}$ isthe galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times thecritical density for closure in the universe. from the escape speed we furtherderive estimates of the mass of the galaxy using a simple mass model with twooptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and anadiabatically contracted navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) sphere. if we fix thelocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher massthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on haloconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint wefind very similar masses for both models. our best estimate for $m_{340}$, themass interior to $r_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times 10^{12}$ m$_\odot$ (corresponding to $m_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times10^{12}$ m$_\odot$). this estimate is in good agreement with recently publishedindependent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more distant halo starsand the satellite galaxy leo i.

1310.1919	in the thick of it: metal-poor disc stars in rave	by selecting in the rave-dr4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpcabove the galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplestthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the milky way. weconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions ofthe thick disc are not gaussian. in particular, we find that the thick disc hasan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [m/h]=-2 dex, contributingroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorterscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. the mean azimuthal velocityof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between themetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on theformation mechanisms of the galactic thick disc. given our simple approach, wefind dvphi/d[m/h] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement withprevious literature values. we complete the study with a brief discussion onthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggestthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed byradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1406.4130	constraining the galaxy's dark halo with rave stars	we use the kinematics of $\sim200\,000$ giant stars that lie within $\sim1.5$ kpc of the plane to measure the vertical profile of mass density near thesun. we find that the dark mass contained within the isodensity surface of thedark halo that passes through the sun($(6\pm0.9)\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$), and the surface density within$0.9$ kpc of the plane ($(69\pm10)\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$) are almostindependent of the (oblate) halo's axis ratio $q$. if the halo is spherical, 46per cent of the radial force on the sun is provided by baryons, and only 4.3per cent of the galaxy's mass is baryonic. if the halo is flattened, thebaryons contribute even less strongly to the local radial force and to thegalaxy's mass. the dark-matter density at the location of the sun is$0.0126\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-3}}=0.48\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{gev\,cm^{-3}}$.when combined with other literature results we find hints for a mildly oblatedark halo with $q \simeq 0.8$. our value for the dark mass within the solarradius is larger than that predicted by cosmological dark-matter-onlysimulations but in good agreement with simulations once the effects of baryonicinfall are taken into account. our mass models consist of threedouble-exponential discs, an oblate bulge and a navarro-frenk-white dark-matterhalo, and we model the dynamics of the rave stars in the correspondinggravitational fields by finding distribution functions $f(\mathbf{j})$ thatdepend on three action integrals. statistical errors are completely swamped bysystematic uncertainties, the most important of which are the distance to thestars in the photometric and spectroscopic samples and the solar distance tothe galactic centre. systematics other than the flattening of the dark haloyield overall uncertainties $\sim 15$ per cent.

1408.6236	spectroscopic signatures of extra-tidal stars around the globular  clusters ngc 6656 (m22), ngc 3201 and ngc 1851 from rave	stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that thebrightest clusters in the galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarfspheroidal galaxies. if the present galactic globular clusters formed withinlarger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal halos and/ortails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems.the stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the bestplaces to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. here an attempt ismade to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globularclusters m22 and ngc 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster ngc 3201.the stellar parameters from the radial velocity experiment (rave) are used toidentify stars with rave metallicities, radial velocities andelemental-abundances consistent with the abundance patterns and properties ofthe stars in m22, ngc 1851 and ngc 3201. the discovery of rave stars that maybe associated with m22 and ngc 1851 are reported, some of which are atprojected distances of ~10 degrees away from the core of these clusters.numerous rave stars associated with ngc 3201 suggest that either the tidalradius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound starsextending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. no furtherextra-tidal stars associated with ngc 3201 could be identified. the brightmagnitudes of the rave stars make them easy targets for high resolutionfollow-up observations, allowing an eventual further chemical tagging tosolidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidaldebris. in both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding ngc1851 and ngc 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is seen, consistent withextended tidal debris from omega centauri.

1503.02072	the imprints of the galactic bar on the thick disk with rave	we study the kinematics of a local sample of stars, located within a cylinderof 500 pc radius centered on the sun, in the rave dataset. we find clearasymmetries in the $v_r$-$v_\phi$ velocity distributions of thin and thick diskstars: here are more stars moving radially outwards for low azimuthalvelocities and more radially inwards for high azimuthal velocities. suchasymmetries have been previously reported for the thin disk as being due to thegalactic bar, but this is the first time that the same type of structures areseen in the thick disk. our findings imply that the velocities of thick diskstars should no longer be described by schwarzschild's, multivariate gaussianor purely axisymmetric distributions. furthermore, the nature of previouslyreported substructures in the thick disk needs to be revisited as these couldbe associated with dynamical resonances rather than to accretion events. it isclear that dynamical models of the galaxy must fit the 3d velocitydistributions of the disks, rather than the projected 1d, if we are tounderstand the galaxy fully.

1504.07695	identification of globular cluster stars in rave data i: application to  stellar parameter calibration	we present the identification of potential members of nearby galacticglobular clusters using radial velocities from the radial velocity experimentdata release 4 (rave-dr4) survey database. our identifications are based onthree globular clusters -- ngc 3201, ngc 5139 ($\omega$ cen) and ngc 362 -- allof which are shown to have |rv|&gt;100 km/s. the identification of globularcluster stars in rave dr4 data offers a unique opportunity to test theprecision and accuracy of the stellar parameters determined with the currentlyavailable stellar parameter pipelines (spps) used in the survey, as globularclusters are ideal testbeds for the validation of stellar atmosphericparameters, abundances, distances and ages. for both ngc 3201 and $\omega$ cen,there is compelling evidence for numerous members (&gt; 10) in the rave database;in the case of ngc 362 the evidence is more ambiguous, and there may besignificant foreground and/or background contamination in ourkinematically-selected sample. a comparison of the rave-derived stellarparameters and abundances with published values for each cluster and with bastiisochrones for ages and metallicities from the literature reveals overall goodagreement, with the exception of the apparent underestimation of surfacegravities for giants, in particular for the most metal-poor stars. moreover, ifthe selected members are part of the main body of each cluster our resultswould also suggest that the distances from binney et al. 2013, where onlyisochrones more metal-rich than -0.9 dex were used, are typicallyunderestimated by ~ 40% with respect to the published distances for theclusters, while the distances from zwitter et al. 2010 show stars ranging from1 to ~ 6.5 kpc -- with indications of a trend toward higher distances at lowermetallicities -- for the three clusters analysed in this study.

0806.0546	the radial velocity experiment (rave): second data release	we present the second data release of the radial velocity experiment (rave),an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities (rvs) andstellar atmosphere parameters of up to one million stars using the 6dfmulti-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidt telescope of theanglo-australian observatory (aao). it is obtaining medium resolution spectra(median r=7,500) in the ca-triplet region (8,410--8,795 \aa) for southernhemisphere stars in the magnitude range 9&lt;i&lt;12. following the first datarelease (steinmetz et al. 2006) the current release doubles the sample ofpublished rvs, now containing 51,829 rvs for 49,327 individual stars observedon 141 nights between april 11 2003 and march 31 2005. comparison with externaldata sets shows that the new data collected since april 3 2004 show a standarddeviation of 1.3 km/s, about twice better than for the first data release. forthe first time this data release contains values of stellar parameters from22,407 spectra of 21,121 individual stars. they were derived by a penalized\chi^2 method using an extensive grid of synthetic spectra calculated from thelatest version of kurucz models. from comparison with external data sets, ourconservative estimates of errors of the stellar parameters (for a spectrum withs/n=40) are 400 k in temperature, 0.5 dex in gravity, and 0.2 dex inmetallicity. we note however that the internal errors estimated from repeatrave observations of 822 stars are at least a factor 2 smaller. we demonstratethat the results show no systematic offsets if compared to values derived fromphotometry or complementary spectroscopic analyses. the data release includesproper motion and photometric measurements. it can be accessed via the ravewebpage: http://www.rave-survey.org and through cds.

0808.1456	diffuse interstellar bands in rave survey spectra	we have used spectra of hot stars from the rave survey in order toinvestigate the visibility and properties of five diffuse interstellar bandspreviously reported in the literature. the rave spectroscopic survey forgalactic structure and kinematics records ccd spectra covering the 8400-8800ang wavelength region at 7500 resolving power. the spectra are obtained withthe uk schmidt at the aao, equipped with the 6df multi-fiber positioner. thedib at 8620.4 ang is by far the strongest and cleanest of all dibs occurringwithin the rave wavelength range, with no interference by underlying absorptionstellar lines in hot stars. it correlates so tightly with reddening that itturns out to be a reliable tool to measure it, following the relation e(b-v) =2.72 (+/- 0.03) x e.w.(ang), valid throughout the general interstellar mediumof our galaxy. the presence of a dib at 8648 ang is confirmed. its intensityappears unrelated to reddening, in agreement with scanty and preliminaryreports available in the literature, and its measurability is stronglycompromised by severe blending with underlying stellar hei doublet at 8649 ang.the two weak dibs at 8531 and 8572 ang do not appear real and should actuallybe blends of underlying stellar lines. the very weak dib at 8439 ang cannot beresolved within the profile of the much stronger underlying hydrogen paschen 18stellar line.

astro-ph;0105343	searching for the physical drivers of the eigenvector 1 correlation  space	[latex markup removed] we recently discussed an eigenvector 1 (e1) parameterspace that provides optimal discrimination between the principal classes ofbroad-line active galactic nuclei (agn). in this paper we begin a search forthe most important physical parameters that are likely to govern correlationsand data point distribution in e1 space. we focus on the principal opticalparameter plane involving the width of the h-beta broad component and theequivalent width ratio between the feii blend at 4570 a and h-beta broadcomponent. we show that the observed correlation for radio-quiet sources can beaccounted for if it is primarily driven by the ratio of agn luminosity to blackhole mass (l/m proportional to eddington ratio) convolved with sourceorientation. l/m apparently drives the radio-quiet correlation only forfwhm(h-beta) &lt; 4000 km/s which includes narrow line seyfert 1 (nlsy1) galaxiesand can be said to define an agn ``main sequence.'' source orientation plays anincreasingly important role as fwhm(h-beta) increases. we also argue that agnlying outside the radio-quiet ``main sequence,'' and specifically those withoptical feii much stronger than expected for a given fwhm(h-beta), may all bebroad absorption line qsos.

astro-ph;0205288	the mysterious eruption of v838 mon	v838 mon is marking one of the most mysterious stellar outbursts on record.the spectral energy distribution of the progenitor resembles an under-luminousf main sequence star (at v=15.6 mag), that erupted into a cool supergiantfollowing a complex and multi-maxima lightcurve (peaking at v=6.7 mag). theoutburst spectrum show baii, lii and lines of several s-elements, with widep-cyg profiles and a moderate and retracing emission in the balmer lines. alight-echo discovered expanding around the object helped to constrain thedistance (d=790+/-30 pc), providing m_v=+4.45 in quiescence and m_v=-4.35 atoptical maximum (somewhat dependent on the still uncertain e(b-v)=0.5reddening). the general outburst trend is toward lower temperatures and largerluminosities, and continuing so at the time of writing. the object propertiesconflict with a classification within already existing categories: theprogenitor was not on a post-agb track and thus the similarities with theborn-again agb stars fg sge, v605 aql and sakurai's object are limited to thecool giant spectrum at maximum; the cool spectrum, the moderate wind velocity(500 km/sec and progressively reducing) and the monotonic decreasing of the lowionization condition argues against a classical nova scenario. the closestsimilarity is with a star that erupted into an m-type supergiant discovered inm31 by rich et al. (1989), that became however much brighter by peaking atm_v=-9.95, and with v4332 sgr that too erupted into an m-type giant (martini etal. 1999) and that attained a lower luminosity, closer to that of v838 mon.m31-redvar, v4332 sgr and v838 mon could be manifestations of the same and newclass of astronomical objects.

astro-ph;0207088	v838 mon and the new class of stars erupting into cool supergiants  (secs)	v838 mon has undergone one of the most mysterious stellar outbursts onrecord. the spectrum at maximum closely resembled a cool agb star, evolvingtoward cooler temperatures with time, never reaching optically thin conditionsor a nebular stage. the latest spectral type recorded is m8-9. the amplitudepeaked at deltav=9 mag, with the outburst evolution being characterized by afast rise, three maxima over four months, and a fast decay (possibly driven bydust condensation in the ejecta). baii, lii and s-element lines were prominentin the outburst spectra. strong and wide (500 km/sec) p-cyg profiles affectedlow ionization species, while balmer lines emerged to modest emission onlyduring the central phase of the outburst. a light-echo discovered expandingaround the object constrains its distance to 790+/-30 pc, providing m_v=+4.45in quiescence and m_v=-4.35 at optical maximum (dependent on the stilluncertain e(b-v)=0.5 reddening). the visible progenitor resembled a somewhatunder-luminous f0 main sequence star, that did not show detectable variabilityover the last half century. v838 mon together with m31-redvar and v4332 sgrseems to define a new class of astronomical objects: stars that erupt into coolsupergiants (secs). they do not develop optically thin or nebular phases, anddeep p-cyg profiles denounce large mass loss at least in the early outburstphases. their visible progenitors are located close to the main sequence, awayfrom the post-agb region. after the outburst, the remnants still closelyresemble the precursors (same brightness, same spectral type). many moresimilar objects could be buried among poorly studied novae that have beenclassified as miras on the base of a single spectrum at maximum brightness.

astro-ph;0501604	on the distance, reddening and progenitor of v838 mon	extensive optical and infrared photometry as well as low and high resolutionspectroscopy are used as inputs in deriving robust estimates of the reddening,distance and nature of the progenitor of v838 mon. the reddening is found toobey the r_v=3.1 law and amounts to (i) e(b-v)=0.86 from the interstellar naiand ki lines, (ii) e(b-v)=0.88 from the energy distribution of the b3vcomponent and (iii) e(b-v)=0.87 from the progression of extinction along theline of sight. the adopted e(b-v)=0.87(+/-0.01) is also the amount required byfitting the progenitor with theoretical isochrones of appropriate metallicity.the distance is estimated from (a) the galactic kinematics of the threecomponents of the interstellar lines, (b) the amount of extinction vs the hicolumn density and vs the dust emission through the whole galaxy in thatdirection, from (c) spectrophotometric parallax to the b3v companion, from (d)comparison of the observed color-magnitude diagram of field stars with 3dstellar population models of the galaxy, from (e) comparison of theoreticalisochrones with the components of the binary system in quiescence and found tobe around 10 kpc. pre-outburst optical and ir energy distributions show thatthe component erupting in 2002 was brighter and hotter than the b3v companion.the best fit is obtained for a 50,000 k source, 0.5 mag brighter than the b3vcompanion. comparison with theoretical isochrones suggests an age of 4 millionyear for the system and a mass around 65 m(sun) for the progenitor of theoutbursting component, which at the time of the outburst was approaching thecarbon ignition stage in its core. the 2002 event is probably just a shellthermonuclear event in the outer envelope of the star.

astro-ph;0506083	spectroscopic survey of the galaxy with gaia ii. the expected science  yield from the radial velocity spectrometer	the gaia mission is designed as a galaxy explorer, and will measuresimultaneously, in a survey mode, the five or six phase space parameters of allstars brighter than 20th magnitude, as well as providing a description of theirastrophysical characteristics. these measurements are obtained by combining anastrometric instrument with micro-arcsecond capabilities, a photometric systemgiving the magnitudes and colours in 15 bands and a medium resolutionspectrograph named the radial velocity spectrometer (rvs). the latterinstrument will produce spectra in the 848 to 874 nm wavelength range, with aresolving power r = 11 500, from which radial velocities, rotationalvelocities, atmospheric parameters and abundances can be derived. a companionpaper (katz et al. 2004) presents the characteristics of the rvs and itsperformance. this paper details the outstanding scientific impact of thisimportant part of the gaia satellite on some key open questions in present dayastrophysics. the unbiased and simultaneous acquisition of multi-epoch radialvelocities and individual abundances of key elements in parallel with theastrometric parameters is essential for the determination of the dynamicalstate and formation history of our galaxy. moreover, for stars brighter thanv=15, the resolving power of the rvs will give information about most of theeffects which influence the position of a star in the hertzsprung-russelldiagram, placing unprecedented constraints on the age, internal structure andevolution of stars of all types. finally, the rvs multi-epoch observations areideally suited to the identification, classification and characterisation ofthe many types of double, multiple and variable stars.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.
