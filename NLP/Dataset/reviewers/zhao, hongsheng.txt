0704.0094	timing and lensing of the colliding bullet clusters: barely enough time  and gravity to accelerate the bullet	we present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in themerging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical local group timing arguments.we consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.{\it marginally consistent} cdm models in newtonian gravity are found with atotal mass m_{cdm} = 1 x 10^{15}msun of cold dm: the bullet subhalo can movewith v_{dm}=3000km/s, and the "bullet" x-ray gas can move withv_{gas}=4200km/s. these are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that areaccelerable by the gravity of two truncated cdm halos in a hubble time evenwithout the ram pressure. consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end ofthe error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gaswould not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the hubble time. models withv_{dm}~ 4500km/s ~ v_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount m_{cdm}=7x10^{15}msun of cdm for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}msun of gas. ourresults are generalisable beyond general relativity, e.g., a speed of$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic mondian lensing model ofangus et al. (2007). however, mondian model with little hot dark matter$m_{hdm} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and cdm model with a small halo mass $\le1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.

0904.1425	n-body simulations for testing the stability of triaxial galaxies in  mond	we perform a stability test of triaxial models in modified newtonian dynamics(mond) using n-body simulations. the triaxial models considered here havedensities that vary with $r^{-1}$ in the center and $r^{-4}$ at large radii.the total mass of the model varies from $10^8\msun$ to $10^{10}\msun$,representing the mass scale of dwarfs to medium-mass elliptical galaxies,respectively, from deep mond to quasi-newtonian gravity. we build triaxialgalaxy models using the schwarzschild technique, and evolve the systems for 200keplerian dynamical times (at the typical length scale of 1.0 kpc). we findthat the systems are virial overheating, and in quasi-equilibrium with therelaxation taking approximately 5 keplerian dynamical times (1.0 kpc). for allsystems, the change of the inertial (kinetic) energy is less than 10% (20%)after relaxation. however, the central profile of the model is flattened duringthe relaxation and the (overall) axis ratios change by roughly 10% within 200keplerian dynamical times (at 1.0kpc) in our simulations. we further find thatthe systems are stable once they reach the equilibrium state.

0906.3880	structure formation by fifth force i: n-body vs. linear simulations	we lay out the frameworks to numerically study the structure formation inboth linear and nonlinear regimes in general dark-matter-coupled scalar fieldmodels, and give an explicit example where the scalar field serves as adynamical dark energy. adopting parameters of the scalar field which yield arealistic cmb spectrum, we generate the initial conditions for our n-bodysimulations, which follow the spatial distributions of the dark matter and thescalar field by solving their equations of motion using the multilevel adaptivegrid technique. we show that the spatial configuration of the scalar fieldtracks well the voids and clusters of dark matter. indeed, the propagation ofscalar degree of freedom effectively acts a fifth force on dark matterparticles, whose range and magnitude are determined by the two model parameters(mu, gamma), local dark matter density as well as the background value for thescalar field. the model behaves like the lcdm paradigm on scales relevant tothe cmb spectrum, which are well beyond the probe of the local fifth force andthus not significantly affected by the matter-scalar coupling. on scalescomparable or shorter than the range of the local fifth force, the fifth forceis perfectly parallel to gravity and their strengths have a fixed ratio2gamma^2 determined by the matter-scalar coupling, provided that the chameleoneffect is weak; if on the other hand there is a strong chameleon effect (i.e.,the scalar field almost resides at its effective potential minimum everywherein the space), the fifth force indeed has suppressed effects in high densityregions and shows no obvious correlation with gravity, which means that thedark-matter-scalar-field coupling is not simply equivalent to a rescaling ofthe gravitational constant or the mass of the dark matter particles.

0908.1109	kinematics at the edge of the galactic bulge: evidence for cylindrical  rotation	we present new results from brava, a large scale radial velocity survey ofthe galactic bulge, using m giant stars selected from the two micron all skysurvey catalogue as targets for the cerro tololo inter-american observatory 4mhydra multi-object spectrograph. the purpose of this survey is to construct anew generation of self-consistent bar models that conform to theseobservations. we report the dynamics for fields at the edge of the galacticbulge at latitudes b=-8 deg. and compare to the dynamics at b=-4 deg. we findthat the rotation curve v(r) is the same at b=-8 deg. as at b=-4 deg. that is,the galactic boxy bulge rotates cylindrically, as do boxy bulges of othergalaxies. the summed line of sight velocity distribution at b=-8 deg. isgaussian, and the binned longitude-velocity plot shows no evidence for either a(disk) population with cold dynamics or for a (classical bulge) population withhot dynamics. the observed kinematics are well modeled by an edge-on n-bodybar, in agreement with published structural evidence. our kinematicobservations indicate that the galactic bulge is a prototypical product ofsecular evolution in galaxy disks, in contrast with stellar population resultsthat are most easily understood if major mergers were the dominant formationprocess.

0908.3480	on the separation between baryonic and dark matter: evidence for phantom  dark matter?	the recent years have seen combined measurements of x-ray and (weak) lensingcontours for colliding galaxy clusters such as, for instance, the famous"bullet" cluster. these observations have revealed offsets in the peaks of thebaryonic and (dominant) gravitational matter component of order ~(100-200) kpc.such discrepancies are difficult to explain using modified theories for gravityother than dark matter. or are they not? here we use the concept of "phantomdark matter" that is based upon a newtonian interpretation of the mondiangravitational potential. we show that this idea is in fact capable of producingsubstantial offsets in idealistic density configurations, involving a uniformexternal field. however, when analysed in a mondian cosmological framework wededuce that the size (and probablity) of the effect is too small to explain theobserved offsets found in the most recent observations, at least in thesimplest incarnation of phantom dark matter as discussed here. the lensingcenters in merging galaxy clusters are likely very close to the centers of truemass even in a mondian cosmology. this gives the support to the idea thatneutrino-like non-collisional matter might be responsible for the observedoffsets of lensing and x-ray peaks.

0910.3207	structure formation by fifth force: power spectrum from n-body  simulations	we lay out the framework to numerically study nonlinear structure formationin the context of scalar-field-coupled cold dark matter models (phicdm models)where the scalar field phi serves as dynamical dark energy. adopting parametersfor the scalar field which yield a realistic cmb spectrum, we generate theinitial conditions for our nbody simulations, which follow the spatialdistributions of dark matter and the scalar field, by solving their equationsof motion using the multilevel adaptive grid technique. we show that thespatial configuration of the scalar field tracks both the voids and clusters ofdark matter. the phicdm model differs from standard lcdm at small scales withobservable modifications of, e.g., the mass function of halos as well as thematter power spectrum. nevertheless, the predictions of both models for thehubble expansion and the cmb spectrum are virtually indistinguishable. hence,galaxy cluster counts and weak lensing observations, which probe structureformation at small scales, are needed to falsify this class of models.

1001.3152	structure formation by the fifth force iii: segregation of baryons and  dark matter	in this paper we present the results of $n$-body simulations with a scalarfield coupled differently to cold dark matter (cdm) and baryons. the scalarfield potential and coupling function are chosen such that the scalar fieldacquires a heavy mass in regions with high cdm density and thus behaves like achameleon. we focus on how the existence of the scalar field affects theformation of nonlinear large-scale structure, and how the different couplingsof the scalar field to baryons and cdm particles lead to differentdistributions and evolutions for these two matter species, both on large scalesand inside virialized halos. as expected, the baryon-cdm segregation increasesin regions where the fifth force is strong, and little segregation in denseregions. we also introduce an approximation method to identify the virializedhalos in coupled scalar field models which takes into account the scalar fieldcoupling and which is easy to implement numerically. it is find that thechameleon nature of the scalar field makes the internal density profiles ofhalos dependent on the environment in a very nontrivial way.

1003.4753	comparing different realizations of modified newtonian dynamics: virial  theorem and elliptical shells	there exists several modified gravity theories designed to reproduce theempirical milgrom's formula (mond). here we derive analytical results in thecontext of the static weak-field limit of two of them (bimond, leading for agiven set of parameters to qumond, and teves). in this limit, these theoriesare constructed to give the same force field for spherical symmetry, but theirpredictions generally differ out of it. however, for certain realizations ofthese theories (characterized by specific choices for their free functions),the binding potential-energy of a system is increased, compared to itsnewtonian counterpart, by a constant amount independent of the shape and sizeof the system. in that case, the virial theorem is exactly the same in thesetwo theories, for the whole gravity regime and even outside of sphericalsymmetry, although the exact force fields are different. we explicitly showthis for the force field generated by the two theories inside an ellipticalshell. for more general free functions, the virial theorems are however notidentical in these two theories. we finally explore the consequences of theseanalytical results for the two-body force.

1008.1963	substructure lensing in galaxy clusters as a constraint on low-mass  sterile neutrinos in tensor-vector-scalar theory: the straight arc of abell  2390	certain covariant theories of the modified newtonian dynamics paradigm seemto require an additional hot dark matter (hdm) component - in the form ofeither heavy ordinary neutrinos or more recently light sterile neutrinos (sns)with a mass around 11ev - to be relieved of problems ranging from cosmologicalscales down to intermediate ones relevant for galaxy clusters. here we suggestusing gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to test such a marriage ofneutrino hdm and modified gravity, adopting the framework oftensor-vector-scalar theory (teves). unlike conventional cold dark matter(cdm), such hdm is subject to strong phase-space constraints, which allows oneto check cluster lens models inferred within the modified framework forconsistency. since the considered hdm particles cannot collapse intoarbitrarily dense clumps and only form structures well above the galacticscale, systems which indicate the need for dark substructure are of particularinterest. as a first example, we study the cluster lens abell 2390 and itsimpressive straight arc with the help of numerical simulations. based on ourresults, we outline a general and systematic approach to model cluster lensesin teves which significantly reduces the calculation complexity. we furtherconsider a simple bimodal lens configuration, capable of producing the straightarc, to demonstrate our approach. we find that such a model is marginallyconsistent with the hypothesis of 11ev sns. future work including more detailedand realistic lens models may further constrain the necessary sn distributionand help to conclusively assess this point. cluster lenses could thereforeprovide an interesting discriminator between cdm and such modified gravityscenarios supplemented by sns or other choices of hdm.

1101.1821	the life cycle of star cluster in a tidal field	the evolution of globular clusters due to 2-body relaxation results in anoutward flow of energy and at some stage all clusters need a central energysource to sustain their evolution. henon provided the insight that we do notneed to know the details of the energy production in order to understand therelaxation-driven evolution of the cluster, at least outside the core. heprovided two self-similar solutions for the evolution of clusters based on theview that the cluster as a whole determines the amount of energy that isproduced in the core: steady expansion for isolated clusters, and homologouscontraction for clusters evaporating in a tidal field. we combine these models:the half-mass radius increases during the first half of the evolution, anddecreases in the second half; while the escape rate approaches a constant valueset by the tidal field. we refer to these phases as `expansion dominated' and`evaporation dominated'. these simple analytical solutions immediately allow usto construct evolutionary tracks and isochrones in terms of cluster half-massdensity, cluster mass and galacto-centric radius. from a comparison to themilky way globular clusters we find that roughly 1/3 of them are in the second,evaporation-dominated phase and for these clusters the density inside thehalf-mass radius varies with the galactocentric distance r as rho_h ~ 1/r^2.the remaining 2/3 are still in the first, expansion-dominated phase and theirisochrones follow the environment-independent scaling rho_h ~ m^2; that is, aconstant relaxation time-scale. we find substantial agreement between milky wayglobular cluster parameters and the isochrones, which suggests that there is,as henon suggested, a balance between the flow of energy and the central energyproduction for almost all globular clusters.

1111.6681	testing quasilinear modified newtonian dynamics in the solar system	a unique signature of the modified newtonian dynamics (mond) paradigm is itspeculiar behavior in the vicinity of the points where the total newtonianacceleration exactly cancels. in the solar system, these are the saddle pointsof the gravitational potential near the planets. typically, such points areembedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` lamond predict significant deviations from newton's laws. as has been pointed outrecently, the earth-sun bubble may be visited by the lisa pathfinder spacecraftin the near future, providing a unique occasion to put these theories to adirect test. in this work, we present a high-precision model of the solarsystem's gravitational potential to determine accurate positions and motions ofthese saddle points and study the predicted dynamical anomalies within theframework of quasi-linear mond. considering the expected sensitivity of thelisa pathfinder probe, we argue that interpolation functions which exhibit a"faster" transition between the two dynamical regimes have a good chance ofsurviving a null result. an example of such a function is the qmond analog ofthe so-called simple interpolating function which agrees well with much of theextragalactic phenomenology. we have also discovered that several of saturn'soutermost satellites periodically intersect the saturn-sun bubble, providingthe first example of solar system objects that regularly undergo the mondregime.

0710.3616	coincidences of dark energy with dark matter -- clues for a simple  alternative?	a rare coincidence of scales in standard particle physics is needed toexplain why $\lambda$ or the negative pressure of cosmological dark energy (de)coincides with the positive pressure $p_0$ of random motion of dark matter (dm)in bright galaxies. recently zlosnik et al. (2007) propose to modify theeinsteinian curvature by adding a non-linear pressure from a medium flowingwith a four-velocity vector field $u^\mu$. we propose to check whether a smoothextension of gr with a simple kinetic lagrangian of $u^\mu$ can be constructed,and whether the pressure can bend space-time sufficiently to replace the rolesof a $w=-1$ de, $w=0$ cold dm and heavy neutrinos in explaining anomalousaccelerations at all scales. as a specific proof of concept we find avector-for-$\lambda$ model (${\mathbf v\lambda}$-model) and its variants. withessentially {\it no free parameters}, these appear broadly consistent with thesolar system, gravitational potentials in dwarf spiral galaxies and the bulletcluster of galaxies, early universe with inflation, structure formation andbbn, and late acceleration with a 1:3 ratio of dm:de.

0710.4935	is gravitational lensing by intercluster filaments always negligible?	intercluster filaments negligibly contribute to the weak lensing signal ingeneral relativity (gr), $\gamma_{n}\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. in the context ofrelativistic modified newtonian dynamics (mond) introduced by bekenstein,however, a single filament inclined by $\approx 45^\circ$ from the line ofsight can cause substantial distortion of background sources pointing towardsthe filament's axis ($\kappa=\gamma=(1-a^{-1})/2\sim 0.01$); this is rigorousfor infinitely long uniform filaments, but also qualitatively true for shortfilaments ($\sim 30$mpc), and even in regions where the projected matterdensity of the filament is equal to zero. since galaxies and galaxy clustersare generally embedded in filaments or are projected on such structures, thiscontribution complicates the interpretation of the weak lensing shear map inthe context of mond. while our analysis is of mainly theoretical interestproviding order-of-magnitude estimates only, it seems safe to conclude thatwhen modeling systems with anomalous weak lensing signals, e.g. the "bulletcluster" of clowe et al., the "cosmic train wreck" of abell 520 from mahdavi etal., and the "dark clusters" of erben et al., filamentary structures mightcontribute in a significant and likely complex fashion. on the other hand, ourpredictions of a (conceptual) difference in the weak lensing signal could, inprinciple, be used to falsify mond/teves and its variations.

0711.0958	perturbations in a non-uniform dark energy fluid: equations reveal  effects of modified gravity and dark matter	we propose a unified single-field description of the galactic dark matter andvarious uniform scalar fields for the inflation and cosmological constant. thetwo types of effects could originate from a fluid of both spatially andtemporally varying vacuum energy if the vacuum has an uneven pressure caused bya photon-like vector field (of perhaps an unstable massive boson). we propose amost general lagrangian with a {\bf n}on-{\bf u}niform cosmological constantfor this vacuum fluid (dubbed as a nu-lambda fluid), working within theframework of einsteinian gravity. this theory includes a continuous spectrum ofplausible dark energy theories and gravity theories, e.g., inflation,quintessence, k-essence, f(r), generalized einstein-aether f(k), mond, teves,bstv etc. theories. it also suggests new models such as a certain f(k+r) model,which suggests intriguing corrections to mond depending of redshift anddensity. some specific constructions of the nu-lambda fluid (e.g., zhao'sv-$\lambda$ model) closely resemble the $\lambda$cdm cosmology on large scale,but fit galaxy rotation curves as good as mond. perturbed einstein equations ina simple $f(k_4)$ model are solvable and show effects of a dm coupled to de.incorporating the perturbation equations here into standard simulations forcosmological structure growth offers a chance to falsify examples of thenu-lambda theories.

1306.2902	stirring n-body systems ii: necessary conditions for the dark matter  attractor	we study the evolution of the phase-space of collisionless n-body systemsunder repeated stirrings or perturbations, which has been shown to lead to aconvergence towards a limited group of end states. this so-called attractor waspreviously shown to be independent of the initial system and environmentalconditions. however the fundamental reason for its appearance is still unclear.it has been suggested that the origin of the attractor may be either radialinfall (ri), the radial orbit instability (roi), or energy exchange which, forinstance, happens during violent relaxation. here we examine the effects of aset of controlled perturbations, referred to as `kicks', which act in additionto the standard collisionless dynamics by allowing pre-specified instantaneousperturbations in phase-space. we first demonstrate that the attractor persistsin the absence of ri and roi by forcing the system to expand. we then considerradial velocity kicks in a rigid potential and isotropic velocity kicks, sincethere are no energy exchanges in these two recipes of kicks. we find that thesekicks do not lead to the attractor, indicating that the energy exchange in adynamic potential is indeed the physical mechanism responsible for theattractor.

0802.1073	galaxy bulges as tests of cdm vs mond in strong gravity	the tight correlation between galaxy bulges and their central black holemasses likely emerges in a phase of rapid collapse and starburst at highredshift, due to the balance of gravity on gas with the feedback force fromstarbursts and the wind from the black hole; the average gravity on per unitmass of gas is ~ 2 x 10^-10 m/sec^2 during the star burst phase. this level ofgravity could come from the real r^{-1} cusps of cold dark matter (cdm) halos,but the predicted gravity would have a large scatter due to dependence oncosmological parameters and formation histories. better agreement is found withthe gravity from the scalar field in some co-variant versions of mond, whichcan create the mirage of a newtonian effective dark halo of density pi r^{-1}near the center, where the characteristic surface density pi=130alpha^{-1} msunpc^{-2} and alpha is a fundamental constant of order unity fixed by thelagrangian of the co-variant theory if neglecting environmental effects.  we show with a toy analytical model and a hydrodynamical simulation that aconstant background gravity due to mond/teves scalar field implies a criticalpressure synchronizing starbursts and the formation of galaxy bulges andellipticals. a universal threshold for the formation of the brightest regionsof galaxies in a mondian universe suggests that the central bhs, bulges andellipticals would respect tight correlations like the m_{bulge}-m_{bh}-sigmarelations. in general mond tends to produce tight correlations in galaxyproperties because its effective halo has less freedom and scatter than cdmhalos.

0804.1588	dark fluid: towards a unification of empirical theories of galaxy  rotation, inflation and dark energy	empirical theories of dark matter like mond gravity and of dark energy likef(r) gravity were motivated by astronomical data. but could these theories bebranches rooted from a more general hence natural framework? here we proposethe natural lagrangian of such a framework based on simple dimensional analysisand co-variant symmetry requirements, and explore various outcomes in atop-down fashion. our framework preserves the co-variant formulation of gr, butallows the expanding physical metric be bent by a single new species of darkfluid flowing in space-time. its non-uniform stress tensor and current vectorare simply functions of a vector field of variable norm, resembling the4-vector electromagnetic potential description for the photon fluid, but isdark (e.g., by very early decoupling from the baryon-radiation fluid). the darkfluid framework naturally branches into a continuous spectrum of theories withdark energy and dark matter effects, including the $f(r)$ gravity, teves-liketheories, einstein-aether and $\nu\lambda$ theories as limiting cases. when thevector field degenerates into a pure higgs-like scalar field, we obtain thephysics for inflaton and quintessence. in this broad setting we emphasize thenon-constant dynamical field behind the cosmological constant effect, andhighlight plausible corrections beyond the classical mond predictions. choicesof parameters can be made to pass bbn, ppn, and causality constraints. the darkfluid is inspired to unify/simplify the astronomically successful ingredientsof previous constructions: the desired effects of inflaton plus quintessenceplus cold dm particle fields or mond-like scalar field(s) are shown largelyachievable by one vector field only.

0805.4400	testing alternative theories of dark matter with the cmb	we propose a method to study and constrain modified gravity theories for darkmatter using cmb temperature anisotropies and polarization. we assume that thetheories considered here have already passed the matter power-spectrum test oflarge-scale structure. with this requirement met, we show that a modifiedgravity theory can be specified by parametrizing the time evolution of itsdark-matter density contrast, which is completely controlled by the dark matterstress history. we calculate how the stress history with a givenparametrization affects the cmb observables, and a qualitative discussion ofthe physical effects involved is supplemented with numerical examples. it isfound that, in general, alternative gravity theories can be efficientlyconstrained by the cmb temperature and polarization spectra. there exist,however, special cases where modified gravity cannot be distinguished from thecdm model even by using both cmb and matter power spectrum observations, norcan they be efficiently restricted by other observables in perturbedcosmologies. our results show how the stress properties of dark matter, whichdetermine the evolutions of both density perturbations and the gravitationalpotential, can be effectively investigated using just the general conservationequations and without assuming any specific theoretical gravitational theorywithin a wide class.

1509.08457	the external field dominated solution in qumond &amp; aqual: application to  tidal streams	the standard $\lambda$cdm paradigm seems to describe cosmology and largescale structure formation very well. however, a number of puzzling observationsremain on galactic scales. an example is the anisotropic distribution ofsatellite galaxies in the local group. this has led to suggestions that amodified gravity theory might provide a better explanation than newtoniangravity supplemented by dark matter. one of the leading modified gravitytheories is modified newtonian dynamics (mond). for an isolated point mass, itboosts gravity by an acceleration-dependent factor of $\nu$.  recently, a much more computer-friendly quasi-linear formulation of mond(qumond) has become available. we investigate analytically the solution for apoint mass embedded in a constant external field of $\mathbf{g}_{ext}$. we findthat the potential is $\phi = - ~ \frac{gm \nu_{ext}}{r}\left(1 + \frac{k_0}{2}\sin^2 \theta \right)$, where $r$ is distance from the mass $m$ which is in anexternal field that `saturates' the $\nu$ function at the value $\nu_{ext}$,leading to a fixed value of $k_0 \equiv \frac{\partial ln ~ \nu}{\partial ln ~g_{ext}}$. in a very weak gravitational field $\left(\left| \mathbf{g}_{ext}\right| \ll a_0 \right)$, $k_0 = -\frac{1}{2}$. the angle $\theta$ is thatbetween the external field direction and the direction towards the mass.  our results are quite close to the more traditional aquadratic lagrangian(aqual) formulation of mond. we apply both theories to a simple model of thesagittarius tidal stream. we find that they give very similar results, with thetidal stream seeming to spread slightly further in aqual.

0806.3080	mond plus classical neutrinos not enough for cluster lensing	clusters of galaxies offer a robust test bed for probing the nature of darkmatter that is insensitive to the assumption of the gravity theories. bothmodified newtonian dynamics (mond) and general relativity (gr) would requiresimilar amounts of non-baryonic matter in clusters as mond boosts the gravityonly mildly on cluster scales. gravitational lensing allows us to estimate theenclosed mass in clusters on small (20 - 50 kpc) and large (several 100 kpc)scales independent of the assumptions of equilibrium. here we show for thefirst time that a combination of strong and weak gravitational lensing effectscan set interesting limits on the phase space density of dark matter in thecenters of clusters. the phase space densities derived from lensingobservations are inconsistent with neutrino masses ranging from 2 - 7 ev, andhence do not support the 2 ev-range particles required by mond. to survive,plausible modifications for mond may be either an additional degree ofdynamical freedom in a co-variant incarnation or mass-varying theories ofneutrinos.

astro-ph;0110390	lcdm-based models for the milky way and m31 i: dynamical models	we apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction withincuspy halo models predicted by the standard lcdm cosmology. the resultingmodels score remarkably well when confronted with the broad range ofobservational data available for the milky way and m31 galaxies, giving a milkyway virial mass of 1-2x10^12msun and concentration c=12-17. we consider twotypes of models, in which: (a) baryons conserve angular momentum and (b) someof the angular momentum of the baryons is transferred to the dark matter.type-a models produce good agreement with observed rotation curves and obeyconstraints in the solar neighborhood, but may have too much dark matter in thecenter to allow a fast rotating bar. the type-b models with angular momentumtransport have a slightly more massive disk and less dark matter in the centralpart, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. both classes of models probablyhave sufficient baryonic mass in the central 3.5kpc to reproduce recentobservational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards thegalactic center. all models require that about 1/2 of all baryons expectedinside the virial radius must not be in the disk or bulge. we investigatewhether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models iscompatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function, and find arange of parameter space that is allowed by this constraint. we conclude thatrotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' high surface brightnessspiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard lcdm.

astro-ph;0110427	are dwarf spheroidal galaxies dark matter dominated or remnants of  disrupted larger satellite galaxies? -- a possible test	the failure of standard cosmolocical models in accounting for the statisticsof dwarf satellites and the rotation curve of gas-rich dwarf galaxies in detailhas led us to examine whether earlier non-equilibrium models of dwarfspheroidal satellites without any dark matter should be reconsidered in moredetail. such models can explain the high dispersion of the dwarf spheroids bythe projection of disrupted tidal debris. we show in the case of milky waysatellites, that these models predict a significant spread in the apparentmagnitude of horizontal branch stars which is correlated with sky position andvelocity. in particular, the models produce a strong correlation of radialvelocity with the long axis of the dwarf. current data do not set strong enoughconstraints on the models, but we suggest that photometric and spectroscopicsurveys of extra-tidal stars of nearby dwarf spheroids in the milky way andandromeda can falsify these models without dark matter.

astro-ph;0112096	feeding black holes at galactic centres by capture from isothermal cusps	we estimate the rate at which stars are captured by supermassive black holes(bhs) in the centres of bulges and elliptical galaxies assuming that theseinitially had an isothermal cusp (rho ~ r^{-2} with velocity dispersionsigma_*). if radial orbits can be adequately replenished a bh can growsignificantly by capturing stars and particles of the dark halo; the lattercould be up to 20--40 percent of the total mass captured. a tight relation m_bh10^8 (sigma_*/200\kms)^5 between bh hole mass and stellar velocity dispersionarises at the high mass end m_bh &gt;= 10^8 m_sun if these giant bhs growprimarily by swallowing stars. for smaller masses a gradual flattening of therelation and an increase of the scatter are expected due to tidal disruption ofstars. at moderate redshifts when bright galaxies may still possess isothermalcusps tidal disruption flares may be as frequent as 10^{-4} -- 10^{-2} yr^{-1}per galaxy, a few percent of the supernovae rate. efficient randomization ofthe orbits can occur when the dense cores of infalling satellites sink to thesphere of influence of the bh by dynamical friction. efficient replenishment ofthe loss cone of radial orbits can also explain why the supermassive binary bhsexpected in hierarchically merging galaxies do generally coalesce, as suggestedby the observed relation between bh mass and the inferred mass of stars ejectedfrom an isothermal cusp.

astro-ph;0207107	dynamical limits on galactic winds, halo machos and intergalactic  globular clusters	we argue that any violent galactic winds following early epoch of star burstswould significantly weaken the potentials of galaxies, and leave lastingsignatures such as a lowered dark halo density and preferentiallyradial/escaping orbits for halo tracers such as globular clusters. a galaxy isdisintegrated if more than half of its dynamical mass is blown off. thepresence of dense halos in galaxies and the absence of intergalactic/escapingglobulars should imply an upper limit on the amount of baryons lost in galacticwinds around 4% of the total mass of the galaxy. this translates to limits onthe baryons participating the early star bursts and baryons locked in stellarremnents, such as white dwarfs. the amount of halo white dwarfs claimed inrecent proper motion searches and microlensing observations in the galactichalo are too high to be consistent with our dynamical upper limits. similararguments also imply upper limits for the amount of neutron stars and stellarblack holes, in galaxy halos. nevertheless, a milder outflow is desirable,especially in dwarf galaxies, both for lowering their cold dark matter centraldensity and for injecting metals to the intergalactic medium.

astro-ph;0209304	a new mass degeneracy in gravitational lenses: is there a crisis between  a large $h_0$ and the time delay by a large lens halo?	isothermal models and other simple smooth models of dark matter halos ofgravitational lenses often predict a dimensionless time delay $h_0\delta t$much too small to be comfortable with the observed time delays $\delta t$ andthe widely accepted $h_0$ value ($\sim 70$ km/s/mpc). this conflict or crisisof the cdm has been highlighted by several recent papers of kochanek, whoclaims that the standard value of $h_0$ favors a strangely small halo ascompact as the stellar light distribution with an overall nearly keplerianrotation curve. in an earlier paper (paper i, astro-ph/0209191) we argue thatthis is not necessarily the case, at least in a perfectly symmetrical einsteincross system. here we introduce a {\it new mass degeneracy} of lens systems togive a counter example to kochanek's claims. we fit the time delay and imagepositions in the quadruple image system pg1115+080. equally good fits are foundbetween lens models with flat vs. keplerian rotation curves. time delays inboth types of models can be fit with the standard value of $h_0$. wedemonstrate that it may still be problematic to constrain the size of lens darkhalos even if the data image positions are accurately given and the cosmologyis precisely specified.

astro-ph;0312165	can satellites deliver substructures and black holes to inner halo by  dynamical friction?	a fully analytical formulation is developed to make dynamical frictionmodeling more realistic. the rate for a satellite to decay its orbit in a hostgalaxy halo is often severely overestimated when applying chandrasekhar'sformula without correcting for the tidal loss of the satellite and theadiabactic growth of the host galaxy potential over the hubble time. as asatellite decays to the inner and denser region of the host galaxy, the highambient density speeds up their exchange of energy and angular momentum, butshrinks the roche lobe of the satellite by tides. eventually both processes oforbital decay and tidal stripping hang up altogether once the satellite islight enough. these competing processes can be modeled analytically for asatellite if we parametrize the massloss history by an empirical formula. wealso incorporate the adiabatic contraction of orbits due to growth of the hostpotential well. observed dwarf galaxies often show a finite density core, whichdetermines how much inwards its remnants could be delivered to the host galaxy.ghost streams or remnant cores or globular clusters of satellites shouldpopulate preferentially the outer halo (e.g., the magellanic stream and theursa minor dwarf), rather than the inner halo (e.g., the sgr stream and theomega-cen cluster). massloss due to strong tides in the inner galaxy also makesit problematic for any small central black holes in nuclei of satellitegalaxies to decay in orbit and merge into the center of the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0403564	dynamical friction for dark halo satellites: effects of tidal massloss  and growing host potential	how fast a satellite decays its orbit depends on how slowly its mass is lostby tide. motivated by inner halo satellite remnants like the sgr and omega cen,we develop fully analytical models to study the orbital decay and tidalmassloss of satellites. the orbital decay rate is often severely overestimatedif applying the chandrasekhar's formula without correcting for (a) theevaporation and tidal loss of the satellite and (b) the contraction ofsatellite orbits due to adiabatic growth of the host galaxy potential over thehubble time. as a satellite migrates inwards, the increasing halo densityaffects the dynamical friction in two opposite ways:(1) it boosts the number ofhalo particles swept in the satellite's gravitational "wake", hence increasingthe drag on the satellite, and (2) it boosts the tide which "peels off" thesatellite, and reduces the amplitude of the wake. these competing processes canbe modeled analytically for a satellite with the help of an empirical formulafor the massloss history. the analytical model agrees with more numericalsimulations of tidal massloss and dynamical friction. rapid massloss due toincreasing tides at ever smaller radius makes it less likely for streams orremnants of infalling satellites to intrude the inner halo (as the sgr streamand ocen) than to stay in the outer halo (magellanic stream), hence anyintermediate-mass central black holes of the satellites are also likely "hungup" at large distances as well. to avoid "hung-up" the satellites might startwith (i) pericenters much smaller than the typical distances to present-dayobserved satellites and with (ii) central density much higher than in the oftenseen finite density cores of observed satellites.

astro-ph;0501625	mini-dark halos with intermediate mass black holes	we argue that the milky way (mw) contains thousands intermediate mass blackholes (imbhs) and minihalos with a fraction of imbhs still being enshrouded inextremely dense mini-spikes of dark matter (dm) particles. each containing$10^6\msun$ of dark particles and no baryons in a sphere of 50 pc radius, theminihalos are dense enough to survive the milky way tide with the nearestminihalo within 2 kpc from the sun. the imbh is formed off-centre in a minihaloby gas accretion, and its growth adiabatically compresses a finite density ofsurrounding dark matter into a $r^{-1.5}$ mini-spike. some imbhs recentre ontheir minihalos after dynamical friction, and some imbhs are ejected by birthkicks. detectable by glast, the mini-spikes and minihalos should stand out thebackground and dominate the neutralino annihilation in the smooth mw andsatellite galaxies. if they are the unidentified egret sources, upper limitscan be set on the branching ratio of neutralino annihilation. the supermassivebh of the mw, if orginates from an imbh, is also likely enshrouded with amini-spike.

astro-ph;0508635	a review on success and problem of mond on globular cluster scale	many past attempts to kill mond have only strengthened the theory. betterdata on galaxy velocity curves clearly favor mond (without fine-tuning) overcold dark matter. the usual critism on the incompleteness of classical mond hasspurred a modified relativity (mr) by bekenstein. after outlining cosmology andlensing in mond, we review mond on small scales. we point out some potentialproblems of mond in two-body relaxation and tidal truncation. we argue that thetidal field in any mond-like gravity theory predicts that the roche lobe sizesof a binary system are simply proportional to the binary baryonic mass ratio tothe power 1/3. an immediate application of this result is that the tidal fieldand tidal truncation radii of million-star globular clusters and million-stardwarf galaxies (e.g., the milky way satellites ngc2419 and carina) would bevery similar because of the one-to-one relation between gravity and baryondistribution. this prediction appears, however, inconsistent with the fact that{\it all} globulars are truncated to much smaller sizes than {\it all} dwarfgalaxies. whether tide is uniquely determined by baryons can also be used tofalsify any mond-like gravity theory, whether classical or relativistic.

astro-ph;0509590	testing bekenstein's relativistic mond gravity with lensing data	we propose to use multiple-imaged gravitational lenses to set limits ongravity theories without dark matter, specificly teves (bekenstein 2004), atheory which is consistent with fundamental relativistic principles and thephenomenology of modified newtonian dynamics (mond) theory. after setting theframework for lensing and cosmology, we derive analytically the deflectionangle for the point lens and the hernquist galaxy profile, and fitgalaxy-quasar lenses in the castles sample. we do this with three methods,fitting the observed einstein ring sizes, the image positions, or the fluxratios. in all cases we consistently find that stars in galaxies in mond/tevesprovide adequate lensing. bekenstein's toy $\mu$ function provides moreefficient lensing than the standard mond $\mu$ function. but for a handful oflenses [indicated in table 2,3, fig 16] a good fit would require a lens massorders of magnitude larger/smaller than the stellar mass derived fromluminosity unless the modification function $\mu$ and modification scale $a_0$for the universal gravity were allowed to be very different from what spiralgalaxy rotation curves normally imply. we discuss the limitation of presentdata and summarize constraints on the mond $\mu$ function. we also show thatthe simplest teves "minimal-matter" cosmology, a baryonic universe with acosmological constant, can fit the distance-redshift relation from thesupernova data, but underpredicts the sound horizon size at the lastscattering. we conclude that lensing is a promising approach to differentiatelaws of gravity (see also astro-ph/0512425).

astro-ph;0511713	roche lobe sizes in deep-mond gravity	modified newtonian dynamics (mond) is evolving from an empirical to a decenttheory respecting fundamental physics after bekenstein (2004) showed thatlensing and hubble expansion can be modeled rigourously in a modifiedrelativity. the degeneracy of mond with dark matter can be broken if we examinethe non-linear mondian poisson's equation in detail. here we study the effectof tides for a binary stellar system or a baryonic satellite-host galaxysystem. we show that the roche lobe is more squashed than the newtonian casedue to the anisotropic dilation effect in deep-mond. we prove analytically thatthe roche lobe volume scales linearly with the "true" baryonic mass ratio inboth newtonian and deep-mond regimes, insensitive to the modification to theinertia mass. hence accurate roche radii of satellites can break the degeneracyof mond and dark matter theory. globular clusters and dwarf galaxies ofcomparable luminosities and distances show a factor of ten scatter in limitingradii; this is difficult to explain in any "mass-tracing-light" universe. theresults here are generalizable to the intermediate mond regime for a wide classof gravity modification function $\mu(g)$ (zhao and tian, astro-ph/0511754).

astro-ph;0511754	roche lobe shapes for testing mond-like modified gravity	dark matter (dm) theories and mass-tracing-light theories like mond are byconstruction nearly degenerate on galactic scales, but not when it comes to thepredicted shapes of roche lobes of a two-body system (e.g., a globular clusterorbiting a host galaxy). we show that the flattening of the roche lobe issensitive to the function mu(g) in modification of the law of gravity. wegeneralise the analytical results obtained in the deep-mond limit by zhao(2005, astro-ph/0511713 and astro-ph/0512425), and consider a binary in theframework of a mond-like gravity modification function mu(g) or a generalnon-keplerian gravity g \propto r^-\zeta. we give analytical expressions forthe inner lagrange point and robe lobe axis ratios. the roche lobe volume isproven to scale linearly with the true mass ratio, which applies to any mu(g),hence mass-tracing light models would overpredict the roche lobe of a dm-poorglobular cluster in a dm-rich host galaxy, and underpredict the size of adm-richer dwarf satellite. the lobes are squashed with the flattening ~ 0.4 inthe strong gravity and ~ 0.6 in the weak gravity; a precise measurement of theflattening could be used to verify the anisotropic dilation effect which isgeneric to mond-like gravity. we generalise these results for extended massdistribution, and compare predicted roche radii in different gravity theorieswith limiting radii of observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxy satellites.

astro-ph;0606216	can mond take a bullet? analytical comparisons of three versions of mond  beyond spherical symmetry	a proper test of modified newtonian dynamics (mond) in systems of non-trivialgeometries depends on modelling subtle differences in several versions of itspostulated theories. this is especially important for lensing and dynamics ofbarely virialised galaxy clusters with typical gravity of scale $\sim a_0 \sim1\aa{\rm s}^{-2}$. the original mond formula, the classical single fieldmodification of the poisson equation, and the multi-field general relativistictheory of bekenstein (teves) all lead to different predictions as we stray fromspherical symmetry. in this paper, we study a class of analytical mondianmodels for a system with a semi-hernquist baryonic profile. after presentingthe analytical distribution function of the baryons in spherical limits, wedevelop orbits and gravitational lensing of the models in non-sphericalgeometries. in particular, we can generate a multi-centred baryonic system witha weak lensing signal resembling that of the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-56with a bullet-like light distribution. we finally present analytical scale-freehighly non-spherical models to show the subtle differences between the singlefield classical mond theory and the multi-field teves theory.

astro-ph;0611132	insight into the baryon-gravity relation in galaxies	observations of spiral galaxies strongly support a one-to-one analyticalrelation between the inferred gravity of dark matter at any radius and theenclosed baryonic mass. it is baffling that baryons manage to settle the darkmatter gravitational potential in such a precise way, leaving no "messy"fingerprints of the merging events and "gastrophysical" feedbacks expected inthe history of a galaxy in a concordance universe. this correlation of gravitywith baryonic mass can be interpreted from several non-standard angles,especially as a modification of gravity called teves, in which no galactic darkmatter is needed. in this theory, the baryon-gravity relation is captured bythe dieletric-like function mu of modified newtonian dynamics (mond),controlling the transition from 1/r^2 attraction in the strong gravity regimeto 1/r attraction in the weak regime. here, we study this mu-function indetail. we investigate the observational constraints upon it from fittinggalaxy rotation curves, unveiling the degeneracy between the stellarmass-to-light ratio and the mu-function as well as the importance of thesharpness of transition from the strong to weak gravity regimes. we alsonumerically address the effects of non-spherical baryon geometry in theframework of non-linear teves, and exhaustively examine how the mu-functionconnects with the free function of that theory. in that regard, we exhibit thesubtle effects and wide implications of renormalizing the gravitationalconstant. we finally present a discontinuity-free transition betweenquasi-static galaxies and the evolving universe for the free function of teves,inevitably leading to a return to 1/r^2 attraction at very low accelerations inisolated galaxies.

astro-ph;0701792	galaxy bulge formation: interplay with dark matter halo and central  supermassive black hole	we present a simple scenario where the formation of galactic bulges wasregulated by the dark halo gravity and regulated the growth of the centralsupermassive black hole. assuming the angular momentum is low, we suggest thatbulges form in a runaway collapse due to the "gravothermal" instability oncethe central gas density or pressure exceeds certain threshold (xu &amp; zhao 2007).we emphasize that the threshold is nearly universal, set by the background nfwdark matter gravity $g_{dm} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-8}{\rm cm} {\rm sec}^{-2}$ inthe central cusps of halos. unlike known thresholds for gradual formation ofgalaxy disks, we show that the universal "halo-regulated" star formationthreshold for spheroids matches the very high star formation rate and starformation efficiency shown in high-redshift observations of central starburstregions. the starburst feedback also builds up a pressure shortly after thecollapse. this large pressure could both act outward to halt further infall ofgas from larger scale, and act inward to counter the compton-thick windlaunched from the central black hole in an eddington accretion. assuming thefeedback balancing inward and outward forces, our scenario naturally gives riseto the black hole-bulge relationships observed in the local universe.

0809.2087	the galactic potential and the asymmetric distribution of hypervelocity  stars	in recent years several hypervelocity stars (hvss) have been observed in thehalo of our galaxy. such hvss have possibly been ejected from the galacticcenter and then propagated in the galactic potential up to their currentposition. the recent survey for candidate hvss show an asymmetry in thekinematics of candidate hvss (position and velocity vectors), where moreoutgoing stars than ingoing stars (i.e. positive galactocentric velocities vs.negative ones) are observed. we show that such kinematic asymmetry, which islikely due to the finite lifetime of the stars and galactic potentialstructure, could be used in a novel method to probe and constrain the galacticpotential, identify the stellar type of the stars in the survey and estimatethe number of hvss. kinematics-independent identification of the stellar typesof the stars in such surveys (e.g. spectroscopic identification) could furtherimprove these results. we find that the observed asymmetry between ingoing andoutgoing stars favors specific galactic potential models. it also implies alower limit of ~54+-8 main sequence hvss in the survey sample (&gt;=648+-96 in thegalaxy), assuming that all of the main sequence stars in the survey originatefrom the galactic center. the other stars in the survey are likely to be hotblue horizontal branch stars born in the halo rather than stars ejected fromthe galactic center.

astro-ph;9409022	microlensing by the galactic bar	we compute the predicted optical depth and duration distribution ofmicrolensing events towards baade's window in a model composed of a galacticdisk and a bar. the bar model is a self-consistent dynamical model built out ofindividual orbits that has been populated to be consistent with the cobe mapsof the galaxy and kinematic observations of the bulge. we find most of thelenses are at 6.25 kpc in bw. the microlensing optical depth of a 2e10 msun barplus a truncated disk is (2.2+-0.3)e-6, consistent with the very large opticaldepth (3.2+-1.2)e-6 found by udalski et al. (1994). this prediction doublesthat of axisymmetric models by kiraga and paczynski (1994) since the bar iselongated along the line-of-sight. the large einstein radius and smalltransverse velocity dispersion also predict a longer event duration in the barmodel than the kp model. the event rate and duration distribution also dependon the lower mass cutoff of the lens mass function. with a 0.1msun cutoff, 5-7events of typical 20 days duration are expected for the ogle experimentaccording to our model, while udalski et al. observed 9 events with durationsfrom 8-62 days. on the other hand, if most of the lenses are brown dwarfs, ourmodel predicts too many short duration events; a ks test finds only 7%probability for the model with 0.01msun cutoff to be consistent with currentdata.

astro-ph;9409024	signatures of bulge triaxiality from kinematics in baade's window/	we study a sample of 62 baade's window (1,-4) k giants that have publishedproper motions, radial velocity and metallicity. we construct the velocityellipsoids for the metal rich stars and metal poor stars. we find a vertexdeviation characteristic of a non-axisymmetric system. the long axes of thevelocity ellipsoids of two samples point to two nearly perpendicular directions(lv,bv)=(-65+-9,+14+-9) and (25+-14,-11+-14) respectively. the vertexdeviations of the velocity ellipsoids cannot be consistently explained by anyoblate model. we populate orbits in a realistic bar potential with a gaussianvelocity distribution, allowing us to simulate and interpret observations. weconclude that the data are consistent with a triaxial bulge pointing towards(l,b) with l&lt;0 and b=0 as suggested by earlier work. we also predict that lowlatitude abs(b)&lt;4 deg bulge fields should show the vertex deviation morestrongly and would therefore be the best locations for future proper motionstudies. the metal rich and metal poor stars appear to occupy the direct boxyand retrograde loop orbits. the correlations between the metallicity and theorbit families can develop if the bulge forms dissipatively on a sufficientlylong time scale. however, it is difficult to reconcile the existence of suchcorrelations with a violent history for the potential of the inner galaxy.

astro-ph;9605030	on the microlensing optical depth of the galactic bar	the microlensing probability (optical depth $\tau$) toward the galacticcenter carries information about the mass distribution of the galacticbulge/bar, so can be used to constrain the very uncertain shape parameters ofthe bar. we find $tau$ depends on the bar mass, radial profile, angle, axisscale lengths and boxyness by a few simple analytical formulae, which shows:(1) $\tau$ is proportional to the mass of the bar, $m$. (2) $\tau$ falls alongthe minor axis with a strong gradient. (3) an oblate bulge can have moreoptical depth than a triaxial bar if the bar angle $\alpha&gt;45$ degress. (4)$\tau$ is the largest if the angle $\alpha$ and the axis ratio $y_0/x_0$conspires so that $y_0/x_0=\tan \alpha$. (5) at a fixed field on the minor axisbut away from the center, boxy bars with a flat density profile tend to give alarger optical depth than ellipsoidal bars with a steep profile. (6) mainsequence sources should have a significantly lower (20-50\% lower) opticaldepth than red clump giants if main sequence stars are not observed as deep asthe bright clump giants.  an application to four cobe-constrained models (dwek et al. 1994) shows mostmodels produce optical depth $2\sigma$ lower than macho and ogle observedvalues even with both a massive bar $2.8\times 10^{10} m_\odot$ and a fulldisk. the high $\tau$ argues for a massive ($&gt; 2\times 10^{10}m_\odot$) boxybar with $y_0/x0\approx \tan\alpha$ and $\alpha&lt;20$ deg and with a flat radialprofile up to corotation.

astro-ph;9606166	possible implications of sagittarius type dwarf galaxy on microlensing  towards the large magellanic cloud	the discovery of the sgr dwarf galaxy (ibata, gilmore, irwin 1994) shows thatthe galactic halo contains large clumps which are not full viralized. stars insuch a clump can lense a background extragalactic source. i use parameters ofsgr to demonstrate that microlensing by a disintegrated dwarf galaxy has aprobability (optical depth) $10^{-7}-10^{-6}$, which is comparable to that ofan isothermal galactic dark halo of massive compact objects (machos). this maychange implications of observed microlensing events towards the lmc. if morethan one such clumps are hidden in the galactic halo, then given their enormousangular size ($\sim 5^o \times 20^o$), there is a significant chance for {\slany} line of sight, say the lmc direction, to intersect one of them. as analternative to the half-macho dark halo models (alcock et al. 1996a,c), idiscuss a non-macho model with lenses of the observed events being faint starsin a hidden sgr-like disintegrated dwarf in the line-of-sight path to the lmc.

astro-ph;9703097	microlensing of tidal debris on the magellanic great circle	increasing evidences suggest that the galactic halo is lumpy on kpc scalesdue to the accretion of at least a dozen small galaxies (lmc/smc, sgr, fornaxetc.). faint stars in such lumpy structures can significant microlense abackground star with an optical depth $10^{-7}-10^{-6}$, which is comparable tothe observed value to the lmc (alcock et al. 1996c). the observed severalmicrolensing events towards the lmc can be explained by a tidal debris taillying in the magellanic plane if the progenitor of the magellanic clouds andstream and other satellite galaxies in the magellanic plane has a mass abouttwice that of the disc of the lmc. the lmc stars can either lense stars in thedebris tail behind the lmc, or be lensed by stars in the part of debris tail infront of the lmc. the models are consistent with an elementary particledominated galactic halo without massive compact halo objects (machos). theyalso differ from sahu's (1994) lmc-self-lensing model by predicting a higheroptical depth and event rate and less concentration of events to the lmccenter.

astro-ph;9712177	the microlensing rate and mass function vs. dynamics of the galactic bar	with the steady increase of the sample size of observed microlenses towardsthe central regions of the galaxy, the main source of the uncertainty in thelens mass will shift from the simple poisson noise to the intrinsicnon-uniqueness of our dynamical models of the inner galaxy, particularly, thegalactic bar. we use a set of simple self-consistent bar models to investigatehow the microlensing event rate varies as a function of axis ratio, bar angleand velocity distribution. the non-uniqueness of the velocity distribution ofthe bar model adds a significant uncertainty (by about a factor of 1.5) to anyprediction of the lens mass. kinematic data and self-consistent models arecritical to lift the non-uniqueness. we discuss the implications of theseresults for the interpretation of microlensing observations of the galacticbulge. in particular we show that freeman bar models scaled to the mass of thegalactic bulge/bar imply a typical lens mass of around $0.8m_\odot$, a factorof 3-5 times larger than the value from other models.

astro-ph;9804304	the survival of the sgr dwarf galaxy and the flatness of the rotation  curve of the galaxy	how has the ``fluffy'' core of the sgr dwarf galaxy survived multiple strongshocks from the tidal force of the galactic halo and disc since the formationof the core a hubble time ago? a scenario that sgr was deflected to its currentorbit by the magellanic clouds after a rendezvous on the north galactic pole2-3 gyrs ago is examined. it is shown that the conditions of the collision fixboth the sense of circulation of sgr and the lmc around the galaxy and theslope of the galactic rotation curve. the model argues that the two orthogonalpolar circles traced by a dozen or so galactic halo dwarf galaxies and globularclusters (lmc-smc-magellanic stream-draco-ursa minor along $l \approx 270^o$and m54-ter 7-ter 8-arp 2-ngc 2419-pal 15 along $l \approx 0^o$) are streams oftidal relics from two ancient galaxies which was captured on two intersectingpolar rosette orbits by the galaxy. our results favor the interpretation ofmicrolensing towards the lmc being due to source or lens stars in tidalfeatures of the magellanic clouds. we discuss direct and indirect observationsto test the collision scenario.

astro-ph;9807243	tidal streams as probes of the galactic potential	we explore the use of tidal streams from galactic satellites to recover thepotential of the milky way. our study is motivated both by the discovery of thefirst lengthy stellar stream in the halo (\cite{it98}) and by the prospect ofmeasuring proper motions of stars brighter than 20th magnitude in such a streamwith an accuracy of $\sim 4\mu as/$yr, as will be possible with the spaceinterferometry mission (sim). we assume that the heliocentric radial velocitiesof these stars can be determined from supporting ground-based spectroscopicsurveys, and that the mass and phase-space coordinates of the galacticsatellite with which they are associated will also be known to sim accuracy.using results from numerical simulations as trial data sets, we find that, ifwe assume the correct form for the galactic potential, we can predict thedistances to the stars as a consequence of the narrow distribution of energyexpected along the streams. we develop an algorithm to evaluate the accuracy ofany adopted potential by requiring that the satellite and stars recombinewithin a galactic lifetime when their current phase-space coordinates areintegrated backwards. when applied to a four-dimensional grid of triaxiallogarithmic potentials, with varying circular velocities, axis ratios andorientation of the major-axis in the disk plane, the algorithm can recover theparameters used for the milky way in a simulated data set to within a fewpercent using only 100 stars in a tidal stream.

astro-ph;9902155	building galaxy models with schwarzschild method and spectral dynamics	tremendous progress has been made recently in modelling the morphology andkinematics of centers of galaxies. increasingly realistic models are built forcentral bar, bulge, nucleus and black hole of galaxies, including our own. thenewly revived schwarzschild method has played a central role in thesetheoretical modellings. here i will highlight some recent work at leiden onextending the schwarzschild method in a few directions. after a briefdiscussion of (i) an analytical approach to include stochastic orbits (zhao1996), and (ii) the ``pendulum effect'' of loop and boxlet orbits (zhao,carollo, de zeeuw 1999), i will concentrate on the very promising (iii)spectral dynamics method, with which not only can one obtain semi-analyticallythe actions of individual orbits as previously known, but also many otherphysical quantities, such as the density in configuration space and theline-of-sight velocity distribution of a superposition of orbits (copin, zhao &amp;de zeeuw 1999). the latter method also represents a drastic reduction ofstorage space for the orbit library and an increase in accuracy over thegrid-based schwarzschild method.

astro-ph;9906126	a radial velocity survey for lmc microlensed sources	we propose a radial velocity survey with the aim to resolve the currentdispute on the lmc lensing: in the pro-macho hypothesis the lenses are halowhite dwarfs or machos in general; in the pro-star hypothesis both the lensesand the sources are stars in various observed or hypothesized structures of themagellanic clouds and the galaxy. star-star lensing should prefer sources atthe backside or behind the lmc disc because lensing is most efficient if thesource is located a few kpc behind a dense screen of stars, here the thin discof the lmc. this signature of self-lensing can be looked for by a radialvelocity survey since kinematics of the stars at the back can be markedlydifferent from that of the majority of stars in the cold, rapidly rotating discof the lmc. detailed simulations of effect together with optimal strategies ofcarrying out the proposed survey are reported here. assuming that the existing30 or so alerted stars in the lmc are truely microlensed stars, theirkinematics can test the two lensing scenarios; the confidence level varies withthe still very uncertain structure of the lmc. spectroscopy of the existingsample and future events requires about two or three good-seeing nights peryear at a 4m-8m class southern telescope, either during the amplification phaseor long after.

astro-ph;9906214	reddening of microlensed lmc stars vs. the location of the lenses	we propose an observational test that can break the degeneracy of two mainclasses of microlensing models to the magellanic clouds: (a) the lenses arelocated in the galactic halo, and (b) the lenses are located in the lmc disk.the source stars in the latter (self-lensing) models tend to be at the far sideor behind the lmc disk, thus experience more reddening and extinction by dustin the lmc disk than ordinary stars in a nearby line of sight. clearly suchbias would not occur in the macho halo lensing models. we show that thisreddening effect is at a level readily observable for the present 30 or somicrolensing alerts fields, either with multi-band photometry from a goodseeing site, or more definitively with ultra-violet (uv) spectroscopy withspace telescope imaging spectrograph (stis). stars behind the lmc dust layershould stand out as uv-faint objects (by more than 1 mag than average stars inthe lmc). hst can also resolve numerous faint neighbouring stars within a fewarcsecs of a lensed source, hence remove blending in these crowded regions andbuild a reddening map to control the patchiness of dust.

astro-ph;9907191	extinction bias of microlensed stars towards the lmc and the fraction of  machos in the halo	we study the effect of reddening on microlensed stars towards the lmc. iflenses are in the lmc disk, then the source stars should be at the far side orbehind the lmc disk. thus they should experience more reddening and extinctionby dust in the lmc disk than typical stars in the immediate neighbouring linesof sight. we simulate this effect in a variety of models for the lmc stars anddust. we stress that the optical depth is not one number, but a function of thereddening of the survey stars. we discuss how these effects could be used toconstrain the fraction of machos in the dark halo. the effect of patchiness ofdust can be controled by working with faint stars in the smallest patches ofthe sky around the microlensed stars. this can be done most effectively withthe hubble space telescope in the ultra-violet. the non-detection of thereddening bias would be strongly in favor of machos in the galactic halo.

astro-ph;9907203	evolution of the galactic potential and halo streamers with future  astrometric satellites	esa's global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics (gaia) holds thepromise of mapping out the detailed phase space structure of the galactic haloby providing unprecedented annual proper motion and parallax of $1-10\muas$astrometric accuracy (gilmore et al. 1998). unlike nasa's space interferometrymission (sim), which will achieve similar accuracies but is a pointedinstrument, gaia will be able to construct a global catalogue of the halo. herewe study proper motions of giant branch stars in a tidal debris torn from asmall satellite system in the halo. we follow the evolution of a cold stream ona polar orbit between 8-50 kpc in a variety of histories of the galacticpotential, and observe the bright ($v&lt;18$mag) members of the debris tail withgaia accuracy. we simulate effects due to the growing or flipping of thegalactic disk over the past 4 gyrs or the perturbation from a massive accretedlump such as the progenitor of the magellanic clouds. our simulations suggestthat the results of johnston, zhao, spergel &amp; hernquist (1999) and helmi, zhao&amp; de zeeuw (1999) for static galactic potentials are likely to be largelygeneralizable to realistic time-dependent potentials: a tidal debris remainscold in spite of evolution and non-axial symmetry of the potential. gaia propermotion measurements of debris stars might be used to probe both galacticstructure and galactic history. we also study several other factors influencingour ability to identify streams, including accuracy of radial velocity andparallax data from gaia, and contamination from random field stars. we concludethat nearby, cold streams could be detected with gaia if these cousins of thesagittarius stream exist.

astro-ph;9907348	magnitude bias of microlensed sources towards the large magellanic cloud	there are lines of evidence suggesting that some of the observed microlensingevents in the direction of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) are caused byordinary star lenses as opposed to dark machos in the galactic halo. efficientlensing by ordinary stars generally requires the presence of one or moreadditional concentrations of stars along the line of sight to the lmc disk. ifsuch a population behind the lmc disk exists, then the source stars (forlensing by lmc disk objects) will be drawn preferentially from the backgroundpopulation and will show systematic differences from lmc field stars. one suchdifference is that the (lensed) source stars will be farther away than theaverage lmc field stars, and this should be reflected in their apparentbaseline magnitudes. we focus on red clump stars: these should appear in thecolor-magnitude diagram at a few tenths of a magnitude fainter than the fieldred clump. suggestively, one of the two near-clump confirmed events,macho-lmc-1, is a few tenths of magnitude fainter than the clump.

0810.2826	the relation between stellar mass and weak lensing signal around  galaxies: implications for mond	we study the amplitude of the weak gravitational lensing signal as a functionof stellar mass around a sample of relatively isolated galaxies. this selectionof lenses simplifies the interpretation of the observations, which consist ofdata from the red- sequence cluster survey and the sloan digital sky survey. wefind that the amplitude of the lensing signal as a function of stellar mass iswell described by a power law with a best fit slope \alpha= 0.74 \pm 0.08. thisresult is inconsistent with modified newtonian dynamics, which predicts \alpha= 0.5 (we find \alpha &gt; 0.5 with 99.7% confidence). as a related test, wedetermine the mond mass-to-light ratio as a function of luminosity. our resultsrequire dark matter for the most luminous galaxies (l &gt;=10^11 l_sun). we ruleout an extended halo of gas or active neutrinos as a way of reconciling ourfindings with mond. although we focus on a single alternative gravity model, wenote that our results provide an important test for any alternative theory ofgravity.

0811.3465	an ecological approach to problems of dark energy, dark matter, mond and  neutrinos	modern astronomical data on galaxy and cosmological scales have revealedpowerfully the existence of certain dark sectors of fundamental physics, i.e.,existence of particles and fields outside the standard models and inaccessibleby current experiments. various approaches are taken to modify/extend thestandard models. generic theories introduce multiple de-coupled fields a, b, c,each responsible for the effects of dm (cold supersymmetric particles), de(dark energy) effect, and mg (modified gravity) effect respectively. sometheories use adopt vanilla combinations like ab, bc, or ca, and assume a, b, cbelong to decoupled sectors of physics. mond-like mg and cold dm are oftentaken as opposite frameworks, e.g. in the debate around the bullet cluster.here we argue that these ad hoc divisions of sectors miss important clues fromthe data. the data actually suggest that the physics of all dark sectors islikely linked together by a self-interacting oscillating field, which governs achameleon-like dark fluid, appearing as dm, de and mg in different settings. itis timely to consider an interdisciplinary approach across all semanticboundaries of dark sectors, treating the dark stress as one identity, henceaccounts for several "coincidences" naturally.
