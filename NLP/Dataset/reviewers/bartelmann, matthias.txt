1001.4984	triaxial collapse and virialisation of dark-matter haloes	we reconsider the ellipsoidal-collapse model and extend it in two ways: wemodify the treatment of the external gravitational shear field, introducing ahybrid model in between linear and non-linear evolution, and we introduce avirialisation criterion derived from the tensor virial theorem to replace thead-hoc criterion employed so far. we compute the collapse parameters delta_cand delta_v and find that they increase with ellipticity e and decrease withprolaticity p. we marginalise them over the appropriate distribution of e and pand show the marginalised results as functions of halo mass and virialisationredshift. while the hybrid model for the external shear gives results verysimilar to those obtained from the non-linear model, ellipsoidal collapsechanges the collapse parameters typically by (20...50)%, in a way increasingwith decreasing halo mass and decreasing virialisation redshift. wequalitatively confirm the dependence on mass and virialisation redshift of afitting formula for delta_c, but find noticeable quantitative differences inparticular at low mass and high redshift. the derived mass function is in goodagreement with mass functions recently proposed in the literature.

1002.0676	soft clustering analysis of galaxy morphologies: a worked example with  sdss	context: the huge and still rapidly growing amount of galaxies in modern skysurveys raises the need of an automated and objective classification method.unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular interest, since theydiscover classes automatically. aims: we briefly discuss the pitfalls ofoversimplified classification methods and outline an alternative approachcalled "clustering analysis". methods: we categorise different classificationmethods according to their capabilities. based on this categorisation, wepresent a probabilistic classification algorithm that automatically detects theoptimal classes preferred by the data. we explore the reliability of thisalgorithm in systematic tests. using a small sample of bright galaxies from thesdss, we demonstrate the performance of this algorithm in practice. we are ableto disentangle the problems of classification and parametrisation of galaxymorphologies in this case. results: we give physical arguments that aprobabilistic classification scheme is necessary. the algorithm we presentproduces reasonable morphological classes and object-to-class assignmentswithout any prior assumptions. conclusions: there are sophisticated automatedclassification algorithms that meet all necessary requirements, but a lot ofwork is still needed on the interpretation of the results.

1004.2048	the lensing efficiencies of macs x-ray selected versus rcs optically  selected galaxy clusters	the statistics of strongly lensed arcs in samples of galaxy clusters provideinformation on cluster structure that is complementary to that from individualclusters. however, samples of clusters that have been analyzed to date havebeen either small, heterogeneous, or observed with limited angular resolution.we measure the lensed-arc statistics of 97 clusters imaged at high angularresolution with the hubble space telescope, identifying lensed arcs using twoautomated arc detection algorithms. the sample includes similar numbers ofx-ray selected (macs) and optically selected (rcs) clusters, and spans clusterredshifts in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1. we compile a catalogue of 42 arcs in thex-ray selected subsample and 7 arcs in the optical subsample. all but five ofthese arcs are reported here for the first time. at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.7, the x-rayselected clusters have a significantly higher mean frequency of arcs, 1.2+/-0.2per cluster, versus 0.2+/-0.1 in the optical sample. the strikingly differentlensing efficiencies indicate that x-ray clusters trace much larger massconcentrations, despite the similar optical luminosities of the x-ray andoptical clusters. the mass difference is supported also by the lower spacedensity of the x-ray clusters, and by the small einstein radii of the few arcsin the optical sample. higher-order effects, such as differences inconcentration or substructure, may also contribute.

1008.1076	weak gravitational lensing with deimos	we introduce a novel method for weak-lensing measurements, which is based ona mathematically exact deconvolution of the moments of the apparent brightnessdistribution of galaxies from the telescope's psf. no assumptions on the shapeof the galaxy or the psf are made. the (de)convolution equations are exact forunweighted moments only, while in practice a compact weight function needs tobe applied to the noisy images to ensure that the moment measurement yieldssignificant results. we employ a gaussian weight function, whose centroid andellipticity are iteratively adjusted to match the corresponding quantities ofthe source. the change of the moments caused by the application of the weightfunction can then be corrected by considering higher-order weighted moments ofthe same source. because of the form of the deconvolution equations, even anincomplete weighting correction leads to an excellent shear estimation ifgalaxies and psf are measured with a weight function of identical size. wedemonstrate the accuracy and capabilities of this new method in the context ofweak gravitational lensing measurements with a set of specialized tests andshow its competitive performance on the great08 challenge data. a complete c++implementation of the method can be requested from the authors.

1011.1559	a study of relative velocity statistics in lagrangian perturbation  theory with pinocchio	subject of this paper is a detailed analysis of the pinocchio algorithm forstudying the relative velocity statistics of merging haloes in lagrangianperturbation theory. given a cosmological background model, a power spectrum offluctuations as well as a gaussian linear density contrast field $\delta_{\rml}$ is generated on a cubic grid, which is then smoothed repeatedly withgaussian filters. for each lagrangian particle at position $\bmath{q}$ and eachsmoothing radius $r$, the collapse time, the velocities and ellipsoidaltruncation are computed using lagrangian perturbation theory. the collapsedmedium is then fragmented into isolated objects by an algorithm designed tomimic the accretion and merger events of hierarchical collapse. directly afterthe fragmentation process the mass function, merger histories of haloes and thestatistics of the relative velocities at merging are evaluated. wereimplemented the algorithm in c++, recovered the mass function and optimisedthe construction of halo merging histories. comparing our results with theoutput of the millennium simulation suggests that pinocchio is well suited forstudying relative velocities of merging haloes and is able to reproduce thepairwise velocity distribution.

1101.4653	lensed arc statistics: comparison of millennium-simulation galaxy  clusters to hubble space telescope observations of an x-ray selected sample	it has been debated for a decade whether there is a large overabundance ofstrongly lensed arcs in galaxy clusters, compared to expectations fromlambdacdm cosmology. we perform ray tracing through the most massive halos ofthe millennium simulation at several redshifts in their evolution, using thehubble ultra deep field as a source image, to produce realistic simulatedlensed images. we compare the lensed arc statistics measured from thesimulations to those of a sample of 45 x-ray selected clusters, observed withthe hubble space telescope, that we have analysed in horesh et al. (2010). theobservations and the simulations are matched in cluster masses, redshifts,observational effects, and the algorithmic arc detection and selection. atz=0.6 there are too few massive-enough clusters in the millennium volume for aproper statistical comparison with the observations. at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.5,however, we have large numbers of simulated and observed clusters, and thelatter are an unbiased selection from a complete sample. for these redshifts,we find excellent agreement between the observed and simulated arc statistics,in terms of the mean number of arcs per cluster, the distribution of number ofarcs per cluster, and the angular separation distribution. at z ~ 0.2 someconflict remains, with real clusters being ~3 times more efficient arcproducers than their simulated counterparts. this may arise due to selectionbiases in the observed subsample at this redshift, to some mismatch in massesbetween the observed and simulated clusters, or to physical effects that ariseat low redshift and enhance the lensing efficiency, but which are notrepresented by the simulations.

1102.0458	the influence of mergers on the cluster temperature function and  cosmological parameters derived from it	we develop a parameter-free analytic model to include the effects of mergersinto the theoretical modelling of the x-ray temperature function of galaxyclusters. we include this description into our model for the cluster populationbased on fluctuations of the gravitational potential, which avoids anyreference to mass. comparisons with a numerical simulation reveal that thetheoretical model is in good agreement with the simulation results. we showthat building the model on the dynamics of spherical rather than ellipsoidalcollapse yields better results if emission-weighted temperatures are used,while ellipsoidal collapse yields good agreement between model and simulationfor mass-weighted temperatures. analysing two different samples of x-rayclusters, we quantify the influence of mergers and a conversion betweendifferent temperature definitions on the joint determination of omega_m0 andsigma_8. if effects of mergers are included, temperature functions based oncluster masses and on the gravitational potential built on spherical collapseare in good agreement with other cosmological probes without any conversion oftemperatures.

1105.2295	the universal einstein radius distribution from 10,000 sdss clusters	we present results from strong-lens modelling of 10,000 sdss clusters, toestablish the universal distribution of einstein radii. detailed lensinganalyses have shown that the inner mass distribution of clusters can beaccurately modelled by assuming light traces mass, successfully uncoveringlarge numbers of multiple-images. approximate critical curves and the effectiveeinstein radius of each cluster can therefore be readily calculated, from thedistribution of member galaxies and scaled by their luminosities. we use asubsample of 10 well-studied clusters covered by both sdss and hst to calibrateand test this method, and show that an accurate determination of the einsteinradius and mass can be achieved by this approach "blindly", in an automatedway, and without requiring multiple images as input. we present the results ofthe first 10,000 clusters analysed in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.55$, and compare themto theoretical expectations. we find that for this all-sky representativesample the einstein radius distribution is log-normal in shape, with $&lt;log(\theta_{e}\arcsec)&gt;=0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$,$\sigma=0.316^{+0.004}_{-0.002}$, and with higher abundance of large$\theta_{e}$ clusters than predicted by $\lambda$cdm. we visually inspect eachof the clusters with $\theta_{e}&gt;40 \arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) and find that$\sim20%$ are boosted by various projection effects detailed here, remainingwith $\sim40$ real giant-lens candidates, with a maximum of $\theta_{e}=69\pm12\arcsec$ ($z_{s}=2$) for the most massive candidate, in agreement withsemi-analytic calculations. the results of this work should be verified furtherwhen an extended calibration sample is available.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1107.3920	shear-flexion cross-talk in weak-lensing measurements	gravitational flexion, caused by derivatives of the gravitational tidalfield, is potentially important for the analysis of the dark-matterdistribution in gravitational lenses, such as galaxy clusters or thedark-matter haloes of galaxies. flexion estimates rely on measurements ofgalaxy-shape distortions with spin-1 and spin-3 symmetry. we show in this paperthat and how such distortions are generally caused not only by the flexionitself, but also by coupling terms of the form (shear $\times$ flexion), whichhave hitherto been neglected. similar coupling terms occur between intrinsicgalaxy ellipticities and the flexion. we show, by means of numerical tests,that neglecting these terms can introduce biases of up to 85% on the $f$flexion and 150% on the $g$ flexion for galaxies with an intrinsic ellipticitydispersion of $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0.3$. in general, this bias depends on thestrength of the lensing fields, the ellipticity dispersion, and theconcentration of the lensed galaxies. we derive a new set of equations relatingthe measured spin-1 and spin-3 distortions to the lensing fields up to firstorder in the shear, the flexion, the product of shear and flexion, and themorphological properties of the galaxy sample. we show that this newdescription is accurate with a bias $\leq 7%$ (spin-1 distortion) and $\leq 3%$(spin-3 distortion) even close to points where the flexion approach breaks downdue to merging of multiple images. we propose an explanation why a spin-3signal could not be measured yet and comment on the difficulties in using amodel-fitting approach to measure the flexion signal.

1109.0285	moka: a new tool for strong lensing studies	strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the matterdistribution in the cores of massive dark matter haloes. recent and ongoinganalyses of galaxy cluster surveys (macs, cfhtls, sdss, sgas, clash, locuss)have adressed the question of the nature of the dark matter distribution inclusters. n-body simulations of cold dark-matter haloes consistently find thathaloes should be characterized by a concentration-mass relation that decreasesmonotonically with halo mass, and populated by a large amount of substructures,representing the cores of accreted progenitor halos. it is important for ourunderstanding of dark matter to test these predictions. we present moka, a newalgorithm for simulating the gravitational lensing signal from cluster-sizedhaloes. it implements the most recent results from numerical simulations tocreate realistic cluster-scale lenses with properties independent of numericalresolution. we perform systematic studies of the strong lensing cross sectionas a function of halo structures. we find that the strong lensing crosssections depend most strongly on the concentration and on the inner slope ofthe density profile of a halo, followed in order of importance by halotriaxiality and the presence of a bright central galaxy.

1201.1616	clash: precise new constraints on the mass profile of abell 2261	we precisely constrain the inner mass profile of abell 2261 (z=0.225) for thefirst time and determine this cluster is not "over-concentrated" as foundpreviously, implying a formation time in agreement with {\lambda}cdmexpectations. these results are based on strong lensing analyses of new 16-bandhst imaging obtained as part of the cluster lensing and supernova survey withhubble (clash). combining this with revised weak lensing analyses of subaruwide field imaging with 5-band subaru + kpno photometry, we place tight newconstraints on the halo virial mass m_vir = 2.2\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70(within r \approx 3 mpc/h70) and concentration c = 6.2 \pm 0.3 when assuming aspherical halo. this agrees broadly with average c(m,z) predictions from recent{\lambda}cdm simulations which span 5 &lt;~ &lt;c&gt; &lt;~ 8. our most significantsystematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight. to estimatethis, we also derive a mass profile based on archival chandra x-rayobservations and find it to be ~35% lower than our lensing-derived profile atr2500 ~ 600 kpc. agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axisratio along our line of sight. for this elongated halo model, we find m_vir =1.7\pm0.2\times10^15 m\odot/h70 and c_vir = 4.6\pm0.2, placing rough lowerlimits on these values. the need for halo elongation can be partially obviatedby non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors inthe x-ray mass measurements. we estimate the effect of background structuresbased on mmt/hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find these tend to lowermvir further by ~7% and increase cvir by ~5%.

1204.0372	constraints on cosmological parameters from strong gravitational lensing  by galaxy clusters	we investigate how observations of strong lensing can be used to infercosmological parameters, in particular the equation of state of dark energy. wefocus on the growth of the critical lines of lensing clusters with the sourceredshift as this behaviour depends on the distance-redshift relation and istherefore cosmologically sensitive. purely analytical approaches are generallyinsufficient because they rely on axisymmetric mass distributions and thuscannot take irregular critical curves into account. we devise a numericalmethod based on the metropolis-hastings algorithm: an elliptical generalizationof the nfw density profile is used to fit a lens model to an observedconfiguration of giant luminous arcs while simultaneously optimizing thegeometry. a semi-analytic method, which derives geometric parameters fromcritical points, is discussed as a faster alternative. we test the approacheson mock observations of gravitational lensing by a numerically simulatedcluster. we find that no constraints can be derived from observations ofindividual clusters if no knowledge of the underlying mass distribution isassumed. uncertainties are improved if a fixed lens model is used for a purelygeometrical optimization, but the choice of a parametric model may producestrong biases.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1204.3630	clash: mass distribution in and around macs j1206.2-0847 from a full  cluster lensing analysis	we derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster macsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification,and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field subaru bvriz' imaging and our recent16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) program. we find goodagreement in the regions of overlap between several weak and strong lensingmass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuringconsistency. the subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large scalestructure with the major axis running approximately north-west south-east(nw-se), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showingelongation with a \sim 2:1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. our full-lensingmass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln\sigma/dlnr\sim -1 at clusteroutskirts (r&gt;1mpc/h), whereas the mass distribution excluding the nw-se excessregions steepens further out, well described by the navarro-frenk-white form.assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass m_{vir}=(1.1\pm 0.2\pm0.1)\times 10^{15} m_{sun}/h and a halo concentration c_{vir} = 6.9\pm 1.0\pm1.2 (\sim 5.7 when the central 50kpc/h is excluded), which falls in the range4&lt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;7 of average c(m,z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent lambdacold dark matter simulations. our full lensing results are found to be inagreement with x-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and whencombined with chandra gas mass measurements, yield a cumulative gas massfraction of 13.7^{+4.5}_{-3.0}% at 0.7mpc/h (\approx 1.7r_{2500}), a typicalvalue observed for high mass clusters.

1204.6524	perturbation theory trispectrum in the time renormalisation approach	an accurate theoretical description of structure formation at least in themildly non-linear regime is essential for comparison with data from nextgeneration galaxy surveys. in a recent approach one follows the time evolutionof correlators directly and finds a hierarchy of evolution equations withincreasing order (pietroni 2008). so far, in this so called timerenormalisation group method the trispectrum was neglected in order to obtain aclosed set of equations. in this work we study the influence of the trispectrumon the evolution of the power spectrum. in order to keep the numerical cost ata manageable level we use the tree-level trispectrum from eulerian perturbationtheory. in comparison to numerical simulations we find improvement in themildly non-linear regime up to k = 0.25 h/mpc. beyond k = 0.25 h/mpc theperturbative description of the trispectrum fails and the method performs worsethan without the trispectrum included. our results reinforce the conceptualadvantage of the time renormalisation group method with respect to perturbationtheory.

1205.6906	the strongest gravitational lenses: i. the statistical impact of cluster  mergers	for more than a decade now, it has been controversial whether or not the highrate of giant gravitational arcs and the largest observed einstein radii areconsistent with the standard cosmological model. recent studies indicate thatmergers provide an efficient mechanism to substantially increase thestrong-lensing efficiency of individual clusters. based on purely semi-analyticmethods, we investigated the statistical impact of cluster mergers on thedistribution of the largest einstein radii and the optical depth for giantgravitational arcs of selected cluster samples. analysing representativeall-sky realizations of clusters at redshifts z &lt; 1 and assuming a constantsource redshift of z_s = 2.0, we find that mergers increase the number ofeinstein radii above 10 arcsec (20 arcsec) by ~ 35 % (~ 55 %). exploiting thetight correlation between einstein radii and lensing cross sections, we inferthat the optical depth for giant gravitational arcs with a length-to-widthratio &gt; 7.5 of those clusters with einstein radii above 10 arcsec (20 arcsec)increases by ~ 45 % (85 %). our findings suggest that cluster mergerssignificantly influence in particular the statistical lensing properties of thestrongest gravitational lenses. we conclude that semi-analytic studies mustinevitably take these events into account before questioning the standardcosmological model on the basis of the largest observed einstein radii and thestatistics of giant gravitational arcs.

1206.0618	relativistic virialization in the spherical collapse model for  einstein-de sitter and \lambda cdm cosmologies	spherical collapse has turned out to be a successful semi-analytic model tostudy structure formation in different de models and theories of gravity.nevertheless, the process of virialization is commonly studied on the basis ofthe virial theorem of classical mechanics. in the present paper, a fullygenerally-relativistic virial theorem based on the tolman-oppenheimer-volkoff(tov) solution for homogeneous, perfect-fluid spheres is constructed for theeinstein-de sitter and \lambda cdm cosmologies. we investigate the accuracy ofclassical virialization studies on cosmological scales and considervirialization from a more fundamental point of view. throughout, we remainwithin general relativity and the class of flrw models. the virializationequation is set up and solved numerically for the virial radius, y_{vir}, fromwhich the virial overdensity \delta_{v} is directly obtained. leading ordercorrections in the post-newtonian framework are derived and quantified. inaddition, problems in the application of this formalism to dynamical de modelsare pointed out and discussed explicitly. we show that, in the weak fieldlimit, the relative contribution of the leading order terms of thepost-newtonian expansion are of the order of 10^{-3}% and the solution of wang&amp; steinhardt (1998) is precisely reproduced. apart from the small corrections,the method could provide insight into the process of virialization from a morefundamental point of view.

1208.1766	miscentring in galaxy clusters: dark matter to brightest cluster galaxy  offsets in 10,000 sdss clusters	we characterise the typical offset between the dark matter (dm) projectedcentre and the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in 10,000 sdss clusters. to placeconstraints on the centre of dm, we use an automated strong-lensing analysis,mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption thatlight traces mass. the cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power-law,and the dm component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting alow-order 2d polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole rangeof polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. we find that the offsets betweenthe bcg and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the dm, \delta, aredistributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are welldescribed by a log-normal distribution with &lt;log_{10}(\delta [h^{-1}mpc])&gt;=-1.895^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, and \sigma=0.501\pm0.004 (95% confidencelevels), or &lt;log_{10}(\delta [\arcsec])&gt;=0.564\pm0.005, and\sigma=0.475\pm0.007. some of the offsets originate in prior misidentificationsof the bcg or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm,whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ~10% of theclusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributingto higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. our resultsconstitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions ofdm-to-bcg offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly showthat there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. theoffsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higherseparations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with thehierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise themerger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.[abridged]

1210.3067	the three-dimensional shapes of galaxy clusters	while clusters of galaxies are considered one of the most importantcosmological probes, the standard spherical modelling of the dark matter andthe intracluster medium is only a rough approximation. indeed, it is wellestablished both theoretically and observationally that galaxy clusters aremuch better approximated as triaxial objects. however, investigating theasphericity of galaxy clusters is still in its infancy. we review here thistopic which is currently gathering a growing interest from the clustercommunity. we begin by introducing the triaxial geometry. then we discuss thetopic of deprojection and demonstrate the need for combining different probesof the cluster's potential. we discuss the different works that have beenaddressing these issues. we present a general parametric framework intended tosimultaneously fit complementary data sets (x-ray, sunyaev zel'dovich andlensing data). we discuss in details the case of abell 1689 to show howdifferent models/data sets lead to different haloe parameters. we present theresults obtained from fitting a 3d nfw model to x-ray, sz, and lensing data for4 strong lensing clusters. we argue that a triaxial model generally allows tolower the inferred value of the concentration parameter compared to a sphericalanalysis. this may alleviate tensions regarding, e.g. the over-concentrationproblem. however, we stress that predictions from numerical simulations rely ona spherical analysis of triaxial halos. given that triaxial analysis will havea growing importance in the observational side, we advocate the need forsimulations to be analysed in the very same way, allowing reliable andmeaningful comparisons. besides, methods intended to derive the threedimensional shape of galaxy clusters should be extensively tested on simulatedmulti-wavelength observations.

1210.6021	order statistics applied to the most massive and most distant galaxy  clusters	in this work we present for the first time an analytic framework forcalculating the individual and joint distributions of the n-th most massive orn-th highest redshift galaxy cluster for a given survey characteristic allowingto formulate lcdm exclusion criteria. we show that the cumulative distributionfunctions steepen with increasing order, giving them a higher constrainingpower with respect to the extreme value statistics. additionally, we find thatthe order statistics in mass (being dominated by clusters at lower redshifts)is sensitive to the matter density and the normalisation of the matterfluctuations, whereas the order statistics in redshift is particularlysensitive to the geometric evolution of the universe. for a fixed cosmology,both order statistics are efficient probes of the functional shape of the massfunction at the high mass end. to allow a quick assessment of both orderstatistics, we provide fits as a function of the survey area that allowpercentile estimation with an accuracy better than two per cent. furthermore,we discuss the joint distributions in the two-dimensional case for differentcombinations of order.  having introduced the theory, we apply the order statistical analysis to thespt massive cluster sample and mcxc catalogue and find that the ten mostmassive clusters in the sample are consistent with lcdm and the tinker massfunction. in turn, by assuming the lcdm reference cosmology, order statisticscan also be utilised for consistency checks of the completeness of the observedsample and of the modelling of the survey selection function.

1304.1223	clash: complete lensing analysis of the largest cosmic lens macs  j0717.5+3745 and surrounding structures	the galaxy cluster macs j0717.5+3745 (z=0.55) is the largest known cosmiclens, with complex internal structures seen in deep x-ray, sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect and dynamical observations. we perform a combined weak and stronglensing analysis with wide-field bvri'z' subaru/suprime-cam observations and16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). we find consistent weakdistortion and magnification measurements of background galaxies, and combinethese signals to construct an optimally estimated radial mass profile of thecluster and its surrounding large-scale structure out to 5 mpc/h. we findconsistency between strong-lensing and weak-lensing in the region where theseindependent data overlap, &lt;500 kpc/h. the two-dimensional weak-lensing mapreveals a clear filamentary structure traced by distinct mass halos. we modelthe lensing shear field with 9 halos, including the main cluster, correspondingto mass peaks detected above 2.5\sigma_\kappa. the total mass of the cluster asdetermined by the different methods is m_{vir}=(2.8\pm0.4) \times 10^15 m_sun.although this is the most massive cluster known at z&gt;0.5, in terms of extremevalue statistics we conclude that the mass of macs j0717.5+3745 by itself isnot in serious tension with lambdacdm, representing only a ~2{\sigma} departureabove the maximum simulated halo mass at this redshift.

1304.5443	joint reconstruction of galaxy clusters from gravitational lensing and  thermal gas i. outline of a non-parametric method	we present a method to estimate the lensing potential from massive galaxyclusters for given observational x-ray data. the concepts developed and appliedin this work can easily be combined with other techniques to infer the lensingpotential, e.g. weak gravitational lensing or galaxy kinematics, to obtain anoverall best fit model for the lensing potential. after elaborating on thephysical details and assumptions the method is based on, we explain how thenumerical algorithm itself is implemented with a richardson-lucy algorithm as acentral part. our reconstruction method is tested on simulated galaxy clusterswith a spherically symmetric nfw density profile filled with gas in hydrostaticequilibrium. we describe in detail how these simulated observational data setsare created and how they need to be fed into our algorithm. we test therobustness of the algorithm against small parameter changes and estimate thequality of the reconstructed lensing potentials. as it turns out we achieve avery high degree of accuracy in reconstructing the lensing potential. thestatistical errors remain below 2.0% whereas the systematical error does notexceed 1.0%.

1304.7681	reconstructing the projected gravitational potential of galaxy clusters  from galaxy kinematics	we develop a method for reconstructing the two-dimensional, projectedgravitational potential of galaxy clusters from observed line-of-sight velocitydispersions of cluster galaxies. it is the third of an intended series ofpapers aiming at a unique reconstruction method for cluster potentialscombining lensing, x-ray, sunyaev-zel'dovich and kinematic data. the observedgalaxy velocity dispersions are deprojected using the richardson-lucyalgorithm. the obtained radial velocity dispersions are then related to thegravitational potential by using the tested assumption of a polytropic relationbetween the effective galaxy pressure and the density. once the gravitationalpotential is obtained in three dimensions, projection along the line-of-sightyields the two-dimensional potential. for simplicity we adopt sphericalsymmetry and a known profile for the anisotropy parameter of the galaxyvelocity dispersions. we test the method with a numerically simulated galaxycluster and galaxies identified therein. we extract a projectedvelocity-dispersion profile from the simulated cluster and pass it through ouralgorithm, showing that the deviation between the true and the reconstructedgravitational potential is less then 10% within approximately 1.2 mpc/h fromthe cluster centre.

1307.7026	a comparison of structure formation in minimally and non-minimally  coupled quintessence models	we study structure formation in non-minimally coupled dark energy models,where there is a coupling in the lagrangian between a quintessence scalar fieldand gravity via the ricci scalar. we consider models with a range of differentnon-minimal coupling strengths and compare these to minimally coupledquintessence models with time-dependent dark energy densities. the equations ofstate of the latter are tuned to either reproduce the equation of state of thenon-minimally coupled models or their background history. thereby they providea reference to study the unique imprints of coupling on structure formation. weshow that the coupling between gravity and the scalar field, which effectivelyresults in a time-varying gravitational constant g, is not negligible and itseffect can be distinguished from a minimally coupled model. we extend previouswork on this subject by showing that major differences appear in thedetermination of the mass function at high masses, where we observe differencesof the order of 40% at z=0. our new results concern effects on the non-linearmatter power spectrum and on the lensing signal (differences of ~10% for bothquantities), where we find that non-minimally coupled models could bedistinguished from minimally coupled ones.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1312.0943	three gravitationally lensed supernovae behind clash galaxy clusters	we report observations of three gravitationally lensed supernovae (sne) inthe cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) multi-cycletreasury program. these objects, sn clo12car (z = 1.28), sn cln12did (z =0.85), and sn cla11tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters,macsj1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), rxj1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and abell 383 (z =0.187), respectively. each sn was detected in hubble space telescope (hst)optical and infrared images. based on photometric classification, we find thatsne clo12car and cln12did are likely to be type ia supernovae (sne ia), whilethe classification of sn cla11tib is inconclusive. using multi-colorlight-curve fits to determine a standardized sn ia luminosity distance, weinfer that sn clo12car was approximately 1.0 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than fieldsne ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lensmagnification. similarly, sn cln12did is approximately 0.2 +/- 0.2 mag brighterthan field sne ia. we derive independent estimates of the predictedmagnification from clash strong+weak lensing maps of the clusters: 0.83 +/-0.16 mag for sn clo12car, 0.28 +/- 0.08 mag for sn cln12did, and 0.43 +/- 0.11mag for sn cla11tib. the two sne ia provide a new test of the cluster lensmodel predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the sn iabrightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. our resultsherald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed sne ia(from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution inclusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolutemagnifications.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1403.4573	the strongest gravitational lenses: iii. the order statistics of the  largest einstein radii	the einstein radius (er) of a gravitational lens encodes information aboutdecisive quantities such as halo mass, concentration, triaxiality, andorientation with respect to the observer. thus, the largest einstein radii canpotentially be utilised to test the predictions of the lcdm model. hitherto,studies have focussed on the single largest observed er. we extend thosestudies by employing order statistics to formulate exclusion criteria based onthe n largest einstein radii and apply these criteria to the strong lensinganalysis of 12 macs clusters at z&gt;0.5. we obtain the order statistics ofeinstein radii by a mc approach, based on the semi-analytic modelling of thehalo population on the past lightcone. after sampling the order statistics, wefit a gev distribution to the first-order distribution, which allows us toderive analytic relations for the order statistics of the einstein radii. wefind that the einstein radii of the 12 macs clusters are not in conflict withthe lcdm expectations. our exclusion criteria indicate that, in order toexhibit tension with the concordance model, one would need to observeapproximately twenty einstein radii &gt;30", ten &gt;35" or five &gt;42" in the range of0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0 on the full sky. furthermore, we find that, with increasing order,the haloes with the largest einstein radii are on average less aligned alongthe line-of-sight and less triaxial. in general, the cumulative distributionfunctions steepen for higher orders, giving them better constraining power.(abridged)

1408.1872	probing spatial homogeneity with ltb models: a detailed discussion	do current observational data confirm the assumptions of the cosmologicalprinciple, or is there statistical evidence for deviations from spatialhomogeneity on large scales? to address these questions, we developed aflexible framework based on spherically symmetric, but radially inhomogeneouslemaitre-tolman-bondi (ltb) models with synchronous big bang. we expanded the(local) matter density profile in terms of flexible interpolation schemes andorthonormal polynomials. a monte carlo technique in combination with recentobservational data was used to systematically vary the shape of these profiles.in the first part of this article, we reconsider giant ltb voids without darkenergy to investigate whether extremely fine-tuned mass profiles can reconcilethese models with current data. while the local hubble rate and supernovae caneasily be fitted without dark energy, however, model-independent constraintsfrom the planck 2013 data require an unrealistically low local hubble rate,which is strongly inconsistent with the observed value; this result agrees wellwith previous studies. in the second part, we explain why it seems natural toextend our framework by a non-zero cosmological constant, which then allows usto perform general tests of the cosmological principle. moreover, theseextended models facilitate explorating whether fluctuations in the local matterdensity profile might potentially alleviate the tension between local andglobal measurements of the hubble rate, as derived from cepheid-calibrated typeia supernovae and cmb experiments, respectively. we show that current dataprovide no evidence for deviations from spatial homogeneity on large scales.more accurate constraints are required to ultimately confirm the validity ofthe cosmological principle, however.

1408.2720	the strongest gravitational lenses: iv. the order statistics of the  largest einstein radii with cluster mergers	based on techniques developed in the previous papers of this series, weinvestigate the impact of galaxy-cluster mergers on the order statistics of thelargest einstein radii. we show that the inclusion of mergers significantlyshifts the extreme value distribution of the largest einstein radius to highervalues, typically increasing the expected value by ${\sim}10\%$. a comparisonwith current data reveals that the largest observed einstein radius agreesexcellently well with the theoretical predictions of the $\lambda$cdm model atredshifts $z &gt; 0.5$. at redshifts $z &lt; 0.5$, our results are somewhat morecontroversial. although cluster mergers also increase the expected values ofthe order statistics of the $n$ largest einstein radii by ${\sim}10\%$, thetheoretically expected values are notably lower (${\sim}3\sigma$ deviation for$n = 12$) than the largest einstein radii of a selected sample of sdss clustersin the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.55$. the uncertainties of the observedeinstein radii are still large, however, and thus the measurements need to becarefully revised in future works. therefore, given the premature state ofcurrent observational data, overall, there is still no reliable statisticalevidence for observed einstein radii to exceed the theoretical expectations ofthe standard cosmological model.

1411.1153	non-equilibrium statistical field theory for classical particles: linear  and mildly non-linear evolution of cosmological density power spectra	we use the non-equlibrium statistical field theory for classical particles,recently developed by mazenko and das and mazenko, together with the freegenerating functional we have previously derived for point sets initiallycorrelated in phase space, to calculate the time evolution of power spectra inthe free theory, i.e. neglecting particle interactions. we provide expressionstaking linear and quadratic momentum correlations into account. up to thispoint, the expressions are general with respect to the free propagator of themicroscopic degrees of freedom.  we then specialise the propagator to that expected for particles in cosmologytreated within the zel'dovich approximation and show that, to linear order inthe momentum correlations, the linear growth of the cosmological power spectrumis reproduced. quadratic momentum correlations return a first contribution tothe non-linear evolution of the power spectrum, for which we derive a simpleclosed expression valid for arbitrary wave numbers. this expression is aconvolution of the initial density power spectrum with itself, multiplied by amode-coupling kernel. we also derive the bispectrum expected in this theorywithin these approximations and show that its connected part reproduces almost,but not quite, the bispectrum expected in eulerian perturbation theory of thedensity contrast.

(2009), the evolution is constrained by a system of linear partialdifferential equations which need to be integrated numerically. we present anew numerical scheme using finite element methods to solve this equation systemand generate scalar initial conditions based on gaussian random fields with anunderlying power spectrum for the bardeen potential. after spherical harmonicdecomposition, the initial fluctuations are propagated in time and estimates ofangular power spectra of each gauge invariant variable are computed asfunctions of redshift. this allows to analyse the coupling strength in astatistical way. we find significant couplings up to $25\%$ for large and deepvoids of gpc scale as required to fit the distance redshift relations of sne.

[...] results.assuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the potentialsrecovered from gravitational lensing and from x-ray emission agree very wellbeyond 500 kpc. owing to the fact that the richardson-lucy deprojectionalgorithm allows deprojecting each line of sight independently, this result mayindicate that non-gravitational effects and/or asphericity are strong in thecentral regions of the clusters. conclusions. we demonstrate the robustness ofthe potential reconstruction method based on the richardson-lucy deprojectionalgorithm and show that gravitational lensing and x-ray emission lead toconsistent gravitational potentials. our results illustrate the power ofcombining galaxy-cluster observables in a single, non-parametric, jointreconstruction of consistent cluster potentials that can be used to locallyconstrain the physical state of the gas.

1504.03187	constraints on $\omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$ from the  potential-based cluster temperature function	the abundance of galaxy clusters is in principle a powerful tool to constraincosmological parameters, especially $\omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$, due tothe exponential dependence in the high-mass regime. while the best observablesare the x-ray temperature and luminosity, the abundance of galaxy clusters,however, is conventionally predicted as a function of mass. hence, theintrinsic scatter and the uncertainties in the scaling relations between massand either temperature or luminosity lower the reliability of galaxy clustersto constrain cosmological parameters. in this article, we further refine thex-ray temperature function for galaxy clusters by angrick et al., which isbased on the statistics of perturbations in the cosmic gravitational potentialand proposed to replace the classical mass-based temperature function, byincluding a refined analytic merger model and compare the theoreticalprediction to results from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. althoughwe find already a good agreement if we compare with a cluster temperaturefunction based on the mass-weighted temperature, including a redshift-dependentscaling between mass-based and spectroscopic temperature yields even betteragreement between theoretical model and numerical results. as a proof ofconcept, incorporating this additional scaling in our model, we constrain thecosmological parameters $\omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$ from an x-ray sampleof galaxy clusters and tentatively find agreement with the recent cosmicmicrowave background based results from the planck mission at 1$\sigma$-level.

1507.01953	extreme value statistics of weak lensing shear peak counts	the statistics of peaks in weak gravitational lensing maps is a promisingtechnique to constrain cosmological parameters in present and future surveys.here we investigate its power when using general extreme value statistics whichis very sensitive to the exponential tail of the halo mass function. to thisend, we use an analytic method to quantify the number of weak lensing peakscaused by galaxy clusters, large-scale structures and observational noise.doing so, we further improve the method in the regime of high signal-to-noiseratios dominated by non-linear structures by accounting for the embedding ofthose counts into the surrounding shear caused by large scale structures. wederive the extreme value and order statistics for both over-densities (positivepeaks) and under-densities (negative peaks) and provide an optimized criterionto split a wide field survey into sub-fields in order to sample thedistribution of extreme values such that the expected objects causing thelargest signals are mostly due to galaxy clusters. we find good agreement ofour model predictions with a ray-tracing $n$-body simulation. for a euclid-likesurvey, we find tight constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_\text{m}$ withrelative uncertainties of $\sim 10^{-3}$. in contrast, the equation of stateparameter $w_0$ can be constrained only with a $10\%$ level, and $w_\text{a}$is out of reach even if we include redshift information.

1507.06508	the projected gravitational potential of the galaxy cluster macs~j1206  derived from galaxy kinematics	we reconstruct the radial profile of the projected gravitational potential ofthe galaxy cluster macs-j1206 from 592 spectroscopic measurements of velocitiesof cluster members. for doing so, we use a method we have developed recentlybased on the richardson-lucy deprojection algorithm and an inversion of thespherically-symmetric jeans equation. we find that, within the uncertainties,our reconstruction agrees very well with a potential reconstruction from weakand strong gravitational lensing as well as with a potential obtained fromx-ray measurements. in addition, our reconstruction is in good agreement withseveral common analytic profiles of the lensing potential. varying theanisotropy parameter in the jeans equation, we find that isotropy parameterswhich are either small, $\beta\lesssim0.2$, or decrease with radius yieldpotential profiles which strongly disagree with that obtained fromgravitational lensing. we achieve the best agreement between our potentialprofile and the profile from gravitational lensing if the anisotropy parameterrises quite steeply to $\beta\approx0. 6$ within $\approx0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}$ andstays constant further out.

1512.05095	degeneracies of parametric lens model families near folds and cusps	we develop an approach to select families of lens models that can describedoubly and triply gravitationally lensed images near folds and cusps using themodel-independent ratios of lensing-potential derivatives derived in wagner &amp;bartelmann (2015). models are selected by comparing these model-independentratios of potential derivatives to (numerically determined) ratios of potentialderivatives along critical curves for entire lens model families in a givenrange of parameter values. this comparison returns parameter ranges which lensmodel families can reproduce observation within, as well as sections of thecritical curve where image sets of the observed type can appear. if themodel-independent potential-derivative ratios inferred from the observationfall outside the range of these ratios derived for the lens model family, theentire family can be excluded as a feasible model in the given volume inparameter space. we employ this approach for the family of singular isothermalspheres with external shear to examples of lensing by a galaxy and two galaxyclusters (jvas b1422+231, sdss j2222+2745, and macs j1149.5+2223) and show thatthe results obtained by our general method are in good agreement with resultsof previous model fits.

0806.4042	deconvolution with shapelets	we seek to find a shapelet-based scheme for deconvolving galaxy images fromthe psf which leads to unbiased shear measurements. based on the analyticformulation of convolution in shapelet space, we construct a procedure torecover the unconvolved shapelet coefficients under the assumption that the psfis perfectly known. using specific simulations, we test this approach andcompare it to other published approaches. we show that convolution in shapeletspace leads to a shapelet model of order $n_{max}^h = n_{max}^g + n_{max}^f$with $n_{max}^f$ and $n_{max}^g$ being the maximum orders of the intrinsicgalaxy and the psf models, respectively. deconvolution is hence atransformation which maps a certain number of convolved coefficients onto agenerally smaller number of deconvolved coefficients. by inferring the latternumber from data, we construct the maximum-likelihood solution for thistransformation and obtain unbiased shear estimates with a remarkable amount ofnoise reduction compared to established approaches. this finding isparticularly valid for complicated psf models and low $s/n$ images, whichrenders our approach suitable for typical weak-lensing conditions.

(2) it is confined to redshifts 0.2+-0.1, and tomasses (5+-3) x 10^14 solar masses. (3) using a particular measure for the weaklensing effect, viz. the aperture mass, cluster masses can be determined with arelative accuracy of ~20% if their density profile is known. consequently, themass function of the combined sample can accurately be measured. (4) forlow-density universes, i predict a sharp peak in the measured (aperture) massfunction near 5 x 10^14 solar masses and explain its origin, showing that thepeak will be absent in high-density universes. (5) the location of the peak andthe exponential decrease of the mass function on its high-mass side will allowthe determination of the amplitude of the dark-matter power spectrum on thecluster scale and the baryon fraction in clusters, and constrain the thermalhistory of the intracluster gas.

astro-ph;0011405	giant cluster arcs as a constraint on the scattering cross-section of  dark matter	we carry out ray tracing through five high resolution simulations of a galaxycluster to study how its ability to produce giant gravitationally lensed arcsis influenced by the collision cross-section of its dark matter. in three casestypical dark matter particles in the cluster core undergo between 1 and 100collisions per hubble time; two more explore the long (``collisionless'') andshort (``fluid'') mean free path limits. we study the size and shapedistributions of arcs and compute the cross-section for producing ``extreme''arcs of various sizes. even a few collisions per particle modify the corestructure enough to destroy the cluster's ability to produce long, thin arcs.for larger collision frequencies the cluster must be scaled up tounrealistically large masses before it regains the ability to produce giantarcs. none of our models with self-interacting dark matter (except the``fluid'' limit) is able to produce radial arcs; even the case with thesmallest scattering cross-section must be scaled to the upper limit of observedcluster masses before it produces radial arcs. apparently the elastic collisioncross-section of dark matter in clusters must be very small, below 0.1 cm^2g^-1, to be compatible with the observed ability of clusters to produce bothradial arcs and giant arcs.

astro-ph;0101430	gravitational lensing: effects of cosmology and of lens and source  profiles	we present detailed calculations of the magnification distribution, includingboth weak and strong lensing, using very recent solutions of the dyer-roeder(1973) equation for light propagation in a inhomogeneous universe with acosmological constant and up-to-date models for the evolving cosmologicaldistribution of dark matter halos. we address in particular the effect of anon-zero cosmological constant, of different density profiles of lenses, and offinite sizes of lensed sources.  we show that, if dark matter fluctuations are normalized to the local clusterabundance, in the presence of a cosmological constant the optical depth forlensing {\em decreases} compared to the case of an einstein-de sitter universe,because halos in the relevant mass range are less abundant over a largeredshift interval. we also discuss the differences in the magnificationprobability distributions produced by navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) and bysingular isothermal sphere (sis) density profiles of lenses. we find that thenfw lens is more efficient for moderate magnifications ($2\lsim a\lsim 4$), andless efficient for larger magnifications. moreover, we discuss quantitativelythe maximum magnification, $a_{\rm max}$, that can be achieved in the case ofextended sources (galaxies) with realistic luminosity profiles, taking intoaccount the possible ellipticity of the lens potential. finally, we apply ourresults to a class of sources following the luminosity evolution typical for aunified scheme of qso formation. we find that the lensed source counts at $850\mu$m can be larger than the unlensed ones by several orders of magnitude atflux densities $\gta100 $mjy.

astro-ph;0110647	cluster detection from surface-brightness fluctuations in sdss data	galaxy clusters can be detected as surface brightness enhancements insmoothed optical surveys. this method does not require individual galaxies tobe identifiable, and enables clusters to be detected out to surprisingly highredshifts, as recently demonstrated by the las campanas distant cluster survey(lcdcs). here, we investigate redshift limits for cluster detection in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). calibrating assumptions about the surfacebrightness profile, the mass-to-light ratio, and the spectral energydistribution of galaxy clusters using available observational data, we showthat it should be possible to detect galaxy groups out to redshifts of ~0.5,and massive galaxy clusters out to redshifts of ~1.2 in summed r'+i'+z' sdssdata. redshift estimates can be derived from the sdss magnitudes of brightestcluster members out to redshifts near unity. over the area of sky it covers,sdss should find &gt;~98% of the clusters detectable by the planck satellitethrough the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. the few planck clusters notdetected in sdss will almost all be at z&gt;~1.2.

astro-ph;0112456	predicting the clustering properties of galaxy clusters detectable for  the planck satellite	we study the clustering properties of the galaxy clusters detectable for theplanck satellite due to their thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. we take thepast light-cone effect and the redshift evolution of both the underlying darkmatter correlation function and the cluster bias factor into account. atheoretical mass-temperature relation allows us to convert the sensitivitylimit of a catalogue into a minimum mass for the dark matter haloes hosting theclusters. we confirm that the correlation length is an increasing function ofthe sensitivity limits defining the survey. using the expected characteristicsof the planck cluster catalogue, which will be a quite large and unbiasedsample, we predict the two-point correlation function and power spectrum fordifferent cosmological models. we show that the wide redshift distribution ofthe planck survey, will allow to constrain the cluster clustering properties upto z=1. the dependence of our results on the main cosmological parameters (thematter density parameter, the cosmological constant and the normalisation ofthe density power-spectrum) is extensively discussed. we find that the futureplanck clustering data place only mild constraints on the cosmologicalparameters, because the results depend on the physical characteristics of theintracluster medium, like the baryon fraction and the mass-temperaturerelation. once the cosmological model and the hubble constant are determined,the clustering data will allow a determination of the baryon fraction with anaccuracy of few per cent.

astro-ph;0201501	cluster cross sections for strong lensing: analytic and numerical lens  models	the statistics of gravitationally lensed arcs was recognised earlier as apotentially powerful cosmological probe. however, while fully numerical modelsfind orders of magnitude difference between the arc probabilities in differentcosmological models, analytic models tend to find markedly different results.we introduce in this paper an analytic cluster lens model which improves uponexisting analytic models in four ways. (1) we use the more realisticnavarro-frenk-white profile instead of singular isothermal spheres, (2) weinclude the effect of cosmology on the compactness of the lenses, (3) we useelliptical instead of axially symmetric lenses, and (4) we take the intrinsicellipticity of sources into account. while these improvements to the analyticmodel lead to a pronounced increase of the arc probability, comparisons withnumerical models of the same virial mass demonstrate that the analytic modelsstill fall short by a substantial margin of reproducing the results obtainedwith numerical models. using multipole expansions of cluster massdistributions, we show that the remaining discrepancy can be attributed tosubstructure inside clusters and tidal fields contributed by the clustersurroundings, effects that cannot reasonably and reliably be mimicked inanalytic models.

astro-ph;0203163	cosmological information from quasar-galaxy correlations induced by weak  lensing	the magnification bias of large-scale structures, combined with galaxybiasing, leads to a cross-correlation of distant quasars with foregroundgalaxies on angular scales of the order of arc minutes and larger. theamplitude and angular shape of the cross-correlation function w_qg containinformation on cosmological parameters and the galaxy bias factor. while theexistence of this cross-correlation has firmly been established, existing datadid not allow an accurate measurement of w_qg yet, but wide area surveys likethe sloan digital sky survey now provide an ideal database for measuring it.however, w_qg depends on several cosmological parameters and the galaxy biasfactor. we study in detail the sensitivity of w_qg to these parameters anddevelop a strategy for using the data. we show that the parameter space can bereduced to the bias factor b, omega_0 and sigma_8, and compute the accuracywith which these parameters can be deduced from sdss data. under reasonableassumptions, it should be possible to reach relative accuracies of the order of5%-15% for b, omega_0, and sigma_8. this method is complementary to otherweak-lensing analyses based on cosmic shear.

astro-ph;0302603	cd galaxy contribution to the strong lensing cross sections of galaxy  clusters	we perform ray-tracing simulations evaluating the effect of a cd galaxy onthe strong lensing properties of five galaxy cluster halos obtained from n-bodysimulations. the cd galaxy is modelled using both axially symmetric andelliptical models and assuming several masses for its dark matter halo. theeffect of the cd orientation with respect to the mass distribution of the hostgalaxy cluster is also investigated. the simulations are carried out in an openand a flat model universe with cosmological constant. we find that theenhancement of the cluster lensing cross sections for long and thin arcs due tothe presence of a massive cd at the cluster centre is typically less than 100%,depending on the model used for the cd galaxy and its orientation. the impactof the cd on the cluster efficiency for producing radially magnified images islarger only for those clusters whose lensing cross section for radial arcs isvery small in absence of the central galaxy. we conclude that the presence of acd galaxy at the cluster centre can only moderately influence the clusterefficiency for strong lensing and in particular fails to explain thediscrepancy between the observed number of giant arcs in galaxy clusters andtheir abundance predicted from lensing simulations in the currently mostfavoured $\lambda$cdm model.

astro-ph;0310898	the impact of cluster mergers on arc statistics	we study the impact of merger events on the strong lensing properties ofgalaxy clusters. previous lensing simulations were not able to resolvedynamical time scales of cluster lenses, which arise on time scales which areof order a gyr. in this case study, we first describe qualitatively with ananalytic model how some of the lensing properties of clusters are expected tochange during merging events. we then analyse a numerically simulated lensmodel for the variation in its efficiency for producing both tangential andradial arcs while a massive substructure falls onto the main cluster body. wefind that: (1) during the merger, the shape of the critical lines and causticschanges substantially; (2) the lensing cross sections for long and thin arcscan grow by one order of magnitude and reach their maxima when the extent ofthe critical curves is largest; (3) the cross section for radial arcs alsogrows, but the cluster can efficiently produce this kind of arcs only while themerging substructure crosses the main cluster centre; (4) while the arc crosssections pass through their maxima as the merger proceeds, the cluster's x-rayemission increases by a factor of $\sim5$. thus, we conclude that accountingfor these dynamical processes is very important for arc statistics studies. inparticular, they may provide a possible explanation for the arc statisticsproblem.

astro-ph;0407599	statistical distribution of gravitational-lensing excursion angles:  winding ways to us from the deep universe	we investigate statistical distributions of differences ingravitational-lensing deflections between two light rays, the so-called lensingexcursion angles. a probability distribution function of the lensing excursionangles, which plays a key role in estimates of lensing effects on angularclustering of objects (such as galaxies, qsos and also the cmb temperaturemap), is known to consist of two components; a gaussian core and an exponentialtail. we use numerical gravitational-lensing experiments in a lambda-cdmcosmology for quantifying these two components. we especially focus on thephysical processes responsible for generating those two components. we developa simple empirical model for the exponential tail which allows us to exploreits origin. we find that the tail is generated by the coherent lensing scatterby massive halos with m&gt;10^14h^-1msun at z&lt;1 and that its exponential shapearises due to the exponential cut-off of the halo mass function at that massrange. on scales larger than 1 arc minute, the tail does not have a practicalinfluence on the lensing effects on the angular clustering. our model predictsthat the coherent scatter may have non-negligible effects on angular clusteringat sub-arcminute scales.

astro-ph;0504206	the impact of gas physics on strong cluster lensing	previous studies of strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters neglectedthe potential impact of the intracluster gas. here, we compare simulations ofstrong cluster lensing including gas physics at increasing levels ofcomplexity, i.e. with adiabatic, cooling, star-forming, feedback-receiving, andthermally conducting gas, and with different implementations of the artificialviscosity in the sph simulations. each cluster was simulated starting from thesame initial conditions such as to allow directly comparing the simulatedclusters. we compare the clusters' shapes, dynamics and density profiles andstudy their strong-lensing cross sections computed by means of ray-tracingsimulations. we find that the impact of adiabatic gas depends on the amount ofturbulence that builds up, which means that the artificial viscosity plays animportant role. with the common viscosity implementation, adiabatic gas haslittle effect on strong cluster lensing, while lower viscosity allows strongerturbulence, thus higher non-thermal pressure and a generally broader gasdistribution which tends to lower lensing cross sections. conversely, coolingand star formation steepen the core density profiles and can thus increase thestrong-lensing efficiency considerably.

astro-ph;0606006	arc sensitivity to cluster ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures	we investigate how ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures separatelyaffect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.this is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constrainingcosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the innerstructure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. we do so by creatingtwo-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetricversions of some numerical models. on average, we find that the contributionsof ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% ofthe total strong lensing cross section, respectively. however, our analysisshows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical andasymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the clustercenters (~1mpc/h). conversely, their effect is less important in highlyasymmetric lenses. the morphology, position and flux of individual arcs arestrongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. removingsubstructures on spatial scales &lt;~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales&lt;~5 10^{10}m_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources usedin the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of thearcs longer than 5''. we conclude that any model for cluster lens cannotneglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. on the otherhand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitationallensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructuresand asymmetries in clusters.

astro-ph;0607547	arcfinder: an algorithm for the automatic detection of gravitational  arcs	we present an efficient algorithm designed for and capable of detectingelongated, thin features such as lines and curves in astronomical images, andits application to the automatic detection of gravitational arcs. the algorithmis sufficiently robust to detect such features even if their surface brightnessis near the pixel noise in the image, yet the amount of spurious detections islow. the algorithm subdivides the image into a grid of overlapping cells whichare iteratively shifted towards a local centre of brightness in their immediateneighbourhood. it then computes the ellipticity for each cell, and combinescells with correlated ellipticities into objects. these are combined to graphsin a next step, which are then further processed to determine properties of thedetected objects. we demonstrate the operation and the efficiency of thealgorithm applying it to hst images of galaxy clusters known to containgravitational arcs. the algorithm completes the analysis of an image with3000x3000 pixels in about 4 seconds on an ordinary desktop pc. we discussfurther applications, the method's remaining problems and possible approachesto their solution.

astro-ph;9403017	on the spin parameter of dark-matter haloes	the study by white (1984) on the growth of angular momentum in dark haloes isextended towards a more detailed investigation of the spin parameter$\lambda\equiv l\sqrt{e}/{g m^{2.5}}$. starting from the zel'dovichapproximation to structure formation, a dark halo is approximated by ahomogeneous ellipsoid with the inertial tensor of the (highly irregular)lagrangian region $\upsilon$ from which the dark halo forms. within thisapproximation, an expression for the spin parameter can be derived, whichdepends on the geometry of $\upsilon$, the cosmological density parameter$\omega_0$, the overdensity of the dark halo, and the tidal torque exerted onit. for gaussian random fields, this expression can be evaluated statistically.as a result, we derive a probability distribution of the spin parameter whichgives $\lambda\simeq0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, consistent with numericalinvestigations. this probability distribution steeply rises with increasingspin parameter, reaching its maximum at $\lambda\simeq0.025$. the 10 (50,90)percentile values are $\lambda=0.02$ (0.05,0.11, respectively). there is a weakanticorrelation of the spin parameter with the peak height $\nu$ of the densityfluctuation field $\lambda\propto \nu^{-0.29}$. the dependence on $\omega_0$and the variance $\sigma$ of the density-contrast field is very weak; there isonly a marginal tendency for the spin parameter to be slightly larger forlate-forming objects in an open universe. due to the weak dependence on$\sigma$, our results should be quite generally applicable and independent on

astro-ph;9412051	cluster mass estimates from weak lensing	the reliability of cluster lens reconstruction techniques based on weaklensing is studied in terms of the accuracy of their reproduction of the totalcluster mass as a function of distance from the cluster center. to do so, avariety of reconstruction algorithms is applied to synthetic lensing datacreated using a sample of 60 numerically modeled clusters, and the massreconstruction is compared to the known deflector mass. the results can besummarized as follows: (1) reconstruction algorithms which require integrationsextending over the entire real plane yield unreliable results, because theygive rise to boundary effects which are hard to control; mass overestimates aremore likely and more substantial in this case than underestimates. (2)reconstruction techniques which avoid these boundary effects yield reliablelower bounds to the cluster mass. the tightness of such bounds depends on thesize of the field, which can be extended synthetically to improve the resultsconsiderably. for the sample of numerical cluster models, the best lowerbounds, achieved by combining synthetic field extension with non-linear,finite-field reconstruction, decline from 100% to 80% of the true cluster massgoing from the cluster center to an angular distance of 2.5'. the 80% errorbars of the lower mass bounds are +/- 10% to 15%.

astro-ph;9505078	gravitational lensing of quasars by their damped lyman-alpha absorbers	damped lyman-alpha absorbers are believed to be associated with galacticdisks. we show that gravitational lensing can therefore affect the statisticsof these systems. first, the magnification bias due to lensing raises faintqsos above a given magnitude threshold and thereby enhances the probability forobserving damped absorption systems. second, the bending of light rays from thesource effectively limits the minimum impact parameter of the line-of-sightrelative to the center of the absorber, thus providing an upper cut-off to theobserved neutral hydrogen (hi) column density. the combination of these effectsyields a pronounced peak in the observed abundance of absorbers with highcolumn densities (&gt;2*10^{21} cm^{-2}) and low redshifts (z&lt;1). the inferredvalue of the cosmological density parameter of neutral hydrogen, omega_{hi},increases with increasing redshift and luminosity of the sources even if thetrue hi density remains constant. this trend resembles the observed evolutionof omega_{hi}(z). damped lyman-alpha absorbers with column densities &gt;10^{21}cm^{-2} and redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 are reliable flags for lensed qsos with a closepair of images separated by 0.3 arcsec. detection of these gravitationallensing signatures with the hubble space telescope can be used to constrain thedepth of the absorber potential-wells and the cosmological constant.

astro-ph;9601125	reanalysis of the association of high-redshift 1-jansky quasars with  iras galaxies	we develop a new statistical method to reanalyse angular correlations betweenbackground qsos and foreground galaxies that are supposed to be a consequenceof dark matter inhomogeneities acting as weak gravitational lenses. the methodis based on a weighted average over the galaxy positions and is optimized todistinguish between a random distribution of galaxies around qsos and adistribution which follows an assumed qso-galaxy two-point correlationfunction, by choosing an appropriate weight function. with simulations wedemonstrate that this weighted average is slightly more significant thanspearman's rank-order test which was used in previous investigations. inparticular, the advantages of the weighted average show up if the two-pointcorrelation function is weak. we then reanalyze the correlation betweenhigh-redshift 1-jansky qsos and iras galaxies, taken from the iras faint sourcecatalog; these samples were analyzed previously using spearman's rank-ordertest. in agreement with the previous work, we find moderate to strongcorrelations between these two samples; considering the angular two-pointcorrelation function of these samples, we find a typical scale of order $5'$from which most of the correlation signal derives. however, the statisticalsignificance of the correlation changes with the redshift slices of the qsosample one considers. comparing with simple theoretical estimates of theexpected correlation, we find that the signal we derive is considerablystronger than expected. on the other hand, recent direct verifications of theoverdensity of matter in the line-of-sight to high-redshift radio qsos obtainedfrom the shear field around these sources, indicates that the observedassociation can be attributed to a gravitational lens effect.

astro-ph;9602053	arcs from a universal dark-matter halo profile	navarro, frenk, \&amp; white have recently found numerically that the densityprofile of dark-matter halos can be described by a universal two-parameterfunction over a broad range of halo masses. the profile is singular,approaching the halo center with $\rho\propto r^{-1}$. it had been arguedpreviously that radially distorted, gravitationally lensed images of backgroundsources in galaxy clusters, so-called radial arcs, required a flat core in thecluster density profile. such radial arcs have so far been detected in twogalaxy clusters, in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile. ishow here that the profile suggested by navarro et al. can produce radial arcsdespite its central singularity, and describe how the two parameters of theprofile can be determined in clusters where radial and tangential arcs areobserved. i then apply this analysis to the two clusters where radial arcs weredetected. in both cases, the redshifts of the radial arcs are yet unknown,hence definitive conclusions on the profile parameters cannot yet be drawn.numerically determined values for the parameters of cluster-sized halos can,however, be used to predict the range of the unknown arc redshifts, thusproviding a direct observational test for the proposed density profile. apotential difficulty with the profile is that the radial magnification oftangential arcs is large, hence tangential arcs should be thick or theirsources should be very thin in the radial direction.

astro-ph;9603101	a comparison of x-ray and strong lensing properties of simulated x-ray  clusters	we use gas-dynamical simulations of galaxy clusters to compare their x-rayand strong lensing properties. special emphasis is laid on mass estimates. thecluster masses range between 6 x 10^14 solar masses and 4 x 10^15 solar masses,and they are examined at redshifts between 1 and 0. we compute the x-rayemission of the intracluster gas by thermal bremsstrahlung, add backgroundcontamination, and mimic imaging and spectral observations with current x-raytelescopes. although the beta model routinely provides excellent fits to thex-ray emission profiles, the derived masses are typically biased low because ofthe restricted range of radii within which the fit can be done. for beta valuesof ~ 2/3, which is the average in our numerically simulated sample, the mass istypically underestimated by ~ 40 per cent. the masses of clusters which exhibitpronounced substructure are often substantially underestimated. we suggest thatthe ratio between peak temperature and emission-weighted average clustertemperature may provide a good indicator for ongoing merging and, therefore,for unreliable mass estimates. x-ray mass estimates are substantially improvedif we fit a king density profile rather than the beta model to the x-rayemission, thereby dropping the degree of freedom associated with beta. clustersselected for their strong lensing properties are typically dynamically moreactive than typical clusters. bulk flows in the intracluster gas contain alarger than average fraction of the internal energy of the gas in such objects,hence the measured gas temperatures are biased low. the bulk of the opticaldepth for arc formation is contributed by clusters with intermediate ratherthan high x-ray luminosity. arcs occur predominantly in clusters which exhibitsubstructure and are not in an equilibrium state. finally we explain why the

astro-ph;9607095	aperture multipole moments from weak gravitational lensing	the projected mass of a gravitational lens inside (circular) apertures can bederived from the measured shear inside an annulus which is caused by the tidalfield of the deflecting mass distribution. here we show that also themultipoles of the two-dimensional mass distribution can be derived from theshear in annuli. we derive several expressions for these mass multipole momentsin terms of the shear, which allow large flexibility in the choice of a radialweight function. in contrast to determining multipole moments from weak-lensingmass reconstructions, this approach allows to quantify the signal-to-noiseratio of the multipole moments directly from the observed galaxy ellipticities,and thus to estimate the significance of the multipole detection. radial weightfunctions can therefore be chosen such as to optimize the significance of thedetection given an assumed radial mass profile. application of our formulae tonumerically simulated clusters demonstrates that the quadrupole moment ofrealistic cluster models can be detected with high signal-to-noise ratio s/n;in about 85 per cent of the simulated cluster fields s/n &gt;~ 3. we also showthat the shear inside a circular annulus determines multipole moments insideand outside the annulus. this is relevant for clusters whose central region istoo bright to allow the observation of the shear of background galaxies, orwhich extend beyond the ccd. we also generalize the aperture mass equation tothe case of `radial' weight functions which are constant on arbitrarily-shapedcurves which are not necessarily self-similar.

astro-ph;9905134	the core structure of galaxy clusters from gravitational lensing	we examine gravitational lensing constraints on the structure of galaxyclusters and compare them with the results of cosmological n-body simulationsof cluster formation in cold dark matter (cdm) dominated universes. we findthat cluster core masses, as measured by the observed location of gianttangential arcs, generally exceed those of dark matter halos of similarvelocity dispersion. the magnitude of the discrepancy is a strong function ofcluster mass. arc properties in the most massive clusters in the sample (i.e.those with velocity dispersion, \sigma \sim 1500-2000 km/s) are essentiallyconsistent with the n-body predictions. on the other hand, giant arcs in \sigma\sim 1000 km/s clusters can only be reconciled with cdm cluster halos if theirlensing power has been increased substantially by the presence of a massive(\sim 3 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} m_{\odot}) central galaxy and of significantsubstructure. best agreement is found if the mass of the central galaxy and theeffects of substructure are approximately independent of cluster mass. massivecentral galaxies with steep inner density profiles are also needed to explain aclear trend observed in our dataset between the radial thickness of gianttangential arcs and the velocity dispersion of the cluster lens. the positionand redshift of radial arcs may be used as independent tests of these results,but at present the dataset available is too limited to have a significantimpact on these conclusions. our results depend only weakly on the cosmologicalmodel adopted, and suggest that structural parameters of clusters derived fromstrong lensing studies cannot usefully constrain the values of cosmologicalparameters.
