0704.0138	circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in kerr  spacetimes	we have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of anearly extremal kerr black hole. for very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=j/m&gt;0.9524m) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum l_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.this behavior is in contrast with newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the "normal" behavior of black hole orbits. such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named "nearly horizon-skimming orbits". our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. the earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). using up-to-date teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. using kludge fluxesbased on a post-newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. we also find that the inclinationchange is, in any case, very small. as such, we conclude that these orbits arenot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveformsexpected to be measured by the space-based detector lisa.

0706.1513	how to tell a gravastar from a black hole	gravastars have been recently proposed as potential alternatives to explainthe astrophysical phenomenology traditionally associated to black holes,raising the question of whether the two objects can be distinguished at all.leaving aside the debate about the processes that would lead to the formationof a gravastar and the astronomical evidence in their support, we here addresstwo basic questions: is a gravastar stable against generic perturbations? ifstable, can an observer distinguish it from a black hole of the same mass? toanswer these questions we construct a general class of gravastars and determinethe conditions they must satisfy in order to exist as equilibrium solutions ofthe einstein equations. for such models we perform a systematic stabilityanalysis against axial-perturbations, computing the real and imaginary parts ofthe eigenfrequencies. overall, we find that gravastars are stable to axialperturbations, but also that their quasi-normal modes differ from those of ablack hole of the same mass and thus can be used to discern, beyond dispute, agravastar from a black hole.

0901.2722	can magnetic fields be detected during the inspiral of binary neutron  stars?	using accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations we assess theeffect that magnetic fields have on the gravitational-wave emission producedduring the inspiral and merger of magnetized neutron stars. in particular, weshow that magnetic fields have an impact after the merger, because they areamplified by a kelvin-helmholtz instability, but also during the inspiral, mostlikely because the magnetic tension reduces the stellar tidal deformation forextremely large initial magnetic fields, b_0&gt;~10^{17}g. we quantify theinfluence of magnetic fields by computing the overlap, o, between the waveformsproduced during the inspiral by magnetized and unmagnetized binaries. we findthat for any realistic magnetic field strength b_0&lt;~10^{14}g the overlap duringthe inspiral is o&gt;~0.999 and is quite insensitive to the mass of the neutronstars. only for unrealistically large magnetic fields like b_0~10^{17}g theoverlap does decrease noticeably, becoming at our resolutions o&lt;~0.76/0.67 forstars with baryon masses m_b~1.4/1.6 msun, respectively. because neutron starsare expected to merge with magnetic fields ~10^{8}-10^{10}g and because presentdetectors are sensitive to o&lt;~0.995, we conclude that it is very unlikely thatthe present detectors will be able to discern the presence of magnetic fieldsduring the inspiral of neutron stars.

0904.2577	predicting the direction of the final spin from the coalescence of two  black holes	knowledge of the spin of the black hole resulting from the merger of ageneric black-hole binary is of great importance for studying the cosmologicalevolution of supermassive black holes. several attempts have been made to modelthe spin via simple expressions exploiting the results of numerical-relativitysimulations. while these expressions are in reasonable agreement with thesimulations, they neglect the precession of the binary's orbital plane, andcannot therefore be applied directly -- i.e., without evolving the system tosmall separations using post-newtonian theory -- to binaries with separationslarger than a few hundred gravitational radii. while not a problem inprinciple, this may be impractical if the formulas are employed in cosmologicalmerger-trees or n-body simulations, which provide the spins and angularmomentum of the two black holes when their separation is of hundreds orthousands of gravitational radii. the formula that we propose is instead builton improved assumptions and gives, for any separation, a very accurateprediction both for the norm of the final spin and for its direction. bycomparing with the numerical data, we also show that the final-spin directionis very accurately aligned with the binary's total angular momentum at largeseparation. hence, observations of the final-spin direction (e.g. via a jet)can provide information on the binary's orbital plane at large separations andcould be relevant, for instance, for studying x-shaped radio sources.

0907.0462	gravitational-wave detectability of equal-mass black-hole binaries with  aligned spins	binary black-hole systems with spins aligned or anti-aligned to the orbitalangular momentum provide the natural ground to start detailed studies of theinfluence of strong-field spin effects on gravitational wave observations ofcoalescing binaries. furthermore, such systems may be the preferred end-stateof the inspiral of generic supermassive binary black-hole systems. in view ofthis, we have computed the inspiral and merger of a large set of binary systemsof equal-mass black holes with spins parallel to the orbital angular momentumbut otherwise arbitrary. our attention is particularly focused on thegravitational-wave emission so as to quantify how much spin effects contributeto the signal-to-noise ratio, to the horizon distances, and to the relativeevent rates for the representative ranges in masses and detectors. as expected,the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the projection of the total black holespin in the direction of the orbital momentum. we find that equal-spin binarieswith maximum spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum are more than"three times as loud" as the corresponding binaries with anti-aligned spins,thus corresponding to event rates up to 30 times larger. we also consider thewaveform mismatch between the different spinning configurations and find that,within our numerical accuracy, binaries with opposite spins s_1=-s_2 cannot bedistinguished whereas binaries with spin s_1=s_2 have clearly distinctgravitational-wave emissions. finally, we derive a simple expression for theenergy radiated in gravitational waves and find that the binaries always haveefficiencies e_rad/m &gt; 3.6%, which can become as large as e_rad/m = 10% formaximally spinning binaries with spins aligned with the orbital angularmomentum.

0707.2559	recoil velocities from equal-mass binary black-hole mergers: a  systematic investigation of spin-orbit aligned configurations	binary black-hole systems with spins aligned with the orbital angularmomentum are of special interest, as studies indicate that this configurationis preferred in nature. if the spins of the two bodies differ, there can be aprominent beaming of the gravitational radiation during the late plunge,causing a recoil of the final merged black hole. we perform an accurate andsystematic study of recoil velocities from a sequence of equal-mass black holeswhose spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and whose individualspins range from a = +0.584 to -0.584. in this way we extend and refine theresults of a previous study and arrive at a consistent maximum recoil of 448 +-5 km/s for anti-aligned models as well as to a phenomenological expression forthe recoil velocity as a function of spin ratio. this relation highlights anonlinear behavior, not predicted by the pn estimates, and can be readilyemployed in astrophysical studies on the evolution of binary black holes inmassive galaxies. an essential result of our analysis is the identification ofdifferent stages in the waveform, including a transient due to lack of aninitial linear momentum in the initial data. furthermore we are able toidentify a pair of terms which are largely responsible for the kick, indicatingthat an accurate computation can be obtained from modes up to l=3. finally, weprovide accurate measures of the radiated energy and angular momentum, findingthese to increase linearly with the spin ratio, and derive simple expressionsfor the final spin and the radiated angular momentum which can be easilyimplemented in n-body simulations of compact stellar systems. our code iscalibrated with strict convergence tests and we verify the correctness of ourmeasurements by using multiple independent methods whenever possible.

0912.2330	vacuum electromagnetic counterparts of binary black-hole mergers	as one step towards a systematic modeling of the electromagnetic (em)emission from an inspiralling black hole binary we consider a simple scenarioin which the binary moves in a uniform magnetic field anchored to a distantcircumbinary disc. we study this system by solving the einstein-maxwellequations in which the em fields are chosen with astrophysically consistentstrengths. we consider binaries with spins aligned or anti-aligned with theorbital angular momentum and study the dependence of gravitational and emsignals with these spin configurations. overall we find that the em radiationin the lowest l=2, m=2 multipole accurately reflects the gravitational one,with identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that differ only by a scalingfactor. we also compute the efficiency of the energy emission in em waves andfind that it is given by e^rad_em/m ~ 10^-15 (m/10^8 m_sun)^2 (b/10^4 g)^2,hence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational energy forrealistic magnetic fields. the corresponding luminosity is much smaller thanthe accretion luminosity if the system is accreting at near the eddington rate.most importantly, this em emission is at frequencies of 10^-4 (10^8 m_sun/m)hz, well outside those accessible to astronomical radio observations. as aresult, it is unlikely that the em emission discussed here can be detecteddirectly and simultaneously with the gravitational-wave one. however, indirectprocesses, driven by changes in the em fields behavior could yield observableevents. in particular if the accretion rate of the circumbinary disc is smalland sufficiently stable over the timescale of the final inspiral, then the ememission may be observable indirectly as it will alter the accretion ratethrough the magnetic torques exerted by the distorted magnetic field lines.

1001.3074	accurate evolutions of unequal-mass neutron-star binaries: properties of  the torus and short grb engines	we present new results from accurate and fully general-relativisticsimulations of the coalescence of unmagnetized binary neutron stars withvarious mass ratios. the evolution of the stars is followed through theinspiral phase, the merger and prompt collapse to a black hole, up until theappearance of a thick accretion disk, which is studied as it enters and remainsin a regime of quasi-steady accretion. although a simple ideal-fluid equationof state with \gamma=2 is used, this work presents a systematic study within afully general relativistic framework of the properties of the resultingblack-hole--torus system produced by the merger of unequal-mass binaries. morespecifically, we show that: (1) the mass of the torus increases considerablywith the mass asymmetry and equal-mass binaries do not produce significant toriif they have a total baryonic mass m_tot &gt;~ 3.7 m_sun; (2) tori with massesm_tor ~ 0.2 m_sun are measured for binaries with m_tot ~ 3.4 m_sun and massratios q ~ 0.75-0.85; (3) the mass of the torus can be estimated by the simpleexpression m_tor(q, m_tot) = [c_1 (1-q) + c_2](m_max-m_tot), involving themaximum mass for the binaries and coefficients constrained from thesimulations, and suggesting that the tori can have masses as large as m_tor ~0.35 m_sun for m_tot ~ 2.8 m_sun and q ~ 0.75-0.85; (4) using a novel techniqueto analyze the evolution of the tori we find no evidence for the onset ofnon-axisymmetric instabilities and that very little, if any, of their mass isunbound; (5) finally, for all the binaries considered we compute the completegravitational waveforms and the recoils imparted to the black holes, discussingthe prospects of detection of these sources for a number of present and futuredetectors.

1002.4185	em counterparts of recoiling black holes: general relativistic  simulations of non-keplerian discs	we investigate the dynamics of a circumbinary disc that responds to the lossof mass and to the recoil velocity of the black hole produced by the merger ofa binary system of supermassive black holes. we perform the firsttwo-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of\textit{extended} non-keplerian discs and employ a new technique to construct a"shock detector", thus determining the precise location of the shocks producedin the accreting disc by the recoiling black hole. in this way we can study howthe properties of the system, such as the spin, mass and recoil velocity of theblack hole, affect the mass accretion rate and are imprinted on theelectromagnetic emission from these sources. we argue that the estimates of thebremsstrahlung luminosity computed without properly taking into account theradiation transfer yield cooling times that are unrealistically short. at thesame time we show, through an approximation based on the relativisticisothermal evolution, that the luminosity produced can reach a peak value above$l \simeq 10^{43} \ {\rm erg/s} $ at about $\sim 30\,{\rm d}$ after the mergerof a binary with total mass $m\simeq 10^6 m_\odot$ and persist for several daysat values which are a factor of a few smaller. if confirmed by moresophisticated calculations such a signal could indeed lead to anelectromagnetic counterpart of the merger of binary black-hole system.

1007.2797	critical phenomena in neutron stars ii: head-on collisions	we consider the head-on collision of equal-mass neutron stars boosted towardseach other and we study the behavior of such systems near the threshold ofblack-hole formation. in particular, we confirm the previous findings by [1]that a type-i critical phenomenon can be observed by fine-tuning the initialmass of the two neutron stars. at the same time, we argue against theinterpretation that the critical solution is not a perturbed spherical star andshow instead that the metastable star corresponds to a (perturbed) equilibriumsolution on the unstable branch of the equilibrium configurations. as a result,the head-on collision of two neutron stars near the critical threshold can beseen as a transition in the space of configurations from an initial stablesolution over to a critical metastable one which can either migrate to a stablesolution or collapse to a black hole. the critical exponent for this processshows a fine structure which was already observed in the case of the criticalcollapse of scalar fields but never before for perfect fluids.

1007.2809	critical phenomena in neutron stars i: linearly unstable nonrotating  models	we consider the evolution in full general relativity of a family of linearlyunstable isolated spherical neutron stars under the effects of very small,perturbations as induced by the truncation error. using a simple ideal-fluidequation of state we find that this system exhibits a type-i criticalbehaviour, thus confirming the conclusions reached by liebling et al. [1] forrotating magnetized stars. exploiting the relative simplicity of our system, weare able carry out a more in-depth study providing solid evidences of thecriticality of this phenomenon and also to give a simple interpretation of theputative critical solution as a spherical solution with the unstable mode beingthe fundamental f-mode. hence for any choice of the polytropic constant, thecritical solution will distinguish the set of subcritical models migrating tothe stable branch of the models of equilibrium from the set of subcriticalmodels collapsing to a black hole. finally, we study how the dynamics changeswhen the numerically perturbation is replaced by a finite-size, resolutionindependent velocity perturbation and show that in such cases a nearly-criticalsolution can be changed into either a sub or supercritical. the work reportedhere also lays the basis for the analysis carried in a companion paper, wherethe critical behaviour in the the head-on collision of two neutron stars isinstead considered [2].

1007.4160	black hole-neutron star mergers and short grbs: a relativistic toy model  to estimate the mass of the torus	the merger of a binary system composed of a black hole and a neutron star mayleave behind a torus of hot, dense matter orbiting around the black hole. whilenumerical-relativity simulations are necessary to simulate this processaccurately, they are also computationally expensive and unable at present tocover the large space of possible parameters, which include the relative massratio, the stellar compactness, and the black hole spin. to mitigate this andprovide a first reasonable coverage of the space of parameters, we havedeveloped a method for estimating the mass of the remnant torus from blackhole-neutron star mergers. the toy model makes use of an improved relativisticaffine model to describe the tidal deformations of an extended tri-axialellipsoid orbiting around a kerr black hole and measures the mass of theremnant torus by considering which of the fluid particles composing the starare on bound orbits at the time of the tidal disruption. we tune the toy modelby using the results of fully general-relativistic simulations obtainingrelative precisions of a few percent and use it to extensively investigate thespace of parameters. in this way we find that the torus mass is largest forsystems with highly spinning black holes, small stellar compactnesses, andlarge mass ratios. as an example, tori as massive as ~1.33 solar masses can beproduced for a very extended star with compactness of ~0.1 inspiralling arounda black hole with dimensionless spin equal to 0.85 and mass ratio of about 0.3.however, for a more astrophysically reasonable mass ratio of ~0.14 and acanonical value of the stellar compactness of ~0.145, the toy model sets aconsiderably smaller upper limit to the torus mass of less than ~0.34 solarmasses.

1008.2212	dynamical damping terms for symmetry-seeking shift conditions	suitable gauge conditions are fundamental for stable and accuratenumerical-relativity simulations of inspiralling compact binaries. a number ofwell-studied conditions have been developed over the last decade for both thelapse and the shift and these have been successfully used both in vacuum andnon-vacuum spacetimes when simulating binaries with comparable masses. at thesame time, recent evidence has emerged that the standard "gamma-driver" shiftcondition requires a careful and non-trivial tuning of its parameters to ensurelong-term stable evolutions of unequal-mass binaries. we present a novel gaugecondition in which the damping constant is promoted to be a dynamical variableand the solution of an evolution equation. we show that this choice removes theneed for special tuning and provides a shift damping term which is free ofinstabilities in our simulations and dynamically adapts to the individualpositions and masses of the binary black-hole system. our gauge condition alsoreduces the variations in the coordinate size of the apparent horizon of thelarger black hole and could therefore be useful when simulating binaries withvery small mass ratios.

1009.0019	constraining scalar fields with stellar kinematics and collisional dark  matter	the existence and detection of scalar fields could provide solutions tolong-standing puzzles about the nature of dark matter, the dark compact objectsat the centre of most galaxies, and other phenomena. yet, self-interactingscalar fields are very poorly constrained by astronomical observations, leadingto great uncertainties in estimates of the mass $m_\phi$ and theself-interacting coupling constant $\lambda$ of these fields. to counter this,we have systematically employed available astronomical observations to developnew constraints, considerably restricting this parameter space. in particular,by exploiting precise observations of stellar dynamics at the centre of ourgalaxy and assuming that these dynamics can be explained by a single bosonstar, we determine an upper limit for the boson star compactness and imposesignificant limits on the values of the properties of possible scalar fields.requiring the scalar field particle to follow a collisional dark matter modelfurther narrows these constraints. most importantly, we find that if a scalardark matter particle does exist, then it cannot account for both thedark-matter halos and the existence of dark compact objects in galactic nuclei

1103.3526	will black hole-neutron star binary inspirals tell us about the neutron  star equation of state?	the strong tidal forces that arise during the last stages of the life of ablack hole-neutron star binary may severely distort, and possibly disrupt, thestar. both phenomena will imprint signatures about the stellar structure in theemitted gravitational radiation. the information from the disruption, however,is confined to very high frequencies, where detectors are not very sensitive.we thus assess whether the lack of tidal distortion corrections indata-analysis pipelines will affect the detection of the inspiral part of thesignal and whether these may yield information on the equation of state ofmatter at nuclear densities. using recent post-newtonian expressions andrealistic equations of state to model these scenarios, we find thatpoint-particle templates are sufficient for the detection of black hole-neutronstar inspiralling binaries, with a loss of signals below 1% for both second andthird-generation detectors. such detections may be able to constrainparticularly stiff equations of state, but will be unable to reveal thepresence of a neutron star with a soft equation of state.

1103.3874	accurate numerical simulations of inspiralling binary neutron stars and  their comparison with effective-one-body analytical models	binary neutron-star systems represent one of the most promising sources ofgravitational waves. in order to be able to extract important information,notably about the equation of state of matter at nuclear density, it isnecessary to have in hands an accurate analytical model of the expectedwaveforms. following our recent work, we here analyze more in detail twogeneral-relativistic simulations spanning about 20 gravitational-wave cycles ofthe inspiral of equal-mass binary neutron stars with different compactnesses,and compare them with a tidal extension of the effective-one-body (eob)analytical model. the latter tidally extended eob model is analyticallycomplete up to the 1.5 post-newtonian level, and contains an analyticallyundetermined parameter representing a higher-order amplification of tidaleffects. we find that, by calibrating this single parameter, the eob model canreproduce, within the numerical error, the two numerical waveforms essentiallyup to the merger. by contrast, analytical models (either eob, or taylor-t4)that do not incorporate such a higher-order amplification of tidal effects,build a dephasing with respect to the numerical waveforms of several radians.

1105.0122	collapse of differentially rotating neutron stars and cosmic censorship	we present new results on the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission fromthe collapse of differentially rotating neutron stars. we have considered anumber of polytropic stellar models having different values of thedimensionless angular momentum j/m^2, where j and m are the asymptotic angularmomentum and mass of the star, respectively. for neutron stars with j/m^2&lt;1,i.e., "sub-kerr" models, we were able to find models that are dynamicallyunstable and that collapse promptly to a rotating black hole. both the dynamicsof the collapse and the consequent emission of gravitational waves resemble theone seen for uniformly rotating stars, although with an overall decrease in theefficiency of gravitational-wave emission. for stellar models with j/m^2&gt;1,i.e., "supra-kerr" models, on the other hand, we were not able to find modelsthat are dynamically unstable and all of the computed supra-kerr models werefound to be far from the stability threshold. for these models a gravitationalcollapse is possible only after a very severe and artificial reduction of thepressure, which then leads to a torus developing nonaxisymmetric instabilitiesand eventually contracting to a stable axisymmetric stellar configuration.while this does not exclude the possibility that a naked singularity can beproduced by the collapse of a differentially rotating star, it also suggeststhat cosmic censorship is not violated and that generic conditions for asupra-kerr progenitor do not lead to a naked singularity.

1105.5615	general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics of accretion flows. i:  bondi-hoyle accretion	we present a new code for performing general-relativisticradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion flows onto black holes. theradiation field is treated in the optically-thick approximation, with theopacity contributed by thomson scattering and thermal bremsstrahlung. ouranalysis is concentrated on a detailed numerical investigation of hottwo-dimensional, bondi-hoyle accretion flows with various mach numbers. we findsignificant differences with respect to purely hydrodynamical evolutions. inparticular, once the system relaxes to a radiation-pressure dominated regime,the accretion rates become about two orders of magnitude smaller than in thepurely hydrodynamical case, remaining however super-eddington as are theluminosities. furthermore, when increasing the mach number of the inflowinggas, the accretion rates become smaller because of the smaller cross section ofthe black hole, but the luminosities increase as a result a stronger emissionin the shocked regions. overall, our approach provides the firstself-consistent calculation of the bondi-hoyle luminosity, most of which isemitted within r~100 m from the black hole, with typical values l/l_edd ~ 1-7,and corresponding energy efficiencies eta_bh ~ 0.09-0.5. the possibility ofcomputing luminosities self-consistently has also allowed us to compare withthe bremsstrahlung luminosity often used in modelling the electromagneticcounterparts to supermassive black-hole binaries, to find that in theoptically-thick regime these more crude estimates are about 20 times largerthan our radiation-hydrodynamics results.

1108.0060	black-hole horizons as probes of black-hole dynamics i: post-merger  recoil in head-on collisions	the understanding of strong-field dynamics near black-hole horizons is along-standing and challenging prob- lem in general relativity. recent advancesin numerical relativity and in the geometric characterization of black- holehorizons open new avenues into the problem. in this first paper in a series oftwo, we focus on the analysis of the recoil occurring in the merger of binaryblack holes, extending the analysis initiated in [1] with robinson- trautmanspacetimes. more specifically, we probe spacetime dynamics through thecorrelation of quantities defined at the black-hole horizon and at nullinfinity. the geometry of these hypersurfaces responds to bulk gravitationalfields acting as test screens in a scattering perspective of spacetimedynamics. within a 3 + 1 approach we build an effective-curvature vector fromthe intrinsic geometry of dynamical-horizon sections and correlate itsevolution with the flux of bondi linear momentum at large distances. we employthis setup to study numerically the head-on collision of nonspinning blackholes and demonstrate its validity to track the qualita- tive aspects of recoildynamics at infinity. we also make contact with the suggestion that theantikick can be described in terms of a "slowness parameter" and how this canbe computed from the local properties of the horizon. in a companion paper [2]we will further elaborate on the geometric aspects of this approach and on itsrelation with other approaches to characterize dynamical properties ofblack-hole horizons.

0710.3345	the final spin from the coalescence of aligned-spin black-hole binaries	determining the final spin of a black-hole (bh) binary is a question of keyimportance in astrophysics. modelling this quantity in general is madedifficult by the fact that it depends on the 7-dimensional space of parameterscharacterizing the two initial black holes. however, in special cases, whensymmetries can be exploited, the description can become simpler. for black-holebinaries with unequal masses but with equal spins which are aligned with theorbital angular momentum, we show that the use of recent simulations and basicbut exact constraints derived from the extreme mass-ratio limit allow to modelthis quantity with a simple analytic expression. despite the simple dependence,the expression models very accurately all of the available estimates, witherrors of a couple of percent at most. we also discuss how to use the fit topredict when a schwarzschild bh is produced by the merger of two spinning bhs,when the total angular momentum of the spacetime ``flips'' sign, or under whatconditions the final bh is ``spun-up'' by the merger. finally, suggest anextension of the fit to include unequal-spin binaries, thus potentiallyproviding a complete description of the final spin from the coalescence ofgeneric black-hole binaries with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum.

1206.3803	on the mass radiated by coalescing black-hole binaries	we derive an analytic phenomenological expression that predicts the finalmass of the black-hole remnant resulting from the merger of a generic binarysystem of black holes on quasi-circular orbits. besides recovering the correcttest-particle limit for extreme mass-ratio binaries, our formula reproduceswell the results of all the numerical-relativity simulations published so far,both when applied at separations of a few gravitational radii, and when appliedat separations of tens of thousands of gravitational radii. these validationsmake our formula a useful tool in a variety of contexts ranging fromgravitational-wave physics to cosmology. as representative examples, we firstillustrate how it can be used to decrease the phase error of theeffective-one-body waveforms during the ringdown phase. second, we show that,when combined with the recently computed self-force correction to the bindingenergy of nonspinning black-hole binaries, it provides an estimate of theenergy emitted during the merger and ringdown. finally, we use it to calculatethe energy radiated in gravitational waves by massive black-hole binaries as afunction of redshift, using different models for the seeds of the black-holepopulation.

1206.6604	poloidal-field instability in magnetized relativistic stars	we investigate the instability of purely poloidal magnetic fields innonrotating neutron stars by means of three-dimensional general-relativisticmagnetohydrodynamics simulations, extending the work presented in ciolfi et al.(2011). our aim is to draw a clear picture of the dynamics associated with theinstability and to study the final configuration reached by the system, thusobtaining indications on possible equilibria in a magnetized neutron star.furthermore, since the internal rearrangement of magnetic fields is a highlydynamical process, which has been suggested to be behind magnetar giant flares,our simulations can provide a realistic estimate of the electromagnetic andgravitational-wave emission which should accompany the flare event. our mainfindings are the following: (i) the initial development of the instabilitymeets all the expectations of perturbative studies in terms of the location ofthe seed of the instability, the timescale for its growth and the generation ofa toroidal component; (ii) in the subsequent nonlinear reorganization of thesystem, ~90% of magnetic energy is lost in few alfven timescales mainly throughelectromagnetic emission, and further decreases on a much longer timescale;(iii) all stellar models tend to achieve a significant amount of magnetichelicity and the equipartition of energy between poloidal and toroidal magneticfields, and evolve to a new configuration which does not show a subsequentinstability on dynamical or alfven timescales; (iv) the electromagneticemission matches the duration of the initial burst in luminosity observed ingiant flares, giving support to the internal rearrangement scenario; (v) only asmall fraction of the energy released during the process is converted intof-mode oscillations and in the consequent gravitational-wave emission, thusresulting in very low chances of detecting this signal with present and..

1207.4035	equilibrium models of relativistic stars with a toroidal magnetic field	we have computed models of rotating relativistic stars with a toroidalmagnetic field and investigated the combined effects of magnetic field androtation on the apparent shape (i.e. the surface deformation), which could berelevant for the electromagnetic emission, and on the internal matterdistribution (i.e. the quadrupole distortion), which could be relevant for theemission of gravitational waves. using a sample of eight different cold nuclearphysics equations of state, we have computed models of maximum field strength,as well as the distortion coefficients for the surface and the quadrupolardeformations. surprisingly, we find that non-rotating models admit arbitrarylevels of magnetization, accompanied by a growth of size and quadrupoledistortion to which we could not find a limit. rotating models, on the otherhand, are subject to a mass-shedding limit at frequencies well below thecorresponding ones for unmagnetized stars. overall, the space of solutions canbe split into three distinct classes for which the surface deformation and thequadrupole distortion are either prolate and prolate, oblate and prolate, oroblate and oblate, respectively. we also derive a simple formula expressing therelativistic distortion coefficients, which allows one to compute the surfacedeformation and the quadrupole distortion up to significant levels of rotationand magnetization, essentially covering all known magnetars. such a formulareplaces newtonian equivalent expressions that overestimate the magneticquadrupole distortion by about a factor of 6 and are inadequate for stronglyrelativistic objects like neutron stars.

1208.3487	general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics in three dimensions:  formulation and tests	we present a new numerical implementation of the general-relativisticresistive magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) equations within the whisky code. thenumerical method adopted exploits the properties of implicit-explicitrunge-kutta numerical schemes to treat the stiff terms that appear in theequations for large electrical conductivities. using tests in one, two, andthree dimensions, we show that our implementation is robust and recovers theideal-mhd limit in regimes of very high conductivity. moreover, the resultsillustrate that the code is capable of describing scenarios in a very widerange of conductivities. in addition to tests in flat spacetime, we reportsimulations of magnetized nonrotating relativistic stars, both in the cowlingapproximation and in dynamical spacetimes. finally, because of itsastrophysical relevance and because it provides a severe testbed forgeneral-relativistic codes with dynamical electromagnetic fields, we study thecollapse of a nonrotating star to a black hole. we show that also in this caseour results on the quasinormal mode frequencies of the excited electromagneticfields in the schwarzschild background agree with the perturbative studieswithin 0.7% and 5.6% for the real and the imaginary part of the l=1 modeeigenfrequency, respectively. finally we provide an estimate of theelectromagnetic efficiency of this process.

1302.4368	magnetorotational instability in relativistic hypermassive neutron stars	a differentially rotating hypermassive neutron star (hmns) is a metastableobject which can be formed in the merger of neutron-star binaries. the eventualcollapse of the hmns into a black hole is a key element in generating thephysical conditions expected to accompany the launch of a short gamma-rayburst. we investigate the influence of magnetic fields on hmnss by performingthree-dimensional simulations in general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. inparticular, we provide direct evidence for the occurrence of themagnetorotational instability (mri) in hmns interiors. for the first time insimulations of these systems, rapidly-growing and spatially-periodic structuresare observed to form with features like those of the channel flows produced bythe mri in other systems. moreover, the growth time and wavelength of thefastest-growing mode are extracted and compared successfully with analyticalpredictions. the mri emerges as an important mechanism to amplify magneticfields over the lifetime of the hmns, whose collapse to a black hole isaccelerated. the evidence provided here that the mri can actually develop inhmnss could have a profound impact on the outcome of the merger of neutron-starbinaries and on its connection to short gamma-ray bursts.

1306.2803	twisted-torus configurations with large toroidal magnetic fields in  relativistic stars	understanding the properties of the internal magnetic field of neutron starsremains a theoretical challenge. over the last years, twisted-torus geometrieshave been considered both in newtonian and general-relativistic equilibriummodels, as they represent a potentially good description of neutron starinteriors. all of these works have found an apparent intrinsic limitation togeometries that are poloidal-field-dominated, with a toroidal-to-poloidalenergy ratio inside the star that are &lt;10%, unless surface currents areincluded and magnetic fields are allowed to be discontinuous. this limitationis in stark contrast with the general expectation that much higher toroidalfields should be present in the stellar interior and casts doubt about thestability and hence realism of these configurations. we here discuss how toovercome this limitation by adopting a new prescription for the azimuthalcurrents that leads to magnetized equilibria where the toroidal-to-totalmagnetic-field energy ratio can be as high as 90%, thus including geometriesthat are toroidal-field-dominated. moreover, our results show that for a fixedexterior magnetic-field strength, a higher toroidal-field energy implies a muchhigher total magnetic energy stored in the star, with a potentially strongimpact on the expected electromagnetic and gravitational-wave emission fromhighly magnetized neutron stars.

1306.4065	matter effects on binary neutron star waveforms	using an extended set of equations of state and a multiple-groupmultiple-code collaborative effort to generate waveforms, we improvenumerical-relativity-based data-analysis estimates of the measurability ofmatter effects in neutron-star binaries. we vary two parameters of aparameterized piecewise-polytropic equation of state (eos) to analyze themeasurability of eos properties, via a parameter {\lambda} that characterizesthe quadrupole deformability of an isolated neutron star. we find that, towithin the accuracy of the simulations, the departure of the waveform frompoint-particle (or spinless double black-hole binary) inspiral increasesmonotonically with {\lambda}, and changes in the eos that did not change{\lambda} are not measurable. we estimate with two methods the minimal andexpected measurability of {\lambda} in second- and third- generationgravitational-wave detectors. the first estimate, using numerical waveformsalone, shows two eos which vary in radius by 1.3km are distinguishable inmergers at 100mpc. the second estimate relies on the construction of hybridwaveforms by matching to post-newtonian inspiral, and estimates that the sameeos are distinguishable in mergers at 300mpc. we calculate systematic errorsarising from numerical uncertainties and hybrid construction, and we estimatethe frequency at which such effects would interfere with template-basedsearches.

1306.4953	implementation of a simplified approach to radiative transfer in general  relativity	we describe in detail the implementation of a simplified approach toradiative transfer in general relativity by means of the well-known neutrinoleakage scheme (nls). in particular, we carry out an extensive investigation ofthe properties and limitations of the nls for isolated relativistic stars to alevel of detail that has not been discussed before in a general-relativisticcontext. although the numerous tests considered here are rather idealized, theyprovide a well-controlled environment in which to understand the relationshipbetween the matter dynamics and the neutrino emission, which is important inorder to model the neutrino signals from more complicated scenarios, such asbinary neutron-star mergers. when considering nonrotating hot neutron stars weconfirm earlier results of one-dimensional simulations, but also present novelresults about the equilibrium properties and on how the cooling affects thestability of these configurations. in our idealized but controlled setup, wecan then show that deviations from the thermal and weak-interaction equilibriumaffect the stability of these models to radial perturbations, leading modelsthat are stable in the absence of radiative losses, to a gravitational collapseto a black hole when neutrinos are instead radiated.

1306.6052	beyond second-order convergence in simulations of binary neutron stars  in full general-relativity	despite the recent rapid progress in numerical relativity, a convergenceorder less than the second has so far plagued codes solving the einstein-eulersystem of equations. we report simulations of the inspiral of binary neutronstars in quasi-circular orbits computed with a new code employing high-order,high-resolution shock-capturing, finite-differencing schemes that, for thefirst time, go beyond the second-order barrier. in particular, without anytuning or alignment, we measure a convergence order above three both in thephase and in the amplitude of the gravitational waves. because the new code isable to calculate waveforms with very small phase errors already at modestresolutions, we are able to obtain accurate estimates of tidal effects in theinspiral that are essentially free from the large numerical viscosity typicalof lower-order methods, and even for the challenging large compactness andsmall-deformability binary considered here. we find a remarkable agreementbetween our richardson-extrapolated waveform and the one from the tidallycorrected post-newtonian (pn) taylor-t4 model, with a de-phasing smaller than0.2 radians during the seven orbits of the inspiral and up to the contactpoint. because our results can be used reliably to assess the validity of thepn or other approximations at frequencies significantly larger than thoseconsidered so far in the literature, they seem to exclude at thesecompactnesses significant tidal amplifications fromnext-to-next-to-leading--order terms in the pn expansion.

1307.1409	fast radio bursts: the last sign of supramassive neutron stars	several fast radio bursts have been discovered recently, showing a bright,highly dispersed millisecond radio pulse. the pulses do not repeat and are notassociated with a known pulsar or gamma-ray burst. the high dispersion suggestssources at cosmological distances, hence implying an extremely high radioluminosity, far larger than the power of single pulses from a pulsar. wesuggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassiverotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking.the neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating modelsand is supported by rapid rotation. as magnetic braking constantly reduces thespin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousandto million years after its birth. we discuss several formation scenarios forsupramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures{making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativisticcalculations. while the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an eventhorizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently. this can turn an almostordinary pulsar into a bright radio "blitzar": accelerated electrons from thetravelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphereand produce a massive radio burst that is observable out to z&gt;0.7. only a fewpercent of the neutron stars needs to be supramassive in order to explain theobserved rate. we suggest that fast radio bursts might trace the solitaryformation of stellar mass black holes at high redshifts. these bursts could bean electromagnetic complement to gravitational-wave emission and reveal a newformation and evolutionary channel for black holes that are not seen asgamma-ray bursts. radio observations of these bursts could trace thecore-collapse supernova rate throughout the universe.

1308.3989	dynamical bar-mode instability in rotating and magnetized relativistic  stars	we present three-dimensional simulations of the dynamical bar-modeinstability in magnetized and differentially rotating stars in full generalrelativity. our focus is on the effects that magnetic fields have on thedynamics and the onset of the instability. in particular, we performideal-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of neutron stars that are known to beeither stable or unstable against the purely hydrodynamical instability, but towhich a poloidal magnetic field in the range of $10^{14}$--$10^{16}$ g issuperimposed initially. as expected, the differential rotation is responsiblefor the shearing of the poloidal field and the consequent linear growth in timeof the toroidal magnetic field. the latter rapidly exceeds in strength theoriginal poloidal one, leading to a magnetic-field amplification in the thestars. weak initial magnetic fields, i.e. $ \lesssim 10^{15}$ g, havenegligible effects on the development of the dynamical bar-mode instability,simply braking the stellar configuration via magnetic-field shearing, and overa timescale for which we derived a simple algebraic expression. on the otherhand, strong magnetic fields, i.e. $\gtrsim 10^{16}$ g, can suppress theinstability completely, with the precise threshold being dependent also on theamount of rotation. as a result, it is unlikely that very highly magnetizedneutron stars can be considered as sources of gravitational waves via thedynamical bar-mode instability.

1312.1862	host redshifts from gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron  star mergers	inspiralling compact binaries as standard sirens will soon become aninvaluable tool for cosmology when advanced interferometric gravitational-wavedetectors begin their observations in the coming years. however, a degeneracyin the information carried by gravitational waves between the total rest-framemass $m$ and the redshift $z$ of the source implies that neither can bedirectly extracted from the signal, but only the combination $m(1+z)$, theredshifted mass. recent work has shown that for binary neutron star systems, atidal correction to the gravitational-wave phase in the late-inspiral signalthat depends on the rest-frame source mass could be used to break themass-redshift degeneracy. we propose here to use the signature encoded in thepost-merger signal to deduce the redshift to the source. this will allow anaccurate extraction of the intrinsic rest-frame mass of the source, in turnpermitting the determination of source redshift and luminosity distance solelyfrom gravitational-wave observations. this will herald a new era in precisioncosmography and astrophysics. using numerical simulations of binary neutronstar mergers of very slightly different mass, we model gravitational-wavesignals at different redshifts and use bayesian parameter estimation todetermine the accuracy with which the redshift can be extracted for a source ofknown mass. we find that the einstein telescope can determine the sourceredshift to $sim 10$--$20%$ at redshifts of $z&lt;0.04$.

1401.4544	magnetically driven winds from differentially rotating neutron stars and  x-ray afterglows of short gamma-ray bursts	besides being among the most promising sources of gravitational waves,merging neutron star binaries also represent a leading scenario to explain thephenomenology of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs). recent observations haverevealed a large subclass of sgrbs with roughly constant luminosity in theirx-ray afterglows, lasting $10\!-\!10^4$ s. these features are generally takenas evidence of a long-lived central engine powered by the magnetic spin-down ofa uniformly rotating, magnetized object. we propose a different scenario inwhich the central engine powering the x-ray emission is a differentiallyrotating hypermassive neutron star (hmns) that launches a quasi-isotropic andbaryon-loaded wind driven by the magnetic field, which is built-up throughdifferential rotation. our model is supported by long-term, three-dimensional,general-relativistic, and ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations, showing thatthis isotropic emission is a very robust feature. for a given hmns, thepresence of a collimated component depends sensitively on the initial magneticfield geometry, while the stationary electromagnetic luminosity depends only onthe magnetic energy initially stored in the system. we show that our model iscompatible with the observed timescales and luminosities and express the latterin terms of a simple scaling relation.

1403.5672	constraining the equation of state of neutron stars from binary mergers	determining the equation of state of matter at nuclear density and hence thestructure of neutron stars has been a riddle for decades. we show how theimminent detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binariescan be used to solve this riddle. using a large number of accuratenumerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,we find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct androbust spectral features. while the high-frequency peak has already beenassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced bythe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emergesbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the totalcompactness of the stars in the binary. more importantly, such a correlation isessentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraintson the equation of state. if the mass of the binary is known from the inspiralsignal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneousconstraints to be satisfied. ideally, even a single detection would besufficient to select one equation of state over the others. we test ourapproach with simulated data and verify it works well for all the equations ofstate considered.

1410.8560	a novel paradigm for short gamma-ray bursts with extended x-ray emission	the merger of a binary of neutron stars provides natural explanations formany of the features of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs), such as the generationof a hot torus orbiting a rapidly rotating black hole, which can then build amagnetic jet and provide the energy reservoir to launch a relativistic outflow.yet, this scenario has problems explaining the recently discovered long-termand sustained x-ray emission associated with the afterglows of a subclass ofsgrbs. we propose a new model that explains how an x-ray afterglow can besustained by the product of the merger and how the x-ray emission is producedbefore the corresponding emission in the gamma-band, although it is observed tofollow it. overall, our paradigm combines in a novel manner a number ofwell-established features of the emission in sgrbs and results fromsimulations. because it involves the propagation of an ultra-relativisticoutflow and its interaction with a confining medium, the paradigm alsohighlights a unifying phenomenology between short and long grbs.

1502.05674	new code for quasiequilibrium initial data of binary neutron stars:  corotating, irrotational and slowly spinning systems	we present the extension of our \cocal~- compact object calculator - code tocompute general-relativistic initial data for binary compact-star systems. inparticular, we construct quasiequilibrium initial data for equal-mass binarieswith spins that are either aligned or antialigned with the orbital angularmomentum. the isenberg-wilson-mathews formalism is adopted and the constraintequations are solved using the representation formula with a suitable choice ofa green's function. we validate the new code with solutions for equal-massbinaries and explore its capabilities for a wide range of compactnesses, from awhite dwarf binary with compactness $\sim 10^{-4}$, up to a highly relativisticneutron-star binary with compactness $\sim 0.22$. we also present a comparisonwith corotating and irrotational quasiequilibrium sequences from the spectralcode \lorene [taniguchi and gourgoulhon, phys. rev. d {\bf 66}, 104019 (2002)]and with different compactness, showing that the results from the two codesagree to a precision of the order of $0.05\%$. finally, we present equilibriafor spinning configurations with a nuclear-physics equation of state in apiecewise polytropic representation.

1505.00933	recollimation shocks in magnetized relativistic jets	we have performed two-dimensional special-relativistic magnetohydrodynamicsimulations of non-equilibrium over-pressured relativistic jets in cylindricalgeometry. multiple stationary recollimation shock and rarefaction structuresare produced along the jet by the nonlinear interaction of shocks andrarefaction waves excited at the interface between the jet and the surroundingambient medium. although initially the jet is kinematically dominated, we haveconsidered axial, toroidal and helical magnetic fields to investigate theeffects of different magnetic-field topologies and strengths on therecollimation structures. we find that an axial field introduces a largereffective gas-pressure and leads to stronger recollimation shocks andrarefactions, resulting in larger flow variations. the jet boost growsquadratically with the initial magnetic field. on the other hand, a toroidalfield leads to weaker recollimation shocks and rarefactions, modifyingsignificantly the jet structure after the first recollimation rarefaction andshock. the jet boost decreases systematically. for a helical field, instead,the behaviour depends on the magnetic pitch, with a phenomenology that rangesbetween the one seen for axial and toroidal magnetic fields, respectively. ingeneral, however, a helical magnetic field yields a more complex shock andrarefaction substructure close to the inlet that significantly modifies the jetstructure. the differences in shock structure resulting from different fieldconfigurations and strengths may have observable consequences for disturbancespropagating through a stationary recollimation shock.

1506.06620	analytic bjorken flow in one-dimensional relativistic  magnetohydrodynamics	in the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, strong magneticfields appear due to the large velocity of the colliding charges. the evolutionof these fields appears as a novel and intriguing feature in thefluid-dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions. in this work, we studyanalytically the one-dimensional, longitudinally boost-invariant motion of anideal fluid in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. interestingly, wefind that, in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, i.e., for infiniteconductivity, and irrespective of the strength of the initial magnetization,the decay of the fluid energy density $e$ with proper time $\tau$ is the sameas for the time-honored "bjorken flow" without magnetic field. furthermore,when the magnetic field is assumed to decay $\sim \tau^{-a}$, where $a$ is anarbitrary number, two classes of analytic solutions can be found depending onwhether $a$ is larger or smaller than one. in summary, the analytic solutionspresented here highlight that the bjorken flow is far more general thanformerly thought. these solutions can serve both to gain insight on thedynamics of heavy-ion collisions in the presence of strong magnetic fields andas testbeds for numerical codes.

astro-ph;0307488	oscillations of vertically integrated relativistic tori -- i.  axisymmetric modes in a schwarzschild spacetime	this is the first of a series of papers investigating the oscillationproperties of relativistic, non-selfgravitating tori orbiting around a blackhole. in this initial paper we consider the axisymmetric oscillation modes of atorus constructed in a schwarzschild spacetime. to simplify the treatment andmake it as analytical as possible, we build our tori with vertically integratedand vertically averaged quantities. our investigation progresses by steps. wefirst consider a local analysis in newtonian gravity and determine theproperties of acoustic wave propagation within these objects, as well as therelations between acoustic and epicyclic oscillations. next, we extend thelocal analysis to a general relativistic framework. finally, we perform aglobal analysis and determine both the eigenfunctions and the eigenfrequenciesof the axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the p modes of relativistictori. these behave as sound waves globally trapped in the torus and possesseigenfrequencies appearing in the simple sequence 2:3:4:..., independently ofthe distribution of angular momentum considered. the properties of the modesinvestigated here are in good agreement with those observed in recent numericalsimulations and could have a number of different applications. in x-ray binarysystems containing a black hole candidate, for instance, p-mode oscillationscould be used to explain the harmonic relations in the high frequencyquasi-periodic oscillations observed. in systems comprising a massive torusorbiting a black hole, on the other hand, p-mode oscillations could be used toexplain the development or the suppression of the runaway instability.

astro-ph;0407642	oscillations of vertically integrated relativistic tori -ii.  axisymmetric modes in a kerr spacetime	this is the second of a series of papers investigating the oscillationproperties of relativistic, non-selfgravitating tori orbiting around blackholes. extending the work done in a schwarzschild background, we here considerthe axisymmetric oscillations of vertically integrated tori in a kerrspacetime. the tori are modeled with a number of different non-kepleriandistributions of specific angular momentum and we discuss how the oscillationproperties depend on these and on the rotation of the central black hole. wefirst consider a local analysis to highlight the relations between acoustic andepicyclic oscillations in a kerr spacetime and subsequently perform a globaleigenmode analysis to compute the axisymmetric p modes. in analogy with whatfound in a schwarzschild background, these modes behave as sound waves that aremodified by rotation and are globally trapped in the torus. for constantdistributions of specific angular momentum, the eigenfrequencies appear in asequence 2:3:4:... which is essentially independent of the size of the disc andof the black hole rotation. for non-constant distributions of angular momentum,on the other hand, the sequence depends on the properties of the disc and onthe spin of the black hole, becoming harmonic for sufficiently large tori. wealso comment on how p modes could explain the high frequency quasi-periodicoscillations observed in low-mass x-ray binaries with a black hole candidateand the properties of an equivalent model in newtonian physics.

astro-ph;0609473	accurate simulations of the dynamical bar-mode instability in full  general relativity	we present accurate simulations of the dynamical bar-mode instability in fullgeneral relativity focussing on two aspects which have not been investigated indetail in the past. namely, on the persistence of the bar deformation once theinstability has reached its saturation and on the precise determination of thethreshold for the onset of the instability in terms of the parameter$\beta={t}/{|w|}$. we find that generic nonlinear mode-coupling effects appearduring the development of the instability and these can severely limit thepersistence of the bar deformation and eventually suppress the instability. inaddition, we observe the dynamics of the instability to be strongly influencedby the value $\beta$ and on its separation from the critical value $\beta_c$marking the onset of the instability. we discuss the impact these results haveon the detection of gravitational waves from this process and provide evidencethat the classical perturbative analysis of the bar-mode instability fornewtonian and incompressible maclaurin spheroids remains qualitatively validand accurate also in full general relativity.

astro-ph;0702485	dynamics of magnetized relativistic tori oscillating around black holes	we present a numerical study of the dynamics of magnetized, relativistic,non-self-gravitating, axisymmetric tori orbiting in the background spacetimesof schwarzschild and kerr black holes. the initial models have a constantspecific angular momentum and are built with a non-zero toroidal magnetic fieldcomponent, for which equilibrium configurations have recently been obtained. inthis work we extend our previous investigations which dealt with purelyhydrodynamical thick discs, and study the dynamics of magnetized tori subjectto perturbations which, for the values of the magnetic field strengthconsidered here, trigger quasi-periodic oscillations lasting for tens oforbital periods. overall, we have found that the dynamics of the magnetizedtori analyzed is very similar to that found in the corresponding unmagnetizedmodels. the spectral distribution of the eigenfrequencies of oscillation showsthe presence of a fundamental p mode and of a series of overtones in a harmonicratio 2:3:.... these simulations, therefore, extend the validity of the modelof rezzolla et al.(2003a) for explaining the high-frequency qpos observed inthe spectra of lmxbs containing a black-hole candidate also to the case ofmagnetized discs with purely toroidal magnetic field distribution. ifsufficiently compact and massive, these oscillations can also lead to theemission of intense gravitational radiation which is potentially detectable forsources within the galaxy.

astro-ph;9911188	r-mode oscillations in rotating magnetic neutron stars	we show that r-mode oscillations distort the magnetic fields of neutron starsand that their occurrence is likely to be limited by this interaction. if thefield is gtrsim 10^{16} (omega/omega_b) g, where omega and omega_b are theangular velocities of the star and at which mass shedding occurs, r-modeoscillations cannot occur. much weaker fields will prevent gravitationalradiation from exciting r-mode oscillations or damp them on a relatively shorttimescale by extracting energy from the modes faster than gravitational waveemission can pump energy into them. for example, a 10^{10} g poloidal magneticfield that threads the star's superconducting core is likely to prevent theell=2 mode from being excited unless omega exceeds 0.35 omega_b. if omega islarger than 0.35 omega_b initially, the ell=2 mode may be excited but is likelyto decay rapidly once omega falls below 0.35 omega_b, which happens in lesssim15^d if the saturation amplitude is gtrsim 0.1. the r-mode oscillations mayplay an important role in determining the structure of neutron star magneticfields.

0810.1838	beyond ideal mhd: towards a more realistic modeling of relativistic  astrophysical plasmas	many astrophysical processes involving magnetic fields and quasi-stationaryprocesses are well described when assuming the fluid as a perfect conductor.for these systems, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) description capturesthe dynamics effectively and a number of well-tested techniques exist for itsnumerical solution. yet, there are several astrophysical processes involvingmagnetic fields which are highly dynamical and for which resistive effects canplay an important role. the numerical modeling of such non-ideal mhd flows issignificantly more challenging as the resistivity is expected to change ofseveral orders of magnitude across the flow and the equations are then eitherof hyperbolic-parabolic nature or hyperbolic with stiff terms. we here presenta novel approach for the solution of these relativistic resistive mhd equationsexploiting the properties of implicit-explicit (imex) runge kutta methods. byexamining a number of tests we illustrate the accuracy of our approach under avariety of conditions and highlight its robustness when compared withalternative methods, such as the strang-splitting. most importantly, we showthat our approach allows one to treat, within a unified framework, both thoseregions of the flow which are fluid-pressure dominated (such as in the interiorof compact objects) and those which are instead magnetic-pressure dominated(such as in their magnetospheres)

gr-qc;0107019	gravitational wave emission by cataclysmic variables: numerical models  of semi-detached binaries	gravitational wave emission is considered to be the driving force for theevolution of short-period cataclysmic binary stars, making them a potentialtest for the validity of general relativity. in spite of continuous refinementsof the physical description, a 10% mismatch exists between the theoreticalminimum period ($p_{\rm turn} \simeq 70$ min) and the short-period cut-off($p_{\rm min} \simeq 80$ min) observed in the period distribution forcataclysmic variable binaries. a possible explanation for this mismatch wasassociated with the use of the roche model. we here present a systematiccomparison between self-consistent, numerically constructed sequences ofhydrostatic models of binary stars and roche models of semi-detached binaries.on the basis of our approach, we also derive a value for the minimum period ofcataclysmic variable binaries. the results obtained through the comparisonindicate that the roche model is indeed very good, with deviations from thenumerical solution which are of a few percent at most. our results thereforesuggest that additional sources of angular momentum loss or alternativeexplanations need to be considered in order to justify the mismatch.

gr-qc;0107061	properties of r modes in rotating magnetic neutron stars. i. kinematic  secular effects and magnetic evolution equations	the instability of r-mode oscillations in rapidly rotating neutron stars hasattracted attention as a potential mechanism for producing high frequency,almost periodic gravitational waves. the analyses carried so far have shown theexistence of these modes and have considered damping by shear and bulkviscosity. however, the magnetohydrodynamic coupling of the modes with astellar magnetic field and its role in the damping of the instability has notbeen fully investigated yet. following our introductory paper (rezzolla, lamband shapiro 2000), we here discuss in more detail the existence of secularhigher-order kinematical effects which will produce toroidal fluid drifts. wealso define the sets of equations that account for the time evolution of themagnetic fields produced by these secular velocity fields and show that themagnetic fields produced can reach equipartition in less than a year. the fullnumerical calculations as well as the evaluation of the impact of strongmagnetic fields on the onset and evolution of the r-mode instability will bepresented in a companion paper.

gr-qc;0107062	properties of r modes in rotating magnetic neutron stars. ii. evolution  of the r modes and stellar magnetic field	the evolution of the r-mode instability is likely to be accompanied bysecular kinematic effects which will produce differential rotation with largescale drifts of fluid elements, mostly in the azimuthal direction. as firstdiscussed by rezzolla, lamb and shapiro 2000, the interaction of these secularvelocity fields with a pre-existing neutron star magnetic field could result inthe generation of intense and large scale toroidal fields. following theirderivation in the companion paper, we here discuss the numerical solution ofthe evolution equations for the magnetic field. the values of the magneticfields obtained in this way are used to estimate the conditions under which ther-mode instability might be prevented or suppressed. we also assess the impactof the generation of large magnetic fields on the gravitational wavedetectability of r-mode unstable neutron stars. our results indicate that thesignal to noise ratio in the detection of gravitational waves from the r-modeinstability might be considerably decreased if the latter develops in neutronstars with initial magnetic fields larger than 10^10 g.

gr-qc;0112017	frequencies of f-modes in differentially rotating relativistic stars and  secular stability limits	we have computed the eigenfrequencies of f-modes for a constant-rest-masssequences of rapidly rotating relativistic inviscid stars in differentialrotation. the frequencies have been calculated neglecting the metricperturbations (the relativistic cowling approximation) and expressed as afunction of the ratio between the rotational kinetic energy and the absolutevalue of the gravitational energy of the stellar model beta=t/|w|. the zerosand the end-points of these sequences mark respectively the onset of thesecular instability driven by gravitational radiation-reaction and the maximumvalue of beta at which an equilibrium model exists. in differentially rotatingstars the secular stability limits appear at a beta larger than those found foruniformly rotating stars. differential rotation, on the other hand, also allowsfor the existence of equilibrium models at values of beta larger than those foruniformly rotating stars, moving the end-point of the sequences to larger beta.as a result, for some degrees of differential rotation, the onset of thesecular instability for f-modes is generally favoured by the presence ofdifferential rotation.

gr-qc;0310045	dynamics of thick discs around schwarzschild-de sitter black holes	we consider the effects of a cosmological constant on the dynamics ofconstant angular momentum discs orbiting schwarzschild-de sitter black holes.the motivation behind this study is to investigate whether the presence of aradial force contrasting the black hole's gravitational attraction caninfluence the occurrence of the runaway instability, a robust feature of thedynamics of constant angular momentum tori in schwarzschild and kerrspacetimes. in addition to the inner cusp near the black hole horizon throughwhich matter can accrete onto the black hole, in fact, a positive cosmologicalconstant introduces also an outer cusp through which matter can leave the toruswithout accreting onto the black hole. to assess the impact of this outflow onthe development of the instability we have performed time-dependent andaxisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of equilibrium initial configurationsin a sequence of background spacetimes of schwarzschild-de sitter black holeswith increasing masses. the simulations have been performed with an unrealisticvalue for the cosmological constant which, however, yields sufficiently smalldiscs to be resolved accurately on numerical grids and thus provides a firstqualitative picture of the dynamics. the calculations, carried out for a widerange of initial conditions, show that the mass-loss from the outer cusp canhave a considerable impact on the instability, with the latter being rapidlysuppressed if the outflow is large enough.

gr-qc;0406018	electromagnetic fields in the exterior of an oscillating relativistic  star -- i. general expressions and application to a rotating magnetic dipole	relativistic stars are endowed with intense electromagnetic fields but arealso subject to oscillations of various types. we here investigate the impactthat oscillations have on the electric and magnetic fields external to arelativistic star in vacuum. in particular, modelling the star as arelativistic polytrope with infinite conductivity, we consider the solution ofthe general relativistic maxwell equations both in the vicinity of the stellarsurface and far from it, once a perturbative velocity field is specified. inthis first paper we present general analytic expressions that are notspecialized to a particular magnetic field topology or velocity field. however,as a validating example and an astrophysically important application, weconsider a dipolar magnetic field and the velocity field corresponding to therotation of the misaligned dipole. besides providing analytic expressions forthe electromagnetic fields produced by this configuration, we calculate, forthe first time, the general relativistic energy loss through dipolarelectromagnetic radiation. we find that the widely used newtonian expressionunder-estimates this loss by a factor of 2-6 depending on the stellarcompactness. this correction could have important consequences in the study ofthe spin evolution of pulsars.

gr-qc;0606104	numerical evolutions of a black hole-neutron star system in full general  relativity: i. head-on collision	we present the first simulations in full general relativity of the head-oncollision between a neutron star and a black hole of comparable mass. thesesimulations are performed through the solution of the einstein equationscombined with an accurate solution of the relativistic hydrodynamics equationsvia high-resolution shock-capturing techniques. the initial data is obtained byfollowing the york-lichnerowicz conformal decomposition with the assumption oftime symmetry. unlike other relativistic studies of such systems, no limitationis set for the mass ratio between the black hole and the neutron star, nor onthe position of the black hole, whose apparent horizon is entirely containedwithin the computational domain. the latter extends over ~400m and is coveredwith six levels of fixed mesh refinement. concentrating on a prototypicalbinary system with mass ratio ~6, we find that although a tidal deformation isevident the neutron star is accreted promptly and entirely into the black hole.while the collision is completed before ~300m, the evolution is carried over upto ~1700m, thus providing time for the extraction of the gravitational-wavesignal produced and allowing for a first estimate of the radiative efficiencyof processes of this type.

gr-qc;0610131	on the accretion-induced qnm excitation of a schwarzschild black hole	by combining the numerical solution of the nonlinear hydrodynamics equationswith the solution of the linear inhomogeneous zerilli-moncrief andregge-wheeler equations we investigate the properties of the gravitationalradiation emitted during the axisymmetric accretion of matter onto aschwarzschild black hole. the matter models considered include quadrupolar dustshells and thick accretion disks, permitting us to simulate situations whichmay be encountered at the end stages of stellar gravitational collapse orbinary neutron star merger. we focus on the interference pattern appearing inthe energy spectra of the emitted gravitational waves and on the amount ofexcitation of the quasi-normal modes of the accreting black hole. we show that,quite generically in the presence of accretion, the black hole ringdown is nota simple superposition of quasi-normal modes, although the fundamental mode isusually present and often dominates the gravitational-wave signal. we interpretthis as due to backscattering of waves off the non-exponentially decaying partof the black-hole potential and to the finite spatial extension of theaccreting matter. our results suggest that the black-hole qnm contributions tothe full gravitational-wave signal should be extremely small and possibly notdetectable in generic astrophysical scenarios involving the accretion ofextended distributions of matter.

gr-qc;0701038	are moving punctures equivalent to moving black holes?	when simulating the inspiral and coalescence of a binary black-hole system,special care needs to be taken in handling the singularities. two maintechniques are used in numerical-relativity simulations: a first and moretraditional one ``excises'' a spatial neighbourhood of the singularity from thenumerical grid on each spacelike hypersurface. a second and more recent one,instead, begins with a ``puncture'' solution and then evolves the full3-metric, including the singular point. in the continuum limit, excision isjustified by the light-cone structure of the einstein equations and, inpractice, can give accurate numerical solutions when suitable discretizationsare used. however, because the field variables are non-differentiable at thepuncture, there is no proof that the moving-punctures technique is correct,particularly in the discrete case. to investigate this question we use bothtechniques to evolve a binary system of equal-mass non-spinning black holes. wecompare the evolution of two curvature 4-scalars with proper time along theinvariantly-defined worldline midway between the two black holes, usingrichardson extrapolation to reduce the influence of finite-differencetruncation errors. we find that the excision and moving-punctures evolutionsproduce the same invariants along that worldline, and thus the same spacetimesthroughout that worldline's causal past. this provides convincing evidence thatmoving-punctures are indeed equivalent to moving black holes.
