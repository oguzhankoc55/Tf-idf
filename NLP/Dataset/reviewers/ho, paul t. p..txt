0902.2437	amiba: system performance	the y.t. lee array for microwave background anisotropy (amiba) startedscientific operation in early 2007. this work describes the optimization of thesystem performance for the measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect forsix massive galaxy clusters at redshifts $0.09 - 0.32$. we achieved a pointsource sensitivity of $63\pm 7$ mjy with the seven 0.6m dishes in 1 hour ofon-source integration in 2-patch differencing observations. we measured andcompensated for the delays between the antennas of our platform-mountedinterferometer. beam switching was used to cancel instrumental instabilitiesand ground pick up. total power and phase stability were good on time scales ofhours, and the system was shown to integrate down on equivalent timescales of300 hours per baseline/correlation, or about 10 hours for the entire array.while the broadband correlator leads to good sensitivity, the small number oflags in the correlator resulted in poorly measured bandpass response. wecorrected for this by using external calibrators (jupiter and saturn). usingjupiter as the flux standard, we measured the disk brightness temperature ofsaturn to be $149^{+5}_{-12}$ k.

0903.0886	gas infall towards sgr a* from the clumpy circumnuclear disk	we present the first large-scale mosaic performed with the submillimeterarray (sma) in the galactic center. we have produced a 25-pointing mosaic,covering a ~2' x 2' area around sgr a*. we have detected emission from twohigh-density molecular tracers, hcn(4-3) and cs(7-6), the latter never beforereported in this region. the data have an angular resolution of 4.6" x 3.1",and the spectral window coverage is from -180 km/s to 1490 km/s for hcn(4-3)and from -1605 km/s to 129 km/s for cs(7-6). both molecular tracers present avery clumpy distribution along the circumnuclear disk (cnd), and are detectedwith a high signal-to-noise ratio in the southern part of the cnd, while theyare weaker towards the northern part. assuming that the clumps are as close tothe galactic center as their projected distances, they are still dense enoughto be gravitationally stable against the tidal shear produced by thesupermassive black hole. therefore, the cnd is a non-transient structure. thisgeometrical distribution of both tracers suggests that the southern part of thecnd is denser than the northern part. also, by comparing the hcn(4-3) resultswith hcn(1-0) results we can see that the northern and the southern parts ofthe cnd have different excitation levels, with the southern part warmer thanthe northern. finally, we compare our results with those obtained with thedetection of nh3, which traces the warmer and less dense material detected inthe inner cavity of the cnd. we suggest that we are detecting the origin pointwhere a portion of the cnd becomes destabilized and approaches the dynamicalcenter of the milky way, possibly being impacted by the southern streamer andheated on its way inwards.

0905.1996	evolution of magnetic fields in high mass star formation: linking field  geometry and collapse for the w51 e2/e8 cores	we report our observational results of 870 $\mu$m continuum emission and itslinear polarization in the massive star formation site w51 e2/e8. inferred fromthe linear polarization maps, the magnetic field in the plane of sky(b$_{\bot}$) is traced with an angular resolution of 0$\farcs$7 with thesubmillimeter array (sma). whereas previous bima observations with an angularresolution of 3$\arcsec$ (0.1 pc) showed a uniform b field, our revealedb$_{\bot}$ morphology is hourglass-like in the collapsing core near theultracompact h ii region e2 and also possibly in e8. the decrease inpolarization near the continuum peak seen at lower angular resolution isapparently due to the more complex structures at smaller scales. in e2, thepinched direction of the hourglass-like b field morphology is parallel to theplane of the ionized accretion flow traced by h53$\alpha$, suggesting that themassive stars are formed via processes similar to the low mass stars, i.e.accretion through a disk, except that the mass involved is much larger.furthermore, our finding that the resolved collapsing cores in e2 and e8 liewithin one subcritical 0.5 pc envelope supports the scenario of\textit{magnetic fragmentation} via ambipolar diffusion. we therefore suggestthat magnetic fields control the dynamical evolution of the envelope and coresin w51 e2 and e8.

0707.1293	circumbinary molecular rings around young stars in orion	we present high angular resolution 1.3 mm continuum, methyl cyanide molecularline, and 7 mm continuum observations made with the submillimeter array and thevery large array, toward the most highly obscured and southern part of themassive star forming region omc1s located behind the orion nebula. we find twoflattened and rotating molecular structures with sizes of a few hundredastronomical units suggestive of circumbinary molecular rings produced by thepresence of two stars with very compact circumstellar disks with sizes andseparations of about 50 au, associated with the young stellar objects 139-409and 134-411. furthermore, these two circumbinary rotating rings are related totwo compact and bright {\it hot molecular cores}. the dynamic mass of thebinary systems obtained from our data are $\geq$ 4 m$_\odot$ for 139-409 and$\geq$ 0.5 m$_\odot$ for 134-411. this result supports the idea thatintermediate-mass stars will form through {\it circumstellar disks} andjets/outflows, as the low mass stars do. furthermore, when intermediate-massstars are in multiple systems they seem to form a circumbinary ring similar tothose seen in young, multiple low-mass systems (e.g., gg tau and uy aur).

1003.1355	the reflection-symmetric wiggle of the young protostellar jet hh 211	hh 211 is a highly collimated jet originating from a nearby young class 0protostar. here is a follow-up study of the jet with our previous observationsat unprecedented resolution up to ~ 0.3" in sio (j=8-7), co (j=3-2), and so(n_j=8_9-7_8). sio, co, and so can all be a good tracer of the hh 211 jet,tracing the internal shocks in the jet. although the emissions of thesemolecules show roughly the same morphology of the jet, there are detaileddifferences. in particular, the co emission traces the jet closer to the sourcethan the sio and so emissions. in addition, in the better resolved internalshocks, both the co and so emission are seen slightly ahead of the sioemission. the jet is clearly seen on both sides of the source with more thanone cycle of wiggle. the wiggle is reflection-symmetric about the source andcan be reasonably fitted by an orbiting source jet model. the best-fitparameters suggest that the source itself could be a very low-mass protobinarywith a total mass of ~ 60 m_jup and a binary separation of ~ 4.6 au. theabundances of sio and so in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced inthe jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds, even close to within 300au from the source where the dynamical time scale is &lt;10 yrs. the abundanceenhancements of these molecules are closely related to the internal shocks. thedetected sio is either the consequence of the release of si-bearing materialfrom dust grains or of its formation via gas chemistry in the shocks. the so,on the other hand, seems to form via gas chemistry in the shocks.

(2) the two dusty cores (mm1 and mm2) at the intersection of thefilaments are found to be at different evolutionary stages, and each of them isresolved into multiple condensations. mm1 and mm2 have markedly differenttemperatures, continuum spectral indices, molecular-line spectra, and masses ofboth stars and gas. (3) the dynamics of the "hot-core" mm1 indicates thepresence of a rotating disk in its center (mm1-main) around a faint free-freesource. the stellar mass is estimated to be approximately 10 msun. a massivemolecular outflow is observed along the rotation axis of the disk.

1006.2957	high-angular resolution dust polarization measurements: shaped b-field  lines in the massive star forming region orion bn/kl	we present observational results of the thermal dust continuum emission andits linear polarization in one of the nearest massive star-forming sites orionbn/kl in orion molecular cloud-1. the observations were carried out with thesubmillimeter array. with an angular resolution of 1" (~2 mpc; 480 au), we havedetected and resolved the densest cores near the bn/kl region. at a wavelengthof ~870 micron, the polarized dust emission can be used to trace the structureof the magnetic field in this star-forming core. the dust continuum appears toarise from a v-shaped region, with a cavity nearly coincident with the centerof the explosive outflows observed on larger scales. the position angles(p.a.s) of the observed polarization vary significantly by a total of about 90degree but smoothly, i.e., curl-like, across the dust ridges. such apolarization pattern can be explained with dust grains being magneticallyaligned instead of mechanically with outflows, since the latter mechanism wouldcause the p.a.s to be parallel to the direction of the outflow, i.e.,radial-like. the magnetic field projected in the plane of sky is thereforederived by rotating the p.a.s of the polarization by 90 degree. we find anazimuthally symmetric structure in the overall magnetic field morphology, withthe field directions pointing toward 2.5" west to the center of the explosiveoutflows. we also find a preferred symmetry plane at a p.a. of 36 degree, whichis perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction (120 degree) of the 0.5pc dust ridge. two possible interpretations of the origin of the observedmagnetic field structure are discussed.

1009.1943	constraining intra-cluster gas models with amiba13	clusters of galaxies have been used extensively to determine cosmologicalparameters. a major difficulty in making best use of sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz)and x-ray observations of clusters for cosmology is that using x-rayobservations it is difficult to measure the temperature distribution andtherefore determine the density distribution in individual clusters of galaxiesout to the virial radius. observations with the new generation of szinstruments are a promising alternative approach. we use clusters of galaxiesdrawn from high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement (amr) cosmologicalsimulations to study how well we should be able to constrain the large-scaledistribution of the intra-cluster gas (icg) in individual massive relaxedclusters using amiba in its configuration with 13 1.2-m diameter dishes(amiba13) along with x-ray observations. we show that non-isothermal betamodels provide a good description of the icg in our simulated relaxed clusters.we use simulated x-ray observations to estimate the quality of constraints onthe distribution of gas density, and simulated sz visibilities (amiba13observations) for constraints on the large-scale temperature distribution ofthe icg. we find that amiba13 visibilities should constrain the scale radius ofthe temperature distribution to about 50% accuracy. we conclude that theupgraded amiba, amiba13, should be a powerful instrument to constrain thelarge-scale distribution of the icg.

1101.3459	an overall picture of the gas flow in massive cluster forming region:  the case of g10.6-0.4	the massive clump g10.6-0.4 is an ob cluster forming region, in whichmultiple uc hii regions have been identified. in the present study, we reportarcsecond resolution observations of the cs (1-0) transition, the nh$_{3}$(3,3) main hyperfine inversion transition, the ch$_{3}$oh j=5 transitions, andthe centimeter free-free continuum emissions in this region. the comparisons ofthe molecular line emissions with the free--free continuum emissions reveal a0.5 pc scale massive molecular envelope which is being partially dispersed bythe dynamically-expanding bipolar ionized cavity. the massive envelope isrotationally flattened and has an enhanced molecular density in the mid-plane.in the center of this massive clump lies a compact ($&lt;$0.1 pc) hot($\gtrsim$100 k) toroid, in which a cluster of o--type stars has formed. thisoverall geometry is analogous to the standard core collapse picture in thelow-mass star forming region, with a central (proto-)stellar object, a disk, anenvelope, and a bipolar outflow and outflow cavity. however, g10.6-0.4 has amuch larger physical size scale ($\le$0.1 pc for typical low--mass star formingcore). based on the observations, we propose a schematic picture of the obcluster forming region, which incorporates the various physical mechanisms.this model will be tested with the observations of other embedded ob clusters,and with numerical simulations.

1104.2831	molecular outflows in the substellar domain: millimeter observations of  young very low mass objects in taurus and rho ophiuchi	we report here our search for molecular outflows from young very low massstars and brown dwarfs in taurus and rho ophiuchi. using the submillimeterarray (sma) and the combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy(carma), we have observed 4 targets at 1.3 mm wavelength (230 ghz) to searchfor co j=2--&gt;1 outflows. a young very low mass star mho 5 (in taurus) with anestimated mass of 90 m_j, which is just above the hydrogen-burning limit, showstwo gas lobes that are likely outflows. while the co map of mho 5 does not showa clear structure of outflow, possibly due to environment gas, itsposition-velocity diagram indicates two distinct blue- and redshiftedcomponents. we therefore conclude that they are components of a bipolarmolecular outflow from mho 5. we estimate an outflow mass of 7.0 x 10^-5 m_sunand a mass-loss rate of 9.0 x 10^-10 m_sun. these values are over two orders ofmagnitude smaller than the typical ones for t tauri stars and somewhat weakerthan those we have observed in the young brown dwarf iso-oph 102 of 60 m_j inrho ophiuchi. this makes mho~5 the first young very low mass star showing abipolar molecular outflow in taurus. the detection boosts the scenario thatvery low mass objects form like low-mass stars but in a version scaled down bya factor of over 100.

1110.2496	unveiling the physical properties and kinematics of molecular gas in the  antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/9) through high resolution co (j = 3-2)  observations	we present a ~ 1" (100 pc) resolution 12co (3-2) map of the nearbyintermediate stage interacting galaxy pair ngc 4038/9 (the antennae galaxies)obtained with the submillimeter array. we find that half the co (3-2) emissionoriginates in the overlap region where most of the tidally induced starformation had been previously found in shorter wavelength images, with the restbeing centered on each of the nuclei. the gross distribution is consistent withlower resolution single dish images, but we show for the first time thedetailed distribution of the warm and dense molecular gas across this galaxypair at resolutions comparable to the size of a typical giant molecularcomplex. while we find that 58% (33/57) of the spatially resolved giantmolecular associations (gmas; a few x 100 pc) are located in the overlapregion, only \leqq 30% spatially coincides with the optically detected starclusters, suggesting that the bulk of the co (3-2) emission traces the regionswith very recent or near future star formation activity. the spatialdistribution of the co (3-2)/co (1-0) integrated brightness temperature ratiosmainly range between 0.3 and 0.8, which suggests that on average the co (3-2)line in the antennae is not completely thermalized and similar to the averagevalues of nearby spirals. a higher ratio is seen in both nuclei and thesouthern complexes in the overlap region. higher radiation field associatedwith intense star formation can account for the nucleus of ngc 4038 and theoverlap region, but the nuclear region of ngc 4039 show relatively little starformation or agn activities and cannot be easily explained. we show kinematicalevidence that the high line ratio in ngc 4039 is possibly caused by gas inflowinto the counter-rotating central disk.

0710.2635	the co molecular outflows of iras 16293-2422 probed by the submillimeter  array	we have mapped the proto-binary source iras 16293-2422 in co 2-1, 13co 2-1,and co 3-2 with the submillimeter array (sma). the maps with resolution of1".5-5" reveal a single small scale (~3000 au) bipolar molecular outflow alongthe east-west direction. we found that the blueshifted emission of this smallscale outflow mainly extends to the east and the redshifted emission to thewest from the position of iras 16293a. a comparison with the morphology of thelarge scale outflows previously observed by single-dish telescopes atmillimeter wavelengths suggests that the small scale outflow may be the innerpart of the large scale (~15000 au) e-w outflow. on the other hand, there is noclear counterpart of the large scale ne-sw outflow in our sma maps. comparinganalytical models to the data suggests that the morphology and kinematics ofthe small scale outflow can be explained by a wide-angle wind with aninclination angle of ~30-40 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky. thehigh resolution co maps show that there are two compact, bright spots in theblueshifted velocity range. an lvg analysis shows that the one located 1" tothe east of source a is extremely dense, n(h_2)~10^7 cm^-3, and warm, t_kin &gt;55k. the other one located 1" southeast of source b has a higher temperature oft_kin &gt;65 k but slightly lower density of n(h_2)~10^6 cm^-3. it is likely thatthese bright spots are associated with the hot core-like emission observedtoward iras 16293. since both two bright spots are blueshifted from thesystemic velocity and are offset from the protostellar positions, they arelikely formed by shocks.

1201.0336	probing circumnuclear environments with the hcn(j = 3-2) and hco+(j =  3-2) lines: case of ngc 1097	we present the first interferometric hcn(j = 3-2) and hco+(j = 3-2) maps inthe circumnuclear region of ngc 1097, obtained with the submillimeter array.the goal is to study the characteristics of the dense gas associated with thestarburst ring/seyfert nucleus. with these transitions, we suppress the diffuselow density emission in the nuclear region. we detect and resolve theindividual compact giant molecular cloud associations (gmas) in the 1.4 kpccircumnuclear starburst ring and within the 350 pc nuclear region. the nucleusis brighter than the ring in both lines, and contributes to ~20% and ~30% tothe total detected hco+(j = 3-2) and hcn(j = 3-2) flux, within the central 1.4kpc. the intensity ratios of hcn(j = 3-2)/hco+(j = 3-2) are roughly unity inthe gmas of the starburst ring. however, this ratio is up to ~2 in the nuclearregion. from the hcn(j = 3-2)/hcn(j = 1-0) ratio of &lt;0.2 in the nucleus, weinfer that the nuclear hcn(j = 3-2) emission might be optically thin. thehco+(j = 3-2) and hcn(j = 3-2) show correlations with 12co(j = 3-2) and the24{\mu}m emission. the tight correlations of hcn(j = 3-2), hco+(j = 3-2) and24{\mu}m emission in the starburst ring suggest that the dense molecular gasand the dust are from the same origins of star forming regions. on the otherhand, the hcn(j = 3-2) emission of the nucleus is significantly enhanced,indicating mechanisms other than star formation, such as agn activities. aself-consistent check of the fractional abundance enhanced by x-ray ionizationchemistry of the nucleus is possible with our observations.

1201.4263	magnetic field strength maps for molecular clouds: a new method based on  a polarization - intensity gradient relation	dust polarization orientations in molecular clouds often tend to be close totangential to the stokes $i$ dust continuum emission contours. the magneticfield and the emission gradient orientations, therefore, show some correlation.a method is proposed, which -- in the framework of ideal magneto-hydrodynamics(mhd) -- connects the measured angle between magnetic field and emissiongradient orientations to the total field strength. the approach is based on theassumption that a change in emission intensity (gradient) is a measure for theresulting direction of motion in the mhd force equation. in particular, thisnew method leads to maps of position-dependent magnetic field strengthestimates. when evaluating the field curvature and the gravity directionlocally on a map, the method can be generalized to arbitrary cloud shapes. thetechnique is applied to high-resolution ($\sim0\farcs7$) submillimeter arraypolarization data of the collapsing core w51 e2. a tentative $\sim 7.7$~mgfield strength is found when averaging over the entire core. the analysisfurther reveals some structures and an azimuthally averaged radial profile$\sim r^{-1/2}$ for the field strength. maximum values close to the center arearound $19$~mg. the currently available observations lack higher resolutiondata to probe the innermost part of the core where the largest field strengthis expected from the method. application regime and limitations of the methodare discussed. as a further important outcome of this technique, the localsignificance of the magnetic field force compared to the other forces can bequantified in a model-independent way, from measured angles only. finally, themethod can potentially also be expanded and applied to other objects (besidesmolecular clouds) with measurements that reveal the field morphology, as e.g.faraday rotation measurements in galaxies.

1201.4313	quantifying the significance of the magnetic field from large-scale  cloud to collapsing core: self-similarity, mass-to-flux ratio and star  formation efficiency	dust polarization observational results are analyzed for the high-mass starformation region w51 from the largest parent cloud ($\sim$ 2~pc, jcmt) to thelarge-scale envelope ($\sim$ 0.5~pc, bima) down to the collapsing core e2($\sim$ 60~mpc, sma). magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientationsreveal a correlation which becomes increasingly more tight with higherresolution. the previously developed polarization - intensity gradient method(koch et al. 2012) is applied in order to quantify the magnetic fieldsignificance. this technique provides a way to estimate the local magneticfield force compared to gravity without the need of any mass or field strengthmeasurements, solely making use of measured angles which reflect thegeometrical imprint of the various forces. all three data sets clearly showregions with distinct features in the field-to-gravity force ratio. azimuthallyaveraged radial profiles of this force ratio reveal a transition from a fielddominance at larger distances to a gravity dominance closer to the emissionpeaks. normalizing these profiles to a characteristic core scale points towardself-similarity. furthermore, the polarization intensity-gradient method islinked to the mass-to-flux ratio, providing a new approach to estimate thelatter one without mass and field strength inputs. a transition from amagnetically supercritical to a subcritical state as a function of distancefrom the emission peak is found for the e2 core. finally, based on the measuredradius-dependent field-to-gravity force ratio we derive a modified starformation efficiency with a diluted gravity force. compared to a standard(free-fall) efficiency, the observed field is capable of reducing theefficiency down to 10\% or less.

1202.1576	the taiwan ecdfs near-infrared survey: very bright end of the luminosity  function at z&gt;7	the primary goal of the taiwan ecdfs near-infrared survey (tenis) is to findwell screened galaxy candidates at z&gt;7 (z' dropout) in the extended chandradeep field-south (ecdfs). to this end, tenis provides relatively deep j and ksdata (~25.3 abmag, 5-sigma) for an area of 0.5*0.5 degree. leveraged withexisting data at mid-infrared to optical wavelengths, this allows us to screenfor the most luminous high-z objects, which are rare and thus require a surveyover a large field to be found. we introduce new color selection criteria toselect a z&gt;7 sample with minimal contaminations from low-z galaxies andgalactic cool stars; to reduce confusion in the relatively low angularresolution irac images, we introduce a novel deconvolution method to measurethe irac fluxes of individual sources. illustrating perhaps the effectivenessat which we screen out interlopers, we find only one z&gt;7 candidate, tenis-zd1.the candidate has a weighted z_phot of 7.8, and its colors and luminosityindicate a young (45m years old) starburst galaxy with a stellar mass of3.2*10^10 m_sun. the result matches with the observational luminosity functionanalysis and the semi-analytic simulation result based on the millenniumsimulations, which may over predict the volume density for high-z massivegalaxies. the existence of tenis-zd1, if confirmed spectroscopically to be atz&gt;7, therefore poses a challenge to current theoretical models for how so muchmass can accumulate in a galaxy at such a high redshift.

1211.2666	early stages of cluster formation: fragmentation of massive dense cores  down to ~1000 au	in order to study the fragmentation of massive dense cores, which constitutethe cluster cradles, we observed with the pdbi in the most extendedconfiguration the continuum at 1.3 mm and the co(2-1) emission of four massivecores. we detect dust condensations down to ~0.3 msun and separate millimetersources down to 0.4" or ~1000 au, comparable to the sensitivities andseparations reached in optical/infrared studies of clusters. the co(2-1) highangular resolution images reveal high-velocity knots usually aligned withpreviously known outflow directions. this, in combination with additional coresfrom the literature observed at similar mass sensitivity and spatialresolution, allowed us to build a sample of 18 protoclusters with luminositiesspanning 3 orders of magnitude. among the 18 regions, ~30% show no signs offragmentation, while 50% split up into ~4 millimeter sources. we compiled alist of properties for the 18 massive dense cores, such as bolometricluminosity, total mass, and mean density, and found no correlation of any ofthese parameters with the fragmentation level. in order to investigate thecombined effects of magnetic field, radiative feedback and turbulence in thefragmentation process, we compared our observations to radiationmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations, and found that the low-fragmented regions arewell reproduced in the magnetized core case, while the highly-fragmentedregions are consistent with cores where turbulence dominates over the magneticfield. overall, our study suggests that the fragmentation in massive densecores could be determined by the initial magnetic field/turbulence balance ineach particular core.

1211.4744	alma and vla observations of the outflows in iras 16293-2422	we present alma and vla observations of the molecular and ionized gas at0.1-0.3 arcsec resolution in the class 0 protostellar system iras 16293-2422.these data clarify the origins of the protostellar outflows from the deeplyembedded sources in this complex region. source a2 is confirmed to be at theorigin of the well known large scale north-east--south-west flow. the mostrecent vla observations reveal a new ejection from that protostar,demonstrating that it drives an episodic jet. the central compact part of theother known large scale flow in the system, oriented roughly east-west, is welldelineated by the co(6-5) emission imaged with alma and is confirmed to bedriven from within component a. finally, a one-sided blueshifted bubble-likeoutflow structure is detected here for the first time from source b to thenorth-west of the system. its very short dynamical timescale (~ 200 yr), lowvelocity, and moderate collimation support the idea that source b is theyoungest object in the system, and possibly one of the youngest protostarsknown.

1211.6842	hierarchical fragmentation of the orion molecular filaments	we present a high angular resolution map of 850 um continuum emission of theorion molecular cloud-3 (omc 3) obtained with the submillimeter array (sma);the map is a mosaic of 85 pointings covering an approximate area of 6'.5 x 2'.0(0.88 x 0.27 pc). we detect 12 spatially resolved continuum sources, each withan h_2 mass between 0.3-5.7 mo and a projected source size between 1400-8200au. all the detected sources are on the filamentary main ridge n_h2&gt;10^6cm^-3), and analysis based on the jeans theorem suggests that they are mostlikely gravitationally unstable. comparison of multi-wavelength data setsindicates that of the continuum sources, 6/12 (50 %) are associated withmolecular outflows, 8/12 (67 %) are associated with infrared sources, and 3/12(25 %) are associated with ionized jets. the evolutionary status of thesesources ranges from prestellar cores to protostar phase, confirming that omc-3is an active region with ongoing embedded star-formation. we detectquasi-periodical separations between the omc-3 sources of ~17"/0.035 pc. thisspatial distribution is part of a large hierarchical structure, that alsoincludes fragmentation scales of gmc (~35 pc), large-scale clumps (~1.3 pc),and small-scale clumps (~0.3 pc), suggesting that hierarchical fragmentationoperates within the orion a molecular cloud. the fragmentation spacings areroughly consistent with the thermal fragmentation length in large-scale clumps,while for small-scale cores it is smaller than the local fragmentation length.these smaller spacings observed with the sma can be explained by either ahelical magnetic field, cloud rotation, or/and global filament collapse.finally, possible evidence for sequential fragmentation is suggested in thenorthern part of the omc-3 filament.

1212.0656	dust continuum and polarization from envelope to cores in star  formation: a case study in the w51 north region	we present the first high-angular resolution (up to 0.7", ~5000 au)polarization and thermal dust continuum images toward the massive star-formingregion w51 north. the observations were carried out with the submillimeterarray (sma) in both the subcompact (sma-subc) and extended (sma-ext)configurations at a wavelength of 870 micron. w51 north is resolved into fourcores (sma1 to sma4) in the 870 micron continuum image. the associated dustpolarization exhibits more complex structures than seen at lower angularresolution. we analyze the inferred morphologies of the plane-of-sky magneticfield (b_bot) in the sma1 to sma4 cores and in the envelope using the sma-extand sma-subc data. these results are compared with the b_bot archive imagesobtained from the cso and jcmt. a correlation between dust intensity gradientposition angles (phi_{nabla i}) and magnetic field position angles (phi_b) isfound in the cso, jcmt and both sma data sets. this correlation is furtheranalyzed quantitatively. a systematically tighter correlation betweenphi_{nabla i} and phi_b is found in the cores, whereas the correlationdecreases in outside-core regions. magnetic field-to-gravity force ratio(sigma_b) maps are derived using the newly developed polarization - intensitygradient method by koch, tang &amp; ho 2012. we find that the force ratios tend tobe small (sigma_b &lt;= 0.5) in the cores in all 4 data sets. in regions outsideof the cores, the ratios increase or the field is even dominating gravity(sigma_b &gt; 1). this possibly provides a physical explanation of the tighteningcorrelation between phi_{nabla i} and phi_b in the cores: the more the b fieldlines are dragged and aligned by gravity, the tighter the correlation is.finally, we propose a schematic scenario for the magnetic field in w51 north tointerpret the four polarization observations at different physical scales.

1304.5136	properties of dense cores in clustered massive star-forming regions at  high angular resolution	we aim at characterising dense cores in the clustered environments associatedwith massive star-forming regions. for this, we present an uniform analysis ofvla nh3(1,1) and (2,2) observations towards a sample of 15 massive star-formingregions, where we identify a total of 73 cores, classify them as protostellar,quiescent starless, or perturbed starless, and derive some physical properties.the average sizes and ammonia column densities are 0.06 pc and 10^15 cm^-2,respectively, with no significant differences between the starless andprotostellar cores, while the linewidth and rotational temperature of quiescentstarless cores are smaller, 1.0 km/s and 16 k, than those of protostellar (1.8km/s, 21 k), and perturbed starless (1.4 km/s, 19 k) cores. such linewidths andtemperatures for these quiescent starless cores in the surroundings of massivestars are still significantly larger than the typical values measured instarless cores of low-mass star-forming regions, implying an importantnon-thermal component. we confirm at high angular resolutions the correlationspreviously found with single-dish telescopes between the linewidth, thetemperature of the cores, and the bolometric luminosity. in addition, we find acorrelation between the temperature of each core and the incident flux from themost massive star in the cluster, suggesting that the large temperaturesmeasured in the starless cores of our sample could be due to heating from thenearby massive star. a simple virial equilibrium analysis seems to suggest ascenario of a self-similar, self-graviting, turbulent, virialised hierarchy ofstructures from clumps (0.1-10 pc) to cores (0.05 pc). a closer inspection ofthe dynamical state taking into account external pressure effects, reveal thatrelatively strong magnetic field support may be needed to stabilise the cores,or that they are unstable and thus on the verge of collapse.

1305.1703	platform deformation phase correction for the amiba-13 co-planar  interferometer	we present a new way to solve the platform deformation problem of co-planarinterferometers. the platform of a co-planar interferometer can be deformed dueto driving forces and gravity. a deformed platform will induce extra componentsinto the geometric delay of each baseline, and change the phases of observedvisibilities. the reconstructed images will also be diluted due to the errorsof the phases. the platform deformations of the yuan-tseh lee array formicrowave background anisotropy (amiba) were modelled based on photogrammetrydata with about 20 mount pointing positions. we then used the differentialoptical pointing error between two optical telescopes to fit the modelparameters in the entire horizontal coordinate space. with the platformdeformation model, we can predict the errors of the geometric phase delays dueto platform deformation with given azimuth and elevation of the targets andcalibrators. after correcting the phases of the radio point sources in theamiba interferometric data, we recover 50% - 70% flux loss due to phase errors.this allows us to restore more than 90% of a source flux. the method outlinedin this work is not only applicable to the correction of deformation for otherco-planar telescopes but also to single dish telescopes with deformationproblems. this work also forms the basis of the upcoming science results ofamiba-13.

1308.6185	interpreting the role of the magnetic field from dust polarization maps	dust polarization observations from the submillimeter array (sma) and thecaltech submillimeter observatory (cso) are analyzed with the goal of providinga general tool to interpret the role of the magnetic field in molecular clouds.magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations are observed to showdistinct patterns and features. the angle $\delta$ between these twoorientations can be interpreted as a magnetic field alignment deviation,assuming the emission gradient orientation to coincide with the densitygradient orientation in the magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) force equation. in smahigh-resolution (collapsing) cores, additional symmetry properties in $\delta$can reveal accretion and outflow zones. all these observational findingssuggest the angle $\delta$ to be a relevant quantity that can assess the roleof the magnetic field. indeed, when comparing this angle with the(projection-free) magnetic field significance \sigma_b (koch et al. 2012a), itis demonstrated that |\delta| yields an approximation to the change in\sigma_b. thus, changes in the magnetic field alignment deviation $\delta$trace changes in the role of the magnetic field. the angle $\delta$ isobservationally straightforward to determine, providing a tool to distinguishbetween zones of minor or significant magnetic field impact. this isexemplified by the cso m+0.25+0.01, mon r2, co+0.02-0.02, m-0.02-0.07 sourcesand by the sma high-resolution data from w51 e2, w51 north, orion bn/kl andg5.89. additional cso sources are analyzed, providing further support of thisresult. finally, based on the different features found in our sample of 31sources in total, covering sizes from large-scale complexes to collapsingcores, a schematic evolutionary scenario is proposed (abridged).

0802.4205	prevalence of tidal interactions among local seyfert galaxies	no mechanisms have hitherto been conclusively demonstrated to be responsiblefor initiating optically-luminous nuclear (seyfert) activity in local diskgalaxies. only a small minority of such galaxies are visibly disturbed inoptical starlight, with the observed disturbances being at best marginallystronger than those found in matched samples of inactive galaxies. here, wereport the first systematic study of an optically-selected sample oftwenty-three active galaxies in atomic hydrogen (hi) gas, which is the mostsensitive and enduring tracer known of tidal interactions. eighteen of thesegalaxies are (generally) classified as seyferts, with over half (and perhapsall) having [oiii] luminosities within two orders of magnitude of quasi-stellarobjects. only ~28% of these seyfert galaxies are visibly disturbed in opticaldss2 images. by contrast, ~94% of the same galaxies are disturbed in hi, innearly all cases not just spatially but also kinematically on galactic (&gt;~20kpc) scales. in at least ~67% and perhaps up to ~94% of cases, the observed hidisturbances can be traced to tidal interactions with neighboring galaxiesdetected also in hi. the majority of these neighboring galaxies have projectedseparations of &lt;~ 100 kpc and differ in radial velocities by &lt;~100 km/s fromtheir respective seyfert galaxies, and many have optical luminosities rangingfrom the small to large magellanic clouds. in a companion paper, we show thatonly ~15% of a matched control sample of inactive galaxies display comparablehi disturbances. our results suggest that: i) most seyfert galaxies (with highnuclear luminosities) have experienced tidal interactions in the recent past;ii) in most cases, these tidal interactions are responsible for initiatingevents that lead to their nuclear activity.

1407.3984	magnetic fields and massive star formation	massive stars ($m &gt; 8$ \msun) typically form in parsec-scale molecular clumpsthat collapse and fragment, leading to the birth of a cluster of stellarobjects. we investigate the role of magnetic fields in this process throughdust polarization at 870 $\mu$m obtained with the submillimeter array (sma).the sma observations reveal polarization at scales of $\lsim$ 0.1 pc. thepolarization pattern in these objects ranges from ordered hour-glassconfigurations to more chaotic distributions. by comparing the sma data withthe single dish data at parsec scales, we found that magnetic fields at densecore scales are either aligned within $40^\circ$ of or perpendicular to theparsec-scale magnetic fields. this finding indicates that magnetic fields playan important role during the collapse and fragmentation of massive molecularclumps and the formation of dense cores. we further compare magnetic fields indense cores with the major axis of molecular outflows. despite a limited numberof outflows, we found that the outflow axis appears to be randomly orientedwith respect to the magnetic field in the core. this result suggests that atthe scale of accretion disks ($\lsim 10^3$ au), angular momentum and dynamicinteractions possibly due to close binary or multiple systems dominate overmagnetic fields. with this unprecedentedly large sample massive clumps, weargue on a statistical basis that magnetic fields play an important role duringthe formation of dense cores at spatial scale of 0.01 - 0.1 pc in the contextof massive star and cluster star formation.

1408.4506	characterization of molecular outflows in the substellar domain	we report here our latest search for molecular outflows from young browndwarfs and very low-mass stars in nearby star-forming regions. we have observedthree sources in taurus with the submillimeter array and the combined array forresearch in millimeter-wave astronomy at 230 ghz frequency to search for coj=2-1 outflows. we obtain a tentative detection of a redshifted and extendedgas lobe at about 10 arcsec from the source gm tau, a young brown dwarf intaurus with an estimated mass of 73 m_j, which is right below thehydrogen-burning limit. no blueshifted emission around the brown dwarf positionis detected. the redshifted gas lobe that is elongated in the northeastdirection suggests a possible bipolar outflow from the source with a positionangle of about 36 degrees. assuming that the redshifted emission is outflowemission from gm tau, we then estimate a molecular outflow mass in the rangefrom 1.9x10^-6 m_sun to 2.9x10^-5 m_sun and an outflow mass-loss rate from2.7x10^-9 m_sun yr^-1 to 4.1x10^-8 m_sun yr^-1. these values are comparable tothose we have observed in the young brown dwarf iso-oph 102 of 60 m_j in rhoophiuchi and the very low-mass star mho 5 of 90 m_j in taurus. our resultssuggest that the outflow process in very low-mass objects is episodic withduration of a few thousand years and the outflow rate of active episodes doesnot significantly change for different stages of the formation process of verylow-mass objects. this may provide us with important implications that clarifythe formation process of brown dwarfs.

1410.3927	transition from the infalling envelope to the keplerian disk around  l1551 irs 5	we present combined submillimeter array (sma) + atacama submillimetertelescope experiment (aste) images of the class i protobinary l1551 irs 5 inthe cs ($j$ = 7--6) line, the submillimeter images of l1551 irs 5 with the mostcomplete spatial sampling ever achieved ($0''.9$ -- $36''$). the sma image ofl1551 irs 5 in the 343 ghz dust-continuum emission is also presented, whichshows an elongated feature along the northwest to southeast direction($\sim$160 au $\times$ 80 au), perpendicular to the associated radio jets. thecombined sma+aste images show that the high-velocity ($\gtrsim$1.5 km s$^{-1}$)cs emission traces the structure of the dust component and shows a velocitygradient along the major axis, which is reproduced by a geometrically-thinkeplerian-disk model with a central stellar mass of $\sim$0.5 $m_{\odot}$. thelow-velocity ($\lesssim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$) cs emission shows an extended($\sim$1000 au) feature that exhibits slight south (blueshifted) to north(redshifted) emission offsets, which is modeled with a rotating and infallingenvelope with a conserved angular momentum. the rotational motion of theenvelope connects smoothly to the inner keplerian rotation at a radius of$\sim$64 au. the infalling velocity of the envelope is $\sim$three times lowerthan the free-fall velocity toward the central stellar mass of 0.5 $m_{\odot}$.these results demonstrate transition from the infalling envelope to thekeplerian disk, consistent with the latest theoretical studies of diskformation. we suggest that sizable ($r\sim$50--200 au) keplerian disks arealready formed when the protostars are still deeply embedded in the envelopes.

0806.0217	sma imaging of co(3-2) line and 860 micron continuum of arp 220 :  tracing the spatial distribution of luminosity	we used the submillimeter array (sma) to image 860 micron continuum andco(3-2) line emission in the ultraluminous merging galaxy arp 220, achieving aresolution of 0.23" (80 pc) for the continuum and 0.33" (120 pc) for the line.the co emission peaks around the two merger nuclei with a velocity signature ofgas rotation around each nucleus, and is also detected in a kpc-size diskencompassing the binary nucleus. the dust continuum, in contrast, is mostlyfrom the two nuclei. the beam-averaged brightness temperature of both line andcontinuum emission exceeds 50 k at and around the nuclei, revealing thepresence of warm molecular gas and dust. the dust emission morphologicallyagrees with the distribution of radio supernova features in the east nucleus,as expected when a starburst heats the nucleus. in the brighter west nucleus,however, the submillimeter dust emission is more compact than the supernovadistribution. the 860 micron core, after deconvolution, has a size of 50-80 pc,consistent with recent 1.3 mm observations, and a peak brightness temperatureof (0.9-1.6)x10^2 k. its bolometric luminosity is at least 2x10^{11} lsun andcould be ~10^{12} lsun depending on source structure and 860 micron opacity,which we estimate to be of the order of tau_{860} ~ 1 (i.e., n_{h_2} ~ 10^{25}cm^{-2}). the starbursting west nuclear disk must have in its center a dustenshrouded agn or a very young starburst equivalent to hundreds of super starclusters. further spatial mapping of bolometric luminosity throughsubmillimeter imaging is a promising way to identify the heavily obscuredheating sources in arp 220 and other luminous infrared galaxies.

astro-ph;0206077	nh3 in the central 10 pc of the galaxy. ii. determination of opacity for  gas with large linewidths	the 23 ghz emission lines from the nh3 rotation inversion transitions arewidely used to investigate the kinematics and physical conditions in densemolecular clouds. the line profile is composed of hyperfine components whichcan be used to calculate the opacity of the gas (ho &amp; townes 1983). if theintrinsic linewidth of the gas exceeds one half of the separation of thesequadrupole hyperfine components (~5-10 km/s) these lines blend together and theobserved linewidths greatly overestimate the intrinsic linewidths. ifuncorrected, these artificially broad linewidths will lead to artificially highopacities. we have observed this effect in our nh3 data from the central 10 pcof the galaxy where uncorrected nh3 (1,1) linewidths of ~30 km/s exaggerate theintrinsic linewidths by more than a factor of two (genzel &amp; townes 1987).models of the effect of blending on the line profile enable us to solve for theintrinsic linewidth and opacity of nh3 using the observed linewidth andintensity of two nh3 rotation inversion transitions. we present the result ofthe application of this method to our galactic center data. we successfullyrecover the intrinsic linewidth and opacity of the gas. clouds close to thenucleus in projected distance as well as those that are being impacted by sgr aeast show the highest intrinsic linewidths. the cores of the ``southernstreamer'' (ho et al. 1991; coil &amp; ho 1999, 2000) and the ``50 km/s'' giantmolecular cloud have the highest opacities.

astro-ph;0407009	a cluster of 1.3 cm continuum sources in omc1 south	we present sensitive 1.3 cm radio continuum observations of the region omc1south (omc-1s) in orion using the very large array in its b configuration. wedetect eleven radio sources clustered in a $30{''} \times 30{''}$ region, ofwhich only three had been detected previously at radio wavelengths in deep 3.6cm observations. the eight new radio sources are compact ($\theta_s \leq0\rlap.{''}1$) and we set lower limits to their spectral indices, $\alpha &gt; 0.8\pm 0.3$ (with $s_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$), that suggest that they may beoptically-thick h ii regions. however, one of the new sources exhibitssignificant circular polarization, indicating that gyrosynchrotron emissionwith large positive spectral indices may be an alternative explanation.furthermore, we find that four other sources are associated with infraredsources of low bolometric luminosity that cannot drive an h ii region. finally,two of the sources previously detected at 3.6-cm are angularly resolved in the1.3 cm image and their major axes have position angles that align well withlarge scale outflows emanating from omc-1s. the radio source 143-353 has amajor axis with a position angle consistent with those of the hh 202 and hh 528flows, while the radio source 134-411 has a major axis with a position angleconsistent with that of the low-velocity molecular outflow associated with thefar-infrared source fir~4.

astro-ph;0407102	the dense molecular cores in the iras 21391+5802 region	we present a detailed kinematical study and modeling of the emission of themolecular cores at ambient velocities surrounding iras 21391+5802, anintermediate-mass protostar embedded in ic 1396n. the high-density gas emissionis found in association with three dense cores associated with the ysos bima 1,bima 2, and bima 3. the cs (5-4) and ch3oh (5-4) emission around bima 1 hasbeen modeled by considering a spatially infinitely thin ring seen edge-on bythe observer. from the model we find that cs is detected over a wider radiirange than ch3oh. a bipolar outflow is detected in the cs (2-1) line centerednear bima 1. this outflow could be powered by a yet undetected yso, bima 1w, oralternatively could be part of the bima 1 molecular outflow. the cs and ch3ohemission associated with the intermediate-mass protostar bima 2 is highlyperturbed by the bipolar outflow even at cloud velocities, confirming that theprotostar is in a very active stage of mass loss. for yso bima 3 the lack ofoutflow and of clear evidence of infall suggests that both outflow and infallare weaker than in bima 1, and that bima 3 is probably a more evolved object.

(1999a) with the iram 30 m. ourobservations resolve the outflow, whose velocity-integrated emission has adeconvolved width of 0.89'' \pm 0.06'' (490 au) and a projected length of ~48'' (21,000 au) with very high redshifted and blueshifted gas with velocitiesof about \pm 80 km/s. this outflow is among the most collimated (~ 3 degrees)and youngest outflows (600 yr) that have been reported. the data show that thiscollimated outflow has been blowing in the same direction during the last 600yr. at high velocities, the co(2-1) outflow traces an extremely collimated jet,while at lower velocities the co emission traces an envelope possibly producedby entrainment of ambient gas. furthermore, we also detect for the first time amillimeter wavelength continuum source possibly associated with a class iprotostar that we suggest could be the possible exciting source for thiscollimated outflow. however, the bolometric luminosity of this source appearsto be far too low to account for the powerful molecular outflow.

astro-ph;0509637	a disk of dust and molecular gas around a high-mass protostar	the processes leading to the birth of low-mass stars such as our sun havebeen well studied, but the formation of high-mass (&gt; 8 x sun's mass) stars hasheretofore remained poorly understood. recent observational studies suggestthat high-mass stars may form in essentially the same way as low-mass stars,namely via an accretion process, instead of via merging of several low-mass (&lt;8 msun) stars. however, there is as yet no conclusive evidence. here, we reportthe discovery of a flattened disk-like structure observed at submillimeterwavelengths, centered on a massive 15 msun protostar in the cepheus-a region.the disk, with a radius of about 330 astronomical units (au) and a mass of 1 to8 msun, is detected in dust continuum as well as in molecular line emission.its perpendicular orientation to, and spatial coincidence with the centralembedded powerful bipolar radio jet, provides the best evidence yet thatmassive stars form via disk accretion in direct analogy to the formation oflow-mass stars.

astro-ph;0603414	possible molecular spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk of ab aur	the circumstellar dust disk of the herbig ae star ab aur has been found toexhibit complex spiral-like structures in the near-ir image obtained with thesubaru telescope. we present maps of the disk in both 12co (3-2) and dustcontinuum at 345 ghz with the sma at an angular resolution of 1.0"x0.7" (144aux 100au). the continuum emission traces a dust disk with a central depressionand a maximum overall dimension of 450au (fwhm). this dust disk exhibitsseveral distinct peaks that appear to coincide with bright features in thenear-ir image, in particular the brightest inner spiral arm. the co emissiontraces a rotating gas disk of size 530au x 330au with a deprojected maximumvelocity of 2.8km/s at 450au. in contrast to the dust disk, the gas diskexhibits an intensity peak at the stellar position. furthermore, the coemission in several velocity channels traces the innermost spiral arm seen inthe near-ir. we compare the observed spatial-kinematic structure of the coemission to a simple model of a disk in keplerian rotation, and find that onlythe emission tracing the main spiral arm clearly lies outside the confines ofour model. this emission has a net outward radial motion compared with theradial velocity predicted by the model at the location of the main spiral arms.the disk of ab aur is therefore quite different from the keplerian disks seenaround many herbig ae stars. the spiral-like structures of the disk withnon-keplerian motions we revealed in 12co (3-2), together with the centraldepression of the dust disk, may be explained to be driven by the possibleexistence of a giant planet forming in the disk.

astro-ph;9806058	radiative transfer modelling of the accretion flow onto a star-forming  core in w51	we present an analysis of the temperature, density, and velocity of themolecular gas in the star-forming core around w51 e2. a previous paper (ho andyoung 1996) describes the kinematic evidence which implies that the core arounde2 is contracting onto a young massive star. the current paper presents atechnique for modelling the three-dimensional structure of the core bysimulating spectral line images of the source and comparing those images toobserved data. the primary conclusions of this work are that the molecular gasin e2 is radially contracting at about 5 km/s and that the temperature anddensity of the gas decrease outward over 0.15 pc scales. the simple model ofthe collapse of the singular isothermal sphere for low-mass star formation (shu1977) is an inadequate description of this high-mass molecular core; bettermodels have temperature decreasing outward as r^-0.6, density as r^-2, andvelocity increasing as r^+0.1. the core appears to be spherical rather thandisk-like at the scale of these observations, 0.3 pc. in this paper we show howa series of models of gradually increasing complexity can be used toinvestigate the sensitivity of the model to its parameters. major sources ofuncertainty for this method and this dataset are the interdependence oftemperature and density and the assumed nh3 abundance.

astro-ph;9809068	infalling gas towards the galactic center	vla maps of ammonia emission were made for the galactic center region. thenh3(1,1) and nh3(2,2) transitions were observed in three 2' x 2' fieldscovering sgr a* and the region 3' immediately south of it. in the central 3parsecs surrounding sgr a* we find emission which appears to be associated withthe circumnuclear disk (cnd), both morphologically and kinematically. thiscentral emission is connected to a long, narrow 2 pc x 10 pc streamer of clumpymolecular gas located towards the south, which appears to be carrying gas fromthe nearby 20 km/s giant molecular cloud (gmc) to the circumnuclear region. wefind a velocity gradient along the streamer, with progressively highervelocities as the gas approaches sgr a*. the streamer stops at the location ofthe cnd, where the line width of the nh3 emission increases dramatically. thismay be the kinematic signature of accretion onto the cnd. the ratio of thenh3(2,2)/nh3(1,1) emission indicates that the gas is heated at the northern tipof the streamer, located inside the eastern edge of the cnd. the morphology,kinematics and temperature gradients of the gas all indicate that the southernstreamer is located at the galactic center and is interacting with thecircumnuclear region.

0810.0969	mass and hot baryons in massive galaxy clusters from subaru weak lensing  and amiba sze observations	we present a multiwavelength analysis of a sample of four hot (t_x&gt;8kev)x-ray galaxy clusters (a1689, a2261, a2142, and a2390) using joint amibasunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) and subaru weak lensing observations, combinedwith published x-ray temperatures, to examine the distribution of mass and theintracluster medium (icm) in massive cluster environments. our observationsshow that a2261 is very similar to a1689 in terms of lensing properties. manytangential arcs are visible around a2261, with an effective einstein radius\sim 40 arcsec (at z \sim 1.5), which when combined with our weak lensingmeasurements implies a mass profile well fitted by an nfw model with a highconcentration c_{vir} \sim 10, similar to a1689 and to other massive clusters.the cluster a2142 shows complex mass substructure, and displays a shallowerprofile (c_{vir} \sim 5), consistent with detailed x-ray observations whichimply recent interaction. the amiba map of a2142 exhibits an sze featureassociated with mass substructure lying ahead of the sharp north-west edge ofthe x-ray core suggesting a pressure increase in the icm. for a2390 we obtainhighly elliptical mass and icm distributions at all radii, consistent withother x-ray and strong lensing work. our cluster gas fraction measurements,free from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, are overall in good agreementwith published x-ray and sze observations, with the sample-averaged gasfraction of &lt;f_{gas}&gt; = 0.133 \pm 0.027, for our sample &lt;m_{vir}&gt; = (1.2 \pm0.1) \times 10^{15} m_{sun} h^{-1}. when compared to the cosmic baryon fractionf_b = \omega_b/\omega_m constrained by the wmap 5-year data, this indicates&lt;f_{gas}&gt;/f_b = 0.78 \pm 0.16, i.e., (22 \pm 16)% of the baryons are missingfrom the hot phase of clusters.

0810.2588	first confirmed detection of a bipolar molecular outflow from a young  brown dwarf	studying the earliest stages in the birth of stars is crucial forunderstanding how they form. brown dwarfs with masses between that of stars andplanets are not massive enough to maintain stable hydrogen-burning fusionreactions during most of their lifetime. their origins are subject to muchdebate in recent literature because their masses are far below the typical masswhere core collapse is expected to occur. we present the first confirmedevidence that brown dwarfs undergo a phase of molecular outflow that is typicalof young stars. using the submillimeter array, we have obtained a map of abipolar molecular outflow from a young brown dwarf. we estimate an outflow massof 1.6 x 10^-4 m_sun and a mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^-9 m_sun. these valuesare over two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical ones for t tauristars. from our millimiter continuum data and our own analysis of spitzerinfrared photometry, we estimate that the brown dwarf has a disk with a mass of8 x 10^-3 m_sun and an outer disk radius of 80 au. our results demonstrate thatthe bipolar molecular outflow operates down to planetary masses, occurring inbrown dwarfs as a scaled-down version of the universal process seen in youngstars.

0810.5055	resolving the structure and kinematics of the bn object at $0\rlap.{"}2$  resolution	we present sensitive 7 mm observations of the h53$\alpha$ recombination lineand adjacent continuum, made toward the orion bn/kl region. in the continuum wedetect the bn object, the radio source i (gmr i) and the radio counterpart ofthe infrared source n (orion-n). comparing with observations made at similarangular resolutions but lower frequency, we discuss the spectral indices andangular sizes of these sources. in the h53$\alpha$ line we only detect the bnobject. this is the first time that radio recombination lines are detected fromthis source. the lsr radial velocity of bn from the h53$\alpha$ line, $v_{lsr}= 20.1 \pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$, is consistent with that found from previousstudies in near-infared lines. while the continuum emission is expected to haveconsiderable optical depth at 7 mm, the observed h53$\alpha$ line emission isconsistent with an optically-thin nature and we discuss possible explanationsfor this apparent discrepancy. there is evidence of a velocity gradient, withthe ne part of bn being redshifted by $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to thesw part. this is consistent with the suggestion of jiang et al. that bn may bedriving an ionized outflow along that direction.

0811.1675	tests of amiba data integrity	we describe methods used to validate data from the y.t. lee array formicrowave background anisotropy (amiba), an interferometric array designed tomeasure the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and the anisotropy of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb). we perform several statistical tests on data frompointed galaxy cluster observations taken in 2007 and noise data from long-termblank sky observations and measurements with the feeds covered by theabsorbers. we apply power spectrum analysis, cross power spectrum analysisamong different outputs with different time lags in our analog correlator, andsample variance law tests to noise data. we find that (1) there is no timevariation of electronic offsets on the time scale of our two-patch observations(~10 minutes); (2) noise is correlated by less than 10% between different lags;and (3) the variance of noise scales with the inverse of time. to test thegaussianity of the data, we apply kolmogorov-smirnov (k-s) tests to clusterdata, and find that a 5% significance level efficiently detects data sets withknown hardware problems without rejecting an excess of acceptable data. we alsocalculate third- and fourth-order moments and cumulants for the noise residualvisibilities and find that about 95% of our data are within the 99% confidenceregions of gaussianity.

0812.3444	evolution of magnetic fields in high mass star formation: sma dust  polarization image of the uchii region g5.89-0.39	we report high angular resolution (3") submillimeter array (sma) observationsof the molecular cloud associated with the ultra-compact hii region g5.89-0.39.imaged dust continuum emission at 870 micron reveals significant linearpolarization. the position angles (pas) of the polarization vary enormously butsmoothly in a region of 2x10^4 au. based on the distribution of the pas and theassociated structures, the polarized emission can be separated roughly into twocomponents. the component "x" is associated with a well defined dust ridge at870 micron, and is likely tracing a compressed b field. the component "o" islocated at the periphery of the dust ridge and is probably from the original bfield associated with a pre-existing extended structure. the global b fieldmorphology in g5.89, as inferred from the pas, is clearly disturbed by theexpansion of the hii region and the molecular outflows. using thechandrasekhar-fermi method, we estimate from the smoothness of the fieldstructures that the b field strength in the plane of sky can be no more than2-3 mg. we then compare the energy densities in the radiation, the b field, andthe mechanical motions as deduced from the c^17o 3-2 line emission. we concludethat the b field structures are already overwhelmed and dominated by theradiation, outflows, and turbulence from the newly formed massive stars.
