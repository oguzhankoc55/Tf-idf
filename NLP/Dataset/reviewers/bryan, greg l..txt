0901.2115	gas stripping in simulated galaxies with a multiphase ism	cluster galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (icm) are expected tolose some of their interstellar medium (ism) through ism-icm interactions. weperform high resolution (40 pc) three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ofa galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping including radiative cooling in orderto investigate stripping of a multiphase medium. the clumpy, multiphase ism isself-consistently produced by the inclusion of radiative cooling, and spans sixorders of magnitude in gas density. we find no large variations in the amountof gas lost whether or not cooling is involved, although the gas in themultiphase galaxy is stripped more quickly and to a smaller radius. we also seesignificant differences in the morphology of the stripped disks. this occursbecause the multiphase medium naturally includes high density clouds set insideregions of lower density. we find that the lower density gas is strippedquickly from any radius of the galaxy, and the higher density gas can then beablated. if high density clouds survive, through interaction with the icm theylose enough angular momentum to drift towards the center of the galaxy wherethey are no longer stripped. finally, we find that low ram pressure valuescompress gas into high density clouds that could lead to enhanced starformation, while high ram pressure leads to a smaller amount of high-densitygas.

0909.3097	the tail of the stripped gas that cooled: hi, halpha and x-ray  observational signatures of ram pressure stripping	galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (icm) of a cluster ofgalaxies can lose gas via ram pressure stripping. this stripped gas forms atail behind the galaxy which is potentially observable. in this paper, we carryout hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy undergoing stripping with a focus onthe gas properties in the wake and their observational signatures. we includeradiative cooling in an adaptive hydrocode in order to investigate the impactof a clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium. we find that including coolingresults in a very different morphology for the gas in the tail, with a muchwider range of temperatures and densities. the tail is significantly narrowerin runs with radiative cooling, in agreement with observed wakes. in addition,we make detailed predictions of h i, halpha and x-ray emission for the wake,showing that we generally expect detectable h i and halpha signatures, but noobservable x-ray emission (at least for our chosen ram-pressure strength andicm conditions). we find that the relative strength of the halpha diagnosticdepends somewhat on our adopted minimum temperature floor (below which we setcooling to zero to mimic physics processes not included in the simulation).

0707.1702	radial alignment in simulated clusters	observational evidence for the radial alignment of satellites with their darkmatter host has been accumulating steadily in the past few years. the effect isseen over a wide range of scales, from massive clusters of galaxies down togalaxy-sized systems, yet the underlying physical mechanism has still not beenestablished. to this end, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the shapesand orientations of dark matter substructures in high-resolution n-bodycosmological simulations. we find a strong tendency for radial alignment of thesubstructure with its host halo: the distribution of halo major axes is veryanisotropic, with the majority pointing towards the center of mass of the host.the alignment peaks once the sub-halo has passed the virial radius of the hostfor the first time, but is not subsequently diluted, even after the halos havegone through as many as four pericentric passages. this evidence points to theexistence of a very rapid dynamical mechanism acting on these systems and weargue that tidal torquing throughout their orbits is the most likely candidate.

1009.4191	tidal torquing of elliptical galaxies in cluster environments	observational studies of galaxy isophotal shapes have shown that galaxyorientations are anisotropic: a galaxy's long axis tends to be oriented towardthe center of its host. this radial alignment is seen across a wide range ofscales, from galaxies in massive clusters to small milky way type satellitesystems. recently, this effect has also been detected in dark mattersimulations of cosmological structure, but the degree of alignment of darkmatter substructures in these studies is significantly stronger than seen inobservations. in this paper we attempt to reconcile these two results byperforming high-resolution numerical experiments on n-body multi-componentmodels of triaxial galaxies orbiting in an external analytical potential. thelarge number of particles employed allows us to probe deep into the innerstructure of the galaxy: we show that the discrepancy between observed galaxiesand simulated dark matter halos is a natural consequence of induced radialshape twisting in the galaxy by the external potential. the degree of twistingdepends strongly on the orbital phase and eccentricity of the satellite, and itcan, under certain conditions, be significant at radii smaller than the darkmatter scale radius. such internal misalignments will have importantconsequences, both for the dynamical evolution of the galaxy itself, and formass modeling of galaxies in clustered environments.

0709.1720	environmentally-driven evolution of simulated cluster galaxies	galaxies in clusters are gas-deficient and a number of possible explanationsfor this observation have been advanced, including galaxy-cluster tidalinteractions, galaxy harassment, and ism-icm gas stripping. in this paper, weuse a cosmological simulation of cluster formation and evolution in order toexamine this issue from a theoretical standpoint. we follow a large number ofgalaxies over time and track each galaxy's gas and stellar mass changes todiscover what mechanism(s) dominate the evolution of the cluster galaxies. wefind that while gas is lost due to a wide variety of mechanisms, the mostcommon way is via a gas-only stripping event, and the amount of gas lostcorrelates with the ram-pressure the galaxy is experiencing. although thisgas-stripping occurs primarily in the central region (r &lt; 1 mpc), it is animportant mechanism out to the virial radius of the cluster. this is due to thewide scatter in ram-pressure strength that a galaxy experiences at fixedradius. we find that the timescale for complete gas removal is &gt; 1 gyr. inaddition, we find that galaxies in the field and in the cluster periphery (r &gt;2.4 mpc) often accrete cool gas; the accretion stops between 1-2.4 mpc,possibly indicating the onset of galaxy starvation.

0709.1972	the effect of the interstellar model on star formation properties in  galactic disks	we studied the effect of interstellar gas conditions on global galaxysimulations by considering three different models for the ism. our first modelincluded only radiative cooling down to 300 k, our second model added anadditional background heating term due to photoelectric heating, and our thirdmodel uses an isothermal equation of state with a temperature of 10^4 k and noexplicit heating or cooling. two common prescriptions for star formation areimplemented in each case. the first is based on cosmological simulations with alow threshold for star formation but also a low efficiency. the second assumesstars form only in high density regions but with a higher efficiency. we alsoexplore the effects of including feedback from type ii supernovae. we find thatthe different ism types produce marked differences in the structure of the diskand temperature phases present in the gas, although inclusion of feedbacklargely dominates these effects. in particular, size of the star-forming clumpswas increased both by background heating and by enforcing an isothermal ism. wealso looked at the one dimensional profiles and found that a lognormal pdfprovides a good fit for all our simulations over several orders of magnitude indensity. overall, despite noticeable structural differences, the star formationproperties in the disk are largely insensitive to ism type and agree reasonablywell with observations.

1105.4639	gas condensation in the galactic halo	using adaptive mesh refinement (amr) hydrodynamic simulations of verticallystratified hot halo gas, we examine the conditions under which clouds can formand condense out of the hot halo medium to potentially fuel star formation inthe gaseous disk. we find that halo clouds do not develop from linear isobaricperturbations. this is a regime where the cooling time is longer than thebrunt-vaisala time, confirming previous linear analysis. we extend the analysisinto the nonlinear regime by considering mildly or strongly nonlinearperturbations with overdensities up to 100, also varying the initial height,the cloud size, and the metallicity of the gas. here, the result depends on theratio of cooling time to the time required to accelerate the cloud to the soundspeed (similar to the dynamical time). if the ratio exceeds a critical valuenear unity, the cloud is accelerated without further cooling and gets disruptedby kelvin-helmholtz and/or rayleigh-taylor instabilities. if it is less thanthe critical value, the cloud cools and condenses before disruption. accretinggas with overdensities of 10-20 is expected to be marginally unstable; thecooling fraction will depend on the metallicity, the size of the incomingcloud, and the distance to the galaxy. locally enhanced overdensities withincold streams have a higher likelihood of cooling out. our results haveimplications on the evolution of clouds seeded by cold accretion that arebarely resolved in current cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and absorptionline systems detected in galaxy halos.

1106.3523	photodissociation of h2 in protogalaxies: modeling self-shielding in 3d  simulations	the ability of primordial gas to cool in proto-galactic haloes exposed tolyman-werner (lw) radiation is critically dependent on the self-shielding ofh_2. we perform radiative transfer calculations of lw line photons,post-processing outputs from three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement (amr)simulations of haloes with t_vir &gt; 10^4 k at redshifts around z=10. wecalculate the optically thick photodissociation rate numerically, including theeffects of density, temperature, and velocity gradients in the gas, as well asline overlap and shielding of h_2 by hi, over a large number of sight-lines. inlow-density regions (n&lt;10^4 cm^-3) the dissociation rates exceed those obtainedusing most previous approximations by more than an order of magnitude; thecorrection is smaller at higher densities. we trace the origin of thedeviations primarily to inaccuracies of (i) the most common fitting formula(draine &amp; bertoldi 1996) for the suppression of the dissociation rate and (ii)estimates for the effective shielding column density from local properties ofthe gas. the combined effects of gas temperature and velocity gradients arecomparatively less important, typically altering the spherically averaged rateonly by a factor of less than two. we present a simple modification to the db96fitting formula for the optically thick rate which improves agreement with ournumerical results to within approx. 15 per cent, and can be adopted in futuresimulations. we find that estimates for the effective shielding column can beimproved by using the local sobolev length. our correction to the h_2self-shielding reduces the critical lw flux to suppress h_2-cooling int_vir&gt;10^4 k haloes by an order of magnitude; this increases the number of suchhaloes in which supermassive (approx. m=10^5 m_sun) black holes may haveformed.

1107.5072	simulating the common envelope phase of a red giant using sph and  uniform grid codes	we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to study the rapid infallphase of the common envelope interaction of a red giant branch star of massequal to 0.88 \msun and a companion star of mass ranging from 0.9 down to 0.1\msun. we first compare the results obtained using two different numericaltechniques with different resolutions, and find overall very good agreement. wethen compare the outcomes of those simulations with observed systems thought tohave gone through a common envelope. the simulations fail to reproduce thosesystems in the sense that most of the envelope of the donor remains bound atthe end of the simulations and the final orbital separations between thedonor's remnant and the companion, ranging from 26.8 down to 5.9 \rsun, arelarger than the ones observed. we suggest that this discrepancy vouches forrecombination playing an essential role in the ejection of the envelope and/orsignificant shrinkage of the orbit happening in the subsequent phase.

1112.2701	simulating the cooling flow of cool-core clusters	we carry out high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement simulations of a coolcore cluster, resolving the flow from mpc scales down to pc scales. we do not(yet) include any agn heating, focusing instead on cooling in order tounderstand how gas gets to the supermassive black hole (smbh) at the center ofthe cluster. we find that, as the gas cools, the cluster develops a very flattemperature profile, undergoing a cooling catastrophe only in the central10-100 pc of the cluster. outside of this region, the flow is smooth, with nolocal cooling instabilities, and naturally produces very little low-temperaturegas (below a few kev), in agreement with observations. the gas cooling in thecenter of the cluster rapidly forms a thin accretion disk. the amount of coldgas produced at the very center grows rapidly until a reasonable estimate ofthe resulting agn heating rate (assuming even a moderate accretion efficiency)would overwhelm cooling. we argue that this naturally produces a thermostatwhich links the cooling of gas out to 100 kpc with the cold gas accretion inthe central 100 pc, potentially closing the loop between cooling and heating.isotropic heat conduction does not affect the result significantly, but we showthat including the potential well of the brightest cluster galaxy is necessaryto obtain the correct result. also, we found that the outcome is sensitive toresolution, requiring very high mass resolution to correctly reproduce thesmall transition radius.

1203.0308	star formation in ram pressure stripped tails	we investigate the impact of star formation and feedback on ram pressurestripping using high-resolution adaptive mesh simulations, building on aprevious series of papers that systematically investigated stripping using arealistic model for the interstellar medium, but without star formation. wefind that star formation does not significantly affect the rate at whichstripping occurs, and only has a slight impact on the density and temperaturedistribution of the stripped gas, indicating that our previous (gas-only)results are unaffected. for our chosen (moderate) ram pressure strength,stripping acts to truncate star formation in the disk over a few hundredmillion years, and does not lead to a burst of star formation. star formationin the bulge is slightly enhanced, but the resulting change in thebulge-to-disk ratio is insignificant. we find that stars do form in the tail,primarily from gas that is ablated from the disk and the cools and condenses inthe turbulent wake. the star formation rate in the tail is low, and anycontribution to the intracluster light is likely to be very small. we arguethat star formation in the tail depends primarily on the pressure in theintracluster medium, rather than the ram pressure strength. finally, we compareto observations of star formation in stripped tails, finding that many of thediscrepancies between our simulation and observed wakes can be accounted for bydifferent intracluster medium pressures.

1205.3825	gas accretion is dominated by warm ionized gas in milky way-mass  galaxies at z ~ 0	we perform high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a milky way-massgalaxy in a fully cosmological setting using the adaptive mesh refinement code,enzo, and study the kinematics of gas in the simulated galactic halo. we findthat the gas inflow occurs mostly along filamentary structures in the halo. thewarm-hot (10^5 k &lt; t &lt; 10^6 k) and hot (t &gt; 10^6 k) ionized gases are found todominate the overall mass accretion in the system (with dm/dt = 3-5 m_solar/yr)over a large range of distances, extending from the virial radius to thevicinity of the disk. most of the inflowing gas (by mass) does not cool, andthe small fraction that manages to cool does so primarily close to the galaxy(r &lt;~ 20 kpc), perhaps comprising the neutral gas that may be detectable as,e.g., high-velocity clouds. the neutral clouds are embedded within larger,accreting filamentary flows, and represent only a small fraction of the totalmass inflow rate. the inflowing gas has relatively low metallicity (z/z_solar &lt;0.2). the outer layers of the filamentary inflows are heated due to compressionas they approach the disk. in addition to the inflow, we find high-velocity,metal-enriched outflows of hot gas driven by supernova feedback. our resultsare consistent with observations of halo gas at low z.

1211.1071	the effect of feedback and reionization on star formation in low-mass  dwarf galaxy haloes	we simulate the evolution of a 10^9 msun dark matter halo in a cosmologicalsetting with an adaptive-mesh refinement code as an analogue to local lowluminosity dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the primary goal ofour study is to investigate the roles of reionization and supernova feedback indetermining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. we includea wide range of physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogenformation and cooling, photoionization and photodissociation from ametagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding, starformation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback. we carryout simulations excluding each major effect in turn. we find that reionizationis primarily responsible for expelling most of the gas in our simulations, butthat supernova feedback is required to disperse the dense, cold gas in the coreof the halo. moreover, we show that the timing of reionization can produce anorder of magnitude difference in the final stellar mass of the system. for ourfull physics run with reionization at z=9, we find a stellar mass of about 10^5msun at z=0, and a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius ofapproximately 130 msun/lsun, consistent with observed low-luminosity dwarfs.however, the resulting median stellar metallicity is 0.06 zsun, considerablylarger than observed systems. in addition, we find star formation is truncatedbetween redshifts 4 and 7, at odds with the observed late time star formationin isolated dwarf systems but in agreement with milky way ultrafaint dwarfspheroidals. we investigate the efficacy of energetic feedback in our simplethermal-energy driven feedback scheme, and suggest that it may still sufferfrom excessive radiative losses, despite reaching stellar particle masses ofabout 100 msun, and a comoving spatial resolution of 11 pc.

1307.6215	cosmic-ray driven outflows in global galaxy disk models	galactic-scale winds are a generic feature of massive galaxies with high starformation rates across a broad range of redshifts. despite their importance, adetailed physical understanding of what drives these mass-loaded global flowshas remained elusive. in this paper, we explore the dynamical impact of cosmicrays by performing the first three-dimensional, adaptive mesh refinementsimulations of an isolated starbursting galaxy that includes a basic model forthe production, dynamics and diffusion of galactic cosmic rays. we find thatincluding cosmic rays naturally leads to robust, massive, bipolar outflows fromour 10^12 msun halo, with a mass-loading factor mout/sfr = 0.3 for our fiducialrun. other reasonable parameter choices led to mass-loading factors aboveunity. the wind is multiphase and is accelerated to velocities well in excessof the escape velocity. we employ a two-fluid model for the thermal gas andrelativistic cr plasma and model a range of physics relevant to galaxyformation, including radiative cooling, shocks, self-gravity, star formation,supernovae feedback into both the thermal and cr gas, and isotropic crdiffusion. injecting cosmic rays into star-forming regions can providesignificant pressure support for the interstellar medium, suppressing starformation and thickening the disk. we find that cr diffusion plays a centralrole in driving superwinds, rapidly transferring long-lived crs from thehighest density regions of the disk to the ism at large, where their pressuregradient can smoothly accelerate the gas out of the disk.

1310.7580	modeling agn feedback in cool-core clusters: the formation of cold  clumps	we perform high-resolution (15-30 pc) adaptive mesh simulations to study theimpact of momentum-driven agn feedback in cool-core clusters, focusing in thispaper on the formation of cold clumps. the feedback is jet-driven with anenergy determined by the amount of cold gas within 500 pc of the smbh. when theintra-cluster medium (icm) in the core of the cluster becomes marginally stableto radiative cooling, with the thermal instability to the free-fall timescaleratio t_{ti}/t_{ff} &lt; 3-10, cold clumps of gas start to form along thepropagation direction of the agn jets. by tracing the particles in thesimulations, we find that these cold clumps originate from low entropy (butstill hot) gas that is accelerated by the jet to outward radial velocities of afew hundred km/s. this gas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and so can cool.the clumps then grow larger as they decelerate and fall towards the center ofthe cluster, eventually being accreted onto the super-massive black hole. thegeneral morphology, spatial distribution and estimated h{\alpha} morphology ofthe clumps are in reasonable agreement with observations, although we do notfully replicate the filamentary morphology of the clumps seen in theobservations, probably due to missing physics.

1401.5803	h_2 suppression with shocking inflows: testing a pathway for  supermassive black hole formation	the presence of quasars at redshifts z &gt; 6 indicates the existence ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) as massive as a few times 10^9 msun,challenging models for smbh formation. one pathway is through the directcollapse of gas in t_{vir} &gt; 10^4 k halos; however, this requires thesuppression of h_2 cooling to prevent fragmentation. in this paper, we examinea proposed new mechanism for this suppression which relies on cold-modeaccretion flows leading to shocks at high densities (n &gt; 10^4 cm^{-3}) andtemperatures (t &gt; 10^4 k). in such gas, h_2 is efficiently collisionallydissociated. we use high-resolution numerical simulations to test this idea,demonstrating that such halos typically have lower temperature progenitors, inwhich cooling is efficient. those halos do show filamentary flows; however, thegas shocks at or near the virial radius (at low densities), thus preventing theproposed collisional mechanism from operating. we do find that, if weartificially suppress h_2 formation with a high uv background, so as to allowgas in the halo center to enter the high-temperature, high-density "zone of noreturn", it will remain there even if the uv flux is turned off, collapsing tohigh density at high temperature. due to computational limitations, wesimulated only three halos. however, we demonstrate, using monte carlocalculations of 10^6 halo merger histories, that a few rare halos couldassemble rapidly enough to avoid efficient h_2 cooling in all of theirprogenitor halos, provided that the uv background exceeds j_{21} ~ few atredshifts as high as z ~ 20.

1401.7695	modeling agn feedback in cool-core clusters: the balance between heating  and cooling	we study the long-term evolution of an idealized cool-core galaxy clusterunder the influence of momentum-driven agn feedback using three-dimensionalhigh-resolution (60 pc) adaptive mesh refinement (amr) simulations. themomentum-driven agn feedback is modeled with a pair of (small-angle) precessingjets, and the jet power is calculated based on the accretion rate of the coldgas in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (smbh). the icm first coolsinto clumps along the propagation direction of the agn jets. as the jet powerincreases, gas condensation occurs isotropically, forming spatially extended(up to a few tens kpc) structures that resemble the observed $\rm h\alpha$filaments in perseus and many other cool-core cluster. jet heating elevates thegas entropy and cooling time, halting clump formation. the cold gas that is notaccreted onto the smbh settles into a rotating disk of $\sim 10^{11}$m$_{\odot}$. the hot gas cools directly onto the cold disk while the smbhaccretes from the innermost region of the disk, powering the agn that maintainsa thermally balanced steady state for a few gyr. the mass cooling rate averagedover 7 gyr is $\sim 30$ m$_{\odot}$/yr, an order of magnitude lower than theclassic cooling flow value (which we obtain in runs without the agn). mediumresolution simulations produce similar results, but when the resolution islower than 0.5 kpc, the cluster experiences cycles of gas condensation and agnoutbursts. owing to its self-regulating mechanism, agn feedback cansuccessfully balance cooling with a wide range of model parameters. besidessuppressing cooling, our model produces cold structures in early stages (up to$\sim 2$ gyr) that are in good agreement with the observations. however, thelong-lived massive cold disk is unrealistic, suggesting that additionalphysical processes are still needed.

1402.0882	high-redshift star formation in a time-dependent lyman-werner background	the first generation of stars produces a background of lyman-werner (lw)radiation which can photo-dissociate molecular hydrogen, increasing the mass ofdark matter halos required to host star formation. previous studies havedetermined the critical mass required for efficient molecular cooling with aconstant lw background. however, the true background is expected to increaserapidly at early times. neglecting this evolution could underestimate starformation in small halos that may have started to cool in the past when the lwintensity was much lower. background evolution is a large source of uncertaintyin pre-reionization predictions of the cosmological 21cm signal, which can beobserved with future radio telescopes. to address this, we performzero-dimentional one-zone calculations that follow the density, chemicalabundances, and temperature of gas in the central regions of dark matter halos,including hierarchical growth and an evolving lw background. we begin bystudying the physics of halos subjected to a background that increasesexponentially with redshift. we find that when the intensity increases moreslowly than $j_{\rm lw}(z) \propto 10^{-z/5}$, cooling in the past is arelatively small effect. we then self-consistently compute the cosmological lwbackground over $z=15-50$ and find that cooling in the past due to an evolvingbackground has a modest impact. finally, we compare these results tothree-dimensional hydrodynamical cosmological simulations with varying lwhistories. while only a small number of halos were simulated, the results areconsistent with our one-zone calculations.

1403.1293	a no-go theorem for direct collapse black holes without a strong  ultraviolet background	explaining the existence of supermassive black holes (smbhs) larger than$\sim 10^9 m_\odot$ at redshifts $z &gt;\sim 6$ remains an open theoreticalquestion. one possibility is that gas collapsing rapidly in pristine atomiccooling halos ($t_{\rm vir} &gt;\sim 10^4 \rm{k}$) produces $10^4-10^6 m_\odot$black holes. previous studies have shown that the formation of such a blackhole requires a strong uv background to prevent molecular hydrogen cooling andgas fragmentation. recently it has been proposed that a high uv background maynot be required for halos that accrete material extremely rapidly or for haloswhere gas cooling is delayed due to a high baryon-dark matter streamingvelocity. in this work, we point out that building up a halo with $t_{\rm vir}&gt;\sim 10^4 \rm{k}$ before molecular cooling becomes efficient is not sufficientfor forming a direct collapse black hole (dcbh). though molecular hydrogenformation may be delayed, it will eventually form at high densities leading toefficient cooling and fragmentation. the only obvious way that molecularcooling could be avoided in the absence of strong uv radiation, is for gas toreach high enough density to cause collisional dissociation of molecularhydrogen ($\sim 10^4 ~ {\rm cm}^{-3}$) before cooling occurs. however, we arguethat the minimum core entropy, set by the entropy of the intergalactic medium(igm) when it decouples from the cmb, prevents this from occurring forrealistic halo masses. this is confirmed by hydrodynamical cosmologicalsimulations without radiative cooling. we explain the maximum density versushalo mass in these simulations with simple entropy arguments. the low densitiesfound suggest that dcbh formation indeed requires a strong uv background.

0802.3918	the impact of hd cooling on the formation of the first stars	we use numerical simulations to investigate the importance of hd formationand cooling on the first generation of metal-free stars in a lcdm cosmology. wehave implemented and tested non-equilibrium hd chemistry in an adaptive meshrefinement simulation code and applied it to two situations. (1) it is firstapplied to the formation of 10^5 - 10^6 msun halos which form in the absence ofany ionizing source. we show, in agreement with previous work, that hd coolingis of only marginal importance for most halos; however, we find that for thelowest mass halos, hd cooling can equal or surpass the h2 cooling rate. thisleads to a population of stars formed in halos with effective hd cooling thatare less massive by a factor of ~6 compared to halos dominated by h2 cooling.(2) in the second part of the paper, we ionize the halos in order to explorethe impact of hd cooling in the presence of an ample population of freeelectrons. this leads to cooler temperatures (due to the electron- catalyzedproduction of h2) and somewhat lower resulting proto-stellar mass. adding hdchemistry lowers the temperature further, to the level of the cmb. we find thathd cooling dominates over h2 cooling in the density range 10^2 cm^-3 to 10^6cm^-3, but above this density, the temperature rises and h2 cooling dominatesagain. because of this, the accretion rate on to the protostar is almost thesame as in the h2 case (at least for accreted masses below 50-100 msun),therefore we argue that hd cooling in ionized halos will probably not result ina population of significantly lower mass stars.

0802.3944	simulating the ism in global disk galaxies	until recently, simulations that modeled entire galaxies were restricted toan isothermal or fixed 2- or 3-phase interstellar medium (ism). this obscuredthe full role of the ism in shaping the observed galactic-scale star formationrelations. in particular the kennicutt relation suggests that star formationrates depend in a simple way on global galactic quantities, such as mean gasmass surface density and dynamical time. contrary to this, observations ofnearby star-forming regions, including images from the spitzer telescope, showthat all the way down to ``local-scales'' ($\sim$ parsecs) star formation is ahighly clustered process with the gas existing at a wide range of densities andmultiple phases, and seemingly decoupled from the larger-scale galaxy. manydifferent physical processes appear to be influencing the star formation rate,including heating and cooling of the gas, ``turbulent'' energy injection fromoutflows, winds and supernova blastwaves, ionization, and magnetic fieldsupport. here we present results from global simulations of disk galaxy starformation that include a fully multiphase ism and compare to simpler isothermalmodels. we also investigate the effect of background heating. we discuss theprocess of giant molecular cloud formation as one of the possible links betweenthe galactic and local scales of star formation.

1406.7020	direct collapse black hole formation from synchronized pairs of atomic  cooling halos	high-redshift quasar observations imply that supermassive black holes (smbhs)larger than $\sim 10^9 ~ m_\odot$ formed before $z=6$. that such large smbhsformed so early in the universe remains an open theoretical problem. onepossibility is that gas in atomic cooling halos exposed to strong lyman-werner(lw) radiation forms $10^4-10^6 ~ m_\odot$ supermassive stars which quicklycollapse into black holes. we propose a scenario for direct collapse black hole(dcbh) formation based on synchronized pairs of pristine atomic cooling halos.we consider halos at very small separation with one halo being a subhalo of theother. the first halo to surpass the atomic cooling threshold forms stars. soonafter these stars are formed, the other halo reaches the cooling threshold anddue to its small distance from the newly formed galaxy, is exposed to thecritical lw intensity required to form a dcbh. the main advantage of thisscenario is that synchronization can potentially prevent photoevaporation andmetal pollution in dcbh-forming halos. since the halos reach the atomic coolingthreshold at nearly the same time, the dcbh-forming halo is only exposed toionizing radiation for a brief period. tight synchronization could allow thedcbh to form before stars in the nearby galaxy reach the end of their lives andgenerate supernovae winds. we use n-body simulations to estimate the abundanceof dcbhs formed in this way. the largest source of uncertainty in our estimateis the initial mass function (imf) of metal free stars formed in atomic coolinghalos. we find that even for tight synchronization, the density of dcbhs formedin this scenario could explain the smbhs implied by $z=6$ quasar observations.metal pollution and photoevaporation could potentially reduce the abundance ofdcbhs below that required to explain the observations in other models that relyon a high lw flux.

1410.3822	kinetic energy from supernova feedback in high-resolution galaxy  simulations	we describe a new method for adding a prescribed amount of kinetic energy tosimulated gas modeled on a cartesian grid by directly altering grid cells' massand velocity in a distributed fashion. the method is explored in the context ofsupernova feedback in high-resolution ($\sim 10$ pc) hydrodynamic simulationsof galaxy formation. resolution-dependence is a primary consideration in ourapplication of the method and simulations of isolated explosions (performed atdifferent resolutions) motivate a resolution-dependent scaling for the injectedfraction of kinetic energy that we apply in cosmological simulations of a$10^9$ msun dwarf halo. we find that in high density media ($\gtrsim$ 50cm$^{-3}$) with coarse resolution ($\gtrsim 4$ pc per cell), results aresensitive to the initial kinetic energy fraction due to early and rapidcooling. in our galaxy simulations, the deposition of small amounts ofsupernova energy in kinetic form (as little as 1%) has a dramatic impact on theevolution of the system, resulting in an order of magnitude suppression ofstellar mass. the overall behavior of the galaxy in the two highest resolutionsimulations we perform appears to converge. we discuss the resultingdistribution of stellar metallicities, an observable sensitive to galactic windproperties, and find that while the new method demonstrates increased agreementwith observed systems, significant discrepancies remain, likely due tosimplistic assumptions that neglect contributions from type ia supernovae andstellar winds.

1501.03177	looking for population iii stars with he ii line intensity mapping	constraining the properties of population iii (pop iii) stars will be verychallenging because they reside in small galaxies at high redshift which willbe difficult to directly detect. in this paper, we suggest that intensitymapping may be a promising method to study pop iii stars. intensity mapping isa technique proposed to measure large-scale fluctuations of galaxy lineemission in three dimensions without resolving individual sources. thistechnique is well suited for observing many faint galaxies because it canmeasure their cumulative emission even if they cannot be directly detected. wefocus on intensity mapping of he ii recombination lines. these lines are muchstronger in pop iii stars than pop ii stars because the harder spectra of popiii stars are expected to produce many he ii ionizing photons. measuring the heii 1640 \aa{} intensity mapping signal, along with the signals from other linessuch as ly$\alpha$, h$\alpha$, and metal lines, could give constraints on theinitial mass function (imf) and star formation rate density (sfrd) of pop iiistars as a function of redshift. to demonstrate the feasibility of theseobservations, we estimate the strength of the pop iii he ii 1640 \aa{}intensity mapping signal from $z=10-20$. we show that at $z\approx10$, thesignal could be measured accurately by two different hypothetical futureinstruments, one which cross-correlates he ii 1640 \aa{} with co(1-0) lineemission from galaxies and the other with 21 cm emission from the intergalacticmedium (igm).

1503.02660	cooling, agn feedback and star formation in simulated cool-core galaxy  clusters	numerical simulations of active galactic nuclei (agn) feedback in cool-coregalaxy clusters have successfully avoided classical cooling flows, but oftenproduce too much cold gas. we perform adaptive mesh simulations that includemomentum-driven agn feedback, self-gravity, star formation and stellarfeedback, focusing on the interplay between cooling, agn heating and starformation in an isolated cool-core cluster. cold clumps triggered by agn jetsand turbulence form filamentary structures tens of kpc long. this cold gasfeeds both star formation and the supermassive black hole (smbh), triggering anagn outburst that increases the entropy of the icm and reduces its coolingrate. within 1-2 gyr, star formation completely consumes the cold gas, leadingto a brief shutoff of the agn. the icm quickly cools and redevelops multiphasegas, followed by another cycle of star formation/agn outburst. within 6.5 gyr,we observe three such cycles. there is good agreement between our simulatedcluster and the observations of cool-core clusters. icm cooling is dynamicallybalanced by agn heating, and a cool-core appearance is preserved. the minimumcooling time to free-fall time ratio typically varies between a few and$\gtrsim 20$. the star formation rate (sfr) covers a wide range, from 0 to afew hundred $\rm m_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$, with an average of $\sim 40 \,\rmm_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$. the instantaneous smbh accretion rate shows largevariations on short timescales, but the average value correlates well with thesfr. simulations without stellar feedback or self-gravity produce qualitativelysimilar results, but a lower smbh feedback efficiency (0.1% compared to 1%)results in too many stars.

1505.06359	limits on population iii star formation in minihaloes implied by planck	recently, planck measured a value of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)optical depth due to electron scattering of $\tau=0.066 \pm 0.016$. here weshow that this low value leaves essentially no room for an early partialreionisation of the intergalactic medium (igm) by high-redshift population iii(pop iii) stars, expected to have formed in low-mass minihaloes. we performsemi-analytic calculations of reionisation which include the contribution frompop ii stars in atomic cooling haloes, calibrated with high-redshift galaxyobservations, and pop iii stars in minihaloes with feedback due to lyman-werner(lw) radiation and metal enrichment. we find that without lw feedback or promptmetal enrichment (and assuming a minihalo escape fraction of 0.5) the pop iiistar formation efficiency cannot exceed $\sim{\rm a~few}\times 10^{-4}$,without violating the constraints set by planck data. this excludes massive popiii star formation in typical $10^6 m_\odot$ minihaloes. including lw feedbackand metal enrichment alleviates this tension, allowing large pop iii stars toform early on before they are quenched by feedback. we find that the totaldensity of pop iii stars formed across cosmic time is $\lesssim10^{4-5}~m_\odot~{\rm mpc^{-3}}$ and does not depend strongly on the feedbackprescription adopted. additionally, we perform a simple estimate of thepossible impact on reionisation of x-rays produced by accretion onto black holeremnants of pop iii stars. we find that unless the accretion duty cycle is verylow ($\lesssim 0.01$), this could lead to an optical depth inconsistent withplanck.

1506.07180	supernova feedback and the hot gas filling fraction of the interstellar  medium	supernovae (sn), the most energetic stellar feedback mechanism, are crucialfor regulating the interstellar medium (ism) and launching galactic winds. weexplore how supernova remnants (snrs) create a multiphase medium by performing3d hydrodynamical simulations at various sn rates, $s$, and ism averagedensities, $\bar{n}$. the evolution of a snr in a self-consistently generatedthree-phase ism is qualitatively different from that in a uniform or atwo-phase warm/cold medium. by travelling faster and further in the low-densityhot phase, the domain of a snr increases by $&gt;10^{2.5}$. varying $\bar{n}$ and$s$, we find that a steady state can only be achieved when the hot gas volumefraction $f_{\rm{v,hot}}\lesssim 0.6 \pm 0.1 $. above that level, overlappingsnrs render connecting topology of the hot gas, and the ism is subjected tothermal runaway. photoelectric heating (peh) has a surprisingly strong impacton $f_{\rm{v,hot}}$. for $\bar{n}\gtrsim 3 \cm-3 $, a reasonable peh rate isable to suppress the thermal runaway. overall, we determine the critical snrate for the onset of thermal runaway to be $s_{\rm{crit}} = 200(\bar{n}/1\cm-3)^k (e_{\rm{sn}}/10^{51}\erg)^{-1} \kpc^{-3} \myr-1$, where $k =(1.2,2.7)$ for $\bar{n} \leq 1$ and $&gt; 1\cm-3 $, respectively. we present afitting formula of the ism pressure $p(\bar{n}$, $s$), which can be used as aneffective equation of state in cosmological simulations. despite the 5 ordersof magnitude span of $(\bar{n},s)$, the average mach number varies little:$\mathcal{m} \approx \ 0.5\pm 0.2, \ 1.2\pm 0.3,\ 2.3\pm 0.9$ for the hot, warmand cold phases, respectively.

1511.05144	role of cosmic rays in the circumgalactic medium	we explore the impact of cosmic rays (crs) on cosmological adaptive-meshrefinement simulations of a forming 10^12 msolar halo, focusing on thecircumgalactic medium (cgm), and its resulting low-redshift structure andcomposition. in contrast to a run with star formation and energetic feedbackbut no crs, the cr-inclusive runs feature a cgm substantially enriched with crsand with metals to roughly 0.1 zsolar, thanks to robust, persistent outflowsfrom the disk. the cr-inclusive cgms also feature more diffuse gas at lowertemperatures, down to 10^4 k, than the non-cr run, with diffuse material oftenreceiving a majority of its pressure support from the cr proton fluid. wecompare to recent observations of the cgm of l ~ l* galaxies at low redshift,including uv absorption lines within background quasar spectra. the combinationof metal-enriched, cr-driven winds and large swaths of cr pressure-supported,cooler diffuse gas leads to a cgm that provides a better match to data fromcos-halos (for hi, siiv, ciii and ovi) than the non-cr run. we also compare ourmodels to recent, preliminary observations of diffuse gamma-ray emission inlocal group halos. for our lower cr-diffusion runs with kappa_cr in the range0.3 to 1 x 10^28 cm^2/s, the cr enriched cgm produces an inconsistently highlevel of gamma emission. but the model with a relatively high kappa_cr = 3 x10^28 cm^2/s provided a gamma-ray luminosity consistent with the extra-galacticgamma-ray background observed by fermi and roughly consistent with preliminarymeasures of the emission from m31's cgm.

0705.3465	cosmological simulations of the preheating scenario for galaxy cluster  formation: comparison to analytic models and observations	we perform a set of non--radiative cosmological simulations of a preheatedintracluster medium in which the entropy of the gas was uniformly boosted athigh redshift. the results of these simulations are used first to test thecurrent analytic techniques of preheating via entropy input in the smoothaccretion limit. when the unmodified profile is taken directly fromsimulations, we find that this model is in excellent agreement with the resultsof our simulations. this suggests that preheated efficiently smoothes theaccreted gas, and therefore a shift in the unmodified profile is a goodapproximation even with a realistic accretion history. when we examine thesimulation results in detail, we do not find strong evidence for entropyamplification, at least for the high-redshift preheating model adopted here. inthe second section of the paper, we compare the results of the preheatingsimulations to recent observations. we show -- in agreement with previous work-- that for a reasonable amount of preheating, a satisfactory match can befound to the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. however --as noted by previous authors -- we find that the entropy profiles of thesimulated groups are much too flat compared to observations. in particular,while rich clusters converge on the adiabatic self--similar scaling at largeradius, no single value of the entropy input during preheating cansimultaneously reproduce both the core and outer entropy levels. as a result,we confirm that the simple preheating scenario for galaxy cluster formation, inwhich entropy is injected universally at high redshift, is inconsistent withobservations.

astro-ph;0002135	the formation and fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds	many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of theintergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to beintimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. inparticular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial imfare of special interest. we present results from high resolutionthree--dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow thecollapse of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentationwithin a cosmologically representative volume. comoving scales from 128 kpcdown to 1 pc are followed accurately. dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics andall relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followedself-consistently for a cluster normalized cdm structure formation model.primordial molecular clouds with ~10^5 solar masses are assembled by mergers ofmultiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with afractional abundance of ~10^-4. as the subclumps merge cooling lowers thetemperature to ~200 kelvin in a `cold pocket' at the center of the halo. withinthis cold pocket, a quasi-hydrostatically contracting core with ~200 solar massand number densities &gt; 10^5 cm^-3 is found. we find that less than 1% of theprimordial gas in such small scale structures cools and collapses tosufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star formation.furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that this study achieved the highestdynamic range covered by structured adaptive mesh techniques in cosmologicalhydrodynamics to date.

astro-ph;0010656	metal enrichment and temperature of the intergalactic medium	hydrodynamic simulations of lyman alpha clouds based on ab inito cosmologicalmodels have produced results that are in broad agreement with observations.however, further analyses have revealed that, with progressively highernumerical resolution, the median or cutoff line width of the simulated lymanalpha clouds (i.e. the doppler parameter) appears to converge to a valuesignificantly below what is observed at z~3 (by about a factor of 1.5). theseconvergence test simulations do not include feedback from star formation. giventhe observed metallicity in the lyman alpha clouds we suggest that supernovae,which presumably polluted the igm with metals, may have deposited a sufficientamount of energy in the igm to reconcile the theory with observations. simplearguments immediately narrow the redshift range of pollution down to4&lt;z_{dep}&lt;9. it seems quite certain that dwarf and sub-dwarf galaxies withtotal masses in the range 10^{6.5-9.0}msun have to be largely responsible forthe pollution. furthermore, it is implied that either star formation is veryefficient or metal yield is very high for these early dwarf galaxies, if themean metallicity in the universe at z=3 is as high as &lt;z&gt;=0.01zsun. finally,assuming the specific supernova heating energy is proportional to themetallicity of a gas, we note that the picture proposed here would beconsistent with supernovae being the apparently needed heating source for theintra-cluster gas, if the required heating of the intra-cluster gas is nogreater than 1 kev per particle.

astro-ph;0101466	on the distribution of x-ray surface brightness from diffuse gas	hot intergalactic gas in clusters, groups, and filaments emanates acontinuous background of 0.5-2.0 kev x-rays that ought to be detectable withthe new generation of x-ray observatories. here we present selected resultsfrom a program to simulate the surface-brightness distribution of thisbackground with an adaptive-mesh cosmological hydrodynamics code. we show thatthe bright end of this distribution is well approximated by combining thecluster temperature function with a beta-model for surface brightness andappropriate luminosity-temperature and core radius-luminosity relations. oursimulations verify that the x-ray background from hot gas vastly exceedsobservational limits if non-gravitational processes do not modify theintergalactic entropy distribution. an entropy floor of ~100 kev cm^2, whichcould be established by either heating or cooling, appears necessary toreconcile the simulated background with observations. because the x-raybackground distribution is so sensitive to the effects of non-gravitationalprocesses, it offers a way to constrain the thermal history of theintergalactic medium that is independent of the uncertainties associated withsurveys of clusters and groups.

astro-ph;0101467	the x-ray surface brightness distribution from diffuse gas	we use simulations to predict the x-ray surface brightness distributionarising from hot, cosmologically distributed diffuse gas. the distribution iscomputed for two bands: 0.5-2 kev and 0.1-0.4 kev, using acosmological-constant dominated cosmology that fits many other observations. weexamine a number of numerical issues such as resolution, simulation volume andpixel size and show that the predicted mean background is sensitive toresolution such that higher resolution systematically increases the meanpredicted background. although this means that we can compute only lower boundsto the predicted level, these bounds are already quite restrictive. since theobserved extra-galactic x-ray background is mostly accounted for by compactsources, the amount of the observed background attributable to diffuse gas istightly constrained. we show that without physical processes in addition tothose included in the simulations (such as radiative cooling ornon-gravitational heating), both bands exceed observational limits. in order toexamine the effect of non-gravitational heating we explore a simple modeling ofenergy injection and show that substantial amounts of heating are required(i.e. 5 kev per particle when averaged over all baryons). finally, we alsocompute the distribution of surface brightness on the sky and show that it hasa well-resolved characteristic shape. this shape is substantially modified bynon-gravitational heating and can be used as a probe of such energy injection.

0808.1844	a test suite for quantitative comparison of hydrodynamics codes in  astrophysics	we test four commonly used astrophysical simulation codes; enzo, flash,gadget and hydra, using a suite of numerical problems with analytic initial andfinal states. situations similar to the conditions of these tests, a sod shock,a sedov blast and both a static and translating king sphere occur commonly inastrophysics, where the accurate treatment of shocks, sound waves, supernovaeexplosions and collapsed haloes is a key condition for obtaining reliablevalidated simulations. we demonstrate that comparable results can be obtainedfor lagrangian and eulerian codes by requiring that approximately one particleexists per grid cell in the region of interest. we conclude that adaptiveeulerian codes, with their ability to place refinements in regions of rapidlychanging density, are well suited to problems where physical processes arerelated to such changes. lagrangian methods, on the other hand, are well suitedto problems where large density contrasts occur and the physics is related tothe local density itself rather than the local density gradient.

astro-ph;0111434	regulation of the x-ray luminosity of clusters of galaxies by cooling  and supernova feedback	clusters of galaxies are thought to contain about ten times as much darkmatter as baryonic matter. the dark component therefore dominates thegravitational potential of the cluster, and the baryons confined by thispotential radiate x-rays with a luminosity that depends mainly on the gasdensity in the cluster's core. predictions of the x-rays' properties based onmodels of cluster formation do not, however, agree with the observations. ifthe models ignore the condensation of cooling gas into stars and feedback fromthe associated supernovae, they overestimate the x-ray luminosity because thedensity of the core gas is too high. an early episode of uniformly distributedsupernova feedback could rectify this by heating the uncondensed gas andtherefore making it harder to compress into the core, but such a process seemsto require an implausibly large number of supernovae. here we show howradiative cooling of intergalactic gas and subsequent supernova heatingconspire to eliminate highly compressible low-entropy gas from the intraclustermedium. this brings the core entropy and x-ray luminosities of clusters intoagreement with the observations, in a way that depends little on the efficiencyof supernova heating in the early universe.

astro-ph;0112088	the formation of the first star in the universe	we describe results from a fully self-consistent three dimensionalhydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in theuniverse. dark matter dominated pre-galactic objects form because ofgravitational instability from small initidal density perturbations. as theyassemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrationallines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matterpotential well. the high redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. whenthe dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a densecore of approximately 100 solar mass undergoes rapid contraction. at densitiesn&gt;10^9 cm^-3 a one solar mass proto-stellar core becomes fully molecular due tothree-body h_2 formation. contrary to analytical expectations this process doesnot lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. the calculationis stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final massof the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. at this stage the protostar isacreting material very rapidly (~0.01 solar masses per year). radiativefeedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit theformation of other stars in the same pre-galactic object (at least until thefirst star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). we conclude that at mostone massive (m &gt;&gt; 1 solar mass) metal free star forms per pre-galactic halo,consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal poor galactic halostars.

astro-ph;0205240	modified-entropy models for the intracluster medium	we present a set of cluster models that link the present-day properties ofclusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation. these models treat theentropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamentalproperty. because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient thatrises with radius, the observable properties of a relaxed cluster dependentirely on its dark-matter potential and the entropy distribution of itsuncondensed gas. guided by simulations, we compute the intracluster entropydistribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernovaheating by assuming that the gas-density distribution would be identical tothat of the dark matter. the lowest-entropy gas would then fall below acritical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a hubble time.radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify theentropy of that low-entropy gas, changing the overall entropy distributionfunction and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster. usingsome phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on theexistence of this cooling threshold, we construct a remarkably realistic set ofcluster models. the surface-brightness profiles, mass-temperature relation, andluminosity-temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge fromthese models. by introducing a single adjustable parameter related to theamount of intracluster gas that can cool within a hubble time, we can alsoreproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations ofcooling-flow clusters from the standard luminosity-temperature relation.

astro-ph;0209326	effects of a soft x-ray background on structure formation at high  redshift	we use three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the effectsof a soft x-ray background, that could have been produced by an earlygeneration of mini-quasars, on the subsequent cooling and collapse of highredshift pregalactic clouds. the simulations use an eulerian adaptive meshrefinement technique with initial conditions drawn from a flat lambda-dominatedcold dark matter model cosmology to follow the nonequilibrium chemistry of ninechemical species in the presence of both a soft ultraviolet lyman-werner h_2photodissociating flux and a soft x-ray background extending to 7.2 kev.although we vary the normalization of the x-ray background by two orders ofmagnitude, the positive feedback effect of the x-rays on cooling and collapseof the pregalactic cloud expected due to the increased electron fraction isquite mild, only weakly affecting the mass threshold for collapse and thefraction of gas within the cloud that is able to cool. inside most of the cloudwe find that h_2 is in photodissociation equilibrium with the soft uv flux. thenet buildup of the electron density needed to enhance h_2 formation occurs tooslowly compared to the h_2 photodissociation and dynamical timescales withinthe cloud to overcome the negative impact of the soft uv photodissociating fluxon cloud collapse. however, we find that even in the most extreme cases thefirst objects to form do rely on molecular hydrogen as coolant and stress thatour results do not justify the neglect of these objects in models of galaxyformation.

astro-ph;0603541	was star-formation suppressed in high-redshift minihalos?	the primordial gas in the earliest dark matter halos, collapsing at redshiftsaround z=20, with masses m_halo=10^6 m_sun, and virial temperaturest_vir&lt;10^4k, relied on the presence of molecules for cooling. severaltheoretical studies have suggested that gas contraction and star-formation inthese minihalos was suppressed by radiative, chemical, thermal, and dynamicalfeedback processes. the recent measurement by the wilkinson microwaveanisotropy probe (wmap) of the optical depth to electron scattering,tau=0.09+/-0.03, provides the first empirical evidence for this suppression.the new wmap result is consistent with vanilla models of reionization, in whichionizing sources populate cold dark matter (cdm) halos down to a virialtemperature of t_vir=10^4k. on the other hand, we show that in order to avoidoverproducing the optical depth, the efficiency for the production of ionizingphotons in minihalos must have been about an order of magnitude lower thanexpected and lower than the efficiency in large halos that can cool via atomichydrogen (t_vir &gt; 10^4k). this conclusion is insensitive to assumptions aboutthe efficiency of ionizing photon production in the large halos, as long asreionization ends by z=6, as required by the spectra of bright quasars at z&lt;6.our conclusion is strengthened if the clumping of the ionized gas evolves withredshift, as suggested by semi-analytical predictions and three-dimensionalnumerical simulations.

astro-ph;0605204	breaking cosmological degeneracies in galaxy cluster surveys with a  physical model of cluster structure	forthcoming large galaxy cluster surveys will yield tight constraints oncosmological models. it has been shown that in an idealized survey, containing&gt; 10,000 clusters, statistical errors on dark energy and other cosmologicalparameters will be at the percent level. it has also been shown that through"self-calibration", parameters describing the mass-observable relation andcosmology can be simultaneously determined, though at a loss in accuracy byabout an order of magnitude. here we examine the utility of an alternativeapproach of self-calibration, in which a parametrized ab-initio physical modelis used to compute cluster structure and the resulting mass-observablerelations. as an example, we use a modified-entropy ("pre-heating") model ofthe intracluster medium, with the history and magnitude of entropy injection asunknown input parameters. using a fisher matrix approach, we evaluate theexpected simultaneous statistical errors on cosmological and cluster modelparameters. we study two types of surveys, in which a comparable number ofclusters are identified either through their x-ray emission or through theirintegrated sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. we find that compared to aphenomenological parametrization of the mass-observable relation, using ourphysical model yields significantly tighter constraints in both surveys, andoffers substantially improved synergy when the two surveys are combined. theseresults suggest that parametrized physical models of cluster structure will beuseful when extracting cosmological constraints from sz and x-ray clustersurveys.

astro-ph;0606019	the hii region of a primordial star	the concordance model of cosmology and structure formation predicts theformation of isolated very massive stars at high redshifts in dark matterdominated halos of 10^5 to 10^6 msun. these stars photo-ionize their hostprimordial molecular clouds, expelling all the baryons from their halos. whenthe stars die, a relic hii region is formed within which large amounts ofmolecular hydrogen form which will allow the gas to cool efficiently whengravity assembles it into larger dark matter halos. the filaments surroundingthe first star hosting halo are largely shielded and provide the pathway forgas to stream into the halo when the star has died. we present the first fullythree dimensional cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations that followall these effects. a novel adaptive ray casting technique incorporates the timedependent radiative transfer around point sources. this approach is fast enoughso that radiation transport, kinetic rate equations, and hydrodynamics aresolved self-consistently. it retains the time derivative of the transferequation and is explicitly photon conserving. this method is integrated withthe cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, and runs on distributedand shared memory parallel architectures. where applicable the threedimensional calculation not only confirm expectations from earlier onedimensional results but also illustrate the multi-fold hydrodynamiccomplexities of hii regions. in the absence of stellar winds the circumstellarenvironments of the first supernovae and putative early gamma-ray bursts willbe of low density ~1 cm^-3. albeit marginally resolved, ionization frontinstabilities lead to cometary and elephant trunk like small scale structuresreminiscent of nearby star forming regions.

astro-ph;9404014	a comparison of cosmological hydrodynamic codes	we present a detailed comparison of the simulation results of variouscosmological hydrodynamic codes. starting with identical initial conditionsbased on the cold dark matter scenario for the growth of structure, weintegrate from redshift $z=20$ to $z=0$ to determine the physical state withina representative volume of size $l^3$ where $l=64 h^{-1} {\rm mpc}$. fiveindependent codes are compared: three of them eulerian mesh based and twovariants of the smooth particle hydrodynamics "sph" lagrangian approach. theeulerian codes were run at $n^3=(32^3,~64^3,~128^3,~{\rm and},~256^3)$ cells,the sph codes at $n^3= 32^3$ and $64^3$ particles. results were then rebinnedto a $16^3$ grid with the expectation that the rebinned data should converge,by all techniques, to a common and correct result as $n \rightarrow \infty$. wefind that global averages of various physical quantities do, as expected, tendto converge in the rebinned model, but that uncertainties in even primitivequantities such as $\langle t \rangle$, $\langle \rho^2\rangle^{1/2}$ persistsat the 3\%-17\% level after completion of very large simulations. the two sphcodes and the two shock capturing eulerian codes achieve comparable andsatisfactory accuracy for comparable computer time in their treatment of thehigh density, high temperature regions as measured in the rebinned data; thevariance among the five codes (at highest resolution) for the mean temperature(as weighted by $\rho^2$) is only 4.5\%. overall the comparison allows us tobetter estimate errors, it points to ways of improving this current generationof hydrodynamic codes and of suiting their use to problems which exploit theirindividually best features.

astro-ph;9409091	the evolution of x-ray clusters in a cold plus hot dark matter universe	we present the first self-consistently computed results on the evolution ofx-ray properties of galaxy clusters in a cold + hot dark matter (chdm) model.we have performed a hydrodynamic plus n-body simulation for the cobe-compatiblechdm model with standard mass components: omega(hot) = 0.3, omega(cold) = 0.6and omega(baryon) = 0.1 (h = 0.5). in contrast with the cdm model, which failsto reproduce the observed temperature distribution function dn/dt (bryan et al.1994b), the chdm model fits the observational dn/dt quite well. our results onx-ray luminosity are less firm but even more intriguing. we find that theresulting x-ray luminosity functions at redshifts z = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7 arewell fit by observations, where they overlap. the fact that both temperaturesand luminosities provide a reasonable fit to the available observational dataindicates that, unless we are missing some essential physics, there is neitherroom nor need for a large fraction of gas in rich clusters: 10% (or less) inbaryons is sufficient to explain their x-ray properties. we also see a tightcorrelation between x-ray luminosity and gas temperature.

astro-ph;9501017	a parallel self--consistent field code	we describe a version of an algorithm for evolving self-gravitatingcollections of particles that should be nearly ideal for parallelarchitectures. our method is derived from the ``self-consistent field'' (scf)approach suggested previously by clutton-brock and others. owing to the use ofa global description of the gravitational field, the particles in an scfsimulation do not interact with one another directly, minimizing communicationsoverhead between nodes in a parallel implementation. ideal load-balancing isachieved since precisely the same number of operations are needed to computethe acceleration for each particle. consequently, the scf technique isperfectly scalable and the size of feasible applications will grow in simpleproportion to advances in computational hardware. we describe an scf codedeveloped for and tested on a connection machine 5. empirical tests demonstratethe efficient and scalable nature of the algorithm. depending on theapplication, simulations with particle numbers in the range $n\sim 10^7 -10^{8.5}$ are now possible. larger platforms should make simulations withbillions of particles feasible in the near future. specific astrophysicalapplications are discussed in the context of collisionless dynamics.

astro-ph;9802335	cluster turbulence	we report on results of recent, high resolution hydrodynamic simulations ofthe formation and evolution of x-ray clusters of galaxies carried out within acosmological framework. we employ the highly accurate piecewise parabolicmethod (ppm) on fixed and adaptive meshes which allow us to resolve the flowfield in the intracluster gas. the excellent shock capturing and low numericalviscosity of ppm represent a substantial advance over previous studies usingsph. we find that in flat, hierarchical cosmological models, the icm is in aturbulent state long after turbulence generated by the last major merger shouldhave decayed away. turbulent velocites are found to vary slowly with clusterradius, being $\sim 25%$ of $\sigma_{vir}$ in the core, increasing to $\sim60%$ at the virial radius. we argue that more frequent minor mergers maintainthe high level of turbulence found in the core where dynamical times are short.turbulent pressure support is thus significant throughout the cluster, andresults in a somewhat cooler cluster ($t/t_{vir} \sim .8$) for its mass. someimplications of cluster turbulence are discussed.

astro-ph;9805340	resolving the lyman-alpha forest	in this paper we critically examine predictions of the lya forest within thestandard cold dark matter (scdm) model, paying particular attention to the lowend of the column-density distribution. we show in particular that the width ofthese lines, typically measured by the b-parameter of a voigt profile, issensitive to spatial resolution in numerical simulations and has previouslybeen overestimated. the new result, which predicts a distribution with a medianb of around 20-22 km/s at z=3, is substantially below that observed. we examinea number of possible causes of this discrepancy and argue that it is unlikelyto be rectified by an increase in the thermal broadening of the absorbing gas,but is instead telling us something about the distribution of matter on thesescales. although the median differs, the shape of the b-parameter distributionagrees quite well with that observed, and the high-end tail is naturallyproduced by the filamentary nature of gravitational collapse in these models.in particular, we demonstrate that lines of sight which obliquely intersect afilament or sheet tend to produce absorption lines with larger b parameters. wealso examine the physical nature of the gas which is responsible for theforest, showing that for lines with neutral column densities below n_hi ~ 10^14cm^-2 (for this model at z=3), the peculiar infall velocity is actually slowerthan the hubble flow, while larger lines have, on average, turned around andare collapsing.

astro-ph;9810215	the formation and fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds	many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of theintergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to beintimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. inparticular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial imfare of special interest. we present results from high resolutionthree-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the collapseof primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation within acosmologically representative volume. comoving scales from 128 kpc down to 0.5pc are followed accurately. dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and allrelevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followedself-consistently for a cluster normalized cdm structure formation model.primordial molecular clouds with ~100,000 solar masses are assembled by mergersof multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with afractional abundance of &lt;~ 10^-4. as the subclumps merge cooling decreases thetemperature to ~200 kelvin in multiple "cold pockets" of the merger product.within these cold pockets, quasi-hydrostatically contracting cores with masses\~ 100 m_sun and number densities &gt; 100,000/cm^3 are found. we find that lessthan 1% of the primordial gas in such small scale structures cools andcollapses to sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial starformation. furthermore, our results indicate that the formation of very massiveobjects, massive black holes, fragmentation of a large fraction of baryons intobrown dwars or jupiter size fragments seems, in contrast to various claims inthe literature, very unlikely. the expected escape fraction of uv photons with(h nu) &gt; 11ev is very small.

astro-ph;9906459	the b distribution of the lya forest: probing cosmology and the  intergalactic medium	we investigate a method to determine the temperature-density relation of theintergalactic medium (igm) at z~2-4 using quasar absorption line systems. usinga simple model combined with numerical simulations we show that there is alower cutoff in the distribution of column density (nhi) and line width (bparameter). the location of this cutoff can be used to determine thetemperature-density relation (under certain conditions). we describe and testan algorithm to do this. the method works as long as the amplitude offluctuations on these scales (~100 kpc) is sufficiently large. models with lesspower can mimic higher temperatures. a preliminary application is made to datafrom two quasar lines-of-sight, and we determine an upper limit to thetemperature of the igm. finally, we examine the full distribution ofb-parameters and show that this is completely specified by just two parameters:the temperature of the gas and the amplitude of the power spectrum. using thetemperature upper limit measured with the nhi-b cutoff method, we derive anupper limit to the amplitude of the power spectrum.

0811.3747	dependence of interstellar turbulent pressure on supernova rate	feedback from massive stars is one of the least understood aspects of galaxyformation. we perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellarmedium (ism) simulations in which supernova rates and vertical gas columndensities are systematically varied based on the schmidt-kennicutt law. oursimulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution (1.95 pc) to follow thehydrodynamic interactions among multiple supernovae that structure the ism. ata given supernova rate, we find that the mean mass-weighted sound speed andvelocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density,indicating that both thermal and turbulent pressures are nearly constant in themidplane, so the effective equation of state is isobaric. in contrast, acrossour four models having supernova rates that range from one to 512 times thegalactic supernova rate, the mass-weighted velocity dispersion remains in therange 4-6 km/s. hence, gas averaged over ~100 pc regions follows an effectiveequation of state that is close to isothermal. simulated h i emission lineshave widths of 10-18 km/s, comparable to observed values. in our highestsupernova rate model, superbubble blow-outs occur, and the turbulent pressureon large scales is &gt;~4 times higher than the thermal pressure. we find a tightcorrelation between the thermal and turbulent pressures averaged over ~100 pcregions in the midplane of each model, as well as across the four ism models.we construct a subgrid model for turbulent pressure based on analytic argumentsand explicitly calibrate it against our stratified ism simulations. the subgridmodel provides a simple yet physically motivated way to include supernovafeedback in cosmological simulations.

0812.2479	radiative feedback in relic hii regions at high-redshift	uv radiation from early astrophysical sources could have a large impact onsubsequent star formation in nearby protogalaxies. here we study the radiativefeedback from the first, short-lived stars using hydrodynamical simulationswith transient uv backgrounds (uvbs) and persistent lyman-werner backgrounds(lwbs) of varying intensity. we extend our prior work in mesinger et al.(2006), by studying a more typical region whose proto-galaxies form at lowerredshifts, z~13-20, in the epoch likely preceding the bulk of reionization. weconfirm our previous results that feedback in the relic hii regions resultingfrom such transient radiation, is itself transient. feedback effects dwindleaway after ~30% of the hubble time, and the same critical specific intensity ofj_uv~0.1 x 10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/hz/sr separates positive and negative feedbackregimes. additionally, we discover a second episode of eventual positivefeedback in halos which have not yet collapsed when their progenitor regionswere exposed to the transient uvb. this eventual positive feedback appears inall runs, regardless of the strength of the uvb. however, this feedback regimeis very sensitive to the presence of lyman-werner radiation, and notableeffects disappear under fairly modest background intensities of j_lw&gt;10^{-3} x10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/hz/sr. we conclude that uv radiative feedback in relic hiiregions, although a complicated process, seems unlikely to have a major impacton the progress of cosmological reionization, provided that present estimatesof the lifetime and luminosity of a popiii star are accurate. more likely isthat the build-up of the lwb ultimately governs the feedback strength until apersistent uv background can be established.
