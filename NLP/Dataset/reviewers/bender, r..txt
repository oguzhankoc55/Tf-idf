0910.5590	the old and heavy bulge of m31 i. kinematics and stellar populations	we present new optical long-slit data along 6 position angles of the bulgeregion of m31. we derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcminfrom the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, andout to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk makes 55% of the totallight. we show that the velocity dispersions of mcelroy (1983) are severelyunderestimated (by up to 50 km/s) and previous dynamical models haveunderestimated the stellar mass of m31's bulge by a factor 2. moreover, thelight-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km/s, thusreducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the blackhole at the center of m31. the kinematic position angle varies with distance,pointing to triaxiality. we detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minoraxis. we measure eight emission-corrected lick indices. they are approximatelyconstant on circles. we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-elementoverabundance profiles. except for the region in the inner arcsecs of thegalaxy, the bulge of m31 is uniformly old (&gt;12 gyr, with many best-fit ages atthe model grid limit of 15 gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant([alpha/fe]~0.2) and at solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of theresolved stellar components. the predicted u-g, g-r and r-i sloan colorprofiles match reasonably well the dust-corrected observations. the stellarpopulations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (m/l_r ~4-4.5 for a kroupa imf), in agreement with stellar dynamical estimates based onour new velocity dispersions. in the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted agedrops to 4-8 gyr, while the metallicity increases to above 3 times the solarvalue.

0912.0744	golden gravitational lensing systems from the sloan lens acs survey. i.  sdss j1538+5817: one lens for two sources	we present a lensing and photometric study of the exceptional system sdssj1538+5817, identified by the slacs survey. the lens is a luminous ellipticalat redshift z=0.143. using hst public images in two different filters, thepresence of two background sources lensed into an einstein ring and a doublesystem is ascertained. our new spectroscopic observations, performed at thenot, reveal that the two sources are located at the same redshift z=0.531. weinvestigate the total mass distribution of the lens between 1 and 4 kpc fromthe galaxy center by means of parametric and non-parametric lensing codes thatdescribe the multiple images as point-like objects. several disparate lensingmodels agree on: (1) reproducing accurately the observed image positions; (2)predicting a nearly axisymmetric total mass distribution, centered and orientedas the light distribution; (3) measuring a value of 8.11 x 10^{10} m_{sun} forthe total mass projected within the einstein radius of 2.5 kpc; (4) estimatinga total mass density profile slightly steeper than an isothermal one. a fit ofthe sdss multicolor photometry with csp models provides a value of 20 x 10^{10}m_{sun} for the total stellar mass of the galaxy and of 0.9 for the fraction ofprojected luminous over total mass enclosed inside the einstein radius. bycombining lensing and photometric mass measurements, we differentiate the lensmass content in terms of luminous and dark matter components. thistwo-component modeling, which is viable only in extraordinary systems like sdssj1538+5817, leads to a description of the global properties of the galaxy darkmatter halo. extending these results to a larger number of lenses would improveconsiderably our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution processes inthe lcdm scenario.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1005.3021	finite-source and finite-lens effects in astrometric microlensing	the aim of this paper is to study the astrometric trajectory of microlensingevents with an extended lens and/or source. we consider not only a dark lensbut also a luminous lens as well. we find that the discontinuous finite-lenstrajectories given by takahashi (2003) will become continuous in thefinite-source regime. the point lens (source) approximation alone gives anunder (over)estimation of the astrometric signal when the size of the lens andsource are not negligible. while the finiteness of the source is revealed whenthe lens transits the surface of the source, the finite-lens signal is mostprominent when the lens is very close to the source. astrometric microlensingtowards the galactic bulge, small magellanic cloud and m31 are discussed, whichindicate that the finite-lens effect is beyond the detection limit of currentinstruments. nevertheless, it is possible to distinguish between self-lensingand halo lensing through a (non-)detection of the astrometric ellipse. we alsoconsider the case where the lens is luminous itself, as has been observed wherea lensing event was followed up with the hubble space telescope. we show thatthe astrometric signal will be reduced in a luminous-lens scenario. thephysical properties of the event, such as the lens-source flux ratio, the sizeof the lens and source nevertheless can be derived by fitting the astrometrictrajectory.

0708.2205	axisymmetric orbit models of n-body merger remnants: a dependency of  reconstructed mass on viewing angle	we model mock observations of collisionless n-body disc-disc mergers with anaxisymmetric orbit superposition program that has been used to model comaellipticals. the remnants sample representatively the shapes of disc-discmergers including prolate, triaxial and oblate objects. the aim is to betterunderstand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed massesand stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric,whether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised inmodels of real galaxies. the mass recovery at the half-light radius depends onviewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct totalmasses with an accuracy between 20% (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3% (oblateremnant). masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by upto 50%. deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants arestrongly triaxial or prolate. luminous m/l are sensitive to box orbits in theremnants. box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle.reconstructed luminous m/l and central masses follow this variation. luminousm/l are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2.5). respective dark halos inthe models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again onviewing angle. reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle andon the orbital composition of the remnant. we construct n-body realisations ofthe schwarzschild models to discuss chaotic orbits and the virial equilibriumin our models. apparently flattened, rotating ellipticals of intermediate massare likely close to both, axial symmetry and edge-on orientation. our resultsimply that schwarzschild models allow a reconstruction of their masses andstellar anisotropies with high accuracy.

1101.3781	supermassive black holes do not correlate with galaxy disks or  pseudobulges	the masses of supermassive black holes are known to correlate with theproperties of the bulge components of their host galaxies. in contrast, theyappear not to correlate with galaxy disks. disk-grown pseudobulges areintermediate in properties between bulges and disks. it has been unclearwhether they do or do not correlate with black holes in the same way thatbulges do, because too few pseudobulges were classified to provide a clearresult. at stake are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve withblack holes, possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes.here we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamicallydetected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocitydispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies. these data confirm that blackholes do not correlate with disks and show that they correlate little or not atall with pseudobulges. we suggest that there are two different modes of blackhole feeding. black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergersdrive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. in contrast, small black holesin bulgeless galaxies and galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-levelseyferts. growth of the former is driven by global processes, so the biggestblack holes coevolve with bulges, but growth of the latter is driven locallyand stochastically, and they do not coevolve with disks and pseudobulges.

1103.3414	dynamical masses of early-type galaxies: a comparison to lensing results  and implications for the stellar imf and the distribution of dark matter	this work aims to study the distribution of luminous and dark matter in comaearly-type galaxies. dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that massfollows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systemsof similar velocity dispersions. instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halosare in good agreement with lensing results. we derive mass-to-light ratios ofthe stellar populations from lick absorption line indices, reproducing well theobserved galaxy colours. even in dynamical models with dark matter halos theamount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxyvelocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function(imf). while galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a kroupa imf,the same imf underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~300 km/s by a factor of two and more. a systematic variation of the stellar imfwith galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a salpeter imffor the most massive galaxies. if the imf is instead constant, then some of thedark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatialdistribution very similar to that of the light. a combination of both, avarying imf and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possibleas well. for a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations we show thatthe tilt in the fundamental plane can be explained by systematic variations ofthe total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. we tested commonlyused mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30% level.

1210.4171	molecular gas in the centre of nearby galaxies from vlt/sinfoni integral  field spectroscopy - i. morphology and mass inventory	we present the first results of an analysis of the properties of themolecular gas in the nuclear regions (r &lt; 300 pc) of a sample of six nearbygalaxies, based on new high spatial resolution observations obtained in thek-band with the near-infrared integral field spectrograph sinfoni at the verylarge telescope. we derive two-dimensional distributions of the warm molecularand ionized gas from the h2, br_gamma and hei emission lines present in thespectra of the galaxies. we find a range of morphologies, including bar- andring-like distributions and either centrally peaked or off-centre emission. themorphologies of the molecular and the ionized gas are not necessarilycoincident. the observed emission-line ratios point towards thermal processesas the principal mechanism responsible for the h2 excitation in the nuclear andcircumnuclear regions of the galaxies, independently of the presence of anactive nucleus. we find that a rescaling of the h2 2.12 microns emission-lineluminosity by a factor beta~1200 gives a good estimate (within a factor of 2)of the total (cold) molecular gas mass. the galaxies of the sample containlarge quantities of molecular gas in their centres, with total masses in the ~105 - 108 msol range. never the less, these masses correspond to less than 3per cent of the stellar masses derived for the galaxies in these regions,indicating that the presence of gas should not affect black hole mass estimatesbased on the dynamical modelling of the stars. the high-spatial resolutionprovided by the sinfoni data allowed us to resolve a circumnuclear ring (with aradius of ~270 pc) in the galaxy ngc 4536. the measured values of the br_gammaequivalent width and the hei/br_gamma emission-line ratio suggests that burstsof star formation occurred throughout this ring as recently as 6.5 myr ago.

1211.1023	further evidence for large central mass-to-light ratios in massive  early-type galaxies	we studied the stellar populations, distribution of dark matter, anddynamical structure of a sample of 25 early-type galaxies in the coma and abell262 clusters. we derived dynamical mass-to-light ratios and dark matterdensities from orbit-based dynamical models, complemented by the ages,metallicities, and \alpha-elements abundances of the galaxies from singlestellar population models. most of the galaxies have a significant detection ofdark matter and their halos are about 10 times denser than in spirals of thesame stellar mass. calibrating dark matter densities to cosmologicalsimulations we find assembly redshifts z_{dm} \approx 1-3. the dynamical massthat follows the light is larger than expected for a kroupa stellar initialmass function, especially in galaxies with high velocity dispersion\sigma_{eff} inside the effective radius r_{eff}. we now have 5 of 25 galaxieswhere mass follows light to 1-3 r_{eff}, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio ofall the mass that follows the light is large (\approx 8-10 in the kron-cousinsr band), the dark matter fraction is negligible to 1-3 r_{eff}. this couldindicate a "massive" initial mass function in massive early-type galaxies.alternatively, some of the dark matter in massive galaxies could follow thelight very closely suggesting a significant degeneracy between luminous anddark matter.

1303.6287	dark matter halo properties from galaxy-galaxy lensing	we present results for a galaxy-galaxy lensing study based on imaging datafrom the canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey wide. from a 12 millionobject multi-colour catalogue for 124 deg^2 of photometric data in theu*g'r'i'z' filters we compute photometric redshifts (with a scatter of\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)} = 0.033 and an outlier rate of \eta=2.0 per cent fori'&lt;=22.5) and extract galaxy shapes down to i'=24.0. we select a sample oflenses and sources with 0.05 &lt; z_d &lt;= 1 and 0.05 &lt; z_s &lt;= 2. we fit threedifferent galaxy halo profiles to the lensing signal, a singular isothermalsphere (sis), a truncated isothermal sphere (bbs) and a universal densityprofile (nfw). we derive velocity dispersions by fitting an sis out to 100h^{-1} kpc to the excess surface mass density \delta\sigma and perform maximumlikelihood analyses out to a maximum scale of 2 h^{-1} mpc to obtain haloparameters and scaling relations. we find luminosity scaling relations of\sigma_{red} ~ l^{0.24+-0.03} for the red lens sample, \sigma_{blue} ~l^{0.23+-0.03} for blue lenses and \sigma ~ l^{0.29+-0.02} for the combinedlens sample with zeropoints of \sigma*_{red}=162+-2 km/s, \sigma*_{blue}=115+-3km/s and \sigma*=135+-2 km/s at a chosen reference luminosity l*_{r'} = 1.6\times 10^10 h^{-2} l_{r',sun}. the steeper slope for the combined sample isdue to the different zeropoints of the blue and red lenses and the fact thatblue lenses dominate at low luminosities and red lenses at high luminosities.the mean effective redshifts for the lens samples are &lt;z_{red}&gt;=0.28 for redlenses, &lt;z_{blue}&gt;=0.35 for blue lenses and &lt;z&gt;=0.34 for the combined lenssample.

1306.1124	the influence of dark matter halos on dynamical estimates of black hole  mass: ten new measurements for high-sigma early-type galaxies	adaptive-optics assisted sinfoni observations of the central regions of tenearly-type galaxies are presented. based primarily on the sinfoni kinematics,ten black hole masses occupying the high-mass regime of the m_bh-sigma relationare derived using three-integral schwarzschild models. the effect of darkmatter inclusion on the black hole mass is explored. the omission of a darkmatter halo in the model results in a higher stellar mass-to-light ratio,especially when extensive kinematic data are used in the model. however, whenthe diameter of the sphere of influence -- computed using the black hole massderived without a dark halo -- is at least 10 times the psf fwhm during theobservations, it is safe to exclude a dark matter component in the dynamicalmodeling, i.e. the change in black hole mass is negligible. when the spatialresolution is marginal, restricting the mass-to-light ratio to the right valuereturns the correct m_bh although dark halo is not present in the model.compared to the m_bh-sigma and m_bh-l relations of mcconnell et al. (2011), theten black holes are all more massive than expected from the luminosities andseven black hole masses are higher than expected from the stellar velocitydispersions of the host bulges. using new fitted relations which include theten galaxies, we find that the space density of the most massive black holes(m_bh &gt;~ 10^9 msun) estimated from the m_bh-l relation is higher than theestimate based on the m_bh-sigma relation and the latter is higher than modelpredictions based on quasar counts, each by about an order of magnitude.

1310.5310	depleted galaxy cores and dynamical black hole masses	shallow cores in bright, massive galaxies are commonly thought to be theresult of scouring of stars by mergers of binary supermassive black holes. pastinvestigations have suggested correlations between the central black hole massand the stellar light or mass deficit in the core, using proxy measurements of$m_{\rm bh}$ or stellar mass-to-light ratios ($\upsilon$). drawing on a wealthof dynamical models which provide both $m_{\rm bh}$ and $\upsilon$, we identifycores in 23 galaxies, of which 20 have direct, reliable measurements of $m_{\rmbh}$ and dynamical stellar mass-to-light ratios ($\upsilon_{\star,{\rm dyn}}$).these cores are identified and measured using core-s\'ersic model fits tosurface brightness profiles which extend out to large radii (typically morethan the effective radius of the galaxy); for approximately one fourth of thegalaxies, the best fit includes an outer (\sersic) envelope component. we findthat the core radius is most strongly correlated with the black hole mass andthat it correlates better with total galaxy luminosity than it does withvelocity dispersion. the strong core-size-- $m_{\rm bh}$ correlation enablesestimation of black hole masses (in core galaxies) with an accuracy comparableto the $m_{\rm bh}$--$\sigma$ relation (rms scatter of 0.30 dex in $\log m_{\rmbh}$), without the need for spectroscopy. the light and mass deficits correlatemore strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion than they do with black holemass. stellar mass deficits span a range of 0.2--39 \mbh, with almost all (87%)being $&lt; 10 \, m_{\rm bh}$; the median value is 2.2 $m_{\rm bh}$.

1311.3783	the dynamical fingerprint of core scouring in massive elliptical  galaxies	the most massive elliptical galaxies have low-density centers or cores thatdiffer dramatically from the high-density centers of less massive ellipticalsand bulges of disk galaxies. these cores have been interpreted as the result ofmergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which depopulate galaxy centers bygravitationally slingshotting central stars toward large radii. such binariesnaturally form in mergers of luminous galaxies. here, we analyze the populationof central stellar orbits in 11 massive elliptical galaxies that we observedwith the integral field spectrograph sinfoni at the european southernobservatory very large telescope. our dynamical analysis is orbit-based andincludes the effects of a central black hole, the mass distribution of thestars, and a dark matter halo. we show that the use of integral fieldkinematics and the inclusion of dark matter is important to conclude upon thedistribution of stellar orbits in galaxy centers. six of our galaxies are coregalaxies. in these six galaxies, but not in the galaxies without cores, wedetect a coherent lack of stars on radial orbits in the core region and auniform excess of radial orbits outside of it: when scaled by the core radius,the radial profiles of the classical anisotropy parameter beta are nearlyidentical in core galaxies. moreover, they match quantitatively the predictionsof black hole binary simulations, providing the first convincing dynamicalevidence for core scouring in the most massive elliptical galaxies.

1312.0604	molecular gas in the centre of nearby galaxies from vlt/sinfoni integral  field spectroscopy - ii. kinematics	we present an analysis of the h2 emission-line gas kinematics in the inner &lt;4 arcsec radius of six nearby spiral galaxies, based on ao-assistedintegral-field observations obtained in the k-band with sinfoni/vlt. four ofthe six galaxies in our sample display ordered h2 velocity fields, consistentwith gas moving in the plane of the galaxy and rotating in the same directionas the stars. however, the gas kinematics is typically far from simple circularmotion. we can classify the observed velocity fields into four different typesof flows, ordered by increasing complexity: (1) circular motion in a disc(ngc3351); (2) oval motion in the galaxy plane (ngc3627 and ngc4536); (3)streaming motion superimposed on circular rotation (ngc4501); and (4)disordered streaming motions (ngc4569 and ngc4579). the h2 velocity dispersionin the galaxies is usually higher than 50 km/s in the inner 1-2 arcsec radii.the four galaxies with ordered kinematics have v/sigma &lt; 1 at radii less than40-80 pc. the radius at which v/sigma = 1 is independent of the type of nuclearactivity. while the low values of v/sigma could be taken as an indication of athick disc in the innermost regions of the galaxies, other lines of evidence(e.g. h2 morphologies and velocity fields) argue for a thin disc interpretationin the case of ngc3351 and ngc4536. we discuss the implications of the highvalues of velocity dispersion for the dynamics of the gaseous disc and suggestcaution when interpreting the velocity dispersion of ionized and warm tracersas being entirely dynamical. understanding the nature and role of the velocitydispersion in the gas dynamics, together with the full 2d information of thegas, is essential for obtaining accurate black hole masses from gas kinematics.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

0805.0137	the m31 microlensing event wecapp-gl1/point-agape-s3: evidence for a  macho component in the dark halo of m31?	we re-analyze the m31 microlensing event wecapp-gl1/point-agape-s3 takinginto account that stars are not point-like but extended. we show that thefinite size of stars can dramatically change the self-lensing eventrate and(less dramatically) also the halo lensing eventrate, if events are as bright aswecapp-gl1. the brightness of the brightest events mostly depends on the sourcesizes and fluxes and on the distance distribution of sources and lenses andtherefore can be used as a sensitive discriminator between halo-lensing andself-lensing events, provided the stellar population mix of source stars isknown well enough. using a realistic model for the 3d-light distribution,stellar population and extinction of m31, we show that an event like wecapp-gl1is very unlikely to be caused by self-lensing. in the entire wecapp-field($17.2'\times 17.2'$ centered on the bulge) we expect only one self-lensingevent every 49 years with the approximate parameters of wecapp-gl1 (time-scale1-3d, $r$ flux-excess &lt;19.0 mag). if we assume only 20% of the dark halos ofm31 and the milky-way consist of 1 solar mass machos an event like wecapp-gl1would occur every 10 years. further more, if one uses position, fwhm timescale, flux excess and color of wecapp-gl1, self-lensing is even 13 times lesslikely than lensing by a macho, if machos contribute 20% to the total halo massand have masses in the range of 0.1 to 4 solar masses. we also demonstrate that(i) the brightness distribution of events in general is a good discriminatorbetween self and halo lensing (ii) the time-scale distribution is a gooddiscriminator if the macho mass is larger than 0.5 solar masses. future surveysof m31 like pandromeda (pan-starrs 1) should be able to provide many more suchevents within the next 4 years.

astro-ph;0005530	the nuclear dynamics of m32. i. data and stellar kinematics	we have obtained optical long-slit spectroscopy of the nucleus of m32 usingthe space telescope imaging spectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope. thestellar rotation velocity and velocity dispersion, as well as the fullline-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd), were determined as a function ofposition along the slit using two independent spectral deconvolutionalgorithms. we see three clear kinematical signatures of the nuclear blackhole: a sudden upturn, at ~0.3 arc seconds from the center, in the stellarvelocity dispersions; a flat or rising rotation curve into the center; andstrong, non-gaussian wings on the central losvd. the central velocitydispersion is ~130 km/s (gaussian fit) or ~175 km/s (corrected for the wings).both the velocity dispersion spike and the shape of the central losvd areconsistent with the presence of a supermassive compact object in m32 with amass in the range 2-5 x 10^6 solar masses. these data are a significantimprovement on previous stellar kinematical data, making m32 the first galaxyfor which the imprint of the black hole's gravitation on the stellar velocitieshas been observed with a resolution comparable to that of gas-dynamicalstudies.

astro-ph;0007038	the evolution of the color gradients of early-type cluster galaxies	we investigate the origin of color gradients in cluster early-type galaxiesto probe whether pure age or pure metallicity gradients can explain theobserved data in local and distant (z approx 0.4) samples. we measure thesurface brightness profiles of the 20 brightest early-type galaxies ofcl0949+44 (hereafter cl0949) at redshift z=0.35-0.38 from hst wf2 frames takenin the filters f555w, f675w, f814w. we determine the color profiles (v-r)(r),(v-i)(r), and (r-i)(r) as a function of the radial distance r in arcsec, andfit logarithmic gradients in the range -0.2 to 0.1 mag per decade. these valuesare similar to what is found locally for the colors (u-b), (u-v), (b-v) whichapproximately match the (v-r), (v-i), (r-i) at redshift approx 0.4. we analysethe results with up to date stellar population models. we find that passiveevolution of metallicity gradients (approx 0.2 dex per radial decade) providesa consistent explanation of the local and distant galaxies' data. invoking pureage gradients (with fixed metallicity) to explain local color gradientsproduces too steep gradients at redshifts z approx 0.4. pure age gradients areconsistent with the data only if large present day ages (&gt;=15 gyr) are assumedfor the galaxy centers.

astro-ph;0011204	evidence of a supermassive black hole in the galaxy ngc 1023 from the  nuclear stellar dynamics	we analyze the nuclear stellar dynamics of the sb0 galaxy ngc 1023, utilizingobservational data both from the space telescope imaging spectrograph aboardthe hubble space telescope and from the ground. the stellar kinematics measuredfrom these long-slit spectra show rapid rotation (v = 70 km/s at a distance of0.1 arcsec = 4.9 pc from the nucleus) and increasing velocity dispersion towardthe nucleus (where sigma = 295 +/- 30 km/s). we model the observed stellarkinematics assuming an axisymmetric mass distribution with both two and threeintegrals of motion. both modeling techniques point to the presence of acentral dark compact mass (which presumably is a supermassive black hole) withconfidence &gt; 99%. the isotropic two-integral models yield a best-fitting blackhole mass of (6.0 +/- 1.4) x 10^7 m_sun and mass-to-light ratio (m/l_v) of 5.38+/- 0.08, and the goodness-of-fit (chi^2) is insensitive to reasonable valuesfor the galaxy's inclination. the three-integral models, whichnon-parametrically fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distribution as afunction of position in the galaxy, suggest a black hole mass of (3.9 +/- 0.4)x 10^7 m_sun and m/l_v of 5.56 +/- 0.02 (internal errors), and the edge-onmodels are vastly superior fits over models at other inclinations. the internaldynamics in ngc 1023 as suggested by our best-fit three-integral model showsthat the velocity distribution function at the nucleus is tangentiallyanisotropic, suggesting the presence of a nuclear stellar disk. the nuclearline of sight velocity distribution has enhanced wings at velocities &gt;= 600km/s from systemic, suggesting that perhaps we have detected a group of starsvery close to the central dark mass.

astro-ph;0111146	the evolution of the tully-fisher relation of spiral galaxies	we present the b-band tully-fisher relation (tfr) of 60 late-type galaxieswith redshifts 0.1-1. the galaxies were selected from the fors deep field witha limiting magnitude of r=23. spatially resolved rotation curves were derivedfrom spectra obtained with fors2 at the vlt. high-mass galaxies with v_max&gt;=150km/s show little evolution, whereas the least massive systems in our sample arebrighter by about 1-2 mag compared to their local counterparts. for the entiredistant sample, the tfr slope is flatter than for local field galaxies(-5.77+-0.45 versus -7.92+-0.18). thus, we find evidence for evolution of theslope of the tfr with redshift on the 3-sigma level. this is still true when wesubdivide the sample into three redshift bins. we speculate that the flattertilt of our sample is caused by the evolution of luminosities and an additionalpopulation of blue galaxies at z&gt;=0.2. the mass dependence of the tfr evolutionalso leads to variations for different galaxy types in magnitude-limitedsamples, suggesting that selection effects can account for the discrepantresults of previous tfr studies on the luminosity evolution of late-typegalaxies.

astro-ph;0306219	spatially resolved spectroscopy of coma cluster early -- type galaxies:  iii. the stellar population gradients	we derive central values and logarithmic gradients for the hbeta, mg and feindices of 35 early-type galaxies in the coma cluster. we find that pureelliptical galaxies have on average slightly higher velocity dispersions, lowerhbeta, and higher metallic line-strengths than galaxies with disks (s0). thegradients strongly correlate with the gradients of sigma, but only weakly withthe central index values and galaxy velocity dispersion. using stellarpopulation models with variable element abundance ratios from thomas, maraston&amp; bender (2003a) we derive average ages, metallicities and [alpha/fe] ratios inthe center and at the effective radius. we find that the [alpha/fe] ratiocorrelates with velocity dispersion and drives 30% of the mg-sigma relation,the remaining 70% being caused by metallicity variations. we derive negativemetallicity gradients (-0.16 dex per decade) that are significantly flatterthan what is expected from gaseous monolithic collapse models, pointing to theimportance of mergers in the galaxy formation history. the gradients in age arenegligible, implying that no significant residual star formation has occurredeither in the center or in the outer parts of the galaxies, and that thestellar populations at different radii must have formed at a common epoch. forthe first time we derive the gradients of the [alpha/fe] ratio and find themvery small on the mean. hence, [alpha/fe] enhancement is not restricted togalaxy centers but it is a global phenomenon. our results imply that themg-sigma local relation inside a galaxy, unlike the global mg-sigma relation,must be primarily driven by metallicity variations alone.

astro-ph;0403041	the munich near--infrared cluster survey (munics) -- vi. the stellar  masses of k-band selected field galaxies to z ~ 1.2	we present a measurement of the evolution of the stellar mass function infour redshift bins at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.2 using a sample of more than 5000 k-selectedgalaxies drawn from the munics dataset. our data cover the stellar mass range10^10 &lt; m/msun &lt; 10^12. we derive k-band mass-to-light ratios by fitting a gridof composite stellar population models of varying star formation history, age,and dust extinction to bvrijk photometry. we discuss the evolution of theaverage mass-to-light ratio as a function of galaxy stellar mass in the k-bandand in the b-band. we compare our stellar mass function at z &gt; 0 to estimatesobtained similarly at z=0. we find that the mass-to-light ratios in the k-banddecline with redshift. this decline is similar for all stellar masses above$10^10 msun. lower mass galaxies have lower mass-to-light ratios at allredshifts. the stellar mass function evolves significantly to z = 1.2. thetotal normalization decreases by a factor of ~2, the characteristic mass (theknee) shifts towards lower masses and the bright end therefore steepens withredshift. the amount of number density evolution is a strong function ofstellar mass, with more massive systems showing faster evolution than lessmassive systems. we discuss the total stellar mass density of the universe andcompare our results to the values from the literature both at lower and higherredshift. we find that the stellar mass density at z~1 is roughly 50% of thelocal value. our results imply that the mass assembly of galaxies continueswell after $z \sim 1$. our data favor a scenario in which the growth of themost massive galaxies is dominated by accretion and merging rather than starformation which plays a larger role in the growth of less massive systems.

astro-ph;0406014	mapping stationary axisymmetric phase-space distribution functions by  orbit libraries	this is the first of a series of papers dedicated to unveil the masscomposition and dynamical structure of a sample of flattened early typegalaxies in the coma cluster. we describe our modifications to theschwarzschild code of richstone et al. (in preparation). applying a voronoitessellation in the surface of section we are able to assign accuratephase-space volumes to individual orbits and to reconstruct the fullthree-integral phase-space distribution function (df) of any axisymmetric orbitlibrary. two types of tests have been performed to check the accuracy withwhich dfs can be represented by appropriate orbit libraries. first, by mappingdfs of spherical gamma-models and flattened plummer models on to the library weshow that the resulting line-of-sight velocity distributions and internalvelocity moments of the library match those directly derived from the df to aprecision better than that of present day observational errors. second, byfitting libraries to the projected kinematics of the same dfs we show that thedistribution function reconstructed from the fitted library matches the inputdf to a rms of about 15 per cent over a region in phase-space covering 90 percent of the mass of the library. the achieved accuracy allows us to implementeffective entropy-based regularisation to fit real, noisy and spatiallyincomplete data.

astro-ph;0409515	the star formation rate history in the fors deep and goods south fields	we measure the star formation rate (sfr) as a function of redshift z up to z\~4.5, based on b, i and (i+b) selected galaxy catalogues from the fors deepfield (fdf) and the k-selected catalogue from the goods-south field. distancesare computed from spectroscopically calibrated photometric redshifts accurateto (delta_z / (z_spec+1)) ~0.03 for the fdf and ~0.056 for the goods-southfield. the sfrs are derived from the luminosities at 1500 angstroem. we findthat the total sfr estimates derived from b, i and i+b catalogues agree verywell ($\lsim 0.1$ dex) while the sfr from the k catalogue is lower by ~0.2 dex.we show that the latter is solely due to the lower star-forming activity ofk-selected intermediate and low luminosity (l&lt;l_*) galaxies. the sfr of bright(l&gt;l_*) galaxies is independent of the selection band, i.e. the same for b, i,(i+b), and k-selected galaxy samples. at all redshifts, luminous galaxies(l&gt;l_*) contribute only ~1/3 to the total sfr. there is no evidence forsignificant cosmic variance between the sfrs in the fdf and goods-south field,  ~0.1 dex, consistent with theoretical expectations. the sfrs derived here arein excellent agreement with previous measurements provided we assume the samefaint-end slope of the luminosity function as previous works (alpha ~ -1.6).however, our deep fdf data indicate a shallower slope of alpha=-1.07, implyinga sfr lower by ~0.3 dex. we find the sfr to be roughly constant up to z ~4 andthen to decline slowly beyond, if dust extinctions are assumed to be constantwith redshift.

astro-ph;0410084	comparing spectroscopic and photometric stellar mass estimates	the purpose of this letter is to compare the quality of different methods forestimating stellar masses of galaxies. we compare the results of (a) fittingstellar population synthesis models to broad band colors from sdss and 2mass,(b) the analysis of spectroscopic features of sdss galaxies (kauffmann et al.2003), and, (c) a simple dynamical mass estimate based on sdss velocitydispersions and effective radii. knowing that all three methods can havesignificant biases, a comparison can help to establish their (relative)reliability. in this way, one can also probe the quality of the observationallycheap broadband color mass estimators for galaxies at higher redshift.generally, masses based on broad-band colors and spectroscopic features agreereasonably well, with a rms scatter of only ~ 0.25 dex over almost 4 decades inmass. however, as may be expected, systematic differences do exist and have anamplitude of ~ 0.15 dex, corrleting with halpha emission strength.interestingly, masses from broad-band color fitting are in better agreementwith dynamical masses than masses based on the analysis of spectroscopicfeatures. in addition, the differences between the latter and the dynamicalmasses correlate with halpha equivalent width, while this much less the casefor the broad-band masses. we conclude that broad band color mass estimators,provided they are based on a large enough wavelength coverage and use anappropriate range of ages, metallicities and dust extinctions, can yield fairlyreliable stellar masses for galaxies. this is a very encouraging result as suchmass estimates are very likely the only ones available at significant redshiftsfor some time to come.

astro-ph;0410209	the epochs of early-type galaxy formation as a function of environment	the aim of this paper is to set constraints of the epochs of early-typegalaxy formation through the 'archaeology' of the stellar populations in localgalaxies. using our models of absorption line indices that account for variableabundance ratios, we derive the stellar population parameters of 124 early-typegalaxies in high and low density environments. we find that all threeparameters age, metallicity, and alpha/fe ratio are correlated with velocitydispersion. we further find evidence for an influence of the environment on thestellar population properties. massive early-type galaxies in low-densityenvironments appear on average ~2 gyrs younger and slightly more metal-richthan their counterparts in high density environments. no offsets in thealpha/fe ratios, instead, are detected. we translate the derived ages andalpha/fe ratios into star formation histories. we show that most star formationactivity in early-type galaxies is expected to have happened between redshifts3 and 5 in high density and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low densityenvironments. we conclude that at least 50 per cent of the total stellar massdensity must have already formed at z 1, in good agreement with observationalestimates of the total stellar mass density as a function of redshift. ourresults suggest that significant mass growth in the early-type galaxypopulation below z 1 must be restricted to less massive objects, and asignificant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2should be present caused mainly by the field galaxy population. the results ofthis paper further imply vigorous star formation episodes in massive objects atz 2-5 and the presence of evolved ellipticals around z 1, both observationallyidentified as scuba galaxies and eros.

astro-ph;0410434	looking for obscured qsos in the x-ray emitting ero population	we present xmm-newton data centered on one of the munics near infraredcluster survey fields (s2f1) and we discuss the x-ray properties of the 6 x-rayemitting eros found. for one of them we have already obtained the redshiftusing near-infrared spectroscopic data, while for the remaining 5 eros theanalysis is based on photometric redshifts. we find evidence for the presenceof an x-ray obscured qso in at least 5 out of the 6 x-ray emitting eros. forthese 5 objects we derive intrinsic (2-10 kev) luminosities in excess of 10^44erg/s and intrinsic column densities higher than 10^22 cm^-2. these values havebeen obtained through a basic x-ray spectral analysis for the three brightestsources and through the analysis of the hardness ratios for the remaining two.all of these 5 x-ray emitting eros appear extended in the optical/near-infraredbands indicating that the host galaxy emission dominates at these wavelengths.this suggests that the hosted agns are likely to be absorbed also in theoptical/near-infrared bands: i.e. they are likely x-ray obscured possible type2 qsos. for the remaining ero the presence of an agn is suggested both by itshigh 0.5-2 kev luminosity (l(0.5-2 kev)~10^43 erg/s) and by itsx-ray-to-optical flux ratio. in this case the quality of the present dataprevents us from placing firm constraints on the agn type hosted. finally, thenear-ir spectrum obtained for one of the 6 eros classifies the host galaxy asan elliptical at z~1.7 with a stellar mass well in excess of 10^11 m_\odot.this result corroborates the possible link between the qso activity and theformation of massive spheroids.

astro-ph;0412020	the density of very massive evolved galaxies to z~1.7	we spectroscopically identified 7 massive evolved galaxies with magnitudes17.8&lt;k&lt;18.4 at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.7 over an area of ~160 arcmin^2 of the munics survey.their rest-frame k-band absolute magnitudes are -26.8&lt;m$_k&lt;-26.1 (5l*&lt;l_k&lt;10l*)and the resulting stellar masses are in the range 3-6.5x10^{11} m_sun. theanalysis we performed unambiguously shows the early-type nature of theirspectra. the 7 massive evolved galaxies account for a comoving density of\~5.5(+-2) x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} at &lt;z&gt;~1.5, a factor 1.5 lower than the density(8.4(+-1) x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3}) of early-types with comparable masses at z=0. theincompleteness (30%) of our spectroscopic observations accounts for thisdiscrepancy. thus, our data do not support a decrease of the comoving densityof early-type galaxies with masses comparable to the most massive ones in thelocal universe up to z~1.7. this suggests that massive evolved galaxies do notplay an important role in the evolution of the mass density outlined by recentsurveys in this redshift range, evolution which instead has to be ascribed tothe accretion of the stellar mass in late-type galaxies. finally, the presenceof such massive evolved galaxies at these redshifts suggests that the assemblyof massive spheroids has taken place at z&gt;2 supporting a high efficiency in theaccretion of the stellar mass in massive halos in the early universe.

astro-ph;0412250	kinematic and chemical evolution of early-type galaxies	we investigate in detail 13 early-type field galaxies with 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7 drawnfrom the fors deep field. since the majority (9 galaxies) is at z~0.4, wecompare the field galaxies to 22 members of three rich clusters with z=0.37 toexplore possible variations caused by environmental effects. we exploitvlt/fors spectra (r~1200) and hst/acs imaging to determine internal kinematics,structures and stellar population parameters. from the faber-jackson andfundamental plane scaling relations we deduce a modest luminosity evolution inthe b-band of 0.3-0.5mag for both samples. we compare measured lick absorptionline strengths (hdelta, hgamma, hbeta, mg_b, &amp; fe5335) with evolutionarystellar population models to derive light-averaged ages, metallicities and theelement abundance ratios mg/fe. we find that all these three stellar parametersof the distant galaxies obey a scaling with velocity dispersion (mass) which isvery well consistent with the one of local nearby galaxies. in particular, thedistribution of mg/fe ratios of local galaxies is matched by the distant ones,and their derived mean offset in age corresponds to the average lookback time.this indicates that there was little chemical enrichment and no significantstar formation within the last ~5gyr. the calculated luminosity evolution of asimple stellar population model for the derived galaxy ages and lookback timesis in most cases very consistent with the mild brightening measured by thescaling relations.

astro-ph;0505467	dating the stellar population in massive early-type galaxies at  $z\sim$1.5	we present the analysis of 10 massive early-type galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. theyhave been identified by means of a near-ir low resolution spectroscopicfollow-up of a complete sample of 36 bright (k' $&lt;$ 18.5) extremely red objects(eros, r-k'$&gt;$ 5) selected from the munich near-ir clustersurvey (munics; droryet al. 2001). the low resolution near-ir spectra constrain their redshift at$1.2&lt;z&lt;1.7$, implying absolute magnitudes m$_{k'}&lt;-26.0$ and stellar masseswell in excess of 10$^{11}$ m$_\odot$. under the hypothesis of pure passiveevolution from $z\sim1.5$ to $z=0$, in the local universe they would haveluminosities l$_k\ge2.5$l$^*$. thus, they are the high-z counterparts of thelocal old massive (10$^{11}-10^{12}$ m$_\odot$) early-type galaxies populatingthe bright end of the local luminosity function of galaxies. the comparison oftheir spectro-photometric properties with a grid of synthetic models suggeststhat the stellar populations in more than half of the sample are about$\sim$3-5 gyr old and 1-2 gyr old in the remaining part. these ages implyformation redshift $z_{f} &gt; 2$ for all the galaxies and $z_{f} \geq 4$ for theoldest ones. the comparison of the 4000\aa break and of the overall spectralshape of the average spectrum of the 10 galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with those oftheir local counterpartsconfirms that field massive early-type galaxies formedthe bulk of their stellar mass at $2&lt;z&lt;4$, most likely over a short ($&lt;$ 1 gyr)star formation time scale, consistently with the results derived from theanalysis of their individual spectro-photometric properties.

astro-ph;0511409	a counter-rotating core in the dwarf elliptical galaxy vcc 510	we present optical long-slit spectra of the virgo dwarf elliptical galaxy vcc510 at high spectral and spatial resolution. heliocentric velocities andvelocity dispersions as functions of galaxy radius are derived by deconvolvingline-of-sight velocity distributions. a maximum rotation v_rot=8 km/s insidehalf the effective radius (re~20 arcsec) and a mean, radially flat velocitydispersion sigma=44 km/s are measured. the core extending over the inner 2arcsec (~140 pc) is found to rotate in the opposite sense with v_rot(core) ~-1/2 v_rot. vcc 510 (m_b ~ -15.7) is therefore by far the faintest and smallestgalaxy with a counter-rotating core known. from the main body rotation and thevelocity dispersion profile we deduce that vcc 510 is anisotropic and clearlynot entirely supported by rotation. by comparison of lick absorption-lineindices with stellar population models we derive an old luminosity-weighted age(10 gyr) and sub-solar metallicity ([z/h]=-0.4) inside the effective radius.there is tentative evidence that the counter-rotating core might be younger andless alpha/fe enhanced. from the stellar population parameters we obtain atotal stellar mass-to-light ratio of ~3.6 (m/l_b)_sun which is significantlylower than a rough dynamical estimate obtained from the kinematics through thevirial theorem (~15). this discrepancy hints toward the possible presence ofdark matter in the centre of vcc 510. we discuss the origin of thecounter-rotating core and exclude fly-by encounters as a viable possibility.gas accretion or galaxy merging provide more likely explanations. vcc 510 istherefore the direct observational evidence that such processes do occur incluster satellite galaxies on dwarf galaxy scales.

astro-ph;0610241	the kormendy relation of massive elliptical galaxies at z~1.5. evidence  for size evolution ?	we present the morphological analysis based on hst-nic2 (0.075 arcsec/pixel)images in the f160w filter of a sample of 9 massive field (&gt; 10^{11} m_\odot)galaxies spectroscopically classified as early-types at 1.2&lt;z&lt;1.7. our analysisshows that all of them are bulge dominated systems. in particular, 6 of themare well fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile (n=4) suggesting that they can beconsidered pure elliptical galaxies. the remaining 3 galaxies are better fittedby a sersic profile with index 1.9&lt;n&lt;2.3 suggesting that a disk-like componentcould contribute up to 30% to the total light of these galaxies. we derived theeffective radius r_e and the mean surface brightness &lt;mu_e&gt; within r_e of ourgalaxies and we compared them with those of early-types at lower redshifts. wefind that the surface brightness &lt;mu_e&gt; of our galaxies should get fainter by2.5 mag from z~1.5 to z~0 to match the surface brightness of the localellipticals with comparable r_e, i.e. the local kormendy relation. luminosityevolution without morphological changes can only explain half of this effect,as the maximum dimming expected for an elliptical galaxy is ~1.6 mag in thisredshift range. thus, other parameters, possibly structural, may undergoevolution and play an important role in reconciling models and observations.hypothesizing an evolution of the effective radius of galaxies we find that r_eshould increase by a factor 1.5 from z~1.5 to z~0.

astro-ph;0611769	intense star-formation and feedback at high redshift: spatially-resolved  properties of the z=2.6 submillimeter galaxy smmj14011+0252	we present a detailed analysis of the spatially-resolved properties of thelensed submillimeter galaxy smmj14011+0252 at z=2.56, combining deepnear-infrared integral-field data obtained with spiffi on the vlt with othermulti-wavelength data sets. the broad characteristics of smmj14011+0252 are inagreement with what is expected for the early evolution of local massivespheroidal galaxies. from continuum and line flux, velocity, and dispersionmaps, we measure the kinematics, star-formation rates, gas densities, andextinction for individual subcomponents. the star formation intensity issimilar to low-redshift ``maximal starbursts'', while the line fluxes and thedynamics of the emission line gas provide direct evidence for astarburst-driven wind with physical properties very similar to localsuperwinds. we also find circumstantial evidence for "self-regulated" starformation within j1. the relative velocity of the bluer companion j2 yields adynamical mass estimate for j1 within about 20 kpc, m_dyn \sim 1\times 10^{11}m_sun. the relative metallicity of j2 is 0.4 dex lower than in j1n/s,suggesting different star formation histories. sed fitting of the continuumpeak j1c confirms and substantiates previous suggestions that this component isa z=0.25 interloper. when removing j1c, the stellar continuum and h-alpha lineemission appear well aligned spatially in two individual components j1n andj1s, and coincide with two kinematically distinct regions in the velocity map,which might well indicate a merging system. this highlights the closesimilarity between smgs and ulirgs, which are often merger-driven maximalstarbursts, and suggests that the intrinsic mechanisms of star-formation andrelated feedback are similar to low-redshift strongly star-forming systems.

astro-ph;0612596	x-ray monitoring of optical novae in m31 from july 2004 to february 2005	optical novae have recently been identified as the major class of supersoftx-ray sources in m31 based on rosat and early xmm-newton and chandraobservations. this paper reports on a search for x-ray counterparts of opticalnovae in m31 based on archival chandra hrc-i and acis-i as well as xmm-newtonobservations of the galaxy center region obtained from july 2004 to february2005. we systematically determine x-ray brightness or upper limit forcounterparts of all known optical novae with outbursts between november 2003 tothe end of the x-ray coverage. in addition, we determine the x-ray brightnessesfor counterparts of four novae with earlier outbursts. for comparison with thex-ray data we created a catalogue of optical novae in m31 based on our own novasearch programs and on all novae reported in the literature. we collected allknown properties and named the novae consistently following the cbat scheme. wedetect eleven out of 34 novae within a year after the optical outburst inx-rays. while for eleven novae we detect the end of the supersoft source phase,seven novae are still bright more than 1200, 1600, 1950, 2650, 3100, 3370 and3380 d after outburst. one nova is detected to turn on 50 d, another 200 dafter outburst. three novae unexpectedly showed short x-ray outbursts startingwithin 50 d after the optical outburst and lasting only two to three months.the x-ray emission of several of the novae can be characterized as supersoftfrom hardness ratios and/or x-ray spectra or by comparing hrc-i count rateswith acis-i count rates or upper limits. the number of detected optical novaeat supersoft x-rays is much higher than previously estimated (&gt;30%). we use thex-ray light curves to estimate the burned masses of the white dwarf and of theejecta.

astro-ph;9706023	the z=2.72 galaxy cb58: a gravitational fold arc lensed by the cluster  ms 1512+36	using hst wfpc2 v- and r-band data of the z=0.37 cluster ms1512+36 we showthat the z=2.72 `protogalaxy' cb58 is not extraordinarily luminousintrinsically but lensed into a gravitational fold arc by the cluster. the archas a surface brightness weighted axis ratio of 1:7, is marginally resolved inwidth and about 3 arcsec long. its counterimage was identified and found to bevery compact r(1/2) = 2.4-4.0 / h50 kpc in a q0=0.05 cosmology). in addition,we found three further multiple image systems, one with five and two with threeimages each. the positions of the multiple images is explained by modelling thelight deflection caused by the cluster and the cd-galaxy with ellipticalisothermal potentials. since the multiple images are within 8 arcsec around thecd galaxy, a cluster core radius - cluster velocity dispersion degeneracyarises. the cluster velocity dispersion and the core radius are limited to540-670 km/s and 5 arcsec - 11\arcsec, respectively, and the brightness of theunlensed counterimage of cb58 is about 23.9 +- 0.3 (r-band), corresponding to amagnification and extinction corrected restframe-b band absolute magnitude of-24.75 +- 0.7 mag. the redshifts of the sources of the remaining three multipleimage systems are predicted to be similar to that of cb58. that part of thesource of cb58 which is mapped into the arc is reconstructed and itsmagnification is found to be mu(arc) &gt; 50. this large magnification explains atleast some of the untypical spectroscopic properties of cb58, e.g. that thestar formation rate seems to be high and uniform and to take place in a largearea.

astro-ph;9708237	exploring cluster ellipticals as cosmological standard rods	we explore the possibility to calibrate massive cluster ellipticals ascosmological standard rods using the fundamental plane relation combined with acorrection for luminosity evolution. though cluster ellipticals certainlyformed in a complex way, their passive evolution out to redshifts of about 1indicates that basically all major merging and accretion events took place athigher redshifts. therefore, a calibration of their luminosity evolution can beattempted. we propose to use the mg$-\sigma$ relation for that purpose becauseit is independent of distance and cosmology. we discuss a variety of possiblecaveats, ranging from dynamical evolution to uncertainties in stellarpopulation models and evolution corrections to the presence of age spread.sources of major random and systematic errors are analysed as well. we applythe described procedure to nine elliptical galaxies in two clusters at$z=0.375$ and derive constraints on the cosmological model. for the bestfitting $\lambda$-free cosmological model we obtain: $q_o \approx 0.1$, with90% confidence limits being $0 &lt; q_o &lt; 0.7$ (the lower limit being due to thepresence of matter in the universe). if the inflationary scenario applies (i.e.the universe has flat geometry), then, for the best fitting model, matter and$\lambda$ contribute about equally to the critical cosmic density (i.e.$\omega_m \approx \omega_\lambda \approx 0.5$). with 90% confidence$\omega_\lambda$ should be smaller than 0.9.

astro-ph;9710004	stellar yields and chemical evolution i: abundance ratios and delayed  mixing in the solar neighbourhood	we analyse two recent computations of type ii supernova nucleosynthesis bywoosley &amp; weaver (1995, ww95) and thielemann, nomoto, &amp; hashimoto (1996,tnh96), focusing on the ability to reproduce the observed [mg/fe]-ratios invarious galaxy types. we show that the yields of oxygen and total metallicityare in good agreement. however, tnh96-models produce more magnesium in theintermediate and less iron in the upper mass range of type ii supernovae thanww95-models. to investigate the significance of these discrepancies forchemical evolution, we calculate simple stellar population-yields for both setsof models and different imf slopes. we conclude that the mg-yields of ww95 donot suffice to explain the [mg/fe] overabundance neither in giant ellipticalgalaxies and bulges nor in metal-poor stars in the solar neighbourhood and thegalactic halo. calculating the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhoodaccording to the standard infall-model (e.g. matteucci &amp; greggio 1986; timmes,woosley, &amp; weaver 1995; yoshii, tsujimoto, &amp; nomoto 1995), we find that usingww95 and tnh96 nucleosynthesis, the solar magnesium abundance is underestimatedby 29 and 7 per cent, respectively.  we include the relaxation of the instantaneous mixing approximation inchemical evolution models by splitting the gas component into two differentphases. in additional simulations of the chemical evolution in the solarneighbourhood, we discuss various timescales for the mixing of the stellarejecta with the interstellar medium. we find that a delay of the order of$10^{8}$ years leads to a better fit of the observational data in the[mg/fe]-[fe/h] diagram without destroying the agreement with solar elementabundances and the age-metallicity relation.

astro-ph;9809261	constraints on galaxy formation from alpha-enhancement in luminous  elliptical galaxies	we explore the formation of alpha-enhanced and metal-rich stellar populationsin the nuclei of luminous ellipticals under the assumption of two extremegalaxy formation scenarios based on hierarchical clustering, namely a fastclumpy collapse and the merger of two spirals. we investigate the parameterspace of star formation time-scale, imf slope, and stellar yields. inparticular, the latter add a huge uncertainty in constraining time-scales andimf slopes. we find that -- for thielemann, nomoto &amp; hashimoto nucleosynthesis-- in a fast clumpy collapse scenario an [alpha/fe] overabundance of approx.0.2 dex in the high metallicity stars can be achieved with a salpeter imf andstar formation time-scales of the order 10^9 yr. the scenario of two mergingspirals which are similar to our galaxy, instead, fails to reproducealpha-enhanced abundance ratios in the metal-rich stars, unless the imf isflattened during the burst ignited by the merger. this result is independent ofthe burst time-scale. we suggest that abundance gradients give hints todistinguish between the two extreme formation scenarios considered in thispaper.

astro-ph;9903222	probing early-type galaxy evolution with the kormendy relation	we investigate the evolution of early-type galaxies in four clusters at z=0.4(abell370, cl0303+17, cl0939+47 and cl1447+26) and in one at z=0.55(cl0016+16). the galaxies are selected according to theirspectrophotometrically determined spectral types and comprise the morphologicalclasses e, s0 and sa galaxies. structural parameters are determined by atwo-component fitting of the surface brightness profiles derived from hstimages. exploring a realistic range of k-corrections using bruzual and charlotmodels, we construct the rest-frame b-band kormendy relations (mu_e-log(r_e))for the different clusters. we do not detect a systematic change of the slopeof the relation as a function of redshift. we discuss in detail how theluminosity evolution, derived by comparing the kormendy relations of thedistant clusters with the local one for coma, depends on various assumptionsand give a full description of random and systematic errors by exploring theinfluences of selection bias, different star formation histories andk-corrections.  early-type galaxies with modest disk components (s0 and sa) do not differsignificantly in their evolution from disk-less ellipticals.  the observed luminosity evolution is compatible with pure passive evolutionmodels (with redshift of formation z&gt;2) but also with models that allow ongoingstar formation on a low level, like exponentially decaying star formationmodels with an e-folding time of tau=1 gyr.

0809.3906	dark matter scaling relations and the assembly epoch of coma early-type  galaxies	axisymmetric, orbit-based dynamical models are used to derive dark matterscaling relations for coma early-type galaxies. from faint to bright galaxieshalo core-radii and asymptotic circular velocities increase. compared tospirals of the same brightness, the majority of coma early-types -- those withold stellar populations -- have similar halo core-radii but more than 2 timeslarger asymptotic halo velocities. the average dark matter density inside 2reff decreases with increasing luminosity and is 6.8 times larger than in diskgalaxies of the same b-band luminosity. compared at the same stellar mass, darkmatter densities in ellipticals are 13.5 times higher than in spirals.different baryon concentrations in ellipticals and spirals cannot explain thehigher dark matter density in ellipticals. instead, the assembly redshift (1+z)of coma early-type halos is likely about two times larger than of comparablybright spirals. assuming that local spirals typically assemble at a redshift ofone, the majority of bright coma early-type galaxy halos must have formedaround z = 2-3. for about half of our coma galaxies the assembly redshiftsmatch with constraints derived from stellar populations. we find dark matterdensities and estimated assembly redshifts of our observed coma galaxies inreasonable agreement with recent semi-analytic galaxy formation models.

0811.0619	absorption line indices in the uv. empirical and theoretical stellar  population models	(abridged). stellar absorption lines in the optical have been extensivelystudied and constitute an important stellar population diagnostic for galaxiesin the local universe and up to moderate redshifts. proceeding towards higherlook-back times, galaxies are younger and the ultraviolet becomes the relevantspectral region where the dominant stellar populations shine. a comprehensivestudy of ultraviolet absorption lines of stellar population models is howeverstill lacking. we study absorption line indices in the far and mid-ultravioletin order to determine age and metallicity indicators for uv-bright stellarpopulations in the local universe as well as at high redshift. we exploreempirical and theoretical spectral libraries and use evolutionary populationsynthesis to compute synthetic line indices of stellar population models. fromthe empirical side, we exploit the iue-low resolution library of stellarspectra and system of absorption lines. from the theoretical side we use ahigh-resolution library of kurucz synthetic spectra. in order to select indicesthat can be used as age and/or metallicity indicators for distant galaxies andglobular clusters, we compare the models to data of template globular clustersfrom the magellanic clouds. we provide synthetic line indices in the wavelengthrange 1200 angstrom to 3000 angstrom for stellar populations of various agesand metallicities. this adds several new indices to the well-studied civ andsiiv absorptions. based on the comparison with globular cluster data, we selecta set of 11 indices blueward of the 2000 angstrom rest-frame that allows torecover well the ages and the metallicities of the clusters. these indices areideal to study young galaxies at high redshift. we also provide the synthetichigh-resolution stellar population seds.

0811.2130	the flattening and the orbital structure of early-type galaxies and  collisionless n-body binary disk mergers	we use oblate axisymmetric dynamical models including dark halos to determinethe orbital structure of intermediate mass to massive coma early-type galaxies.we find a large variety of orbital compositions. averaged over all samplegalaxies the unordered stellar kinetic energy in the azimuthal and the radialdirection are of the same order, but they can differ by up to 40 percent inindividual systems. in contrast, both for rotating and non-rotating galaxiesthe vertical kinetic energy is on average smaller than in the other twodirections. this implies that even most of the rotating ellipticals areflattened by an anisotropy in the stellar velocity dispersions. usingthree-integral axisymmetric toy models we show that flattening by stellaranisotropy maximises the entropy for a given density distribution.collisionless disk merger remnants are radially anisotropic. the apparent lackof strong radial anisotropy in observed early-type galaxies implies that theymay not have formed from mergers of disks unless the influence of dissipationalprocesses was significant.
