1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1010.5782	the first release of data from the herschel atlas: the spire images	we have reduced the data taken with the spectral and photometric imagingreceiver (spire) photometer on board the herschel space observatory in thescience demonstration phase (sdp) of the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas). we describe the data reduction, which poses specificchallenges, both because of the sheer size of the data, and because only twoscans are made for each region. we implement effective solutions to process thebolometric timelines into maps, and show that correlations among detectors arenegligible, and that the photometer is stable on time scales up to 250 s. thisis longer than the time the telescope takes to cross the observed sky region,and it allows us to use naive binning methods for an optimal reconstruction ofthe sky emission. the maps have equal contribution of confusion and whiteinstrumental noise, and the latter is estimated to 5.3, 6.4, and 6.7 mjy/beam(1-{\sigma}), at 250, 350, and 500 \mu{m}, respectively. this pipeline is usedto reduce other h-atlas observations, as they became available, and we discusshow it can be used with the optimal map maker implemented in the herschelinteractive processing environment (hipe), to improve computational efficiencyand stability. the sdp dataset is available from http://www.h-atlas.org/.

1105.1006	the elusive ism of dwarf galaxies: excess submillimetre emission and  co-dark molecular gas	the herschel dwarf galaxy survey investigates the interplay of star formationactivity and the the metal-poor gas and dust of dwarf galaxies using fir andsubmillimetre imaging spectroscopic and photometric observations in the 50 to550mu window of the herschel space observatory. the dust seds are wellconstrained with the new herschel and mir spitzer data. a submillimetre excessis often found in low metallicity galaxies, which,if tracing very cold dust,would highlight large dust masses not easily reconciled in some cases, giventhe low metallicities and expected gas-to-dust mass ratios. the galaxies arealso mapped in the fir fine-structure lines (63 and 145mu oi, 158mu cii, 122and 205mu nii, 88mu oiii) probing the low density ionised gas, the hii regionsand photodissociation regions. while still early in the herschel mission we canalready see, along with earlier studies, that line ratios in the metal-poor ismdiffer remarkably from those in the metal-rich starburst environments. in dwarfgalaxies, l[cii]/l(co) (&gt;10^4) is at least an order of magnitude greater thanin the most metal-rich starburst galaxies. the enhanced [cii] arises from thelarger photodissociation region where h2, not traced by the co, can exist. the88mu [oiii] line usually dominates the fir line emission over galaxy-widescales in dwarf galaxies, not the 158mu [cii] line which is the dominant fircooling line in metal-rich galaxies. all of the fir lines together cancontribute 1% to 2% of the l(tir). the herschel dwarf galaxy survey willprovide statistical information on the nature of the dust and gas in lowmetallicity galaxies, elucidating the origin of the submm excess in dwarfgalaxies, and help determine a ([cii] +co) to h2 conversion factor, thusproviding observational constraints on chemical evolution models of galaxies.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.2178	the dust &amp; gas properties of m83	we examine the dust and gas properties of the nearby, barred galaxy m83,which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey. using images from the pacs andspire instruments of herschel, we examine the dust temperature and dust masssurface density distribution. we find that the nuclear, bar and spiral armregions exhibit higher dust temperatures and masses compared to interarmregions. however, the distribution of dust temperature and mass are notspatially coincident. assuming a trailing spiral structure, the dusttemperature peaks in the spiral arms lie ahead of the dust surface densitypeaks. the dust mass surface density correlates well with the distribution ofmolecular gas as traced by co (j=3-2) images (jcmt) and the star formation rateas traced by h?2 with a correction for obscured star formation using 24 micronemission. using hi images from things to trace the atomic gas component, wemake total gas mass surface density maps and calculate the gas-to-dust ratio.we find a mean gas-to-dust ratio of 84 \pm 4 with higher values in the innerregion assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion factor. we also examine thegas-to-dust ratio using co-to-h2 conversion factor that varies withmetallicity.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1210.4448	the herschel fornax cluster survey i: the bright galaxy sample	we present herschel observations of the fornax cluster at 100, 160, 250, 350and 500u with a spatial resolution of 7 - 36 arc sec (10" = 1 kpc atd_fornax=17.9 mpc). we define a sample of 11 bright galaxies, selected at 500u,directly comparable with our past work on virgo. we find good agreement withprevious observations made by iras and planck. the fir luminosity density ishigher (factor of three) in fornax compared to virgo. the 100u (42.5-122.5u)luminosity is two orders of magnitude larger in fornax than in the local fieldas measured by iras. using stellar (l_{0.4-2.5}) and fir (l_{100-500})luminosities we estimate a mean optical depth of tau=0.4+/-0.1 - the same valueas virgo. for 10 of the 11 galaxies (ngc1399 excepted) we fit a modifiedblackbody curve (beta=2.0) to the seds to derive dust masses and temperaturesof 10^{6.54-8.35} m_0 and t=14.6-24.2k respectively, comparable to virgo. thederived stars-to-gas(atomic) and gas(atomic)-to-dust ratios vary from 1.1-67.6and 9.8-436.5 respectively, again consistent with virgo. fornax is a massoverdensity in stars and dust of about 120 compared to the local field (30 forvirgo). fornax and virgo are both a factor of 6 lower over densities ingas(atomic) than in stars and dust indicating loss of gas, but not dust andstars, in the cluster environment. as the brightest fir source in either fornaxand virgo, ngc1365 is detected by planck. the planck data fit the pacs/spiresed out to 1382u with no evidence of other sources of emission ('spinningdust', free-free, synchrotron). at the opposite end of the scale ngc1399 isdetected only at 500$\mu$m with the emission probably arising from the nuclearradio source rather than inter-stellar dust.

1212.2211	h-atlas: the cosmic abundance of dust from the far-infrared background  power spectrum	we present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmicfar-infrared background (cfirb) anisotropies in one of the extragalactic fieldsof the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) at 250, 350and 500 \mu m bands. consistent with recent measurements of the cfirb powerspectrum in herschel-spire maps, we confirm the existence of a clear one-haloterm of galaxy clustering on arcminute angular scales with large-scale two-haloterm of clustering at 30 arcminutes to angular scales of a few degrees. thepower spectrum at the largest angular scales, especially at 250 \mu m, iscontaminated by the galactic cirrus. the angular power spectrum is modeledusing a conditional luminosity function approach to describe the spatialdistribution of unresolved galaxies that make up the bulk of the cfirb.integrating over the dusty galaxy population responsible for the backgroundanisotropies, we find that the cosmic abundance of dust, relative to thecritical density, to be between \omega_dust=10^{-6} and 8 x 10^{-6} in theredshift range z ~ 0-3. this dust abundance is consistent with estimates of thedust content in the universe using quasar reddening and magnificationmeasurements in the sdss.

1301.6618	h2o emission in high-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies	using iram pdbi we report the detection of h2o in six new lensedultra-luminous starburst galaxies at high redshift, discovered in the herschelh-atlas survey. the sources are detected either in the 2_{02}-1_{11} or2_{11}-2_{02} h_2o emission lines with integrated line fluxes ranging from 1.8to 14 jy.km/s. the corresponding apparent luminosities are mu x l_h2o ~ 3-12 x10^8 lo, where mu is the lensing magnification factor (3 &lt; mu &lt; 12). theseresults confirm that h2o lines are among the strongest molecular lines in suchgalaxies, with intensities almost comparable to those of the high-j co lines,and same profiles and line widths (200-900 km/s) as the latter. with thecurrent sensitivity of pdbi, h2o can therefore easily be detected in high-zlensed galaxies (with f(500um) &gt; 100 mjy) discovered in the herschel surveys.correcting the luminosities for lensing amplification, l_h2o is found to have astrong dependence on the ir luminosity, varying as ~l_ir^{1.2}. this relationwhich needs to be confirmed with better statistics, may indicate a role ofradiative (ir) excitation of the h2o lines, and implies that high-z galaxieswith l_ir &gt;~ 10^13 lo tend to be very strong emitters in h2o, that have noequivalent in the local universe.

1302.4276	gama/h-atlas: linking the properties of sub-mm detected and undetected  early-type galaxies: i. z$\le$0.06 sample	we present two large, nearby (0.013$\le$z$\le$0.06) samples of early-typegalaxies (etgs): a visually classified sample of 220 etgs, created usingsource-matched data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) database withfir/sub-mm detections from $herschel$-atlas; and a visually classified sampleof 551 etgs which are undetected with $herschel$-atlas. active galactic nuclei(agn) are removed from our samples using optical emission line diagnostics.these samples are scrutinised to determine characteristics of sub-mm detectedversus undetected etgs. we find similarities in the stellar mass distributionsof the two etg samples but testing other properties uncovers significantdifferences. the sub-mm detected sample is shown to have lower concentrationand s\'ersic indices than those in the undetected sample - a result which maybe linked to the presence of dust in the former. optical and uv-optical coloursare also shown to be much bluer, indicating that the dust is linked with recentstar formation. the intrinsic effective radii are on average 1.5 times largerfor the sub-mm detected etgs. surface densities and groups data from the gamadatabase are examined for the two samples, leading to the conclusion that dustyetgs inhabit sparser environments than non-dusty etgs in the nearby universe,although environments of the brightest etgs are shown to differ the least.modified planck functions are fit to the h-atlas detected pacs and spire fluxesfor etgs with sub-mm flux densities of at least 3$\sigma$ in the 350$\mu$mspire band, giving a resultant mean cold dust temperature of t$_{d}$=22.1k,with a range of 9-30k. the corresponding mean dust mass is1.8$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$, with a range of(0.08-35.0)$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$. the dust masses calculated from thesefits, normalised by stellar mass, are shown to increase with decreasing stellarmass and bluer colours.

1302.4436	herschel-atlas: a binary hylirg pinpointing a cluster of starbursting  proto-ellipticals	panchromatic observations of the best candidate hylirg from the widestherschel extragalactic imaging survey have led to the discovery of at leastfour intrinsically luminous z=2.41 galaxies across a ~100-kpc region - acluster of starbursting proto-ellipticals. via sub-arcsecond interferometricimaging we have measured accurate gas and star-formation surface densities. thetwo brightest galaxies span ~3 kpc fwhm in submm/radio continuum and co j=4-3,and double that in co j=1-0. the broad co line is due partly to the multitudeof constituent galaxies and partly to large rotational velocities in twocounter-rotating gas disks -- a scenario predicted to lead to the most intensestarbursts, which will therefore come in pairs. the disks have m(dyn) ofseveral x 10^11 msun, and gas fractions of ~40%. velocity dispersions aremodest so the disks are unstable, potentially on scales commensurate with theirradii: these galaxies are undergoing extreme bursts of star formation, notconfined to their nuclei, at close to the eddington limit. their specificstar-formation rates place them ~&gt;5x above the main sequence, which supposedlycomprises large gas disks like these. their high star-formation efficienciesare difficult to reconcile with a simple volumetric star-formation law. n-bodyand dark matter simulations suggest this system is the progenitor of ab(inary)-type ~10^14.6-msun cluster.

1302.5430	a multiwavelength study of the magellanic-type galaxy ngc 4449 - i.  modelling the spectral energy distribution, the ionization structure and the  star formation history	[abridged] we present an integrated photometric spectral energy distribution(sed) of the magellanic-type galaxy ngc 4449 from the far-ultraviolet (uv) tothe submillimetre, including new observations acquired by the herschel spaceobservatory. we include integrated uv photometry from the swift ultraviolet andoptical telescope using a measurement technique which is appropriate forextended sources with coincidence loss. in this paper, we examine the availablemultiwavelength data to infer a range of ages, metallicities and star formationrates for the underlying stellar populations, as well as the composition andthe total mass of dust in ngc 4449.  we present an iterative scheme, which allows us to build an in-depth andmulticomponent representation of ngc 4449 `bottom-up', taking advantage of thebroad capabilities of the photoionization and radiative transfer code mocassin(monte carlo simulations of ionized nebulae). we fit the observed sed, theglobal ionization structure and the emission line intensities, and infer arecent sfr of 0.4 msolar/yr and a total stellar mass of approximately 1e9msolar emitting with a bolometric luminosity of 5.7e9 lsolar. our fits yield atotal dust mass of 2.9e6 msolar including 2 per cent attributed to polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons. we deduce a dust to gas mass ratio of 1/190 within themodelled region. while we do not consider possible additional contributionsfrom even colder dust, we note that including the extended hi envelope and themolecular gas is likely to bring the ratio down to as low as ~ 1/800.

1303.1178	towards understanding the relation between the gas and the attenuation  in galaxies at kpc scales	[abridged]  aims. the aim of the present paper is to provide new and more detailedrelations at the kpc scale between the gas surface density and the face-onoptical depth directly calibrated on galaxies, in order to compute theattenuation not only for semi-analytic models but also observationally as newand upcoming radio observatories are able to trace gas ever farther in theuniverse.  methods. we have selected a sample of 4 nearby resolved galaxies and a sampleof 27 unresolved galaxies from the herschel reference survey and the verynearby galaxies survey, for which we have a large set of multi-wavelength datafrom the fuv to the fir including metallicity gradients for resolved galaxies,along with radio hi and co observations. for each pixel in resolved galaxiesand for each galaxy in the unresolved sample, we compute the face-on opticaldepth from the attenuation determined with the cigale sed fitting code and anassumed geometry. we determine the gas surface density from hi and coobservations with a metallicity-dependent xco factor.  results. we provide new, simple to use, relations to determine the face-onoptical depth from the gas surface density, taking the metallicity intoaccount, which proves to be crucial for a proper estimate. the method used todetermine the gas surface density or the face-on optical depth has littleimpact on the relations except for galaxies that have an inclination over 50d.finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to compute the attenuationpractically from the gas surface density taking into account possibleinformation on the metallicity.  conclusions. examination of the influence of these new relations on simulatedfuv and ir luminosity functions shows a clear impact compared to older oft-usedrelations, which in turn could affect the conclusions drawn from studies basedon large scale cosmological simulations.

1304.3128	star formation &amp; dust heating in the fir bright sources of m83	we investigate star formation and dust heating in the compact fir brightsources detected in the herschel maps of m83. we use the source extraction codegetsources to detect and extract sources in the fir, as well as theirphotometry in the mir and h{\alpha}. by performing infrared sed fitting andapplying an h{\alpha} based star formation rate (sfr) calibration, we derivethe dust masses and temperatures, sfrs, gas masses and star formationefficiencies (sfes). the detected sources lie exclusively on the spiral armsand represent giant molecular associations (gmas), with gas masses and sizes of10^6-10^8 solar masses and 200-300 pc, respectively. the inferred parametersshow little to no radial dependence and there is only a weak correlationbetween the sfrs and gas masses, which suggests that more massive clouds areless efficient at forming stars. dust heating is mainly due to local starformation. however, although the sources are not optically thick, the totalintrinsic young stellar population luminosity can almost completely account forthe dust luminosity. this suggests that other radiation sources contribute tothe dust heating as well and approximately compensate for the unabsorbedfraction of uv light.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1305.2628	an overview of the dwarf galaxy survey	the dwarf galaxy survey (dgs) program is studying low-metallicity galaxiesusing 230h of far-infrared (fir) and submillimetre (submm) photometric andspectroscopic observations of the herschel space observatory and draws to thisa rich database of a wide range of wavelengths tracing the dust, gas and stars.this sample of 50 galaxies includes the largest metallicity range achievable inthe local universe including the lowest metallicity (z) galaxies, 1/50 zsun,and spans 4 orders of magnitude in star formation rates. the survey is designedto get a handle on the physics of the interstellar medium (ism) of lowmetallicity dwarf galaxies, especially on their dust and gas properties and theism heating and cooling processes. the dgs produces pacs and spire maps oflow-metallicity galaxies observed at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mic withthe highest sensitivity achievable to date in the fir and submm. the firfine-structure lines, [cii] 158 mic, [oi] 63 mic, [oi] 145 mic, [oiii] 88 mic,[niii] 57 mic and [nii] 122 and 205 mic have also been observed with the aim ofstudying the gas cooling in the neutral and ionized phases. the spire ftsobservations include many co lines (j=4-3 to j=13-12), [nii] 205 mic and [ci]lines at 370 and 609 mic. this paper describes the sample selection and globalproperties of the galaxies, the observing strategy as well as the vastancillary database available to complement the herschel observations. thescientific potential of the full dgs survey is described with some exampleresults included.

1305.3130	herschel observations of edge-on spirals (heroes). i: far-infrared  morphology and dust mass determination	context. edge-on spiral galaxies with prominent dust lanes provide us with anexcellent opportunity to study the distribution and properties of the dustwithin them. the heroes project was set up to observe a sample of seven largeedge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.  aims. within this first paper, we present the herschel observations andperform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive someglobal properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.  methods. we determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the herschelobservations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.modified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperturephotometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. the latter values arecompared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken fromthe literature.  results. on the whole, our herschel flux measurements agree well witharchival values. we find that the exponential horizontal dust distributionmodel often used in the literature generally provides a good description of theobserved horizontal profiles. three out of the seven galaxies show signaturesof extended vertical emission at 100 and 160 {\mu}m at the 5{\sigma} level, butin two of these it is probably due to deviations from an exactly edge-onorientation. only for ngc 4013, a galaxy in which vertically extended dust hasalready been detected in optical images, we can detect vertically extendeddust, and the derived scaleheight agrees with the value estimated throughradiative transfer modelling. our analysis hints at a correlation between thedust scaleheight and its degree of clumpiness, which we infer from thedifference between the dust masses as calculated from modelling of optical dataand from fitting the spectral energy distribution of herschel datapoints.

1308.4406	herschel-atlas: correlations between dust and gas in local  submm-selected galaxies	we present an analysis of co molecular gas tracers in a sample of500{\mu}m-selected herschel-atlas galaxies at z&lt;0.05 (cz&lt;14990km/s). using22-500{\mu}m photometry from wise, iras and herschel, with hi data from theliterature, we investigate correlations between warm and cold dust, and tracersof the gas in different phases. the correlation between global co(3-2) linefluxes and fir-submillimetre fluxes weakens with increasing ir wavelength({\lambda}&gt;60{\mu}m), as a result of colder dust being less strongly associatedwith dense gas. conversely, co(2-1) and hi line fluxes both appear to be bettercorrelated with longer wavelengths, suggesting that cold dust is more stronglyassociated with diffuse atomic and molecular gas phases, consistent with itbeing at least partially heated by radiation from old stellar populations. theincreased scatter at long wavelengths implies that submillimetre fluxes are apoorer tracer of sfr. fluxes at 22 and 60{\mu}m are also better correlated withdiffuse gas tracers than dense co(3-2), probably due to very-small-grainemission in the diffuse interstellar medium, which is not correlated with sfr.the fir/co luminosity ratio and the dust mass/co luminosity ratio both decreasewith increasing luminosity, as a result of either correlations between mass andmetallicity (changing co/h2) or between co luminosity and excitation [changingco(3-2)/co(1-0)].

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1309.6338	cold dust but warm gas in the unusual elliptical galaxy ngc 4125	data from the herschel space observatory have revealed an unusual ellipticalgalaxy, ngc 4125, which has strong and extended submillimeter emission fromcold dust but only very strict upper limits to its co and hi emission.depending on the dust emissivity, the total dust mass is 2-5x10^6 msun. whilethe neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is extremely low (&lt; 12-30), including theionized gas traced by [cii] emission raises this limit to &lt; 39-100. the dustemission follows a similar r^{1/4} profile to the stellar light and the dust tostellar mass ratio is towards the high end of what is found in nearbyelliptical galaxies. we suggest that ngc 4125 is currently in an unusual phasewhere evolved stars produced in a merger-triggered burst of star formation arepumping large amounts of gas and dust into the interstellar medium. in thisscenario, the low neutral gas-to-dust mass ratio is explained by the gas beingheated to temperatures &gt;= 10^4 k faster than the dust is evaporated. ifgalaxies like ngc 4125, where the far-infrared emission does not trace neutralgas in the usual manner, are common at higher redshift, this could havesignificant implications for our understanding of high redshift galaxies andgalaxy evolution.

1311.1774	the herschel virgo cluster survey xvi: a cluster inventory	herschel fir observations are used to construct virgo cluster galaxyluminosity functions and to show that the cluster lacks the very bright and thenumerous faint sources detected in field galaxy surveys. the far-infrared sedsare fitted to obtain dust masses and temperatures and the dust mass function.the cluster is over dense in dust by about a factor of 100 compared to thefield. the same emissivity (beta) temperature relation applies for differentgalaxies as that found for different regions of m31. we use optical and hi datato show that virgo is over dense in stars and atomic gas by about a factor of100 and 20 respectively. metallicity values are used to measure the mass ofmetals in the gas phase. the mean metallicity is about 0.7 solar and 50% of themetals are in the dust. for the cluster as a whole the mass density of stars ingalaxies is 8 times that of the gas and the gas mass density is 130 times thatof the metals. we use our data to consider the chemical evolution of theindividual galaxies, inferring that the measured variations in effective yieldare due to galaxies having different ages, being affected to varying degrees bygas loss. four galaxy scaling relations are considered: mass-metallicity,mass-velocity, mass-star formation rate and mass-radius - we suggest thatinitial galaxy mass is the prime driver of a galaxy's ultimate destiny.finally, we use x-ray observations and galaxy dynamics to assess the dark andbaryonic matter content compared to the cosmological model.

1401.1017	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xv. planck submillimetre sources in  the virgo cluster	we cross-correlate the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs) with thefully sampled 84 deg2 herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) fields. we searchfor and identify the 857 and 545 ghz pccs sources in the hevics fields bystudying their fir/submm and optical counterparts. we find 84 and 48 compactplanck sources in the hevics fields at 857 and 545 ghz, respectively. almostall sources correspond to individual bright virgo cluster galaxies. the vastmajority of the planck detected galaxies are late-type spirals, with the scclass dominating the numbers, while early-type galaxies are virtually absentfrom the sample, especially at 545 ghz. we compare the hevics spire fluxdensities for the detected galaxies with the four different pccs flux densityestimators and find an excellent correlation with the aperture photometry fluxdensities, even at the highest flux density levels. we find only seven pccssources in the hevics fields without a nearby galaxy as obvious counterpart,and conclude that all of these are dominated by galactic cirrus features or arespurious detections. no planck sources in the hevics fields seem to beassociated to high-redshift proto-clusters of dusty galaxies or strongly lensedsubmm sources. finally, our study is the first empirical confirmation of thesimulation-based estimated completeness of the pccs, and provides a strongsupport of the internal pccs validation procedure.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1402.4524	pacs photometry of the herschel reference survey -  far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours as tracers of dust properties in nearby  galaxies	we present herschel/pacs 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323galaxies in the herschel reference survey (hrs), a k-band-, volume-limitedsample of galaxies in the local universe. once combined with the herschel/spireobservations already available, these data make the hrs the largestrepresentative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the100-500 micron wavelength range. in this paper, we take advantage of thisunique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of thefar-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. weshow that, in the stellar mass range covered by the hrs (8&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;12),the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modifiedblack-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. inparticular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components areneeded, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.we thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a singlemodified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. we show that, whilethe correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formationrate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are muchmore reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observedtrends.

1402.5967	a resolved analysis of cold dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral  ngc 891	we investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-onspiral galaxy ngc 891. high resolution herschel pacs and spire 70, 100, 160,250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with jcmt scuba 850 $\mu$mobservations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energydistribution (sed). maps of the hi 21 cm line and co(j=3-2) emission trace theatomic and molecular hydrogen gas, respectively. we fit one-component modifiedblackbody models to the integrated sed, finding a global dust mass of8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ m$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 k. wealso fit the pixel-by-pixel seds to produce maps of the dust mass andtemperature. the dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellarpopulation as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. the derived dust temperature,which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 k, is found to correlate with the 24$\mu$m emission. allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an averagevalue of $\beta$ = 1.9$\pm$0.3. we confirm an inverse relation between the dustemissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe anyvariation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of thedisk. a comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of theism reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities ofdust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. observedasymmetries in the dust temperature, and the h$_{2}$-to-dust and totalgas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate may bethe result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel starformation in the ne compared to the sw. whilst the asymmetry likely arises fromdust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of thespiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in thene side of the disk.

1403.0589	the herschel fornax cluster survey ii: fir properties of  optically-selected fornax cluster galaxies	the $herschel$ fornax cluster survey (hefocs) is a deep, far-infrared (fir)survey of the fornax cluster. the survey is in 5 $herschel$ bands (100 - 500$\mu$m) and covers an area of 16 deg$^2$ centred on ngc1399. this paperpresents photometry, detection rates, dust masses and temperatures using anoptically selected sample from the fornax cluster catalogue (fcc). our resultsare compared with those previously obtained using data from the $herschel$virgo cluster survey (hevics). in fornax, we detect 30 of the 237 (13%)optically selected galaxies in at least one $herschel$ band. the globaldetection rates are significantly lower than virgo, reflecting themorphological make up of each cluster - fornax has a lower fraction oflate-type galaxies. for galaxies detected in at least 3 bands we fit a modifiedblackbody with a $\beta = 2$ emissivity. detected early-type galaxies (e/s0)have a mean dust mass, temperature, and dust-to-stars ratio of$\log_{10}(&lt;m_{dust}&gt;/\mathrm{m_{\odot}}) = 5.82 \pm 0.20$, $&lt;t_{dust}&gt; = 20.82\pm 1.77$k, and $\log_{10}(m_{dust}/m_{stars}) = -3.87 \pm 0.28$, respectively.late-type galaxies (sa to sd) have a mean dust mass, temperature, anddust-to-stars ratio of $\log_{10}(&lt;m_{dust}&gt;/\mathrm{m_{\odot}}) = 6.54 \pm0.19$, $&lt;t_{dust}&gt; = 17.47 \pm 0.97$k, and $\log_{10}(m_{dust}/m_{stars}) =-2.93 \pm 0.09$, respectively. the different cluster environments seem to havehad little effect on the fir properties of the galaxies and so we conclude thatany environment dependent evolution, has taken place before the cluster wasassembled.

1403.2994	herschel-atlas: properties of dusty massive galaxies at low and high  redshifts	we present a comparison of the physical properties of a rest-frame $250\mu$mselected sample of massive, dusty galaxies from $0&lt;z&lt;5.3$. our sample comprises29 high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs) from the literature, and 843dusty galaxies at $z&lt;0.5$ from the herschel-atlas, selected to have a similarstellar mass to the smgs. the $z&gt;1$ smgs have an average sfr of$390^{+80}_{-70}\,$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ which is 120 times that of thelow-redshift sample matched in stellar mass to the smgs (sfr$=3.3\pm{0.2}$m$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). the smgs harbour a substantial mass of dust($1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times{10}^9\,$m$_\odot$), compared to$(1.6\pm0.1)\times{10}^8\,$m$_\odot$ for low-redshift dusty galaxies. at lowredshifts the dust luminosity is dominated by the diffuse ism, whereas a largefraction of the dust luminosity in smgs originates from star-forming regions.at the same dust mass smgs are offset towards a higher sfr compared to thelow-redshift h-atlas galaxies. this is not only due to the higher gas fractionin smgs but also because they are undergoing a more efficient mode of starformation, which is consistent with their bursty star-formation histories. theoffset in sfr between smgs and low-redshift galaxies is similar to that foundin co studies, suggesting that dust mass is as good a tracer of molecular gasas co.

1403.4272	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga): iv. dust  scaling relations at sub-kpc resolution	the imprints of dust-starlight interactions are visible in scaling relationsbetween stellar characteristics, star formation parameters and dust properties.we aim to examine dust scaling relations on a sub-kpc resolution in theandromeda galaxy (m31) by comparing the properties on a local and global scaleto other galaxies of the local universe. new herschel observations are combinedwith available data from galex, sdss, wise and spitzer to construct a datasetcovering uv to submm wavelengths. we work at the resolution of the spire $500\;\mu$m beam, with pixels corresponding to physical regions of 137 x 608 pc inthe galaxy's disk. a panchromatic spectral energy distribution was modelled foreach pixel and several dust scaling relations are investigated. we find, on asub-kpc scale, strong correlations between $m_d/m_\star$ and nuv-r, and between$m_d/m_\star$ and $\mu_\star$ (the stellar mass surface density). strikingsimilarities with corresponding relations based on integrated galaxies arefound. we decompose m31 in four macro-regions based on their fir morphology;the bulge, inner disk, star forming ring and the outer disk. all regionsclosely follow the galaxy-scale average trends. the specific star formationcharacteristics we derive for these macro-regions give strong hints of aninside-out formation of the bulge-disk geometry, as well as an internaldownsizing process. however, within each macro-region, a great diversity inindividual micro-regions is found. furthermore, we confirm that dust in thebulge of m31 is heated only by the old stellar populations. in general, thelocal dust scaling relations indicate that the dust content in m31 ismaintained by a subtle interplay of past and present star formation. thesimilarity with galaxy-based relations strongly suggests that they are in situcorrelations, with underlying processes that must be local in nature.

1404.0403	the physical characteristics of the gas in the disk of centaurus a using  the herschel space observatory	we search for variations in the disk of centaurus a of the emission fromatomic fine structure lines using herschel pacs and spire spectroscopy. inparticular we observe the [c ii](158 $\mu$m), [n ii](122 and 205 $\mu$m), [oi](63 and 145 $\mu$m) and [o iii](88 $\mu$m) lines, which all play an importantrole in cooling the gas in photo-ionized and photodissociation regions. wedetermine that the ([c ii]+[o i]$_{63}$)/$f_{tir}$ line ratio, a proxy for theheating efficiency of the gas, shows no significant radial trend across theobserved region, in contrast to observations of other nearby galaxies. wedetermine that 10 - 20% of the observed [c ii] emission originates in ionizedgas. comparison between our observations and a pdr model shows that thestrength of the far-ultraviolet radiation field, $g_0$, varies between$10^{1.75}$ and $10^{2.75}$ and the hydrogen nucleus density varies between$10^{2.75}$ and $10^{3.75}$ cm$^{-3}$, with no significant radial trend ineither property. in the context of the emission line properties of thegrand-design spiral galaxy m51 and the elliptical galaxy ngc 4125, the gas incen a appears more characteristic of that in typical disk galaxies rather thanelliptical galaxies.

1404.5676	herschel-atlas: far-infrared properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet  quasars	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars from thefaint im- ages radio sky at twenty-one centimetres (first) and the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7), over the h-atlas phase 1 area(9h, 12h and 14.5h). using a stacking analysis we find a significantcorrelation between the far-infrared luminosity and 1.4-ghz luminosity forradio-loud quasars. partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsiccorrelation after removing the redshift contribution while for radio-quietquasars no partial correlation is found. using a single-temperature grey-bodymodel we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in the case ofradio-loud quasars comparing to radio-quiet quasars. also, radio-loud quasarsare found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift andoptical luminosity bins. in addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at loweroptical luminosities tend to have on average higher fir and 250-micronluminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same opticalluminosites. even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe thefir data, the fir luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.these results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with starformation especially at lower accretion rates.

1406.7649	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) v:  strengthening the case for substantial interstellar grain growth	in this paper we consider the implications of the distributions of dust andmetals in the disc of m31. we derive mean radial dust distributions using adust map created from herschel images of m31 sampling the entire far-infrared(fir) peak. modified blackbodies are fit to approximately 4000 pixels with avarying, as well as a fixed, dust emissivity index (beta). an overall metaldistribution is also derived using data collected from the literature. we use asimple analytical model of the evolution of the dust in a galaxy with dustcontributed by stellar sources and interstellar grain growth, and fit thismodel to the radial dust-to-metals distribution across the galaxy. our analysisshows that the dust-to-gas gradient in m31 is steeper than the metallicitygradient, suggesting interstellar dust growth is (or has been) important inm31. we argue that m31 helps build a case for cosmic dust in galaxies being theresult of substantial interstellar grain growth, while the net dust productionfrom stars may be limited. we note, however, that the efficiency of dustproduction in stars, e.g., in supernovae (sne) ejecta and/or stellaratmospheres, and grain destruction in the interstellar medium (ism) may bedegenerate in our simple model. we can conclude that interstellar grain growthby accretion is likely at least as important as stellar dust productionchannels in building the cosmic dust component in m31.

1409.1815	the identification of dust heating mechanisms in nearby galaxies using  herschel 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness ratios	we examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightnessratios within 24 nearby (&lt;30 mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with theherschel space observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emittingat these wavelengths. the analysis consisted of both qualitative andquantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 micron ratios to h alphaand 24 micron surface brightnesses, which trace the light from star formingregions, and 3.6 micron emission, which traces the light from the older stellarpopulations of the galaxies. we find broad variations in the heating mechanismsfor the dust. in one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at&lt;=160 microns (and in rare cases potentially at &lt;=350 microns) originates fromdust heated by star forming regions. in another subset, we found that theemission at &gt;=250 microns (and sometimes at &gt;=160 microns) originates from dustheated by the older stellar population. in the rest of the sample, either theresults are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contributeequally to the global dust heating. the observed variations in dust heatingmechanisms does not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emissionand radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dusttemperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability indust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.

1409.2499	the temperature dependence of the far-infrared-radio correlation in the  herschel-atlas	we use 10,387 galaxies from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) to probe the far-infrared radio correlation (firc) of starforming galaxies as a function of redshift, wavelength, and effective dusttemperature. all of the sources in our 250 {\mu}m-selected sample havespectroscopic redshifts, as well as 1.4 ghz flux density estimates measuredfrom the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres (first) survey.this enables us to study not only individual sources, but also the averageproperties of the 250 {\mu}m selected population using median stackingtechniques. we find that individual sources detected at $\geq 5\sigma$ in boththe h-atlas and first data have logarithmic flux ratios (i.e. firc $q_\lambda$parameters) consistent with previous studies of the firc. in contrast, thestacked values show larger $q_\lambda$, suggesting excess far-ir fluxdensity/luminosity in 250{\mu}m selected sources above what has been seen inprevious analyses. in addition, we find evidence that 250 {\mu}m sources withwarm dust seds have a larger 1.4 ghz luminosity than the cooler sources in oursample. though we find no evidence for redshift evolution of the monochromaticfirc, our analysis reveals significant temperature dependence. whilst the fircis reasonably constant with temperature at 100 {\mu}m, we find increasinginverse correlation with temperature as we probe longer pacs and spirewavelengths. these results may have important implications for the use ofmonochromatic dust luminosity as a star formation rate indicator instar-forming galaxies, and in the future, for using radio data to determinegalaxy star formation rates.

1410.4502	cross-correlation between the cmb lensing potential measured by planck  and high-z sub-mm galaxies detected by the herschel-atlas survey	we present the first measurement of the correlation between the map of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) lensing potential derived from the\emph{planck} nominal mission data and $z\gtrsim 1.5$ galaxies detected by the\emph{herschel}-atlas (h-atlas) survey covering about $600\,\hbox{deg}^2$, i.e.about 1.4\% of the sky. we reject the hypothesis that there is no correlationbetween cmb lensing and galaxy detection at a $20\,\sigma$ significance,checking the result by performing a number of null tests. the significance ofthe detection of the theoretically expected cross-correlation signal is foundto be $10\,\sigma$. the galaxy bias parameter, $b$, derived from a jointanalysis of the cross-power spectrum and of the auto-power spectrum of thegalaxy density contrast is found to be $b=2.80^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, consistentwith earlier estimates for h-atlas galaxies at similar redshifts. on the otherhand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be a factor $1.62 \pm0.16$ higher than expected from the standard model and also found bycross-correlation analyses with other tracers of the large-scale structure. theenhancement due to lensing magnification can account for only a fraction of theexcess cross-correlation signal. we suggest that part of it may be due to anincomplete removal of the contamination of the cib, that includes the h-atlassources we are cross-correlating with. in any case, the highly significantdetection reported here using a catalog covering only 1.4\% of the skydemonstrates the potential of cmb lensing correlations with submillimetersurveys.

1411.3960	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xviii. star-forming dwarf galaxies in  a cluster environment	to assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different componentsof the interstellar medium, we analyse the fir-submm properties of a sample ofstar-forming dwarf (sfd) galaxies detected by the herschel virgo cluster survey(hevics). we determine dust masses and dust temperatures by fitting a modifiedblack body (mbb) function to the spectral energy distributions (seds). stellarand gas masses, star formation rates (sfrs), and metallicities are obtainedfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. dust is detected in 49 out of 140optically identified dwarfs covered by the hevics field; considering onlydwarfs brighter than $m_b$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. afterevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the fir-submm seds arebest-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $t_d$ = 22.4 k.assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five herschelbands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the mbb model. the excess isinversely correlated with sfr and stellar masses. to study the variations inthe global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we comparethe virgo sfds to other herschel surveys, such as kingfish, the dwarf galaxysurvey (dgs), and the hevics bright galaxy catalogue (bgc). we explore therelations between stellar mass and hi fraction, specific sfr, dust fraction,gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. highly hi-deficientvirgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formationactivity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in clusterdwarfs. however, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less thanthat of the hi component. since the virgo sfds are likely to be crossing thecluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip themore centrally concentrated dust distribution.

1412.7344	the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and  far-infrared dust emission from ngc 2403 and m83	we examine the relation between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission at 8 microns and far-infrared emission from hot dust grains at 24microns and from large dust grains at 160 and 250 microns in the nearby spiralgalaxies ngc 2403 and m83 using data from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory. we find that the pah emission in ngc 2403 is bettercorrelated with emission at 250 microns from dust heated by the diffuseinterstellar radiation field (isrf) and that the 8/250 micron surfacebrightness ratio is well-correlated with the stellar surface brightness asmeasured at 3.6 microns. this implies that the pahs in ngc 2403 are intermixedwith cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) and thatthe pahs are excited by the diffuse isrf. in m83, the pah emission appears morestrongly correlated with 160 micron emission originating from large dust grainsheated by star forming regions. however, the pah emission in m83 is low wherethe 24 micron emission peaks within star forming regions, and enhancements inthe 8/160 micron surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dustand the star forming regions within the spiral arms. this suggests that thepahs observed in the 8 micron band are not excited locally within star formingregions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star formingregions or locally by young, non-photoionising stars that have migrateddownstream from the spiral density waves. the results from just these twogalaxies show that pahs may be excited by different stellar populations indifferent spiral galaxies.

1504.05254	spitzer imaging of strongly-lensed herschel-selected dusty star forming  galaxies	we present the rest-frame optical spectral energy distribution and stellarmasses of six herschel- selected gravitationally lensed dusty, star-forminggalaxies (dsfgs) at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3. these galaxies were first identified withherschel/spire imaging data from the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas) and the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey(hermes). the targets were observed with spitzer/irac at 3.6 and 4.5um. due tothe spatial resolution of the irac observations at the level of 2 arcseconds,the lensing features of a background dsfg in the near-infrared are blended withthe flux from the foreground lensing galaxy in the irac imaging data. we makeuse of higher resolution hubble/wfc3 or keck/nirc2 adaptive optics imaging datato fit light profiles of the foreground lensing galaxy (or galaxies) as a wayto model the foreground components, in order to successfully disentangle theforeground lens and background source flux densities in the irac images. theflux density measurements at 3.6 and 4.5um, once combined with hubble/wfc3 andkeck/nirc2 data, provide important constraints on the rest-frame opticalspectral energy distribution of the herschel-selected lensed dsfgs. we modelthe combined uv- to millimeter-wavelength seds to establish the stellar mass,dust mass, star-formation rate, visual extinction, and other parameters foreach of these herschel-selected dsfgs. these systems have inferred stellarmasses in the range 8 x 10^10 to 4 x 10^11 msun and star-formation rates ofaround 100 msun yr-1. this puts these lensed sub-millimeter systems well abovethe sfr-m* relation observed for normal star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. the high values of sfr inferred for these systems are consistentwith a major merger-driven scenario for star formation.

1504.06111	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics). v. ultraviolet  diffuse emission and cirrus properties in the virgo cluster direction	context: the virgo direction has been observed at many wavelengths in therecent years, in particular in the ultraviolet with galex. the far ultraviolet(fuv) diffuse light detected by galex bears interesting information on thelarge scale distribution of galactic dust, owing to the galex fuv bandsensitivity and resolution. aims: we aim to characterise the ultraviolet largescale distribution of diffuse emission in the virgo direction. a map of thisemission may become useful for various studies by identifying regions wheredust affects observations by either scattering light or absorbing radiation.methods: we construct mosaics of the fuv and near ultraviolet diffuse emissionover a large sky region (ra 12 to 13 hours, dec 0 to 20 degrees) surroundingthe virgo cluster, using all the galex available data in the area. we test forthe first time the utilisation of the fuv diffuse light as a galacticextinction e(b-v) tracer. results: the fuv diffuse light scattered on cirrusreveals details in their geometry. despite a large dispersion, the fuv diffuselight correlates roughly with other galactic dust tracers (coming from iras,herschel, planck), offering an opportunity to use the fuv emission to locatethem in future studies with a better resolution (about 5 arcsec nativeresolution, 20 arcsec pixels maps presented in this paper) than several usualtracers. estimating the galactic dust extinction on the basis of this emissionallows us to find a smaller dispersion in the nuv-i colour of backgroundgalaxies at a given e(b-v)than with other tracers. the diffuse light mosaicsobtained in this work are made publicly available.

1506.05466	h-atlas/gama: quantifying the morphological evolution of the galaxy  population using cosmic calorimetry	using results from the herschel astrophysical terrahertz large-area surveyand the galaxy and mass assembly project, we show that, for galaxy masses aboveapproximately 1.0e8 solar masses, 51% of the stellar mass-density in the localuniverse is in early-type galaxies (etgs: sersic n &gt; 2.5) while 89% of the rateof production of stellar mass-density is occurring in late-type galaxies (ltgs:sersic n &lt; 2.5). from this zero-redshift benchmark, we have used a calorimetrictechnique to quantify the importance of the morphological transformation ofgalaxies over the history of the universe. the extragalactic backgroundradiation contains all the energy generated by nuclear fusion in stars sincethe big bang. by resolving this background radiation into individual galaxiesusing the deepest far-infrared survey with the herschel space observatory and adeep near-infrared/optical survey with the hubble space telescope (hst), andusing measurements of the sersic index of these galaxies derived from the hstimages, we estimate that approximately 83% of the stellar mass-density formedover the history of the universe occurred in ltgs. the difference between thisand the fraction of the stellar mass-density that is in ltgs today impliesthere must have been a major transformation of ltgs into etgs after theformation of most of the stars.

1507.04447	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the effect of close interactions on  star formation in galaxies	the modification of star formation (sf) in galaxy interactions is a complexprocess, with sf observed to be both enhanced in major mergers and suppressedin minor pair interactions. such changes likely to arise on short timescalesand be directly related to the galaxy-galaxy interaction time. here weinvestigate the link between dynamical phase and direct measures of sf ondifferent timescales for pair galaxies, targeting numerous star-formation rate(sfr) indicators and comparing to pair separation, individual galaxy mass andpair mass ratio. we split our sample into the higher (primary) and lower(secondary) mass galaxies in each pair and find that sf is indeed enhanced inall primary galaxies but suppressed in secondaries of minor mergers. we findthat changes in sf of primaries is consistent in both major and minor mergers,suggesting that sf in the more massive galaxy is agnostic to pair mass ratio.we also find that sf is enhanced/suppressed more strongly for short-timeduration sfr indicators (e.g. h-alpha), highlighting recent changes to sf inthese galaxies, which are likely to be induced by the interaction. we propose ascenario where the lower mass galaxy has its sf suppressed by gas heating orstripping, while the higher mass galaxy has its sf enhanced, potentially bytidal gas turbulence and shocks. this is consistent with the seeminglycontradictory observations for both sf suppression and enhancement in closepairs.

1511.07430	the bolometric and uv attenuation in normal spiral galaxies of the  herschel reference survey	the dust in nearby galaxies absorbs a fraction of theuv-optical-near-infrared radiation produced by stars. this energy isconsequently re-emitted in the infrared. we investigate the portion of thestellar radiation absorbed by spiral galaxies from the hrs by modelling theiruv-to-submillimetre spectral energy distributions. our models provide anattenuated and intrinsic sed from which we find that on average 32 % of allstarlight is absorbed by dust. we define the uv heating fraction as thepercentage of dust luminosity that comes from absorbed uv photons and find thatthis is 56 %, on average. this percentage varies with morphological type, withlater types having significantly higher uv heating fractions. we find a strongcorrelation between the uv heating fraction and specific star formation rateand provide a power-law fit. our models allow us to revisit the irx-afuvrelations, and derive these quantities directly within a self-consistentframework. we calibrate this relation for different bins of nuv-r colour andprovide simple relations to relate these parameters. we investigated therobustness of our method and we conclude that the derived parameters arereliable within the uncertainties which are inherent to the adopted sed model.this calls for a deeper investigation on how well extinction and attenuationcan be determined through panchromatic sed modelling.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.
