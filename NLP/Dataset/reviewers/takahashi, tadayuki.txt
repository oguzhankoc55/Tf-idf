0901.0419	modeling and reproducibility of suzaku hxd pin/gso background	suzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) achieved the lowest background level thanany other previously or currently operational missions sensitive in the energyrange of 10--600 kev, by utilizing pin photodiodes and gso scintillatorsmounted in the bgo active shields to reject particle background andcompton-scattered events as much as possible. because it does not have imagingcapability nor rocking mode for the background monitor, the sensitivity islimited by the reproducibility of the non x-ray background (nxb) model. wemodeled the hxd nxb, which varies with time as well as other satellites with alow-earth orbit, by utilizing several parameters, including particle monitorcounts and satellite orbital/attitude information. the model background issupplied as an event file in which the background events are generated byrandom numbers, and can be analyzed in the same way as the real data. thereproducibility of the nxb model depends on the event selection criteria (suchas cut-off rigidity and energy band) and the integration time, and the 1sigmasystematic error is estimated to be less than 3% (pin 15--40 kev) and 1% (gso50--100 kev) for more than 10 ksec exposure.

0904.1064	long-term stability of non-thermal x-ray modulation in the gamma-ray  binary ls 5039	we report on long-term stability of x-ray modulation apparently synchronizedwith an orbital period of 3.9 days in the gamma-ray binary ls 5039. recentobservations with the suzaku satellite in the year 2007, which coveredcontinuously more than one orbital period, have provided us with detailedcharacterization of x-ray flux and spectral shape as a function of orbitalphase. motivated by the results from suzaku, we have re-analyzed the x-ray dataobtained with asca, xmm-newton, and chandra between 1999 and 2005, toinvestigate long-term behavior of ls 5039 in the x-ray band.  we found that the modulation curves in 1999--2007 are surprisingly stable.even fine structures in the light curves such as spikes and dips are found tobe quite similar from one orbit to another. the spectral characteristicsobserved in the past are consistent with those seen with suzaku for someorbital phase segments. we suggest that magneto-hydrodynamical collisionsbetween the relativistic outflow from a compact object and the stellar windfrom the o star explain the clock-like non-thermal x-ray emission over eightyears through remarkably stable production of high-energy particles near thebinary system.

0904.1238	suzaku observations of psr b1259-63: a new manifestation of relativistic  pulsar wind	we observed psr b1259-63, a young non-accreting pulsar orbiting around a bestar ss 2883, eight times with the suzaku satellite in 2007, to characterizethe x-ray emission arising from the interaction between a pulsar relativisticwind and be star outflows. the x-ray spectra showed a featureless continuum in0.6-10 kev, modeled by a power law with a wide range of photon index 1.3-1.8.when combined with the suzaku pin detector which allowed spectral analysis inthe hard 15-50 kev band, x-ray spectra show a break at 5 kev in a certainepoch. regarding the system as a compactified pulsar wind nebula, in which e+e-pairs are assumed to be accelerated at the inner shock front of the pulsarwind, we attribute the x-ray spectral break to the low-energy cutoff of thesynchrotron radiation associated with the lorentz factor of the relativisticpulsar wind gamma_1 = 4x10^5. our result indicates that comptonization ofstellar photons by the unshocked pulsar wind will be accessible (or tightlyconstrained) by observations with the fermi gamma-ray space telescope duringthe next periastron passage. the psr b1259-63 system allows us to probe thefundamental properties of the pulsar wind by a direct means, beingcomplementary to the study of large-scale pulsar wind nebulae.

0905.0698	suzaku wide band analysis of the x-ray variability of tev blazar mrk 421  in 2006	we present the results of x-ray observations of the well-studied tev blazarmrk 421 with the suzaku satellite in 2006 april 28. during the observation, mrk421 was undergoing a large flare and the x-ray flux was variable, decreasing by~ 50 %, from 7.8x10^{-10} to 3.7x10^{-10} erg/s/cm^2 in about 6 hours, followedby an increase by ~ 35 %. thanks to the broad bandpass coupled withhigh-sensitivity of suzaku, we measured the evolution of the spectrum over the0.4--60 kev band in data segments as short as ~1 ksec. the data show deviationsfrom a simple power law model, but also a clear spectral variability. thetime-resolved spectra are fitted by a synchrotron model, where the observedspectrum is due to a exponentially cutoff power law distribution of electronsradiating in uniform magnetic field; this model is preferred over a brokenpower law. as another scenario, we separate the spectrum into "steady" and"variable" components by subtracting the spectrum in the lowest-flux periodfrom those of other data segments. in this context, the difference ("variable")spectra are all well described by a broken power law model with photon indexgamma ~ 1.6, breaking at energy epsilon_{brk} ~ 3 kev to another photon indexgamma ~ 2.1 above the break energy, differing from each other only bynormalization, while the spectrum of the "steady" component is best describedby the synchrotron model. we suggest the rapidly variable component is due torelatively localized shock (fermi i) acceleration, while the slowly variable("steady") component is due to the superposition of shocks located at largerdistance along the jet, or due to other acceleration process, such as thestochastic acceleration on magnetic turbulence (fermi ii) in the more extendedregion.

0707.2425	wide-band spectroscopy of the compton thick seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3 with  suzaku	we obtained a wide-band spectrum of the compton-thick seyfert 2 galaxy mrk 3with suzaku. the observed spectrum was clearly resolved into weak, softpower-law emission, a heavily absorbed power-law component, cold reflection,and many emission lines. the heavily absorbed component, absorbed by gas with acolumn density of 1.1x10^24 cm^-2, has an intrinsic 2--10 kev luminosity of~1.6x10^43 erg s^-1, and is considered to be direct emission from the mrk 3nucleus. the reflection component was interpreted as reflection of the directlight off cold, thick material; the reflection fraction $r$ was 1.36+/-0.20.the cold material is inferred to be located &gt; 1 pc from the central black holeof mrk 3 due to the low ionization parameter of iron (xi &lt; 1 erg cm s^-1) andthe narrow iron line width (s &lt; 22 ev). a compton shoulder to the iron line wasdetected, but the intensity of the shoulder component was less than thatexpected from spherically distributed compton-thick material. the weak, softpower-law emission is considered to be scattered light by ionized gas. theexistence of many highly-ionized lines from o, ne, mg, si, s, and fe in theobserved spectrum indicates that the ionized gas has a broad ionized structure,with xi=10--1000. the scattering fraction with respect to the direct light wasestimated to be 0.9+/-0.2%, which indicates that the column density of thescattering region is about 3.6x10^22 cm^-2. this high-quality spectrum obtainedby suzaku can be considered a template for studies of seyfert 2 galaxies.

0707.3867	low/hard state spectra of gro j1655-40 observed with suzaku	the galactic black-hole binary gro j1655$-$40 was observed with suzaku on2005 september 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) and 20 ks with the hard x-ray detector (hxd). the source wasdetected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 kev, with anintensity of $\sim$50 mcrab at 20 kev. at a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300kev luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of theeddington luminosity for a 6 $m_{\odot}$ black hole). the source was in atypical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photonindex of $\sim 1.6$. during the observation, the source intensity graduallydecreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ kev, and by 35% below 2 kev. this,together with the soft x-ray spectra taken with the xis, suggests the presenceof an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from acool ($\sim 0.2$ kev) disk. the hard x-ray spectra obtained with the hxd reveala high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ kev.since the spectral photon index above 10 kev is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than thatobserved in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher thanthose of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 kev spectrum cannot bereproduced by a single thermal comptonization model, even consideringreflection effects. instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can besuccessfully explained by invoking two thermal-comptonization components withdifferent $y$-parameters. in contrast to the high/soft state spectra of thisobject in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalentwidths of 60--100 ev, the present xis spectra bear no such features beyond anupper-limit equivalent width of 25 ev.

0708.2002	measuring the broad-band x-ray spectrum from 400 ev to 40 kev in the  southwest part of the supernova remnant rx j1713.7-3946	we report on results from suzaku broadband x-ray observations of thesouthwest part of the galactic supernova remnant (snr) rx j1713.7-3946 with anenergy coverage of 0.4-40 kev. the x-ray spectrum, presumably of synchrotronorigin, is known to be completely lineless, making this snr ideally suited fora detailed study of the x-ray spectral shape formed through efficient particleacceleration at high speed shocks. with a sensitive hard x-ray measurement fromthe hxd pin on board suzaku, we determine the hard x-ray spectrum in the 12--40kev range to be described by a power law with photon index gamma = 3.2+/- 0.2,significantly steeper than the soft x-ray index of gamma = 2.4+/- 0.05 measuredpreviously with asca and other missions. we find that a simple power law failsto describe the full spectral range of 0.4-40 kev and instead a power-law withan exponential cutoff with hard index gamma = 1.50+/- 0.09 and high-energycutoff epsilon_c = 1.2+/- 0.3 kev formally provides an excellent fit over thefull bandpass. if we use the so-called srcut model, as an alternative model, itgives the best-fit rolloff energy of epsilon_{roll} = 0.95+/- 0.04 kev.together with the tev gamma-ray spectrum ranging from 0.3 to 100 tev obtainedrecently by hess observations, our suzaku observations of rx j1713.7-3946provide stringent constraints on the highest energy particles accelerated in asupernova shock.

0708.3968	spectral evolution of grb 060904a observed with swift and suzaku --  possibility of inefficient electron acceleration	we observed an x-ray afterglow of grb 060904a with the swift and suzakusatellites. we found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phaseand the decline phase of an x-ray flare in the bat and xrt data. the observedspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\gamma= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundredseconds in the prompt tail. this is one of the steepest x-ray spectra everobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron accelerationand synchrotron radiation. then, we applied an alternative spectral fittingusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (bpec) model. it is valid toconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotronfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. sincethe spectral cutoff appears in the soft x-ray band, we conclude the electronacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of grb 060904a. thesecutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tailphase to the shallow decay one. after that, typical afterglow spectra with thephoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both xrt andsuzaku/xis up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. we could successfullytrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energyand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\propto t^{-3} \simt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. this factindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completelydifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. therefore we conclude theemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.

1507.02442	time-dependent modeling of gamma-ray flares in blazar pks1510-089	here we present a new approach for constraining luminous blazars,incorporating fully time-dependent and self-consistent modeling of brightgamma-ray flares of pks1510-089 resolved with fermi-lat, in the framework ofthe internal shock scenario. the results of our modeling imply the location ofthe gamma-ray flaring zone outside of the broad-line region, namely around0.3pc from the core for a free-expanding jet with the opening angle gamma,\theta_\mathrm{jet} \simeq 1 (where gamma is the jet bulk lorentz factor), upto \simeq 3pc for a collimated outflow with gamma, \theta_\mathrm{jet} \simeq0.1. moreover, under the gamma, \theta_\mathrm{jet} \simeq 1 condition, ourmodeling indicates the maximum efficiency of the jet production during theflares, with the total jet energy flux strongly dominated by protons andexceeding the available accretion power in the source. this is in contrast tothe quiescence states of the blazar, characterized by lower jet kinetic powerand an approximate energy equipartition between different plasma constituents.we demostrate how strictly simultaneous observations of flaring pks1510-089 atoptical, x-ray, and gev photon energies on hourly timescales, augmented byextensive simulations as presented in this paper, may help to impose furtherprecise constraints on the magnetization and opening angle of the emittingregion. our detailed modeling implies in addition that a non-uniformity of thedoppler factor across the jet, caused by the radial expansion of the outflow,may lead to a pronounced time distortion in the observed gamma-ray lightcurves, resulting in particular in asymmetric flux profiles with substantiallyextended decay phases.

1509.00588	the si/cdte semiconductor compton camera of the astro-h soft gamma-ray  detector (sgd)	the soft gamma-ray detector (sgd) is one of the instrument payloads onboardastro-h, and will cover a wide energy band (60--600 kev) at a background level10 times better than instruments currently in orbit. the sgd achieves lowbackground by combining a compton camera scheme with a narrow field-of-viewactive shield. the compton camera in the sgd is realized as a hybridsemiconductor detector system which consists of silicon and cadmium telluride(cdte) sensors. the design of the sgd compton camera has been finalized and thefinal prototype, which has the same configuration as the flight model, has beenfabricated for performance evaluation. the compton camera has overalldimensions of 12 cm x 12 cm x 12 cm, consisting of 32 layers of si pixelsensors and 8 layers of cdte pixel sensors surrounded by 2 layers of cdte pixelsensors. the detection efficiency of the compton camera reaches about 15% and3% for 100 kev and 511 kev gamma rays, respectively. the pixel pitch of the siand cdte sensors is 3.2 mm, and the signals from all 13312 pixels are processedby 208 asics developed for the sgd. good energy resolution is afforded bysemiconductor sensors and low noise asics, and the obtained energy resolutionswith the prototype si and cdte pixel sensors are 1.0--2.0 kev (fwhm) at 60 kevand 1.6--2.5 kev (fwhm) at 122 kev, respectively. this results in goodbackground rejection capability due to better constraints on comptonkinematics. compton camera energy resolutions achieved with the final prototypeare 6.3 kev (fwhm) at 356 kev and 10.5 kev (fwhm) at 662 kev, respectively,which satisfy the instrument requirements for the sgd compton camera (betterthan 2%). moreover, a low intrinsic background has been confirmed by thebackground measurement with the final prototype.

1509.07668	the first demonstration of the concept of "narrow-fov si/cdte  semiconductor compton camera"	the soft gamma-ray detector (sgd), to be deployed onboard the {\it astro-h}satellite, has been developed to provide the highest sensitivity observationsof celestial sources in the energy band of 60-600~kev by employing a detectorconcept which uses a compton camera whose field-of-view is restricted by a bgoshield to a few degree (narrow-fov compton camera). in this concept, thebackground from outside the fov can be heavily suppressed by constraining theincident direction of the gamma ray reconstructed by the compton camera to beconsistent with the narrow fov. we, for the first time, demonstrate thevalidity of the concept using background data taken during the thermal vacuumtest and the low-temperature environment test of the flight model of sgd onground. we show that the measured background level is suppressed to less than10\% by combining the event rejection using the anti-coincidence trigger of theactive bgo shield and by using compton event reconstruction techniques. morethan 75\% of the signals from the field-of-view are retained against thebackground rejection, which clearly demonstrates the improvement ofsignal-to-noise ratio. the estimated effective area of 22.8~cm$^2$ meets themission requirement even though not all of the operational parameters of theinstrument have been fully optimized yet.

0806.1490	study of nonthermal emission from snr rx j1713.7-3946 with suzaku	we present results obtained from a series of observations of the supernovaremnant rx j1713.7-3946 by the suzaku satellite. the observations cover abouttwo-thirds of the remnant surface. we successfully detected hard x-rays up to ~40 kev from each pointing. the hard x-ray spectra are described by power-lawfunctions with photon indices of ~ 3.0, which are larger than those in theenergy region below 10 kev. connection of the spatially-integrated xis and hxdspectra clearly reveals a spectral cutoff in the 0.4--40 kev x-ray spectrum.this cutoff is interpreted to correspond to the maximum acceleration energy ofelectrons emitting synchrotron radiation. the wide-band coverage of suzaku forthe first time allows us to derive the parent electron spectrum in the cutoffregion, which shows good agreement with theoretical predictions. the inferredcutoff energy in the spatially-integrated x-ray spectrum indicates thatparticle acceleration in the remnant is so efficient that it is almost at thetheoretical limit, the so-called bohm limit. based on the suzaku data, wepresent results of multi-wavelength studies from spectral and morphologicalpoints of view. the spectral energy distribution favors the hadronic scenariorather than the leptonic scenario. for the morphology studies, we compare thesurface brightness maps from the suzaku xis and the h.e.s.s. telescope. weconfirm the strong correlation between x-ray and tev gamma-ray emission. inaddition to the correlation, we found that in the bright western rim regionsthe x-ray emission is brighter than expected from the general x-ray togamma-ray correlation.

1512.04300	suzaku spectra of a type ii supernova remnant kes 79	this paper reports results of a suzaku observation of the supernova remnant(snr) kes 79 (g33.6+0.1). the x-ray spectrum is best fitted by atwo-temperature model: a non-equilibrium ionization (nei) plasma and acollisional ionization equilibrium (cie) plasma. the nei plasma is spatiallyconfined within the inner radio shell with kt~0.8 kev, while the cie plasma isfound in more spatially extended regions associated with the outer radio shellwith kt~0.2 kev and solar abundance. therefore, the nei plasma is attributableto the sn ejecta and the cie plasma is forward shocked interstellar medium. inthe nei plasma, we discovered k-shell line of al, ar and ca for the first time.the abundance pattern and estimated mass of the ejecta are consistent with thecore-collapse supernova explosion of a ~30-40 solar mass progenitor star. an feline with center energy of ~6.4 kev is also found in the southeast (se) portionof the snr, a close peripheral region around dense molecular clouds. onepossibility is that the line is associated with the ejecta. however, thecentroid energy of ~6.4 kev and the spatial distribution of enhancement nearthe se peripheral do not favor this scenario. since the ~6.4 kev emittingregion coincides to the molecular clouds, we propose another possibility thatthe fe line is due to k-shell ionization of neutral fe by the interaction oflocally accelerated protons (lecrp) with the surrounding molecular cloud. boththese possibilities, heated ejecta or lecrp origin, are discussed based on theobservational facts.

astro-ph;0104079	x-ray probing of the central regions of clusters of galaxies	results of asca x-ray study of central regions of medium-richness clusters ofgalaxies are summarized, emphasizing differences between cd and non-cdclusters. the intra-cluster medium (icm) is likely to consist of two (hot andcool) phases within $\sim 100$ kpc of a cd galaxy, where the icm metallicity isalso enhanced. in contrast, the icm in non-cd clusters appears to be isothermalwith little metallicity gradient right to the center. the gravitationalpotential exhibits a hierarchical nesting around cd galaxies, while a totalmass-density profile with a central cusp is indicated for a non-cd clusterabell~1060. the iron-mass-to-light ratio of the icm decreases toward the centerin both types of clusters, although it is radially constant in peripheralregions. the silicon-to-iron abundance ratio in the icm increases with thecluster richness, but remains close to the solar ratio around cd galaxies.these overall results are interpreted without appealing to the popularcooling-flow hypothesis. instead, an emphasis is put on the halo-in-halostructure formed around cd galaxies.

astro-ph;0105022	characteristic x-ray variability of tev blazars: probing the link  between the jet and the central engine	we have studied the rapid x-ray variability of three extragalactic tevgamma-ray sources; mrk 421, mrk 501 and pks 2155-304. analyzing the x-ray lightcurves obtained from asca and/or rxte observations between 1993 and 1998, wehave investigated the variability in the time domain from 10^3 to 10^8 sec. forall three sources, both the power spectrum density (psd) and the structurefunction (sf) show a roll-over with a time-scale of the order of 1 day orlonger, which may be interpreted as the typical time-scale of successive flareevents. although the exact shape of turn-over is not well constrained and thelow-frequency (long time-scale) behavior is still unclear, the high-frequency(short time-scale) behavior is clearly resolved. we found that, on time-scalesshorter than 1 day, there is only small power in the variability, as indicatedby a steep power spectrum density of f^{-2~-3}. this is very different fromother types of mass-accreting black-hole systems for which the short time-scalevariability is well characterized by a fractal, flickering-noise psd(f^{-1~-2}). the steep psd index and the characteristic time-scale of flaresimply that the x-ray emitting site in the jet is of limited spatial extent; d &gt;10^{17} cm distant from the base of the jet, which corresponds to &gt; 100schwarzschild radii for 10^{7-10} m_solar black-hole systems.

astro-ph;0108310	variability time scales of tev blazars observed in the asca continuous  long-look x-ray monitoring	three uninterrupted, long (lasting respectively 7, 10, and 10 days) ascaobservations of the well-studied tev-bright blazars mrk 421, mrk 501 and pks2155-304 all show continuous strong x-ray flaring. despite the relatively faintintensity states in 2 of the 3 sources, there was no identifiable quiescentperiod in any of the observations. structure function analysis shows that allblazars have a characteristic time scale of ~ a day, comparable to therecurrence time and to the time scale of the stronger flares. on the otherhand, examination of these flares in more detail reveals that each of thestrong flares is not a smooth increase and decrease, but exhibits substructuresof shorter flares having time scales of ~10 ks. we verify via simulations thatin order to explain the observed structure function, these shorter flares("shots") are unlikely to be fully random, but in some way are correlated witheach other. the energy dependent cross-correlation analysis shows thatinter-band lags are not universal in tev blazars. this is important since inthe past, only positive detections of lags were reported. in this work, wedetermine that the sign of a lag may differ from flare to flare; significantlags of both signs were detected from several flares, while no significant lagwas detected from others. however, we also argue that the nature of theunderlying component can affect these values. the facts that all flares arenearly symmetric and that fast variability shorter than the characteristic timescale is strongly suppressed, support the scenario where the light crossingtime dominates the variability time scales of the day-scale flares.

astro-ph;0202414	asca view of the supernova remnant gamma cygni (g78.2+2.1):  bremsstrahlung x-ray spectrum from loss-flattened electron distribution	we perform x-ray studies of the shell-type supernova remnant (snr)gamma-cygni associated with the brightest egret unidentified source 3egj2020+4017. in addition to the thermal emissions with characteristictemperature of kt = 0.5-0.9 kev, we found an extremely hard x-ray componentfrom several clumps localized in the northern part of the remnant. thiscomponent is described by a power-law with a photon index of 0.8-1.5. both theabsolute flux and the spectral shape of the nonthermal x-rays cannot beexplained by the synchrotron or inverse-compton mechanisms. we argue that theunusually hard x-ray spectrum can be naturally interpreted in terms ofnonthermal bremsstrahlung from coulomb-loss-flattened electron distribution indense environs with the gas density about 10 to 100 cm^-3 . for given spectrumof the electron population, the ratio of the bremsstrahlung x- and gamma-rayfluxes depends on the position of the ``coulomb break'' in the electronspectrum. the bulk of gamma-rays detected by egret would come from theradio-bright and x-ray dim cloud at southeast, where very dense gas and strongmagnetic field would illuminate the cloud in the radio and gamma-ray bands, butsuppress the bremsstrahlung x-ray emission due to the shift of the ``coulombbreak'' in the electron spectrum towards higher energies.

astro-ph;0210214	implications of variability patterns observed in tev blazars on the  structure of the inner jet	the recent long look x-ray observations of tev blazars have revealed manyimportant new features concerning their time variability. in this paper, wesuggest a physical interpretation for those features based on the framework ofthe internal and external shock scenarios. we present a simplified modelapplicable to tev blazars, and investigate through simulations how each of themodel parameters would affect to the observed light curve or spectrum. inparticular, we show that the internal shock scenario naturally leads to all theobserved variability properties including the structure function, but for it tobe applicable, the fractional fluctuation of the initial bulk lorentz factorsmust be small, with sigma_gamma / gamma_average &lt; 0.01. this implies very lowdynamical efficiency of the internal shock scenario. we also suggest thatseveral observational quantities -- such as the characteristic time scale, therelative amplitude of flares as compared to the steady (``offset'') component,and the slope of the structure function -- can be used to probe the inner jet.the results are applied to the tev blazar mrk421, and this, within the contextof the model, leads to the determination of several physical parameters: theejection of a shell with average thickness of ~1e13 cm occurs on average every10 minutes, and the shells collide ~1e17 cm away from the central source.

astro-ph;0608310	discovery of a possible x-ray counterpart to hess j1804-216	suzaku deep observations have discovered two highly significant nonthermalx-ray sources, suzaku j1804$-$2142 (src 1) and suzaku j1804$-$2140 (src 2),positionally coincident with the unidentified tev $\gamma$-ray source, hessj1804$-$216. the x-ray sources are not time variable and show no counterpart inother wavebands, except for the tev source. src 1 is unresolved at suzakuspatial resolution, whereas src 2 is extended or composed of multiple sources.the x-ray spectra are highly absorbed, hard, and featureless, and are wellfitted by absorbed power-law models with best-fit photon indices and absorptioncolumns of $-0.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ and $0.2_{-0.2}^{+2.0}\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$for src 1, and $1.7_{-1.0}^{+1.4}$ and $1.1_{-0.6}^{+1.0}\times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$ for src 2. the measured x-ray absorption to the latter source issignificantly larger than the total galactic neutral hydrogen column in thatdirection. the unabsorbed 2--10 kev band luminosities are $7.5\times10^{32}(d/{\rm 5 kpc})^2$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (src 1) and $1.3\times 10^{33}(d/{\rm 5kpc})^2$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (src 2), where $d$ is the source distance. among thehandful of tev sources with known x-ray counterparts, hess j1804$-$216 has thelargest ratio of tev $\gamma$-ray to hard x-ray fluxes. we discuss the natureof the emission and propose the suzaku sources as plausible counterparts to thetev source, although further observations are necessary to confirm this.

astro-ph;0609215	iron and nickel line diagnostics for the galactic center diffuse  emission	we have observed the diffuse x-ray emission from the galactic center (gc)using the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) on suzaku. the high-energyresolution and the low-background orbit provide excellent spectra of the gcdiffuse x-rays (gcdx). the xis found many emission lines in the gcdx near theenergy of k-shell transitions of iron and nickel. the most pronounced featuresare fei k alpha at 6.4 kev and k-shell absorption edge at 7.1 kev, which arefrom neutral and/or low ionization states of iron, and the k-shell lines at 6.7kev and 6.9 kev from he-like (fexxv k alpha) and hydrogenic (fexxvi ly alpha)ions of iron. in addition, k alpha lines from neutral or low ionization nickel(nii k alpha) and he-like nickel (nixxvii k alpha), and fei k beta, fexxv kbeta, fexxvi ly beta, fexxv k gamma and fexxvi ly gamma are detected for thefirst time. the line center energies and widths of fexxv k alpha and fexxvi lyalpha favor a collisional excitation (ce) plasma for the origin of the gcdx.the electron temperature determined from the line flux ratio of fexxv k alpha /fexxv k beta is similar to the ionization temperature determined from that offexxv k alpha /fexxvi ly alpha. thus it would appear that the gcdx plasma isclose to ionization equilibrium. the 6.7 kev flux and temperature distributionto the galactic longitude is smooth and monotonic,in contrast to the integratedpoint source flux distribution. these facts support the hypothesis that thegcdx is truly diffuse emission rather than the integration of the outputs of alarge number of unresolved point sources. in addition, our results demonstratethat the chemical composition of fe in the interstellar gas near the gc isconstrained to be about 3.5 times solar.

astro-ph;0609581	precision fe kalpha and fe kbeta line spectroscopy of the seyfert 1.9  galaxy ngc 2992 with suzaku	we present detailed time-averaged x-ray spectroscopy in the 0.5--10 kev bandof the seyfert~1.9 galaxy ngc 2992 with the suzaku x-ray imaging spectrometers(xis). we model the complex continuum in detail. there is an fe k line emissioncomplex that we model with broad and narrow lines and we show that theintensities of the two components are decoupled at a confidence level &gt;3sigma.the broad fe k line has an ew of 118 (+32,-61) ev and could originate in anaccretion disk (with inclination angle greater than ~30 degrees). the narrow fekalpha line has an ew of 163 (+47,-26) ev and is unresolved fwhm &lt;4090 km/s)and likely originates in distant matter. the absolute flux in the narrow lineimplies that the column density out of the line-of-sight could be much higherthan measured in the line-of-sight, and that the mean (historically-averaged)continuum luminosity responsible for forming the line could be a factor ofseveral higher than that measured from the data. we also detect the narrow fekbeta line with a high signal-to-noise ratio and describe a new robust methodto constrain the ionization state of fe responsible for the fe kalpha and fekbeta lines that does not require any knowledge of possible gravitational anddoppler energy shifts affecting the line energies. for the distantline-emitting matter (e.g. the putative obscuring torus) we deduce that thepredominant ionization state is lower than fe viii (at 99% confidence),conservatively taking into account residual calibration uncertainties in thexis energy scale and theoretical and experimental uncertainties in the fe kfluorescent line energies. from the limits on a possible compton-reflectioncontinuum it is likely that the narrow fe kalpha and fe kbeta lines originatein a compton-thin structure.

astro-ph;0610391	a suzaku observation of the low-ionization fe-line emission from rcw 86	the newly operational x-ray satellite suzaku observed the southwesternquadrant of the supernova remnant (snr) rcw 86 in february 2006 to study thenature of the 6.4 kev emission line first detected with the advanced satellitefor cosmology and astronomy (asca). the new data confirm the existence of theline, localizing it for the first time; most of the line emission is adjacentand interior to the forward shock and not at the locus of the continuum hardemission. we also report the first detection of a 7.1 kev line that weinterpret as the k-beta emission from low-ionization iron. the fe-k linefeatures are consistent with a non-equilibrium plasma of fe-rich ejecta withn_{e}t &lt;~ 10^9 cm^-3 s and kt_{e} ~ 5 kev. this combination of low n_{e}t andhigh kt_{e} suggests collisionless electron heating in an snr shock. the fek-alpha line shows evidence for intrinsic broadening, with a width of 47(34--59) ev (99% error region). the difference of the spatial distributions ofthe hard continuum above 3 kev and the fe-k line emission support a synchrotronorigin for the hard continuum.

astro-ph;0610434	revealing the high energy emission from the obscured seyfert galaxy mcg  -5-23-16 with suzaku	we report on a 100 ks suzaku observation of the bright, nearby (z=0.008486)seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg -5-23-16. the broad-band (0.4-100 kev) x-ray spectrumallows us to determine the nature of the high energy emission with littleambiguity. the x-ray continuum consists of a cutoff power-law of photon index$\gamma=1.9$, absorbed through compton-thin matter of column density $n_{\rmh}=1.6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. a soft excess is observed below 1 kev and islikely a combination of emission from scattered continuum photons and distantphotoionized gas. the iron k line profile is complex, showing narrow neutraliron k$\alpha$ and k$\beta$ emission, as well as a broad line which can bemodeled by a moderately inclined accretion disk. the line profile shows eitherthe disk is truncated at a few tens of gravitational radii, or the diskemissivity profile is relatively flat. a strong compton reflection component isdetected above 10 kev, which is best modeled by a combination of reflection offdistant matter and the accretion disk. the reflection component does not appearto vary. the overall picture is that this seyfert 1.9 galaxy is viewed atmoderate (50 degrees) inclination through compton-thin matter at the edge of acompton-thick torus covering $2\pi$ steradians, consistent with unified models.

astro-ph;0612754	probing the disk-jet connection of the radio galaxy 3c120 observed with  suzaku	broad line radio galaxies (blrgs) are a rare type of radio-loud agn, in whichthe broad optical permitted emission lines have been detected in addition tothe extended jet emission. here we report on deep (40ksec x4) observations ofthe bright blrg 3c~120 using suzaku. the observations were spaced a week apart,and sample a range of continuum fluxes. an excellent broadband spectrum wasobtained over two decades of frequency (0.6 to 50 kev) within each 40 ksecexposure. we clearly resolved the iron k emission line complex, finding that itconsists of a narrow k_a core (sigma ~ 110 ev or an ew of 60 ev), a 6.9 kevline, and an underlying broad iron line. our confirmation of the broad linecontrasts with the xmm-newton observation in 2003, where the broad line was notrequired. the most natural interpretation of the broad line is iron k lineemission from a face-on accretion disk which is truncated at ~10 r_g. above 10kev, a relatively weak compton hump was detected (reflection fraction of r ~0.6), superposed on the primary x-ray continuum of gamma ~ 1.75. thanks to thegood photon statistics and low background of the suzaku data, we clearlyconfirm the spectral evolution of 3c120, whereby the variability amplitudedecreases with increasing energy. more strikingly, we discovered that thevariability is caused by a steep power-law component of gamma ~2.7, possiblyrelated to the non-thermal jet emission. we discuss our findings in the contextof similarities and differences between radio-loud/quiet objects.

astro-ph;9903099	x-ray observations of tev blazars and multi-frequency analysis	the non-thermal spectra of blazars, observed from radio to gev/tevgamma-rays, reveal two pronounced components, both produced by radiation byenergetic particles. one peaks in the ir - to soft x-ray band, radiating viathe synchrotron process; the other, peaking in the high-energy gamma-rays, isproduced by the compton process. these spectra -- and, in particular, the \ascadata -- suggest that the origin of the seed photons for comptonization isdiverse. in the high-energy peaked bl lac objects (hbls), the dominant seedphotons for comptonization appear to be the synchrotron photons internal to thejet (ssc process). in the quasar-hosted blazars (qhbs), on the other hand, thex-ray band emission is still dominated by the ssc process, while the mev to gevrange is produced by comptonization of external photons such as the emissionline light. in the context of this three-component model, we derive themagnetic field of 0.1 - 1 gauss for all classes of blazars. lorentz factorsgamma_{peak} of electrons radiating at each peak of the nufnu spectra areestimated to be ~10^{5}$ for hbls; this is much higher than ~10^{3}$ for qhbs.this difference is consistent with the fact that the four sources that areknown to emit tev gamma-rays (tev blazars) are all classified as hbls. amongthe tev blazars, mkn 421 is one of the brightest and most variable emittersfrom ultraviolet (ev) to hard gamma-ray (tev) energies.the multi-frequencyobservations including tev energy band provide the best opportunity tounderstand high-energy emission from blazar jets. in this paper, we discussresults of multi-frequency analysis and review the results of intensivecampaigns for mkn 421 from 1994 to 1998

astro-ph;9908128	the asca medium sensitivity survey (the gis catalog project): source  counts and evidence for emerging population of hard sources	we present first results from the asca medium sensitivity survey (amss; orthe gis catalog project). from the serendipitous fields amounting to 106dege-2, we determined the log n - log s relations in the 0.7-7 kev and 2-10 kevbands with the best statistical accuracy obtained so far, over the flux rangefrom 1 x 10e-11 to 5 x 10e-14 and 7 x 10e-14 erg se-1 cme-2, respectively. whenthe sources detected in the 0.7-7 kev band are divided into two subsamples withhigher and lower spectral hardness, the former exhibits a significantly steeperslope than the latter at fluxes below ~10e-12 erg se-1 cme-2 (0.7-7 kev). theaverage spectrum of sources becomes continuously harder toward fainter fluxes,from a photon index of 2.1 in the 0.7-10 kev range at the flux of ~10e-11 to1.6 at ~10e-13 erg se-1 cme-2 (0.7-7 kev). this is consistent with thecomparison of source counts between the 2-10 kev and the 0.7-2 kev band, andsolves the puzzle of their discrepancy reported previously. our resultsdemonstrate rapid emergence of hard x-ray sources with a decreasing flux from\~10e-12 to ~10e-13 erg se-1 cme-2 (2-10 kev).

0811.0415	high energy resolution hard x-ray and gamma-ray imagers using cdte diode  devices	we developed cdte double-sided strip detectors (dsds or cross stripdetectors) and evaluated their spectral and imaging performance for hard x-raysand gamma-rays. though the double-sided strip configuration is suitable forimagers with a fine position resolution and a large detection area, cdte diodedsds with indium (in) anodes have yet to be realized due to the difficultyposed by the segmented in anodes. cdte diode devices with aluminum (al) anodeswere recently established, followed by a cdte device in which the al anodescould be segmented into strips. we developed cdte double-sided strip deviceshaving pt cathode strips and al anode strips, and assembled prototype cdtedsds. these prototypes have a strip pitch of 400 micrometer. signals from thestrips are processed with analog asics (application specific integratedcircuits). we have successfully performed gamma-ray imaging spectroscopy with aposition resolution of 400 micrometer. energy resolution of 1.8 kev (fwhm: fullwidth at half maximum) was obtained at 59.54 kev. moreover, the possibility ofimproved spectral performance by utilizing the energy information of both sidestrips was demonstrated. we designed and fabricated a new analog asic, va32ta6,for the readout of semiconductor detectors, which is also suitable for dsds. anew feature of the asic is its internal adc function. we confirmed thisfunction and good noise performance that reaches an equivalent noise charge of110 e- under the condition of 3-4 pf input capacitance.

0811.3796	suzaku observations of extreme mev blazar swift j0746.3+2548	we report the suzaku observations of the high luminosity blazar swiftj0746.3+2548 (j0746) conducted in november 2005. this object, with z = 2.979,is the highest redshift source observed in the suzaku guaranteed time observer(gto) period, is likely to show high gamma-ray flux peaking in the mev range.as a result of the good photon statistics and high signal-to-noise ratiospectrum, the $suzaku$ observation clearly confirms that j0746 has an extremelyhard spectrum in the energy range of 0.3-24 kev, which is well represented by asingle power-law with a photon index of 1.17 and galactic absorption. themultiwavelength spectral energy distribution of j0746 shows two continuumcomponents, and is well modeled assuming that the high-energy spectralcomponent results from comptonization of the broad-line region photons. in thispaper we search for the bulk compton spectral features predicted to be producedin the soft x-ray band by scattering external optical/uv photons by coldelectrons in a relativistic jet. we discuss and provide constraints on the paircontent resulting from the apparent absence of such features.
