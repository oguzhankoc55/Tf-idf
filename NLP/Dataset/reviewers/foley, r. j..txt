0901.0710	an intermediate luminosity transient in ngc300: the eruption of a  dust-enshrouded massive star	[abridged] we present multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectroscopy,uv/radio/x-ray imaging, and archival hubble and spitzer observations of anintermediate luminosity optical transient recently discovered in the nearbygalaxy ngc300. we find that the transient (ngc300 ot2008-1) has a peak absolutemagnitude of m_bol~-11.8 mag, intermediate between novae and supernovae, andsimilar to the recent events m85 ot2006-1 and sn2008s. our high-resolutionspectra, the first for this event, are dominated by intermediate velocity(~200-1000 km/s) hydrogen balmer lines and caii emission and absorption linesthat point to a complex circumstellar environment, reminiscent of the yellowhypergiant irc+10420. in particular, we detect broad caii h&amp;k absorption withan asymmetric red wing extending to ~1000 km/s, indicative of gas infall onto amassive and relatively compact star (blue supergiant or wolf-rayet star); anextended red supergiant progenitor is unlikely. the origin of the inflowing gasmay be a previous ejection from the progenitor or the wind of a massive binarycompanion. the low luminosity, intermediate velocities, and overall similarityto a known eruptive star indicate that the event did not result in a completedisruption of the progenitor. we identify the progenitor in archival spitzerobservations, with deep upper limits from hubble data. the spectral energydistribution points to a dust-enshrouded star with a luminosity of about 6x10^4l_sun, indicative of a ~10-20 m_sun progenitor (or binary system). thisconclusion is in good agreement with our interpretation of the outburst andcircumstellar properties. the lack of significant extinction in the transientspectrum indicates that the dust surrounding the progenitor was cleared by theoutburst.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0906.1616	improved distances to type ia supernovae with two spectroscopic  subclasses	we study the observables of 158 relatively normal type ia supernovae (sne ia)by dividing them into two groups in terms of the expansion velocity inferredfrom the absorption minimum of the si ii 6355 line in their spectra near b-bandmaximum brightness. one group ("normal") consists of normal sne ia populating anarrow strip in the si ii velocity distribution, with an average expansionvelocity v=10,600+/-400 km/s near b maximum; the other group ("hv") consists ofobjects with higher velocities, v &gt; 11,800 km/s. compared with the normalgroup, the hv one shows a narrower distribution in both the peak luminosity andthe luminosity decline rate dm_{15}. in particular, their b-v colors at maximumbrightness are found to be on average redder by ~0.1, suggesting that theyeither are associated with dusty environments or have intrinsically red b-vcolors. the hv sne ia are also found to prefer a lower extinction ratio rv~1.6(versus ~2.4 for the normal ones). applying such an absorption-correctiondichotomy to sne ia of these two groups remarkably reduces the dispersion intheir peak luminosity from 0.178 mag to only 0.125 mag.

0906.2003	a faint type of supernova from a white dwarf with a helium-rich  companion	supernovae (sne) are thought to arise from two different physical processes.the cores of massive, short-lived stars undergo gravitational core collapse andtypically eject a few solar masses during their explosion. these are thought toappear as as type ib/c and ii sne, and are associated with young stellarpopulations. a type ia sn is thought to arise from the thermonuclear detonationof a white dwarf star composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, whose massapproaches the chandrasekhar limit. such sne are observed in both young and oldstellar environments. here we report our discovery of the faint type ib sn2005e in the halo of the nearby isolated galaxy, ngc 1032.  the lack of any trace of recent star formation near the sn location (fig. 1),and the very low derived ejected mass (~0.3 m_sun), argue strongly against acore-collapse origin for this event. spectroscopic observations and the derivednucleosynthetic output show that the sn ejecta have high velocities and aredominated by helium-burning products, indicating that sn 2005e was neither asubluminous nor a regular sn ia (fig. 2). we have therefore found a new type ofstellar explosion, arising from a low-mass, old stellar system, likelyinvolving a binary with a primary white dwarf and a helium-rich secondary. thesn ejecta contain more calcium than observed in any known type of sn and likelyadditional large amounts of radioactive 44ti. such sne may thus help resolvefundamental physical puzzles, extending from the composition of the primitivesolar system and that of the oldest stars, to the galactic production ofpositrons.

0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0908.2818	the high-metallicity explosion environment of the relativistic supernova  2009bb	we investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40mpc) broad-lined type icsupernova sn 2009bb. this event was observed to produce a relativistic outflowlikely powered by a central accreting compact object. while such a phenomenonwas previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), no lgrbwas detected in association with sn 2009bb. using an optical spectrum of the sn2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ism properties for the hostenvironment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and starformation rate. we compare the sn explosion site properties to observations oflgrb and broad-lined sn ic host environments on optical emission line ratiodiagnostic diagrams. based on these analyses, we find that the sn 2009bbexplosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement withother broad-lined sn ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshiftlgrb host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits forrelativistic explosions. we consider the implications of these findings and theimpact that sn 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have onour understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some sne toproduce a relativistic outflow.

0910.2193	first-year sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova results:  consistency and constraints with other intermediate-redshift datasets	we present an analysis of the luminosity distances of type ia supernovae fromthe sloan digital sky survey-ii (sdss-ii) supernova survey in conjunction withother intermediate redshift (z&lt;0.4) cosmological measurements includingredshift-space distortions from the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs), the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect seen by the sdss, and thelatest baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) distance scale from both the sdss and2dfgrs. we have analysed the sdss-ii sn data alone using a variety of"model-independent" methods and find evidence for an accelerating universe at&gt;97% level from this single dataset. we find good agreement between thesupernova and bao distance measurements, both consistent with alambda-dominated cdm cosmology, as demonstrated through an analysis of thedistance duality relationship between the luminosity (d_l) and angular diameter(d_a) distance measures. we then use these data to estimate w within thisrestricted redshift range (z&lt;0.4). our most stringent result comes from thecombination of all our intermediate-redshift data (sdss-ii sne, bao, isw andredshift-space distortions), giving w = -0.81 +0.16 -0.18(stat) +/- 0.15(sys)and omega_m=0.22 +0.09 -0.08 assuming a flat universe. this value of w, andassociated errors, only change slightly if curvature is allowed to vary,consistent with constraints from the cosmic microwave background. we alsoconsider more limited combinations of the geometrical (sn, bao) and dynamical(isw, redshift-space distortions) probes.

0910.2275	on the progenitor of the type ii-plateau sn 2008cn in ngc 4603	through comparison of pre- and post-explosion images obtained with the widefield and planetary camera 2 onboard the hubble space telescope, we haveisolated a supergiant star prior to explosion at nearly the same position asthe high-luminosity sn ii-p 2008cn. we provide evidence that this supergiantmay well be the progenitor of the sn, although this identification is notentirely unambiguous due mainly to the distance to the host galaxy (ngc 4603),33.3 mpc. the progenitor candidate has a more yellow color than generally wouldbe expected and, if a single star, would require that it exploded during a"blue loop" evolutionary phase. nonetheless, we estimate an initial mass ofmini = 15 +/- 2 msun for this star, which is within the expected mass range forsn ii-p progenitors. the yellower color could also arise from the blend of twoor more stars, such as a red supergiant hidden by a brighter, blue supergiant;or a massive, interacting binary system. finally, if the yellow supergiant isnot the progenitor, or is not a stellar blend or binary containing theprogenitor, then we constrain any undetected progenitor star to be a redsupergiant with mini &lt; 11 msun, considering a physically more realisticscenario of explosion at the model endpoint luminosity for a rotating star.(abridged)

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

1004.3783	on the interpretation of supernova light echo profiles and spectra	the light echo systems of historical supernovae in the milky way and localgroup galaxies provide an unprecedented opportunity to reveal the effects ofasymmetry on observables, particularly optical spectra. scattering dust atdifferent locations on the light echo ellipsoid witnesses the supernova fromdifferent perspectives and the light consequently scattered towards earthpreserves the shape of line profile variations introduced by asymmetries in thesupernova photosphere. however, the interpretation of supernova light echospectra to date has not involved a detailed consideration of the effects ofoutburst duration and geometrical scattering modifications due to finitescattering dust filament dimension, inclination, and image point-spreadfunction and spectrograph slit width. in this paper, we explore theimplications of these factors and present a framework for future resolvedsupernova light echo spectra interpretation, and test it against cas a and sn1987a light echo spectra. we conclude that the full modeling of the dimensionsand orientation of the scattering dust using the observed light echoes at twoor more epochs is critical for the correct interpretation of light echospectra. indeed, without doing so one might falsely conclude that differencesexist when none are actually present.

1011.1310	intracluster supernovae in the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey	the multi-epoch nearby cluster survey (meneacs) has discovered twenty-threecluster type ia supernovae (sne) in the 58 x-ray selected galaxy clusters (0.05&lt; z &lt; 0.15) surveyed. four of our sn ia events have no host galaxy on closeinspection, and are likely intracluster sne. deep image stacks at the locationof the candidate intracluster sne put upper limits on the luminosities of fainthosts, with m_{r} &gt; -13.0 mag and m_{g} &gt; -12.5 mag in all cases. for suchlimits, the fraction of the cluster luminosity in faint dwarfs below ourdetection limit is &lt;0.1%, assuming a standard cluster luminosity function. allfour events occurred within ~600 kpc of the cluster center (projected), asdefined by the position of the brightest cluster galaxy, and are more centrallyconcentrated than the cluster sn ia population as a whole. after accounting forseveral observational biases that make intracluster sne easier to discover andspectroscopically confirm, we calculate an intracluster stellar mass fractionof 0.16^{+0.13}_{-0.09} (68% cl) for all objects within r_{200}. if we assumethat the intracluster stellar population is exclusively old, and the clustergalaxies themselves have a mix of stellar ages, we derive an upper limit on theintracluster stellar mass fraction of &lt;0.47 (84% one-sided cl). when combinedwith the intragroup sne results of mcgee &amp; balogh, we confirm the decliningintracluster stellar mass fraction as a function of halo mass reported bygonzalez and collaborators.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1101.3581	sn2008am: a super-luminous type iin supernova	we present observations and interpretation of the type iin supernova sn2008am discovered by the rotse supernova verification project (rsvp). sn 2008ampeaked at approximately -22.3 mag at a redshift of z=0.2338, giving it a peakluminosity of 3 x 10^{44}erg/s and making it one of the most luminoussupernovae ever observed. the total radiated energy is ~ 2 x 10^{51} erg.photometric observations in the ultraviolet, optical and infrared bands(j,h,ks) constrain the sed evolution. we obtained six optical spectra of thesupernova, five on the early decline from maximum light and a sixth nearly ayear later plus a very late-time spectrum (~2 yr) of the host galaxy. thespectra of sn 2008am show strong balmer-line and he i lambda 5876a emissionwith intermediate widths (~25a) in the first ~40 days after optical maximum. weexamine a variety of models for the line wings and conclude that multiplescattering is most likely, implying that our spectra contain no specificinformation on the bulk flow velocity. we examine a variety of models for therotse light curve subject to the rise time and the nature of the spectra,including radioactive decay, shocks in optically-thick and optically-thincircumstellar media (csm) and a magnetar. the most successful model is one forwhich the csm is optically-thick and in which diffusion of forwardshock-deposited luminosity gives rise to the observed light curve. diffusion ofthe shock-deposited energy from the forward shock is found to be important toaccount for the rising part of the light curve. although there are differencesin detail, sn 2008am appears to be closely related to other super-luminous typeiin supernovae, sn 2006gy, sn 2006tf and perhaps sn 2008iy, that may representthe deaths of very massive lbv-type progenitors and for which the luminosity ispowered by the interaction of the ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1106.3073	the spectroscopic classification and explosion properties of sn2009nz  associated with grb091127 at z=0.490	we present spectroscopic observations of grb091127 (z=0.490) at the peak ofthe putative associated supernova, sn2009nz. subtracting a late-time spectrumof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of sn2009nz and uncover broadfeatures typical of nearby grb-sne. this establishes unambiguously thatgrb091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined type ic sn, and links a cosmologicallong burst with a standard energy release (e_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to amassive star progenitor. the spectrum of sn2009nz closely resembles that ofsn2006aj, with sn2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but hassignificantly narrower features than sne 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of alower expansion velocity. the photospheric velocity inferred from the siii 6355absorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of sne 2006ajand 2003dh than to the other grb-sne. combining the measured velocity with thelight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosionparameters: m_ni ~ 0.35 m_sun, e_k ~ 2.3e51 erg, and m_ej ~ 1.4 m_sun, similarto those of sn2006aj. these properties indicate that sn2009nz follows a trendof lower m_ni for grb-sne with lower e_k and m_ej. equally important, sincegrb091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of sn2009nz tosn2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that xrf060218/sn2006aj was powered bya neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encodedin the sn properties but not in the prompt emission. future spectra of grb-sneat z &gt; 0.3, including proper subtraction of the host galaxy contribution, willshed light on the full dispersion of sn properties for standard long grbs, onthe relation between sne associated with sub-energetic and standard grbs, andon a potential dispersion in the associated sn types.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

1112.2210	light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool eta carinae during its  19th-century great eruption	eta carinae (eta car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the milkyway. it became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century"great eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates ofbrightness). its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in thatit exceeded the eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. because it is only 2.3kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejectedmass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, eta carejected more than 10 m_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of atypical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. here we report thediscovery of light echoes of eta carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858great eruption. spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, whichare blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansionspeeds. the light-echo spectra correlate best with those of g2-g5 supergiantspectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 k. in contrast to the classof extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of eta car's great eruption,the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowedby standard opaque wind models. this indicates that other physical mechanismslike an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1208.3368	high-redshift cool-core galaxy clusters detected via the  sunyaev--zel'dovich effect in the south pole telescope survey	we report the first investigation of cool-core properties of galaxy clustersselected via their sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) effect. we use 13 galaxy clustersuniformly selected from 178 deg^2 observed with the south pole telescope (spt)and followed up by the chandra x-ray observatory. they form an approximatelymass-limited sample (&gt; 3 x 10^14 m_sun h^-1_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt;1.1. using previously published x-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare twoproxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (csb) andcuspiness ({\alpha}). we find that csb is better constrained. we measure csbfor the spt sample and find several new z &gt; 0.5 cool-core clusters, includingtwo strong cool cores. this rules out the hypothesis that there are no z &gt; 0.5clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4{\sigma} level. thefraction of strong cool-core clusters in the spt sample in this redshift regimeis between 7% and 56% (95% confidence). although the spt selection function issignificantly different from the x-ray samples, the high-z csb distribution forthe spt sample is statistically consistent with that of x-ray-selected samplesat both low and high redshifts. the cool-core strength is inversely correlatedwith the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the x-ray centroid,providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength ofthe cluster. larger sz-selected samples will be crucial in understanding theevolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.3645	multi-epoch high-spectral-resolution observations of neutral sodium in  14 type ia supernovae	one of the main questions concerning type ia supernovae is the nature of thebinary companion of the exploding white dwarf. a major discriminant betweendifferent suggested models is the presence and physical properties ofcircumstellar material at the time of explosion. if present, this material willbe ionized by the ultra-violet radiation of the explosion and later recombine.this ionization-recombination should manifest itself as time-variableabsorption features that can be detected via multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution observations. previous studies have shown that thestrongest effect is seen in the neutral sodium d lines. we report onobservations of neutral sodium absorption features observed in multi-epochhigh-resolution spectra of 14 type ia supernova events. this is the firstmulti-epoch high-resolution study to include multiple sne. no variability inline strength that can be associated with circumstellar material is detected.we find that ~18% of the events in the extended sample exhibit time-variablesodium features associated with circumstellar material. we explore theimplication of this study on our understanding of the progenitor systems oftype ia supernovae via the current type ia supernova multi-epochhigh-spectral-resolution sample.

1312.2462	constraints on the cmb temperature evolution using multi-band  measurements of the sunyaev zel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope	the adiabatic evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) is a key prediction of standard cosmology. we study deviations from theexpected adiabatic evolution of the cmb temperature of the form $t(z)=t_0(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$ using measurements of the spectrum of the sunyaevzel'dovich effect with the south pole telescope (spt). we present a method forusing the ratio of the sunyaev zel'dovich signal measured at 95 and 150 ghz inthe spt data to constrain the temperature of the cmb. we demonstrate that thisapproach provides unbiased results using mock observations of clusters from anew set of hydrodynamical simulations. we apply this method to a sample of 158spt-selected clusters, spanning the redshift range $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 1.35$, andmeasure $\alpha = 0.017^{+0.030}_{-0.028}$, consistent with the standard modelprediction of $\alpha=0$. in combination with other published results, weconstrain $\alpha = 0.011 \pm 0.016$, an improvement of $\sim 20\%$ overpublished constraints. this measurement also provides a strong constraint onthe effective equation of state in models of decaying dark energy$w_\mathrm{eff} = -0.987^{+0.016}_{-0.017}$.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1401.4064	improved cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of the sdss-ii  and snls supernova samples	we present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type iasupernova (sn ia) observations obtained by the sdss-ii and snls collaborations.the data set includes several low-redshift samples (z&lt;0.1), all 3 seasons fromthe sdss-ii (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.4), and 3 years from snls (0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1) and totals\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type ia supernovae with high quality lightcurves. we have followed the methods and assumptions of the snls 3-year dataanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition ofthe full sdss-ii spectroscopically-confirmed sn ia sample in both the trainingof the salt2 light curve model and in the hubble diagram analysis (\nsdsscsne), 2) inter-calibration of the snls and sdss surveys and reduced systematicuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect tothe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errorsassociated with the salt2 modeling of sn ia light-curves. we producerecalibrated sn ia light-curves and associated distances for the sdss-ii andsnls samples. the large sdss-ii sample provides an effective, independent,low-z anchor for the hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error fromcalibration systematics in the low-z sn sample. for a flat lcdm cosmology wefind omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recentcmb measurement from the planck and wmap experiments. our result is 1.8sigma(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of snls 3-year data.the change is due primarily to improvements in the snls photometriccalibration. when combined with cmb constraints, we measure a constantdark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flatuniverse. adding bao distance measurements gives similar constraints:w=-1.027+-0.055.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1407.2942	mass calibration and cosmological analysis of the spt-sz galaxy cluster  sample using velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ and x-ray $y_\textrm{x}$  measurements	we present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the south poletelescope sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey (spt-sz) galaxy cluster sample.using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 x-ray yxmeasurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate themass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. thecalibrations using $\sigma_v$ and yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. we use the fullcluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. thespt cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the wmap9 orplanck+wmap9 polarization (wp) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrinomasses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ ev, we find the datasets to be consistent at the1.0$\sigma$ level for wmap9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for planck+wp. allowing for larger$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. when we combine the cluster andplanck+wp datasets with bao and snia, the preferred cluster masses are$1.9\sigma$ higher than the yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the$\sigma_v$ calibration. given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of thedata. using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. within a $\nu$cdm model we find $\sum m_\nu =0.148\pm0.081$ ev. we present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of stateparameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with alcdm model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).

1408.1093	comprehensive observations of the bright and energetic type iax sn  2012z: interpretation as a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf explosion	we present uv through nir broad-band photometry, and optical and nirspectroscopy of type iax supernova 2012z. the data set consists of both earlyand late-time observations, including the first late phase nir spectrumobtained for a spectroscopically classified sn iax. simple model calculationsof its bolometric light curve suggest sn 2012z produced ~0.3 m_sun of (56)ni,ejected about a chandrasekhar mass of material, and had an explosion energy of~10^51 erg, making it one of the brightest and most energetic sn iax yetobserved. the late phase nir spectrum of sn 2012z is found to broadly resemblesimilar epoch spectra of normal sne ia; however, like other sne iax,corresponding visual-wavelength spectra differ substantially compared to allsupernova types. constraints from the distribution of imes, e.g. silicon andmagnesium, indicate that the outer ejecta did not experience significant mixingduring or after burning, and the late phase nir line profiles suggests most ofthe (56)ni is produced during high density burning. the various observationalproperties of sn 2012z are found to be consistent with the theoreticalexpectations of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitor that experiences apulsational delayed detonation, which produced several tenths of a solar massof (56)ni during the deflagration burning phase and little (or no) (56)niduring the detonation phase. within this scenario only a moderate amount ofrayleigh-taylor mixing occurs both during the deflagration and fallback phaseof the pulsation, and the layered structure of the imes is a product of thesubsequent denotation phase. the fact that the sne iax population does notfollow a tight brightness-decline relation similar to sne ia can then beunderstood in the framework of variable amounts of mixing during pulsationalrebound and variable amounts of (56)ni production during the early subsonicphase of expansion.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1502.06964	galex detection of shock breakout in type ii-p supernova ps1-13arp:  implications for the progenitor star wind	we present the galex detection of a uv burst at the time of explosion of anoptically normal type ii-p supernova (ps1-13arp) from the pan-starrs1 survey atz=0.1665. the temperature and luminosity of the uv burst match the theoreticalpredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration afactor of ~50 longer than expected. we compare the $nuv$ light curve ofps1-13arp to previous galex detections of type iip sne, and find cleardistinctions that indicate that the uv emission is powered by shock breakout,and not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected inthese systems. we interpret the ~ 1 d duration of the uv signal with a shockbreakout in the wind of a red supergiant with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate of~ 10^-3 msun yr^-1. this mass-loss rate is enough to prolong the duration ofthe shock breakout signal, but not enough to produce an excess in the opticalplateau light curve or narrow emission lines powered by circumstellarinteraction. this detection of non-standard, potentially episodic highmass-loss in a rsg sn progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospectsof future wide-field uv surveys to detect shock breakout directly in thesesystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of snprogenitors.

1504.02396	500 days of sn 2013dy: spectra and photometry from the ultraviolet to  the infrared	sn 2013dy is a type ia supernova for which we have compiled an extraordinarydataset spanning from 0.1 to ~ 500 days after explosion. we present 10 epochsof ultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared (nir) spectra with hst/stis, 47epochs of optical spectra (15 of them having high resolution), and more than500 photometric observations in the bvrriizyjh bands. sn 2013dy has a broad andslowly declining light curve (delta m(b) = 0.92 mag), shallow si ii 6355absorption, and a low velocity gradient. we detect strong c ii in our earliestspectra, probing unburned progenitor material in the outermost layers of the snejecta, but this feature fades within a few days. the uv continuum of sn2013dy, which is strongly affected by the metal abundance of the progenitorstar, suggests that sn 2013dy had a relatively high-metallicity progenitor.examining one of the largest single set of high-resolution spectra for a sn ia,we find no evidence of variable absorption from circumstellar material.combining our uv spectra, nir photometry, and high-cadence optical photometry,we construct a bolometric light curve, showing that sn 2013dy had a maximumluminosity of 10.0^{+4.8}_{-3.8} * 10^{42} erg/s. we compare the syntheticlight curves and spectra of several models to sn 2013dy, finding that sn 2013dyis in good agreement with a solar-metallicity w7 model.

0805.2201	from shock breakout to peak and beyond: extensive panchromatic  observations of the type ib supernova 2008d associated with swift x-ray  transient 080109	we present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared)and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (sn) 2008d aswell as x-ray data analysis on the associated swift/x-ray transient (xrt)080109. our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the x-raytransient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us toderive constraints on the nature of the sn and its progenitor; throughout wedraw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several keyaspects that differ. we show that the x-ray spectrum of xrt 080109 can be fitequally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal partsof both power law and blackbody. our data first established that sn 2008d is aspectroscopically normal sn ib (i.e., showing conspicuous he lines), and showthat sn 2008d had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest opticalpeak luminosity. the early-time light curves of the sn are dominated by acooling stellar envelope (for \delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the bluebands) followed by 56^ni decay. we construct a reliable measurement of thebolometric output for this stripped-envelope sn, and, combined with estimatesof e_k and m_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius r_star of itsprobable wolf-rayet progenitor. according to the model of waxman et al. and ofchevalier &amp; fransson, we derive r_star^{w07}= 1.2+/-0.7 r_sun andr_star^{cf08}= 12+/-7 r_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line withtypical wn stars. spectra obtained at 3 and 4 months after maximum light showdouble-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from sphericalsymmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of sn ibcores.

1507.05137	the difference imaging pipeline for the transient search in the dark  energy survey	we describe the difference imaging pipeline (diffimg) used to detecttransients in deep images from the dark energy survey supernova program(des-sn) in its first observing season from aug 2013 through feb 2014. des-snis a search for transients in which ten 3-deg^2 fields are repeatedly observedin the g,r,i,z passbands with a cadence of about 1 week. the observing strategyhas been optimized to measure high-quality light curves and redshifts forthousands of type ia supernova (sn ia) with the goal of measuring dark energyparameters. the essential diffimg functions are to align each search image to adeep reference image, do a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, and then examine thesubtracted image for significant positive detections of point-source objects.the vast majority of detections are subtraction artifacts, but after selectionrequirements and image filtering with an automated scanning program, there are130 detections per deg^2 per observation in each band, of which only 25% areartifacts. of the 7500 transients discovered by des-sn in its first observingseason, each requiring a detection on at least 2 separate nights, monte carlosimulations predict that 27% are expected to be supernova. another 30% of thetransients are artifacts, and most of the remaining transients are agn andvariable stars. fake sne ia are overlaid onto the images to rigorously evaluatedetection efficiencies, and to understand the diffimg performance. the diffimgefficiency measured with fake sne agrees well with expectations from a montecarlo simulation that uses analytical calculations of the fluxes and theiruncertainties. in our 8 "shallow" fields with single-epoch 50% completenessdepth 23.5, the sn ia efficiency falls to 1/2 at redshift z 0.7, in our 2"deep" fields with mag-depth 24.5, the efficiency falls to 1/2 at z 1.1.

1508.05361	supercal: cross-calibration of multiple photometric systems to improve  cosmological measurements with type ia supernovae	current cosmological analyses which use type ia supernova (sn ia)observations combine sn samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of asingle sample and increase the overall sample size. the inhomogeneousphotometric calibration between different sn samples is one of the largestsystematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. to placethese different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observationsof a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $hst$ system. we proposea complementary method, called `supercal', in which we use measurements ofsecondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the samestars in the pan-starrs1 (ps1) system, and determine offsets for each systemrelative to ps1, placing all sn observations on a single, consistentphotometric system. ps1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relativecalibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15&lt;griz&lt;21$ mag), making it anideal reference system. we use this process to recalibrate optical observationstaken by the following sn samples: ps1, snls, sdss, csp, and cfa1-4. we measurediscrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various opticalpassbands. we find that correcting for these differences changes recoveredvalues for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average$2.6\%$. this change is roughly half the size of current statisticalconstraints on $w$. the size of this effect strongly depends on the error inthe $b-v$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. the supercal method will allowfuture analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.

astro-ph;0411357	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first two years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations of targets discoveredduring the first two years of the essence project. the goal of essence is touse a sample of ~200 type ia supernovae (sne ia) at moderate redshifts (0.2 &lt; z&lt; 0.8) to place constraints on the equation of state of the universe.spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirmsthat some of the discoveries are indeed sne ia. this confirmation is criticalto the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances tosne ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the sameas the ones at low redshift. we describe the methods of target selection andprioritization, the telescopes and detectors, and the software used to identifyobjects. the redshifts deduced from spectral matching of high-redshift sne iawith low-redshift sne ia are consistent with those determined from host-galaxyspectra. we show that the high-redshift sne ia match well with low-redshifttemplates. we include all spectra obtained by the essence project, including 52sne ia, 5 core-collapse sne, 12 active galactic nuclei, 19 galaxies, 4 possiblyvariable stars, and 16 objects with uncertain identifications.

astro-ph;0504481	a definitive measurement of time dilation in the spectral evolution of  the moderate-redshift type ia supernova 1997ex	we have obtained high-quality keck optical spectra at three epochs of thetype ia supernova 1997ex, whose redshift z is 0.361. the elapsed calendar timebetween the first two spectra was 24.88 d, and that between the first and thirdspectra was 30.95 d. in an expanding universe where 1 + z represents the factorby which space has expanded between the emission and detection of light, theamount of aging in the supernova rest frame should be a factor of 1 / (1 + z)smaller than the observed-frame aging; thus, we expect sn 1997ex to have aged18.28 d and 22.74 d between the first epoch and the second and third epochs,respectively. the quantitative method for determining the spectral-feature ageof a sn ia, developed by riess et al. (1997), reveals that the correspondingelapsed times in the supernova rest frame were 16.97 +/- 2.75 d and 18.01 +/-3.14 d, respectively. this result is inconsistent with no time dilation with asignificance level of 99.0%, providing evidence against "tired light" and otherhypotheses in which no time dilation is expected. moreover, the observedtimescale of spectral evolution is inconsistent with that expected in the"variable mass theory." the result is within ~1 sigma of the aging expectedfrom a universe in which redshift is produced by cosmic expansion.

astro-ph;0505480	closing in on a short-hard burst progenitor: constraints from early-time  optical imaging and spectroscopy of a possible host galaxy of grb 050509b	the localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 050509b was awatershed event. thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the grb position byswift, we began imaging the grb field 8 minutes after the burst and continuedfor the following 8 days. no convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow orsupernova was found for the object. we present a re-analysis of the xrtafterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4" to the west of the xrtposition reported previously. close to this position is a bright ellipticalgalaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster ofgalaxies. based on positional coincidences, the grb and the bright ellipticalare likely to be physically related. we thus have discovered evidence that atleast some short-duration, hard-spectra grbs arise at cosmological distances.however, while grb 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration grbs, wedemonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy isconsistent with that of long-duration grbs. based on this analysis, on thelocation of the grb (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there isnow observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts ariseduring the merger of a compact binary. we limit the properties of ali-paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' other progenitor models are still viable, andadditional rapidly localized bursts from the swift mission will undoubtedlyhelp to further clarify the progenitor picture.

astro-ph;0510022	the galaxy hosts and large-scale environments of short-hard gamma-ray  bursts	the rapid succession of discovery of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs hasled to unprecedented insights into the energetics of the explosion and natureof the progenitors. yet short of the detection of a smoking gun, like a burstof coincident gravitational radiation or a li-paczynski mini-supernova, it isunlikely that a definitive claim can be made for the progenitors. as was thecase with long--duration soft--spectrum grbs, however, the expectation is thata systematic study of the hosts and the locations of short grbs could begin toyield fundamental clues about their nature. we present the first aggregatestudy of the host galaxies of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs. inparticular, we present the gemini--north and keck discovery spectra of thegalaxies that hosted three short grbs and a moderate--resolution (r~6000)spectrum of a fourth host. we find that these short--hard grbs originate in avariety of low-redshift (z&lt;1) environments that differ substantially from thoseof long--soft grbs, both on individual galaxy scales and on galaxy--clusterscales. specifically, three of the bursts are found to be associated with oldand massive galaxies with no current (&lt; 0.1 msol/hr) or recent star formation.two of these galaxies are located within a cluster environment. theseobservations support an origin from the merger of compact stellar remnants,such as double neutron stars of a neutron star--black hole binary. the fourthevent, in contrast, occurred within a dwarf galaxy with a star formation rateexceeding 0.5 msol/yr. therefore, it appears that like supernovae of type ia,the progenitors of short--hard bursts are created in all galaxy types,suggesting a corresponding class with a wide distribution of delay timesbetween formation and explosion.

astro-ph;0512081	grb 050408: an atypical gamma-ray burst as a probe of an atypical  galactic environment	the bright grb 050408 was localized by hete-ii near local midnight, enablingan impressive ground-based followup effort as well as space-based followup fromswift. the swift data from the x-ray telescope (xrt) and our own opticalphotometry and spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for ouranalysis. under the traditional assumption that the visible waveband was abovethe peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the opticalphotometry from 0.03 to 5.03 days show an afterglow decay corresponding to anelectron energy index of p_lc = 2.05 +/- 0.04, without a jet break as suggestedby others. a break is seen in the x-ray data at early times (at ~12600 secafter the grb). the spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent withp_lc assuming a host-galaxy extinction of a_v = 1.18 mag. the optical-nirbroadband spectrum is also consistent with p = 2.05, but prefers a_v = 0.57mag. the x-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26 x 10^4 sec, which may be theresult of a refreshed shock. this burst stands out in that the optical andx-ray data suggest a large h i column density of n_hi ~ 10^22 cm^-2; it is verylikely a damped lyman alpha system and so the faintness of the host galaxy (m_v&gt; -18 mag) is noteworthy. moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong ti iiabsorption lines with a column density through the grb host that exceeds thelargest values observed for the milky way by an order of magnitude.furthermore, the ti ii equivalent width is in the top 1% of mg iiabsorption-selected qsos. this suggests that the large-scale environment of grb050408 has significantly lower ti depletion than the milky way and a largevelocity width (delta v &gt; 200 km/s).

astro-ph;0606763	when do internal shocks end and external shocks begin? early-time  broadband modelling of grb 051111	even with the renaissance in gamma-ray burst (grb) research fostered by theswift satellite, few bursts have both contemporaneous observations at longwavelengths and exquisite observations at later times across theelectromagnetic spectrum. we present here contemporaneous imaging with the kaitrobotic optical telescope, dense optical sampling with lulin, and supplementedwith infrared data from pairitel and radio to gamma-ray data from theliterature. for the first time, we can test the constancy of microphysicalparameters in the internal-external shock paradigm and carefully trace the flowof energy from the grb to the surrounding medium. kait data taken &lt;~1 minuteafter the start of grb051111 and coinciding with the fading gamma-ray tail ofthe prompt emission indicate a smooth re-injection of energy into the shock. nocolor change is apparent in observations beginning ~1.5 minutes after the grband lasting for the first hour after the burst. there are achromatic fluxmodulations about the best-fit model at late (t~10^4 s) times, possibly due tovariations in the external density. we find that the host-galaxy extinction iswell fit by a curve similar to that ofthe small magellanic cloud. low visualextinction, a_v~0.2 mag, combined with high column densities determined fromthe x-ray and optical spectroscopy (n_h&gt; 10^21 cm^-2), indicate a lowdust-to-metals ratio and a possible over-abundance of the light metals. anapparent small ratio of total to selective extinction (r_v~2) argues againstdust destruction by the grb. time constancy of both the ir/optical/uv spectralenergy distribution and the soft x-ray absorption suggests that the absorbingmaterial is not local to the grb.

astro-ph;0607078	sn 2004aw: confirming diversity of type ic supernovae	optical and near-infrared observations of the type ic supernova (sn) 2004aware presented, obtained from day -3 to day +413 with respect to the b-bandmaximum. the photometric evolution is characterised by a comparatively slowpost-maximum decline of the light curves. the peaks in redder bands aresignificantly delayed relative to the bluer bands, the i-band maximum occurring8.4 days later than that in b. with an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in thev band the sn can be considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. this alsoholds for the u through i bolometric light curve, where sn 2004aw has aposition intermediate between sne 2002ap and 1998bw. spectroscopically sn2004aw provides a link between a normal type ic supernova like sn 1994i and thegroup of broad-lined sne ic. the spectral evolution is rather slow, with aspectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. the shape of thenebular [o i] 6300,6364 line indicates a highly aspherical explosion. heliumcannot be unambiguously identified in the spectra, even in the near-infrared.using an analytical description of the light curve peak we find that the totalmass of the ejecta in sn 2004aw is 3.5-8.0 m_sun, significantly larger than insn 1994i, although not as large as in sn 1998bw. the same model suggests thatabout 0.3 m_sun of {56}ni has been synthesised in the explosion. no connectionto a grb can be firmly established.

astro-ph;0611295	the peculiar sn 2005hk: do some type ia supernovae explode as  deflagrations?	we present extensive u'g'r'i'bvriyjhks photometry and optical spectroscopy ofsn 2005hk. these data reveal that sn 2005hk was nearly identical in itsobserved properties to sn 2002cx, which has been called ``the most peculiarknown type ia supernova.'' both supernovae exhibited high ionization sn1991t-like pre-maximum spectra, yet low peak luminosities like sn 1991bg. thespectra reveal that sn 2005hk, like sn 2002cx, exhibited expansion velocitiesthat were roughly half those of typical type ia supernovae. the r and i lightcurves of both supernovae were also peculiar in not displaying the secondarymaximum observed for normal type ia supernovae. our yjh photometry of sn 2005hkreveals the same peculiarity in the near-infrared. by combining our optical andnear-infrared photometry of sn 2005hk with published ultraviolet light curvesobtained with the swift satellite, we are able to construct a bolometric lightcurve from ~10 days before to ~60 days after b maximum. the shape and unusuallylow peak luminosity of this light curve, plus the low expansion velocities andabsence of a secondary maximum at red and near-infrared wavelengths, are all inreasonable agreement with model calculations of a 3d deflagration whichproduces ~0.25 m_sun of 56ni.

astro-ph;0701041	observational constraints on the nature of the dark energy: first  cosmological results from the essence supernova survey	we present constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter,w=p/(rho c^2), using 60 type ia supernovae (sne ia) from the essence supernovasurvey. we derive a set of constraints on the nature of the dark energyassuming a flat universe. by including constraints on (omega_m, w) from baryonacoustic oscillations, we obtain a value for a static equation-of-stateparameter w=-1.05^{+0.13}_{-0.12} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.11 (sys) andomega_m=0.274^{+0.033}_{-0.020} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fit chi^2/dof of0.96. these results are consistent with those reported by the supernova legacysurvey in a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. weevaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations andpresent monte carlo simulations that explore these effects. currently, thelargest systematic currently with the potential to affect our measurements isthe treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies.combining our set of essence sne ia with the supernova legacy survey sne ia, weobtain a joint constraint of w=-1.07^{+0.09}_{-0.09} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.12(sys), omega_m=0.267^{+0.028}_{-0.018} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fitchi^2/dof of 0.91. the current sn ia data are fully consistent with acosmological constant.

astro-ph;0701043	the essence supernova survey: survey optimization, observations, and  supernova photometry	we describe the implementation and optimization of the essence supernovasurvey, which we have undertaken to measure the equation of state parameter ofthe dark energy. we present a method for optimizing the survey exposure timesand cadence to maximize our sensitivity to the dark energy equation of stateparameter w=p/rho c^2 for a given fixed amount of telescope time. for oursurvey on the ctio 4m telescope, measuring the luminosity distances andredshifts for supernovae at modest redshifts (z~0.5 +- 0.2) is optimal fordetermining w. we describe the data analysis pipeline based on using reliableand robust image subtraction to find supernovae automatically and in nearreal-time. since making cosmological inferences with supernovae reliescrucially on accurate measurement of their brightnesses, we describe ourefforts to establish a thorough calibration of the ctio 4m natural photometricsystem. in its first four years, essence has discovered and spectroscopicallyconfirmed 102 type ia sne, at redshifts from 0.10 to 0.78, identified throughan impartial, effective methodology for spectroscopic classification andredshift determination. we present the resulting light curves for the all typeia supernovae found by essence and used in our measurement of w, presented inwood-vasey et al, 2007.

astro-ph;0702565	esc and kait observations of the transitional type ia sn 2004eo	we present optical and infrared observations of the unusual type ia supernova(sn) 2004eo. the light curves and spectra closely resemble those of theprototypical sn 1992a, and the luminosity at maximum (m_b = -19.08) is close tothe average for a sn ia. however, the ejected 56ni mass derived by modellingthe bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limitof the 56ni mass distribution observed in normal sne ia. accordingly, sn 2004eoshows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (delta m_(b) =1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio si ii 5972 /si ii 6355 similar to that of sn 1992a. the physical properties of sn 2004eocause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocitygradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by benetti et al.(2005). similar behaviour is seen in a few other sne ia. thus, there may infact exist a few sne ia with intermediate physical properties.

astro-ph;0703538	the troublesome broadband evolution of grb 061126: does a grey burst  imply grey dust?	we report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (grb 061126) with an extremelybright (r ~ 12 mag at peak) early-time optical afterglow. the optical afterglowis already fading as a power law 22 seconds after the trigger, with nodetectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident witha large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. the optical--infrared photometricspectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but itexhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 safter the burst. this color change is contemporaneous with a switch from arelatively fast decay to slower decay. the rapidly decaying early afterglow isbroadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a brightforward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time x-rayobservations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is notobserved. indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burstwould qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flatoptical-to-x-ray spectral index. our photometric spectral energy distributionprovides no evidence of host-galaxy extinction, requiring either largequantities of grey dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006,based upon our late-time keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins forthe x-ray and optical afterglows.

0811.1205	a golden standard type ia supernova sn 2005cf: observations from the  ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavebands	we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (uv), optical, andnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra,for the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) 2005cf. from the well-sampled lightcurves, we find that sn 2005cf reached a b-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag,with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(b) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. thecorrelations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibratedon the basis of an expanded sn ia sample, yielded e(b-v)_host=0.09+/-0.03 magfor sn2005cf. the uv photometry was obtained with the hst and the swiftultraviolet/optical telescope, and the results match each other to within0.1-0.2 mag. the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband u,with an exception in the 2000-2500 angstrom spectral range (corresponding tothe f220w/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainterthan that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).combining the uv data with the ground-based optical and nir data, we establishthe generic uv-optical-nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive thebolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data. the overallspectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn ia, but withvariety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. the spectra atearly times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (hv) features in the ca iih&amp;k doublet and nir triplet. similar hv features may exist in the siii 6355absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in theearliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be commonin other normal sne ia. the possible origin of the hv absorption features isbriefly discussed (abridged).

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.

0812.1589	the young, massive, star cluster sandage-96 after the explosion of sn  2004dj in ngc 2403	the bright type ii-plateau supernova (sn) 2004dj occurred within the young,massive stellar cluster sandage-96 in a spiral arm of ngc 2403. newmulti-wavelength observations obtained with several ground-based andspace-based telescopes are combined to study the radiation from sandage-96after sn 2004dj faded away. sandage-96 started to dominate the flux in theoptical bands starting september 2006 (~800 d after explosion). the opticalfluxes are equal to the pre-explosion ones within the observationaluncertainties. an optical keck spectrum obtained ~900 d after explosion showsthe dominant blue continuum from the cluster stars shortward of 6000 \aa aswell as strong sn nebular emission lines redward. the integrated spectralenergy distribution (sed) of the cluster has been extended into the ultravioletregion by archival xmm-newton and new swift observations, and compared withtheoretical models. the outer parts of the cluster have been resolved by thehubble space telescope, allowing the construction of a color-magnitude diagram.the fitting of the cluster sed with theoretical isochrones results in clusterages between 10--40 myr, depending on metallicity and the model family. theisochrone fitting indicates that the resolved part of the cluster has a bimodalage distribution: a younger population at ~10--16 myr, and an older one at~32--100 myr which is similar to the age distribution of the nearby fieldstars. these stars may have been captured from the field during the clusterformation. the young age of sandage-96 suggest 12 &lt; m_prog &lt; 20 m_\odot as themost probable mass range for the progenitor of sn 2004dj. this is consistentwith, but perhaps slightly higher than, most of the other type ii-plateau snprogenitor masses determined so far.
