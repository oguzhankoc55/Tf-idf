0709.1131	new ultracool and halo white dwarf candidates in sdss stripe 82	a 2.5 x 100 degree region along the celestial equator (stripe 82) has beenimaged repeatedly from 1998 to 2005 by the sloan digital sky survey. a newcatalogue of ~4 million light-motion curves, together with over 200 derivedstatistical quantities, for objects in stripe 82 brighter than r~21.5 has beenconstructed by combining these data by bramich et al. (2007). this catalogue isat present the deepest catalogue of its kind. extracting the ~130000 objectswith highest signal-to-noise ratio proper motions, we build a reduced propermotion diagram to illustrate the scientific promise of the catalogue. in thisdiagram disk and halo subdwarfs are well-separated from the cool white dwarfsequence. our sample of 1049 cool white dwarf candidates includes at least 8and possibly 21 new ultracool h-rich white dwarfs (t_eff &lt; 4000k) and one newultracool he-rich white dwarf candidate identified from their sdss optical andukidss infrared photometry. at least 10 new halo white dwarfs are alsoidentified from their kinematics.

1102.0229	[oii] emitters in the goods field at z~1.85: a homogeneous measure of  evolving star formation	we present the results of a deep, near-infrared, narrow band imaging surveyat a central wavelength of 1.062 microns (fwhm=0.01 microns) in the goods-southfield using the eso vlt instrument, hawk-i. the data are used to carry out thehighest redshift search for [oii]3727 emission line galaxies to date. theimages reach an emission line flux limit (5 sigma) of 1.5 x 10^-17 erg cm^-2s^-1, additionally making the survey the deepest of its kind at high redshift.in this paper we identify a sample of [oii]3727 emission line objects atredshift z~1.85 in a co-moving volume of ~4100 mpc^3. objects are selectedusing an observed equivalent width (ew_obs) threshold of ew_obs = 50 angstroms.the sample is used to derive the space density and constrain the luminosityfunction of [oii] emitters at z=1.85. we find that the space density of objectswith observed [oii] luminosities in the range log(l_[oii]) &gt; 41.74 erg s^-1 islog(rho)=-2.45+/-0.14 mpc^-3, a factor of 2 greater than the observed spacedensity of [oii] emitters reported at z~1.4. after accounting for completenessand assuming an internal extinction correction of a_halpha=1 mag (equivalent toa_[oii]=1.87), we report a star formation rate density of rho* ~0.38+/-0.06msun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we independently derive the dust extinction of the sampleusing 24 micron fluxes and find a mean extinction of a_[oii]=0.98+/-0.11magnitudes (a_halpha=0.52). this is significantly lower than the a_halpha=1(a[oii]=1.86) mag value widely used in the literature. finally we incorporatethis improved extinction correction into the star formation rate densitymeasurement and report rho*~0.24+/-0.06 msun yr^-1 mpc^-3.

0710.0402	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey v. optical identification of the  xmm-newton medium sensitivity survey (xms)	we present the xmm-newton medium sensitivity survey (xms), including a totalof 318 x-ray sources found among the serendipitous content of 25 xmm-newtontarget fields. the xms comprises four largely overlapping source samplesselected at soft (0.5-2 kev), intermediate (0.5-4.5 kev), hard (2-10 kev) andultra-hard (4.5-7.5 kev) bands, the first three of them being flux-limited. wereport on the optical identification of the xms samples, complete to 85-95%. atthe intermediate flux levels sampled by the xms we find that the x-ray sky islargely dominated by active galactic nuclei. the fraction of stars in softx-ray selected samples is below 10%, and only a few per cent for hard selectedsamples. we find that the fraction of optically obscured objects in the agnpopulation stays constant at around 15-20% for soft and intermediate bandselected x-ray sources, over 2 decades of flux. the fraction of obscuredobjects amongst the agn population is larger (~35-45%) in the hard orultra-hard selected samples, and constant across a similarly wide flux range.the distribution in x-ray-to-optical flux ratio is a strong function of theselection band, with a larger fraction of sources with high values in hardselected samples. sources with x-ray-to-optical flux ratios in excess of 10 aredominated by obscured agn, but with a significant contribution from unobscuredagn.

0704.2971	the xmm-ssc survey of hard-spectrum xmm-newton sources 1: optically  bright sources	we present optical and x-ray data for a sample of serendipitous xmm-newtonsources that are selected to have 0.5-2 kev vs 2-4.5 kev x-ray hardness ratioswhich are harder than the x-ray background. the sources have 2-4.5 kev x-rayflux &gt;= 10^-14 cgs, and in this paper we examine a subsample of 42 opticallybright (r &lt; 21) sources; this subsample is 100 per cent spectroscopicallyidentified. all but one of the optical counterparts are extragalactic, and weargue that the single exception, a galactic m star, is probably a coincidentalassociation. the x-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws(21.8 &lt; log nh &lt; 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed agn. the majorityof the sources show only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra,implying that they are type-2 agn. only a small fraction of the sources (7/42)show broad optical emission lines, and all of these have nh &lt; 10^23 cm^-2. thisimplies that ratios of x-ray absorption to optical/uv extinction equivalent to&gt; 100 times the galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in agn absorbers (at most afew percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-lineqsos. seven objects appear to have an additional soft x-ray component inaddition to the heavily absorbed power law. we consider the implications of ourresults in the light of the agn unified scheme. we find that the softcomponents in narrow-line objects are consistent with the unified schemeprovided that &gt; 4 per cent of broad-line agn have ionised absorbers thatattenuate their soft x-ray flux by &gt;50 per cent. in at least one of the x-rayabsorbed, broad-line agn in our sample the x-ray spectrum requires an ionisedabsorber, consistent with this picture.

1203.5844	detection of atomic carbon [cii] 158 micron and dust emission from a  z=7.1 quasar host galaxy	using the iram plateau de bure interferometer, we report the detection of the158 micron [cii] emission line and underlying dust continuum in the host galaxyof the quasar ulas j112001.48+064124.3 (hereafter j1120+0641) atz=7.0842+/-0.0004. this is the highest redshift detection of the [cii] line todate, and allows us to put first constraints on the physical properties of thehost galaxy. the [cii] line luminosity is (1.2+/-0.2)x10^9 lsun, which is afactor ~4 lower than observed in a luminous quasar at z=6.42 (sdss j1148+5251).the underlying far-infrared (fir) continuum has a flux density of 0.61+/-0.16mjy, similar to the average flux density of z~6 quasars that were notindividually detected in the rest-frame fir. assuming the fir luminosity ofl_fir = 5.8x10^11-1.8x10^12 lsun is mainly powered by star-formation, we derivea star-formation rate in the range 160-440 msun/yr and a total dust mass in thehost galaxy of 6.7x10^7-5.7x10^8 msun (both numbers have significantuncertainties given the unknown nature of dust at these redshifts). the [cii]line width of sigma_v=100+/-15 km/s is among the smallest observed whencompared to the molecular line widths detected in z~6 quasars. both the [cii]and dust continuum emission are spatially unresolved at the current angularresolution of 2.0x1.7 arcsec^2 (corresponding to 10x9 kpc^2 at the redshift ofj1120+0641).

1209.2331	a new l-dwarf member of the moderately metal-poor triple system hd  221356	we report on the discovery of a fourth component in the hd 221356 starsystem, previously known to be formed by an f8v, slightly metal-poor primary([fe/h]=-0.26), and a distant m8v+l3v pair. in our ongoing common proper motionsearch based on vista hemisphere survey (vhs) and 2mass catalogues, we havedetected a faint (j=13.76+/-0.04 mag) co-moving companion of the f8 starlocated at angular separation of 12.13+/-0.18 arcsec (position angle of221.8+/-1.7), corresponding to a projected distance of ~312 au at 26 pc.near-infrared spectroscopy of the new companion, covering the 1.5-2.4 micronwavelength range with a resolving power of r~600, indicates an l1+/-1 spectraltype. using evolutionary models the mass of the new companion is estimated at~0.08 solar masses, which places the object close to the stellar-substellarborderline. this multiple system provides an interesting example of objectswith masses slightly above and below the hydrogen burning mass limit. the lowmass companions of hd 221356 have slightly bluer colours than field dwarfs withsimilar spectral type, which is likely a consequence of the sub-solarmetallicity of the system.

1311.1686	x-rays from the redshift 7.1 quasar ulas j1120+0641	we present x-ray imaging and spectroscopy of the redshift z=7.084 radio-quietquasar ulas j112001.48+064124.3 obtained with chandra and xmm-newton. thequasar is detected as a point source with both observatories. the chandraobservation provides a precise position, confirming the association of thex-ray source and the quasar, while a sufficient number of photons is detectedin the xmm-newton observation to yield a meaningful x-ray spectrum. in thexmm-newton observation the quasar has a 2-10 kev luminosity of 4.7+-0.9 times10^44 erg/s and a spectral slope alpha = 1.6+0.4/-0.3 (where f_nu isproportional to nu^-alpha). the quasar appears to have dimmed in the 15 monthsbetween the two observations, with a 2-10 kev luminosity of $1.8+1.0/-0.7 times10^45 erg/s during the chandra observation. we derive optical to x-ray spectralslopes alpha_ox of 1.76+-0.07 and 1.54+0.09/-0.08 at the times of thexmm-newton and chandra observations respectively, consistent with the range ofalpha_ox found in other quasars of comparable ultraviolet luminosity. the verysoft x-ray spectrum suggests that the quasar is accreting above the eddingtonrate, l/l_edd = 5+15/-4, compared to l/l_edd = 1.2+0.6/-0.5 derived from therest-frame ultraviolet. super-eddington accretion would help to reduce thediscrepancy between the age of the quasar implied by the small size of theionized near zone in which it sits (&lt;10^7 years), and the characteristice-folding time (2.5 times 10^7 years if l/l_edd=2). such super-eddingtonaccretion would also alleviate the challenging constraints on the seed blackhole mass provided that the quasar has been rapidly accreting throughout itshistory. the remnant of an individual population iii star is a plausibleprogenitor if an average l/l_edd&gt;1.46 has been maintained over the quasar'slifetime.

1311.3260	black hole mass estimates and emission-line properties of a sample of  redshift z&gt;6.5 quasars	we present the analysis of optical and near-infrared spectra of the only four$z&gt;6.5$ quasars known to date, discovered in the ukidss-las and vista-vikingsurveys. our data-set consists of new vlt/x-shooter and magellan/fireobservations. these are the best optical/nir spectroscopic data that are likelyto be obtained for the $z&gt;6.5$ sample using current $6$ - $10$ m facilities. weestimate the black hole mass, the eddington ratio, and the siiv/civ, ciii]/civ,and feii/mgii emission-line flux ratios. we perform spectral modeling using aprocedure that allows us to derive a probability distribution for the continuumcomponents and to obtain the quasar properties weighted upon the underlyingdistribution of continuum models. the $z&gt;6.5$ quasars show the same emissionproperties as their counterparts at lower redshifts. the $z&gt;6.5$ quasars hostblack holes with masses of $\sim 10^9$ m$_{\odot}$ that are accreting close tothe eddington luminosity ($\langle{\rm log} (l_{\rm bol}/l_{\rm edd})\rangle=-0.4\pm0.2$), in agreement with what has been observed for a sample of$4.0&lt;z&lt;6.5$ quasars. by comparing the siiv/civ and ciii]/civ flux ratios withthe results obtained from luminosity-matched samples at $z\sim6$ and $2\leqz\leq4.5$, we find no evidence of evolution of the line ratios with cosmictime. we compare the measured feii/mgii flux ratios with those obtained for asample of $4.0&lt;z&lt;6.4$ sources. the two samples are analyzed using a consistentprocedure. there is no evidence that the feii/mgii flux ratio evolves between$z=7$ and $z=4$. under the assumption that the feii/mgii traces the fe/mgabundance ratio, this implies the presence of major episodes of chemicalenrichment in the quasar hosts in the first $\sim0.8$ gyr after the big bang.

1311.3666	discovery of three z&gt;6.5 quasars in the vista kilo-degree infrared  galaxy (viking) survey	studying quasars at the highest redshifts can constrain models of galaxy andblack hole formation, and it also probes the intergalactic medium in the earlyuniverse. optical surveys have to date discovered more than 60 quasars up toz~6.4, a limit set by the use of the z-band and ccd detectors. only one z&gt;6.4quasar has been discovered, namely the z=7.08 quasar ulas j1120+0641, usingnear-infrared imaging. here we report the discovery of three new z&gt;6.4 quasarsin 332 square degrees of the visible and infrared survey telescope forastronomy kilo-degree infrared galaxy (viking) survey, thus extending thenumber from 1 to 4. the newly discovered quasars have redshifts of z=6.60,6.75, and 6.89. the absolute magnitudes are between -26.0 and -25.5, 0.6-1.1mag fainter than ulas j1120+0641. near-infrared spectroscopy revealed the mgiiemission line in all three objects. the quasars are powered by black holes withmasses of ~(1-2)x10^9 m_sun. in our probed redshift range of 6.44&lt;z&lt;7.44 we canset a lower limit on the space density of supermassive black holes of\rho(m_bh&gt;10^9 m_sun) &gt; 1.1x10^(-9) mpc^(-3). the discovery of three quasars inour survey area is consistent with the z=6 quasar luminosity function whenextrapolated to z~7. we do not find evidence for a steeper decline in the spacedensity of quasars with increasing redshift from z=6 to z=7.

1404.7367	do high redshift quasars have powerful jets?	double-lobed radio galaxies a few 100s of kpc in extent, like cygnus a, arecommon at redshifts of 1 to 2, arising from some 10 per cent of the mostpowerful active galactic nuclei (agn). at higher redshifts they are rare, withnone larger than a few 10s of kpc known above redshift z~4. recent studies ofthe redshift evolution of powerful-jetted objects indicate that they mayconstitute a larger fraction of the agn population above redshift 2 thanappears from a simple consideration of detected ghz radio sources. the radioband is misleading as the dramatic (1+z)^4 boost in the energy density of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) causes inverse compton scattering to dominatethe energy losses of relativistic electrons in the extended lobes produced byjets, making them strong x-ray, rather than radio, sources. here we investigatelimits to x-ray lobes around two distant quasars, ulasj112001.48+064124.3 at z= 7.1 and sdssj1030+0524 at z=6.3, and find that powerful jets could beoperating yet be currently undetectable. jets may be instrumental in the rapidbuild-up of billion msun black hole at a rate that violates the eddingtonlimit.

1504.03264	des j0454-4448: discovery of the first luminous z &gt; 6 quasar from the  dark energy survey	we present the first results of a survey for high redshift, z $\ge$ 6,quasars using izy multi-colour photometric observations from the dark energysurvey (des). here we report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation ofthe $\rm z_{ab}, y_{ab}$ = 20.2, 20.2 (m$_{1450}$ = $-$26.5) quasar desj0454$-$4448 with an emission line redshift of z = 6.10$\pm$0.03 and a hi nearzone size of 4.6 $\pm$ 1.7 mpc.the quasar was selected as an i-band drop outwith i$-$z = 2.46 and z$_{ab} &lt; 21.5$ from an area of $\rm \sim$300 deg$^2$. itis the brightest of our 43 candidates and was identified for follow-upspectroscopically solely based on the des i$-$z and z$-$y colours. the quasaris detected by wise and has $w1_{ab} = 19.68$. the discovery of onespectroscopically confirmed quasar with 5.7 $&lt;$ z $&lt;$ 6.5 and z$_{ab} \leq$20.2 is consistent with recent determinations of the luminosity function at z$\sim$ 6. des when completed will have imaged $\rm \sim$5000 deg$^2$ to$y_{ab}$ = 23.0 ($5\sigma$ point source) and we expect to discover $&gt;$ 50-100new quasars with z $&gt;$ 6 including 3-10 with z $&gt;$ 7 dramatically increasingthe numbers of quasars currently known that are suitable for detailed studiesincluding determination of the neutral hi fraction of the intergalactic medium(igm) during the epoch of hydrogen reionization.

1507.00726	first discoveries of z~6 quasars with the kilo degree survey and vista  kilo-degree infrared galaxy survey	we present the results of our first year of quasar search in the on-going esopublic kilo degree survey (kids) and vista kilo-degree infrared galaxy (viking)surveys. these surveys are among the deeper wide-field surveys that can be usedto uncovered large numbers of z~6 quasars. this allows us to probe a morecommon population of z~6 quasars that is fainter than the well-studied quasarsfrom the main sloan digital sky survey. from this first set of combined surveycatalogues covering ~250 deg^2 we selected point sources down to z_ab=22 thathad a very red i-z (i-z&gt;2.2) colour. after follow-up imaging and spectroscopy,we discovered four new quasars in the redshift range 5.8&lt;z&lt;6.0. the absolutemagnitudes at a rest-frame wavelength of 1450 a are between -26.6 &lt; m_1450 &lt;-24.4, confirming that we can find quasars fainter than m^*, which at z=6 hasbeen estimated to be between m^*=-25.1 and m^*=-27.6. the discovery of 4quasars in 250 deg^2 of survey data is consistent with predictions based on thez~6 quasar luminosity function. we discuss various ways to push the candidateselection to fainter magnitudes and we expect to find about 30 new quasars downto an absolute magnitude of m_1450=-24. studying this homogeneously selectedfaint quasar population will be important to gain insight into the onset of theco-evolution of the black holes and their stellar hosts.

1507.05552	cosmology from cosmic shear with des science verification data	we present the first constraints on cosmology from the dark energy survey(des), using weak lensing measurements from the preliminary scienceverification (sv) data. we use 139 square degrees of sv data, which is lessthan 3\% of the full des survey area. using cosmic shear 2-point measurementsover three redshift bins we find $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.81\pm 0.06$ (68\% confidence), after marginalising over 7 systematics parametersand 3 other cosmological parameters. we examine the robustness of our resultsto the choice of data vector and systematics assumed, and find them to bestable. about $20$\% of our error bar comes from marginalising over shear andphotometric redshift calibration uncertainties. the current state-of-the-artcosmic shear measurements from cfhtlens are mildly discrepant with thecosmological constraints from planck cmb data; our results are consistent withboth datasets. our uncertainties are $\sim$30\% larger than those from cfhtlenswhen we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attributelargely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. we investigateconstraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the fullsurvey, the des sv constraints make negligible impact on the planckconstraints. the moderate disagreement between the cfhtlens and planck valuesof $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ is present regardless of the value of$w$.

1509.00018	cold dust emission from x-ray agn in the scuba-2 cosmology legacy  survey: dependence on luminosity, obscuration &amp; agn activity	we study the 850um emission in x-ray selected agn in the 2 sq-deg cosmosfield using new data from the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey. we find 19 850umbright x-ray agn in a high-sensitivity region covering 0.89 sq-deg with fluxdensities of s850=4-10 mjy. the 19 agn span the full range in redshift and hardx-ray luminosity covered by the sample - 0.7&lt;z&lt;3.5 and 43.2&lt;log10(lx) &lt;45. wereport a highly significant stacked 850um detection of a hard x-rayflux-limited population of 699 z&gt;1 x-ray agn - s850=0.71+/-0.08mjy. we exploretrends in the stacked 850um flux densities with redshift, finding no evolutionin the average cold dust emission over the redshift range probed. for type 1agn, there is no significant correlation between the stacked 850um flux andhard x-ray luminosity. however, in type 2 agn the stacked submm flux is afactor of 2 higher at high luminosities. when averaging over all x-rayluminosities, no significant differences are found in the stacked submm fluxesof type 1 and type 2 agn as well as agn separated on the basis of x-rayhardness ratios and optical-to-infrared colours. however, at log10(lx) &gt;44.4,dependences in average submm flux on the optical-to-infrared colours becomemore pronounced. we argue that these high luminosity agn represent a transitionfrom a secular to a merger-driven evolutionary phase where the star formationrates and accretion luminosities are more tightly coupled. stacked agn 850umfluxes are compared to the stacked fluxes of a mass-matched sample of k-bandselected non-agn galaxies. we find that at 10.5&lt;log10(m*/m0)&lt;11.5, the non-agn850um fluxes are 1.5-2x higher than in type 2 agn of equivalent mass. wesuggest these differences are due to the presence of massive dusty, redstarburst galaxies in the k-band selected non-agn sample, which are not presentin optically selected catalogues covering a smaller area.

0806.0294	fifteen new t dwarfs discovered in the ukidss large area survey	we present the discovery of fifteen new t2.5-t7.5 dwarfs (with estimateddistances between ~24-93pc, identified in the first three main data releases ofthe ukirt infrared deep sky survey. this brings the total number of t dwarfsdiscovered in the large area survey (to date) to 28. these discoveries areconfirmed by near infrared spectroscopy, from which we derive spectral types onthe unified scheme of burgasser et al. (2006). seven of the new t dwarfs havespectral types of t2.5-t4.5, five have spectral types of t5-t5.5, one is at6.5p, and two are t7-7.5. we assess spectral morphology and colours toidentify t dwarfs in our sample that may have non-typical physical properties(by comparison to solar neighbourhood populations). the colours of the fullsample of las t dwarfs show a possible trend to bluer y-j with decreasingeffective temperature beyond t8. by accounting for the main sources ofincompleteness (selection, follow-up and spatial) as well as the effects ofunresolved binarity and malmquist bias, we estimate that there are 17+-4 &gt;=t4dwarfs in the j&lt;=19 volume of the las second data release. comparing this totheoretical predictions is most consistent with a sub-stellar mass functionexponent alpha between -1.0 and 0. this is consistent with the latest2mass/sdss constraint (which is based on lower number statistics), and issignificantly lower than the alpha~1.0 suggested by l dwarf field populations,possibly a result of the lower mass range probed by the t dwarf class.

1511.07432	bright [cii] and dust emission in three z&gt;6.6 quasar host galaxies  observed by alma	we present alma detections of the [cii] 158 micron emission line and theunderlying far-infrared continuum of three quasars at 6.6&lt;z&lt;6.9 selected fromthe viking survey. the [cii] line fluxes range between 1.6-3.4 jy km/s ([cii]luminosities ~(1.9-3.9)x10^9 l_sun). we measure continuum flux densities of0.56-3.29 mjy around 158 micron (rest-frame), with implied far-infraredluminosities between (0.6-7.5)x10^12 l_sun and dust masses m_d=(0.7-24)x10^8m_sun. in one quasar we derive a dust temperature of 30^+12_-9 k from thecontinuum slope, below the canonical value of 47 k. assuming that the [cii] andcontinuum emission are powered by star formation, we find star-formation ratesfrom 100-1600 m_sun/yr based on local scaling relations. the l_[cii]/l_firratios in the quasar hosts span a wide range from (0.3-4.6)x10^-3, includingone quasar with a ratio that is consistent with local star-forming galaxies. wefind that the strength of the l_[cii] and 158 micron continuum emission in z&gt;~6quasar hosts correlate with the quasar's bolometric luminosity. in one quasar,the [cii] line is significantly redshifted by ~1700 km/s with respect to themgii broad emission line. comparing to values in the literature, we find that,on average, the mgii is blueshifted by 480 km/s (with a standard deviation of630 km/s) with respect to the host galaxy redshift, i.e. one of our quasars isan extreme outlier. through modeling we can rule out a flat rotation curve forour brightest [cii] emitter. finally, we find that the ratio of black hole massto host galaxy (dynamical) mass is higher by a factor 3-4 (with significantscatter) than local relations.

0806.4188	two new large separation gravitational lenses from sdss	we present discovery images, together with follow-up imaging andspectroscopy, of two large separation gravitational lenses found by our surveyfor wide arcs (the cassowary). the survey exploits the multicolor photometry ofthe sloan digital sky survey to find multiple blue components around redgalaxies. cassowary~2 (or "the cheshire cat") is composed of two massiveearly-type galaxies at z = 0.426 and 0.432 respectively lensing two backgroundsources, the first a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.97 and the second a highredshift galaxy (z&gt; 1.4). there are at least three images of the former sourceand probably four or more of the latter, arranged in two giant arcs. the massenclosed within the larger arc of radius 11 arcsecs is about 33 x 10^{12} solarmasses. cassowary~3 comprises an arc of three bright images of a z = 0.725source, lensed by a foreground elliptical at z = 0.274. the radius of the arcis about 4 arcsecs and the enclosed mass is 2.5 x 10^{12} solar masses.together with earlier discoveries like the cosmic horseshoe and the 8 o'clockarc, these new systems, with separations intermediate between the arcsecondseparation lenses of typical strong galaxy lensing and the larger separationcluster lenses, probe the very high end of the galaxy mass function.

astro-ph;0003198	the european large area iso survey ii: mid-infrared extragalactic source  counts	we present preliminary source counts at 6.7um and 15um from the preliminaryanalysis of the european large area iso survey, with limiting flux densities of\~2mjy at 15um &amp; ~1mjy at 6.7um. we separate the stellar contribution from theextragalactic using identifications with apm sources made with the likelihoodratio technique. we quantify the completeness &amp; reliability of our sourceextraction using (a) repeated observations over small areas, (b) cross-ids withstars of known spectral type, (c) detections of the psf wings around brightsources, (d) comparison with independent algorithms. flux calibration at 15umwas performed using stellar ids; the calibration does not agree with thepre-flight estimates, probably due to effects of detector hysteresis andphotometric aperture correction. the 6.7um extragalactic counts are broadlyreproduced in the pearson &amp; rowan-robinson model, but the franceschini et al.(1997) model underpredicts the observed source density by ~0.5-1 dex, thoughthe photometry at 6.7um is still preliminary. at 15um the extragalactic countsare in excellent agreement with the predictions of the pearson &amp; rowan-robinson(1996), franceschini et al. (1994), guiderdoni et al. (1997) and the evolvingmodels of xu et al. (1998), over 7 orders of magnitude in 15um flux density.the counts agree with other estimates from the isocam instrument at overlappingflux densities (elbaz et al. 1999), provided a consistent flux calibration isused. luminosity evolution at a rate of (1+z)^3, incorporating mid-ir spectralfeatures, provides a better fit to the 15um differential counts than (1+z)^4density evolution. no-evolution models are excluded, and implying that belowaround 10mjy at 15um the source counts become dominated by an evolvingcosmological population of dust-shrouded starbursts and/or active galaxies.

astro-ph;0007458	an efficient search for gravitationally-lensed radio lobes	we performed an automated comparison of the first radio survey with the apmoptical catalog to find radio lobes with optical counterparts. based on aninitial survey covering ~3000 square degrees, we selected a sample of 33 lenscandidates for vla confirmation. vla and optical observations of thesecandidates yielded two lens systems, one a new discovery (j0816+5003), and oneof which was previously known (j1549+3047). two other candidates have radiolobes with galaxies superposed, but lack evidence of multiple imaging. one ofour targets (j0958+2947) is a projected close pair of quasars (8'' separationat redshifts 2.064 and 2.744). our search method is highly efficient, with &gt;5%of our observing targets being lensed, compared to the usual success rate of&lt;1%. using the whole first survey, we expect to find 5--10 lenses in shortorder using this approach, and the sample could increase to hundreds of lensedlobes in the northern sky, using deeper optical surveys and planned upgrades tothe vla. such a sample would be a powerful probe of galaxy structure andevolution.

astro-ph;0012027	predicting the peculiar velocities of nearby psc-z galaxies using the  least action principle	we use the least action principle to predict the peculiar velocities of psc-zgalaxies inside $cz=2000$\km. linear theory is used to account for tidaleffects to $cz=15000$\km, and we iterate galaxy positions to account forredshift distortions. as the least action principle is valid beyond lineartheory, we can predict reliable peculiar velocities even for very nearbygalaxies (ie $cz \leq 500$\km). these predicted peculiar velocities are thencompared with the observed velocities of 12 galaxies with cepheid distances.the combination of the psc-z galaxy survey (with its large sky coverage anduniform selection), with the accurate cepheid distances, makes this comparisonrelatively free from systematic effects. we find that galaxies are good tracersof the mass, even at small ($\leq 10$\mpc) scales; and under the assumption ofno biasing, $0.25 \leq \beta \leq 0.75$ (at 90% confidence). we use thereliable predicted peculiar velocities to estimate the hubble constant \ho fromthe local volume without ``stepping up'' the distance ladder, finding aconfidence range of 65-75\kmm (at 90% confidence).

astro-ph;0403223	the star formation rate of the universe at z~6 from the hubble ultra  deep field	we determine the abundance of i'-band drop-outs in the recently-releasedhst/acs hubble ultra deep field (udf). since the majority of these sources arelikely to be z~6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the f775w i'-band andf850lp z'-band arises from lyman-alpha absorption, the number of detectedcandidates provides a valuable upper limit to the unextincted star formationrate at this redshift. we demonstrate that the increased depth of udf enablesus to reach an 8-sigma limiting magnitude of z'(ab)=28.5 (equivalent to1.5/h{70}^2 m_sun/yr at z=6, or 0.1 l*(uv) for the z~3 u-drop population),permitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved formof the luminosity function. we identify 54 galaxies (and only one star) atz'(ab)&lt;28.5 with (i'-z')&gt;1.3 over the deepest 11arcmin^2 portion of the udffield. the characteristic luminosity (l*) is consistent with values observed atz~3. the faint end slope (alpha) is less well constrained, but is consistentwith only modest evolution. the main change appears to be in the number density(phi*). specifically, and regardless of possible contamination from cool starsand lower redshift sources, the udf data support our previous result that thestar formation rate at z~6 was at least x6 less than at z~3 (stanway, bunker &amp;mcmahon 2003). this declining comoving star formation rate (0.005h{70}m_sun/yr/mpc^3 at z~6 for a salpeter imf) poses an interesting challengefor models which suggest that l&gt;0.1l* star forming galaxies at z~6 reionizedthe universe. the  short-fall in ionizing photons might be alleviated by galaxies  fainter than our limit, or a radically different imf.  alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have occurred at z&gt;&gt;6.

astro-ph;0408069	discovery of high-amplitude x-ray variability in the seyfert-liner  transition galaxy ngc7589	we present the first result of a programme to search for large fluxvariations in the x-ray sources of the xmm serendipitous survey compared toprevious rosat observations. an increase in x-ray flux by a factor &gt;10 wasdiscovered from the nucleus of the galaxy ngc7589 on a timescale of less than 5years. the 0.4-10kev xmm spectrum can be approximated by a power-law withphoton index of 1.7-1.8, though it seems to flatten above 5kev, suggesting apossible complex model, such as partial covering or disc reflection. aclassification based on an analysis of its optical spectrum places ngc7589 inthe seyfert region, but close to the seyfert-liner border-line on the agndiagnostic diagrams. we classify ngc7589 as either seyfert1.9 or lineri, in thelight of the detection of a broad h_alpha line, which makes ngc7589 an agn inthe low-luminosity regime. we interpret the observed variability in terms ofeither changes in covering factor of absorbing gas in the agn, or variabilityin the intrinsic x-ray luminosity. should the latter be the case, the inferrededdington accretion rate increased from the radiatively inefficient accretiondominated regime to a value close to the putative critical value, at which atransition of the accretion mode is supposed to take place. this possibilitypresents a new prospect of studying accretion physics in the central blackholes of external galaxies by direct observing changes of `spectral state', asis common in stellar black hole binary systems.

astro-ph;9508042	the deficit of distant galaxy clusters in the rixos x-ray survey	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems andtherefore provide an important way of studying the formation and evolution ofthe large scale structure of the universe. cluster evolution can be inferredfrom observations of the x-ray emission of the gas in distant clusters, butinterpreting these data is not straightforward. in a simplified view, clustersgrow from perturbations in the matter distribution: their intracluster gas iscompressed and shock-heated by the gravitational collapse$^{1}$. the resultingx-ray emission is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in thechanging gravitational potential. however, if processes such as radiativecooling or pre-collapse heating of the gas are important, then the x-rayevolution will be strongly influenced by the thermal history of the gas. herewe present the first results from a faint flux-limited sample of x-ray selectedclusters compiled as part of the rosat international x-ray and optical survey(rixos). very few distant clusters have been identified. most importantly,their redshift distribution appears to be inconsistent with simple models basedon the evolution of the gravitational potential. our results suggest thatradiative cooling or non-gravitational heating of the intracluster gas mustplay an important role in the evolution of clusters.

astro-ph;9608147	evolution of neutral gas at high redshift -- implications for the epoch  of galaxy formation	though observationally rare, damped lya absorption systems dominate the massdensity of neutral gas in the universe. eleven high redshift damped lya systemscovering 2.8&lt;z&lt;4.4 were discovered in 26 qsos from the apm z&gt;4 qso survey,extending these absorption system surveys to the highest redshifts currentlypossible. combining our new data set with previous surveys we find that thecosmological mass density in neutral gas, omega_g, does not rise as steeplyprior to z~2 as indicated by previous studies. there is evidence in theobserved omega_g for a flattening at z~2 and a possible turnover at z~3. whencombined with the decline at z&gt;3.5 in number density per unit redshift ofdamped systems with column densities log n(hi)&gt;21 atoms cm^-2, these resultspoint to an epoch at z&gt;3 prior to which the highest column density dampedsystems are still forming. we find that over the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;4 the totalmass in neutral gas is marginally comparable with the total visible mass instars in present day galaxies. however, if one considers the total mass visiblein stellar disks alone, ie excluding galactic bulges, the two values arecomparable. we are observing a mass of neutral gas comparable to the mass ofvisible disk stars. lanzetta, wolfe &amp; turnshek (1995) found that omega_g(z~3.5)was twice omega_g(z~2), implying a much larger amount of star formation musthave taken place between z=3.5 and z=2 than is indicated by metallicitystudies. this created a `cosmic g-dwarf problem'. the more gradual evolution ofomega_g we find alleviates this. these results have profound implications fortheories of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9608192	measurements of the cosmological parameters omega and lambda from the  first 7 supernovae at z &gt;= 0.35	we have developed a technique to systematically discover and studyhigh-redshift supernovae that can be used to measure the cosmologicalparameters. we report here results based on the initial seven of &gt;28 supernovaediscovered to date in the high-redshift supernova search of the supernovacosmology project. we find a dispersion in peak magnitudes of sigma_{m_b} =0.27 this dispersion narrows to sigma_{m_b,corr} = 0.19 after "correcting" themagnitudes using the light-curve "width-luminosity" relation found for nearby(z &lt;= 0.1) type ia supernovae from the calan/tololo survey (hamuy et al. 1996).comparing lightcurve-width-corrected magnitudes as a function of redshift ofour distant (z = 0.35-0.46) supernovae to those of nearby type ia supernovaeyields a global measurement of the mass density, omega_m = 0.88^{+0.69}_{-0.60}for a lambda = 0 cosmology. for a spatially flat universe (i.e., omega_m+omega_lambda = 1), we find omega_m = 0.94 ^{+0.34}_{-0.28} or, equivalently, ameasurement of the cosmological constant, omega_lambda = 0.06 ^{+0.28}_{-0.34}(&lt;0.51 at the 95% confidence level). for the more general friedmann-lemaitrecosmologies with independent omega_m and omega_lambda, the results arepresented as a confidence region on the omega_m-omega_lambda plane. this regiondoes not correspond to a unique value of the deceleration parameter q_0. wepresent analyses and checks for statistical and systematic errors, and alsoshow that our results do not depend on the specifics of the width-luminositycorrection. the results for omega_lambda-versus-omega_m are inconsistent withlambda-dominated, low density, flat cosmologies that have been proposed toreconcile the ages of globular cluster stars with higher hubble constantvalues.

astro-ph;9610018	detailed analysis of the cross-correlation function between the x-ray  background and foreground galaxies	recent rosat surveys suggest that galaxies constitute the new class of x-raysources required to explain the full phenomenology of the cosmic x-raybackground (xrb). to test this hypothesis, we compute the two-pointcross-correlation function wxg(theta) between 62 einstein-ipc fields (.81-3.5kev) and the apm northern galaxy catalog (13.5&lt;e&lt;19.0). at zero-lag (theta=0),we detect a 3.5sigma correlation signal with an amplitude ofwxg(0)=.045+/-.013. at non-zero lag (theta&gt;0), the angular dependence of wxghas two main features: the main signal for theta&lt;4', and an almost flat plateauwith an amplitude of wxg(theta&gt;4')=.015, likely to result from the diffusex-ray emission by clusters of galaxies. taking the point-spread function of thex-ray instrument into account, we find that the mean x-ray flux of galaxieswith &lt;e&gt;=17.5+/-.3 is (8.1+/-4.7) 10^(-16) ergs/cm^2/s. this agrees with thex-ray flux expected from earlier direct studies of brighter galaxies, whichwere shown to result in a total galaxy contribution to the xrb of about 13%. wediscuss how this powerful cross-correlation method can be used to measure theflux of x-ray sources well below the detection limit of x-ray instruments, and,perhaps, to probe otherwise undetectable faint diffuse x-ray emission.

astro-ph;9712212	discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe and  its cosmological implications	the ultimate fate of the universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can bedetermined by measuring the redshifts, apparent brightnesses, and intrinsicluminosities of very distant supernovae. recent developments have providedtools that make such a program practicable: (1) studies of relatively nearbytype ia supernovae (sne ia) have shown that their intrinsic luminosities can beaccurately determined; (2) new research techniques have made it possible toschedule the discovery and follow-up observations of distant supernovae,producing well over 50 very distant (z = 0.3 -- 0.7) sne ia to date. thesedistant supernovae provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over thepast several billion years. by making precise measurements of supernovae atstill greater distances, and thus extending this expansion history back farenough in time, we can distinguish the slowing caused by the gravitationalattraction of the universe's mass density omega_m from the effect of a possiblyinflationary pressure caused by a cosmological constant lambda. we report herethe first such measurements, with our discovery of a type ia supernova (sn1997ap) at z = 0.83. measurements at the keck ii 10-m telescope make this themost distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. over two months ofphotometry of sn 1997ap with the hubble space telescope and ground-basedtelescopes, when combined with previous measurements of nearer sne ia, suggeststhat we may live in a low mass-density universe. further supernovae atcomparable distances are currently scheduled for ground and space-basedobservations.

astro-ph;9712228	the topology of the iras point source catalogue redshift survey	we investigate the topology of the new point source catalogue redshift survey(pscz) of iras galaxies by means of the genus statistic. the survey maps thelocal universe with approximately 15000 galaxies over 84.1 per cent of the skyand provides an unprecedented number of resolution elements for the topologicalanalysis. for comparison with the pscz data we also examine the genus of largen-body simulations of four variants of the cold dark matter cosmogony. thesimulations are part of the virgo project to simulate the formation ofstructure in the universe. we assume that the statistical properties of thegalaxy distribution can be identified with those of the dark matter particlesin the simulations. we extend the standard genus analysis by examining theinfluence of sampling noise on the genus curve and introducing a statistic ableto quantify the amount of phase correlation present in the density field, the"amplitude drop" of the genus compared to a gaussian field with identical powerspectrum. the results for pscz are consistent with the hypothesis ofrandom-phase initial conditions. in particular, no strong phase correlation isdetected on scales ranging from 10 h^(-1)mpc to 32 h^(-1)mpc, whereas there isa positive detection of phase correlation at smaller scales. among thesimulations, phase correlations are detected in all models at small scales,albeit with different strengths. when scaled to a common normalization, theamplitude drop primarily depends on the shape of the power spectrum. we findthat the constant bias standard cdm model can be ruled out at high significancebecause the shape of its power spectrum is not consistent with pscz. the othercdm models with more large-scale power all fit the pscz data almost equallywell, with a slight preference for a high-density taucdm model.

astro-ph;9812256	a 1.4 ghz survey of the southern elais region	a deep survey of the european large area iso survey (elais) field in thesouthern celestial hemisphere (hereinafter s1) has been carried out with theaustralia telescope compact array (atca) at 1.4 ghz. the s1 region, coveringabout 4 square degrees, has been also surveyed in the mid- and far-infrared(5-200 micron) with the infrared space observatory (iso). the radio surveyprovides uniform coverage of the entire s1 region, with a sensitivity (5 sigma)of 0.4 mjy over the whole area and 0.2 mjy in the center. to this sensitivity,virtually all the radio counterparts of the far-infrared extragalactic isosources should be detected. this paper presents a radio sample - complete atthe 5 sigma level - consisting of 581 sources detected at 1.4 ghz. of theseradio sources, 349 have peak flux density in the range 0.2-1 mjy, forming a newhomogeneous sample of sub-mjy radio sources. due to its size, depth andmulti-waveband coverage, the sample will allow us to study in greater detailthe sub-mjy radio source population. the full catalogue will be available fromhttp://athena.ph.ac.uk/

astro-ph;9901189	the power spectrum of the psc redshift survey	we measure the redshift-space power spectrum p(k) for the recently completediras point source catalogue (psc) redshift survey, which contains 14500galaxies over 84% of the sky with 60 micron flux &gt;= 0.6 jansky. comparison withsimulations shows that our estimated errors on p(k) are realistic, and thatsystematic errors due to the finite survey volume are small for wavenumbers k&gt;~ 0.03 h mpc^-1. at large scales our power spectrum is intermediate betweenthose of the earlier qdot and 1.2 jansky surveys, but with considerably smallererror bars; it falls slightly more steeply to smaller scales. we have fittedfamilies of cdm-like models using the peacock-dodds formula for non-linearevolution; the results are somewhat sensitive to the assumed small-scalevelocity dispersion \sigma_v. assuming a realistic \sigma_v \approx 300 km/syields a shape parameter \gamma ~ 0.25 and normalisation b \sigma_8 ~ 0.75; if\sigma_v is as high as 600 km/s then \gamma = 0.5 is only marginally excluded.there is little evidence for any `preferred scale' in the power spectrum ornon-gaussian behaviour in the distribution of large-scale power.

astro-ph;9905182	a comparison of the pscz and stromlo-apm redshift surveys	we present a direct comparison of the clustering properties of two redshiftsurveys covering a common volume of space: the recently completed iras pointsource catalogue redshift survey (pscz) containing 14500 galaxies with alimiting flux of 0.6 jy at 60 microns, and the optical stromlo-apm surveycontaining 1787 galaxies in a region of 4300 deg^2 in the southern galacticcap. we use three methods to compare the clustering properties: thecounts-in-cells comparison of efstathiou (1995), the two-point crosscorrelation function, and the tegmark (1998) `null-buster' test. we find thatthe stromlo variances are systematically higher than those of pscz, as expecteddue to the deficit of early-type galaxies in iras samples. however we find thatthe differences between the cell counts are consistent with a linear biasbetween the two surveys, with a relative bias parameter b_rel =b_stromlo/b_pscz \approx 1.3 which appears approximately scale-independent. thecorrelation coefficient r between optical and iras densities on scales \sim 20mpc/h is r &gt; 0.72 at 95% c.l., placing limits on types of `stochastic bias'which affect optical and iras galaxies differently.

astro-ph;9910369	evidence for large scale structure in the lyman alpha forest at z&gt;2.6	we present a search for spatial and redshift correlations in a 2 a resolutionspectroscopic survey of the lyman alpha forest at 2.15 &lt; z &lt; 3.37 toward tenqsos concentrated within a 1-degree diameter field. we find a signal at 2.7sigma significance for correlations of the lyman alpha absorption linewavelengths between different lines of sight over the whole redshift range. thesignificance rises to 3.2 sigma if we restrict the redshift range to 2.60 &lt; z &lt;3.37, and to 4.0 sigma if we further restrict the sample to lines with restequivalent width 0.1 &lt;= w0/(a) &lt; 0.9. we conclude that a significant fractionof the lyman alpha forest arises in structures whose correlation length extendsat least over 30 arcmin (~26/h comoving mpc at z=2.6 for h0 = 100h km/s/mpc,omega=1.0, lambda=0). we have also calculated the three dimensional two pointcorrelation function for lyman alpha absorbers; we do not detect anysignificant signal in the data. however, we note that line blending prevents usfrom detecting the signal produced by a 100% overdensity of lyman alphaabsorbers in simulated data. we find that the lyman alpha forest redshiftdistribution provides a more sensitive test for such clustering than the threedimensional two point correlation function.

astro-ph;9912215	the first bright quasar survey. ii. 60 nights and 1200 spectra later	we have used the vla first survey and the apm catalog of the poss-i plates asthe basis for constructing a new radio-selected sample of optically brightquasars. this is the first radio-selected sample that is competitive in sizewith current optically selected quasar surveys. using only two basic criteria,radio-optical positional coincidence and optical morphology, quasars and bllacs can be identified with 60% selection efficiency; the efficiency increasesto 70% for objects fainter than magnitude 17. we show that a more sophisticatedselection scheme can predict with better than 85% reliability which candidateswill turn out to be quasars.  this paper presents the second installment of the first bright quasar surveywith a catalog of 636 quasars distributed over 2682 square degrees. the quasarsample is characterized and all spectra are displayed. the fbqs detects bothradio-loud and radio-quiet quasars out to a redshift z&gt;3. we find a largepopulation of objects of intermediate radio-loudness; there is no evidence inour sample for a bimodal distribution of radio characteristics. the sampleincludes ~29 broad absorption line quasars, both high and low ionization, and anumber of new objects with remarkable optical spectra.

astro-ph;9912223	the iras pscz dipole	we use the pscz iras galaxy redshift survey to analyze the cosmologicalgalaxy dipole out to a distance 300 h$^{-1}$ mpc. the masked area is filled inthree different ways, firstly by sampling the whole sky at random, secondly byusing neighbouring areas to fill a masked region, and thirdly using a sphericalharmonic analysis. the method of treatment of the mask is found to have asignificant effect on the final calculated dipole.  the conversion from redshift space to real space is accomplished by using ananalytical model of the cluster and void distribution, based on 88 nearbygroups, 854 clusters and 163 voids, with some of the clusters and all of thevoids found from the pscz database.  the dipole for the whole pscz sample appears to have converged within adistance of 200 $h^{-1}$mpc and yields a value for $\beta = \omega^{0.6}/b$ =0.75 (+0.11,-0.08), consistent with earlier determinations from iras samples bya variety of methods. for b = 1, the $2-\sigma$ range for $\omega_{o}$ is0.43-1.02.  the direction of the dipole is within 13$^o$ of the cmb dipole, the mainuncertainty in direction being associated with the masked area behind thegalactic plane. the improbability that further major contributions to thedipole amplitude will come from volumes larger than those surveyed here meansthat the question of the origin of the cmb dipole is essentially resolved.

0810.4180	discovery of a redshift 6.13 quasar in the ukirt infrared deep sky  survey	optical and near-infrared (nir) spectra are presented for ulasj131911.29+095951.4 (hereafter ulas j1319+0950), a new redshift z = 6.127 +/-0.004 quasar discovered in the third data release (dr3) of the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss). the source has y_vega = 19.10 +/- 0.03, correspondingto m_1450,ab = -27.12, which is comparable to the absolute magnitudes of the z~= 6 quasars discovered in the sdss. ulas j1319+0950 was, in fact, registeredby sdss as a faint source with z_ab = 20.1 +/- 0.1, just below thesignal--to--noise ratio limit of the sdss high-redshift quasar survey. thefaint z-band magnitude is a consequence of the weak ly alpha/n v emission line,which has a rest-frame equivalent width of only ~20 a and provides only a smallboost to the z-band flux. nevertheless, there is no evidence from thisukidss-based search for a significant population of high-redshift quasars withweak emission lines. the ly alpha optical depth to ulas j1319+0950 isconsistent with that measured towards similarly distant sdss quasars, implyingthat results from optical- and nir-selected quasars may be combined.  also presented is a new nir-spectrum of the previously discovered ukidssquasar ulas j020332.38+001229.2, which reveals the object to be a broadabsorption line quasar. the new spectrum shows that the emission linepreviously identified as ly alpha is actually n v, leading to a revisedredshift of z = 5.72, rather than z = 5.86 as previously estimated.
