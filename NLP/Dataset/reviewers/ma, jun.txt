0904.0674	old stellar population synthesis: new age and mass estimates for mayall  ii = g1	mayall ii = g1 is one of the most luminous globular clusters (gcs) in m31.here, we determine its age and mass by comparing multicolor photometry withtheoretical stellar population synthesis models. based on far- andnear-ultraviolet galex photometry, broad-band ubvri, and infrared jhk_s 2massdata, we construct the most extensive spectral energy distribution of g1 todate, spanning the wavelength range from 1538 to 20,000 a. a quantitativecomparison with a variety of simple stellar population (ssp) models yields amean age that is consistent with g1 being among the oldest building blocks ofm31 and having formed within ~1.7 gyr after the big bang. irrespective of thessp model or stellar initial mass function adopted, the resulting massestimates (of order $10^7 m_\odot$) indicate that g1 is one of the most massivegcs in the local group. however, we speculate that the cluster's exceptionallyhigh mass suggests that it may not be a genuine gc. we also derive that g1 maycontain, on average, $(1.65\pm0.63)\times10^2 l_\odot$ far-ultraviolet-bright,hot, extreme horizontal-branch stars, depending on the ssp model adopted. on ageneric level, we demonstrate that extensive multi-passband photometry coupledwith ssp analysis enables one to obtain age estimates for old ssps to a similaraccuracy as from integrated spectroscopy or resolved stellar photometry,provided that some of the free parameters can be constrained independently.

0905.4337	variable stars in the field of the open cluster ngc 2126	we report the results of a time-series ccd photometric survey of variablestars in the field of the open cluster ngc 2126. in about one square degreefield covering the cluster, a total number of 21 variable candidates aredetected during this survey, of which 16 are newly found. the periods,classifications and spectral types of 14 newly discovered variables arediscussed, which consist of six eclipsing binaries systems, three pulsatingvariable stars, three long period variables, one rs cvn star, and one w uma or$\delta$ scuti star. in addition, there are two variable candidates, theproperties of which cannot be determined in this paper. by a method based onfitting spectral energy distributions(seds) of stars with theoretical ones, themembership probabilities and the fundamental parameters of this cluster aredetermined. as a result, five variables are probably members of ngc 2126. thefundamental parameters of the this cluster are determined as: the metallicityto be 0.008 $z_\odot$, the age $\log(t)$= 8.95, the distance modulus$(m-m)_{0}$= 10.34 and the reddening value $e(b-v)$=0.55 mag.

0909.3737	the orbits of open clusters in the galaxy	we present and analyze kinematics and orbits for a sample of 488 openclusters in the galaxy. the velocity ellipsoid for our present sample isderived as ($\sigma_{u}$, $\sigma_{v}$, $\sigma_{w})$=$(28.7$, 15.8, 11.0) kms$^{-1}$ which represents a young thin disc population. we also confirm thatthe velocity dispersions increase with the age of cluster subsample. the orbitsof open clusters are calculated with three galactic gravitational potentialmodels. the errors of orbital parameters are also calculated considering theintrinsic variation of the orbital parameters and the effects of observationaluncertainties. the observational uncertainties dominate the errors of derivedorbital parameters. the vertical motions of clusters calculated using differentgalactic disc models are rather different. the observed radial metallicitygradient of clusters is derived with a slope of $b=-0.070\pm0.011$ dexkpc$^{-1}$. the radial metallicity gradient of clusters based on theirapogalactic distances is also derived with a slope of $b=-0.082\pm0.014$ dexkpc$^{-1}$. the distribution of derived orbital eccentricities for openclusters is very similar to the one derived for the field population of dwarfsand giants in the thin disc.

1001.3939	spectral energy distributions and age estimates of 104 m31 globular  clusters	we present photometry of 104 m31 globular clusters (gcs) and gc candidates in15 intermediate-band filters of the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc)photometric system. the gcs and gc candidates were selected from the revisedbologna catalog (v.3.5). we obtain the cluster ages by comparing thephotometric data with up-to-date theoretical synthesis models. the photometricdata used are {\sl galex} far- and near-ultraviolet and 2mass near-infrared$jhk_{\rm s}$ magnitudes, combined with optical photometry. the ages of oursample clusters cover a large range, although most clusters are younger than 10gyr. combined with the ages obtained in our series of previous papers focusingon the m31 gc system, we present the full m31 gc age distribution. the m31 gcsystem contains populations of young and intermediate-age gcs, as well as the`usual' complement of well-known old gcs, i.e., gcs of similar age as themajority of the galactic gcs. in addition, young gcs (and gc candidates) aredistributed nearly uniformly in radial distance from the center of m31, whilemost old gcs (and gc candidates) are more strongly concentrated.

1004.1002	the correlations between the intrinsic colors and spectroscopic  metallicities of m31 globular clusters	we present the correlations between the spectroscopic metallicities andninety-three different intrinsic colors of m31 globular clusters, includingseventy-eight batc colors and fifteen sdss and near infrared ugrizk colors. thebatc colors were derived from the archival images of thirteen filters (from cto p), which were taken by beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multicolorsky survey with a 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope. the spectroscopicmetallicities adopted in our work were from literature. we fitted thecorrelations of seventy-eight different batc colors and the metallicities for123 old confirmed globular clusters, and the result implies that correlationcoefficients of twenty-three colors r&gt;0.7. especially, for the colors$(f-k)_0$, $(f-o)_0$, and $(h-k)_0$, the correlation coefficients are r&gt;0.8.meanwhile, we also note that the correlation coefficients (r) approach zero for$(g-h)_0$, $(k-m)_0$, $(k-n)_0$, and $(m-n)_0$, which are likely to beindependent of metallicity. similarity, we fitted the correlations ofmetallicity and ugrizk colors for 127 old confirmed gcs. the result indicatesthat all these colors are metal-sensitive (r&gt;0.7), of which $(u-k)_0$ is themost metal-sensitive color. our work provides an easy way to simply estimatethe metallicity from colors.

1008.2993	determination of fundamental properties of an m31 globular cluster from  main-sequence photometry	m31 globular cluster b379 is the first extragalactic cluster, the age ofwhich was determined by main-sequence photometry. in this method, the age of acluster is obtained by fitting its cmd with stellar evolutionary models.however, different stellar evolutionary models use different parameters ofstellar evolution, such as range of stellar masses, different opacities andequations of state, and different recipes, and so on. so, it is interesting tocheck whether different stellar evolutionary models can give consistent resultsfor the same cluster. brown et al. (2004a) constrained the age of b379 bycomparing its cmd with isochrones of the 2006 vandenberg models. using sspmodels of bc03 and its multi-photometry, ma et al. (2007) independentlydetermined the age of b379, which is in good agreement with the determinationof brown et al. (2004a). the bc03 models are calculated based on the padovaevolutionary tracks. it is necessary to check whether the age of b379 which,being determined based on the padova evolutionary tracks, is in agreement withthe determination of brown et al. (2004a). so, in this paper, we re-determineits age using isochrones of the padova stellar evolutionary models. inaddition, the metal abundance, the distance modulus, and the reddening valuefor b379 are also determined in this paper. the results obtained in this paperare consistent with the previous determinations, which including the ageobtained by brown et al. (2004a). so, this paper confirms the consistence ofthe age scale of b379 between the padova isochrones and the 2006 vandenbergisochrones, i.e. the results' comparison between brown et al. (2004a) and ma etal. (2007) is meaningful. the results obtained in this paper are: themetallicity [m/h]=-0.325, the age $\tau=11.0\pm1.5$ gyr, the reddening valuee(b-v)=0.08, and the distance modulus $(m-m)_{0}=24.44\pm0.10$.

0708.4083	metal abundance properties of m81 globular cluster system	this paper is the third in the series of papers on m81 globular clusters. inthis paper, we present spatial and metal abundance properties of 95 m81globular clusters, which comprise nearly half of all the m81 globular clustersystem. these globular clusters are divided into two m81 metallicity groups bya kmm test. our results show that, the metal-rich clusters did not demonstratea centrally concentrated spatial distribution as ones in m31, and metal-poorclusters tend to be less spatially concentrated. in other words, thedistribution of the metal-rich clusters in m81 is not very similar to that ofm31. most of the metal-rich clusters distribute at projected radii of 4-8 kpc.it is also noted that the metal-rich clusters distribute within the inner 20kpc, and the metal-poor ones do out to radii of ~40 kpc. like our galaxy andm31, the metallicity distribution of globular clusters in m81 alonggalactocentric radius suggests that some dissipation occurred during theformation of the globular cluster system, i.e. smooth, pressure-supportedcollapse models of galaxies are unlikely to produce such radial distribution ofmetallicity presented in this paper. there is not evident correlation betweenglobular cluster luminosity and metallicity in m81 globular clusters. theoverwhelming conclusion of this paper seems to be that a more complete andthorough cluster search is needed in m81.

1101.1567	age and mass constraints for a young massive cluster in m31 based on  spectral-energy-distribution fitting	vdb0-b195d is a massive, blue star cluster in m31. it was observed as part ofthe beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multicolor sky survey using 15intermediate-band filters covering a wavelength range of 3000--10,000 \aa.based on aperture photometry, we obtain its spectral-energy distribution (sed)as defined by the 15 batc filters. we apply previously established relationsbetween the batc intermediate-band and the johnson-cousins $ubvri$ broad-bandsystems to convert our batc photometry to the standard system. a detailedcomparison shows that our newly derived $vri$ magnitudes are fully consistentwith previous results, while our new $b$ magnitude agrees to within $2\sigma$.in addition, we determine the cluster's age and mass by comparing its sed (from3000 to 20,000{\aa}, comprising photometric data in the 15 batc intermediatebands, optical broad-band $bvri$, and 2mass near-infrared $jhk_{\rm s}$ data)with theoretical stellar population synthesis models, resulting in age and massdeterminations of $60.0\pm 8.0$~myr and $(1.1-1.6) \times 10^5 m_\odot$,respectively. this age and mass confirms previous suggestions that vdb0-b195dis a young massive cluster in m31.

1101.1569	detailed study of b037 based on {\sl hst} images	b037 is of interest because it is both the most luminous and the most highlyreddened cluster known in m31. images of deep observations and of highlyspatial resolutions with the advanced camera for surveys on the {\sl hst}firstly show that this cluster is crossed by a dust lane. photometric data inthe f606w and f814w filters obtained in this paper provide that, colors of($\rm {f606w-f814w}$) in the dust lane are redder $\sim 0.4$ mags than ones inthe other regions of b037. the {\sl hst} images show that, this dust lane seemsto be contained in b037, not from the m31 disk or the milky way. as we know,the formation of dust requires gas with a rather high metallicity. however,b037 has a low metallicity to be $\rm [fe/h]=-1.07\pm 0.20$. so, it seemsimprobable that the observed dust lane is physically associated with b037. itis clear that the origin of this dust lane is worthy of future study. inaddition, based on these images, we present the precise variation ofellipticity and position angle, and of surface brightness profile, anddetermine the structural parameters of b037 by fitting a single-mass isotropicking model. in the f606w filter, we derive the best-fitting scale radius,$r_0=0.56\pm0.02\arcsec~(=2.16\pm0.08~\rm{pc})$, a tidal radius,$r_t=8.6\pm0.4\arcsec~(=33.1\pm1.5~\rm{pc})$, and a concentration index $c=\log(r_t/r_0)=1.19\pm0.02$. in the f814w filter, we derive$r_0=0.56\pm0.01\arcsec~(=2.16\pm0.04~\rm{pc})$,$r_t=8.9\pm0.3\arcsec~(=34.3\pm1.2~\rm{pc})$, and $c=\log(r_t/r_0)=1.20\pm0.01$. the extinction-corrected central surface brightness is$\mu_0=13.53\pm 0.03~{\rm mag~arcsec^{-2}}$ in the f606w filter, and $12.85\pm0.03~{\rm mag~arcsec^{-2}}$ in the f814w filter, respectively.

1101.3375	multicolor photometry study of the galaxy cluster a2589: dynamics,  luminosity function and star formation history	in this paper we present a multicolor photometry for a2589 ($z=0.0414$) with15 intermediate bands in the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) systemwhich covers an optical wavelength range from 3000 \aa\ to 10000 \aa. thespectral energy distributions (seds) for more than 5000 sources are achieveddown to {\it v} $\sim$ 20 mag in about 1 deg$^{2}$ field. a2589 has been alsocovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) in photometric mode only. across-identification of the batc-detected galaxies with the sdss photometriccatalog achieves 1199 galaxies brighter than $i=19.5$ mag, among which 68member galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts are found. after combiningthe sdss five-band photometric data and the batc seds, the technique ofphotometric redshift is applied to these galaxies for selecting faint membergalaxies. the color-magnitude relation is taken as a further restriction ofearly-type cluster galaxies. as a result, 106 galaxies are newly selected asmember galaxies. spatial distribution of member galaxies shows a north-southelongation which agrees with the x-ray brightness profile and the orientationof central cd galaxy, ngc 7647. no substructures are detected on the basis ofpositions and radial velocities of cluster galaxies, indicating that a2589 is awell-relaxed system. the luminosity function of a2589 exhibits a peak at $m_{r}\sim -20$ mag and a dip at $m_{r} \sim -19 $ mag. the low-density outer regionsare the preferred habitat of faint galaxies. with the evolutionary populationsynthesis model, pegase, the environmental effect on the star formationproperties for 68 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies is studied. theoutlier faint galaxies tend to have longer time scales of star formation,shorter mean stellar ages, and lower metallicities of interstellar medium,which can be interpreted in the context of hierarchical cosmological scenario.

1104.5177	stellar population properties and evolution analysis of ngc 628 with the  panchromatic photometry	panchromatic spectral energy distribution (sed) from the ultraviolet (uv),optical to infrared (ir) photometry of ngc 628, combined with the evolutionarystellar population synthesis, is used to derive the spatially resolved age,metallicity and reddening maps. these parameter distributions show that thebulge of this galaxy is a disk-like pseudobulge, which has the s{\'e}rsic indexclose to the exponential law, rich gas, and a young circumnuclear ringstructure. we also discover the disk has two distinct regions with differentradial age and metallicity gradients. the inner region is older and has a muchsteeper age gradient than the outer region of the disk. both these two regionsand the central young structure can be seen in the radial profile of theoptical color. based on the age and reddening distributions, we consider thatthe pseudobulge and disk are likely to have grown via the secular evolution,which is the redistribution of mass and energy through the angular momentumtransport caused by the non-axisymmetric potential of the spirals. however,possible gas accretion events could affect the outer region of the disk, due toabundant h{\sc i} gas accumulating in the outer disk.

1108.1020	optical variability and colour behaviour of 3c 345	the colour behaviour of blazars is a subject of much debate. one argument isthat the bl lac objects show bluer-when-brighter chromatism while theflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) display redder-when-brighter trend. base ona 3.5-year three-colour monitoring programme, we studied the opticalvariability and colour behaviour of one fsrq, 3c 345. there is at least oneoutburst in this period. the overall variation amplitude is 2.640 mags in the$i$ band. intra-night variability was observed on two nights. thebluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter chromatisms were simultaneouslyobserved in this object when using different pairs of passbands to compute thecolours. the bluer-when-brighter chromatism is a shared property with the bllacs, while the redder-when-brighter trend is likely due to two less variableemission features, the mg\,{\sc ii} line and the blue bump, at shortwavelengths. with numerical simulations, we show that some other strong butless variable emission lines in the spectrum of fsrqs may also significantlyalter their colour behaviour. then the colour behaviour of an fsrq is linkednot only to the emission process in the relativistic jet, but also to theredshift, the passbands used for computing the colour and the strengths of theless variable emission features relative to the strength of the non-thermalcontinuum.

1108.2121	spectroscopic study of globular clusters in the halo of m31 with  xinglong 2.16m telescope	we present the spectroscopic observations for 11 confirmed globular clustersof m31 with the omr spectrograph on 2.16m telescope at xinglong site ofnational astronomical observatories, chinese academy of sciences. nine of oursample clusters are located in the halo of m31 and the most remote one is outto a projected radius of 78.75 kpc from the galactic center. for all our sampleclusters, we measured the lick absorption-line indices and the radialvelocities. it is noted that most gcs of our sample are distinct from the hirotation curve of m31 galaxy, especially for b514, mcgc5, h12 and b517,suggesting that most of our sample clusters do not have kinematic associationwith the star forming young disk of the galaxy. we fitted the absorption lineindices with the updated stellar population model thomas et al. (2010) with twodifferent tracks of cassisi and padova, separately, by applying the$\chi^2-$minimization method. the fitting results show that all our sampleclusters are older than 10 gyr, and metal-poor ($-0.91 \le $ [fe/h] $\le -2.38$dex). after merging the spectroscopic metallicity of our work with thepreviously published ones, we extended the cluster sample out to a projectedradius of 117 kpc from the galaxy's center. we found the metallicity gradientfor all the confirmed clusters exists with a slope of $-0.028\pm0.001$ dexkpc$^{-1}$. however, the slope turns to be $-0.018\pm0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ forall the halo clusters, which is much shallower. if we only consider the outerhalo clusters with $r_{\rm p}&gt;25$ kpc, the slope becomes $-0.010\pm0.002$ dexkpc$^{-1}$ and if one cluster g001 is excluded from the outer halo sample, theslope is $-0.004\pm0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. thus we conclude that metallicitygradient for m31 outer halo clusters is not significant, which agrees well withthe previous findings.

1203.5588	structural parameters for globular clusters in the outer halo of m31	in this paper, we present internal surface brightness profiles, using imagesin the f606w and f814w filter bands observed with the advanced camera forsurveys on the {\it hubble space telescope}, for ten globular clusters (gcs) inthe outer halo of m31. standard king models are fitted to the profiles toderive their structural and dynamical parameters. the results show that, ingeneral, the properties of clusters in m31 and the milky way fall in the sameregions of parameter spaces. the outer halo gcs of m31 have largerellipticities than most of gcs in m31 and the milky way. their largeellipticities may be due to galaxy tides coming from satellite dwarf galaxiesof m31 or may be related to the apparently more vigorous accretion or mergerhistory that m31 has experienced. the tight correlation of cluster bindingenergy $e_b$ with mass $m_{\rm mod}$ indicates that, the "fundamental plane"does exist for clusters, regardless of their host environments, which isconsistent with previous studies.

1204.1842	multicolor photometry of the nearby galaxy cluster a119	this paper presents multicolor optical photometry of the nearby galaxycluster abell 119 (z = 0:0442) with the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut(batc) system of 15 intermediate bands. within the batc viewing field of 58'*58', there are 368 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts, including 238member galaxies (called sample i). based on the spectral energy distributions(seds) of 1376 galaxies brighter than ibatc = 19:5, photometric redshifttechnique and the color-magnitude relation of earlytype galaxies are applied toselect faint member galaxies. as a result, 117 faint galaxies were selected asnew member galaxies. combined with sample i, an enlarged sample (called sampleii) of 355 member galaxies is obtained. spatial distribution and localizedvelocity structure for two samples demonstrate that a119 is a dynamicallycomplex cluster with at least three prominent substructures in the centralregion within 1 mpc. a large velocity dispersion for the central clumpindicates a merging along the line of sight. no significant evidences formorphology and luminosity segregations are found in both samples. with theevolutionary synthesis model pegase, environmental effect on the star formationproperties is confirmed. faint galaxies in low-density region tend to havelonger time scales of star formation, smaller mean stellar ages, and lowermetallicities of interstellar medium, which is in agreement with the context ofhierarchical cosmological scenario.

1205.4822	an updated catalog of m33 clusters and candidates: $ubvri$ photometry,  and some statistical results	we present $ubvri$ photometry for 392 star clusters and candidates in thefield of m33, which are selected from the most recent star cluster catalog. inthis catalog, the authors listed star clusters' parameters such as clusterpositions, magnitudes and colors in the $ubvrijhk_s$ filters, and so on.however, a large fraction of objects in this catalog do not have previouslypublished photometry. photometry is performed using archival images from thelocal group galaxies survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the major axis ofm33. detailed comparisons show that, in general, our photometry is consistentwith previous measurements. positions (right ascension and declination) forsome clusters are corrected here. combined with previous literature, weconstitute a large sample of m33 star clusters. based on this cluster sample,we present some statistical results: none of the m33 youngest clusters ($\sim10^7$ yr) have masses approaching $10^5$ $m_{\odot}$; roughly half the starclusters are consistent with the $10^4$ to $10^5$ $m_{\odot}$ mass models; thecontinuous distribution of star clusters along the model line indicates thatm33 star clusters have been formed continuously from the epoch of the firststar cluster formation until recent times; there are $\sim 50$ star clusterswhich being overlapped with the galactic globular clusters on the color-colordiagram, and these clusters are old globular clusters candidates in m33.

1208.6078	type iin supernova sn 2010jl: optical observations for over 500 days  after explosion	we present extensive optical observations of a type iin supernova (sn) 2010jlfor the first 1.5 years after the discovery. the ubvri light curvesdemonstrated an interesting two-stage evolution during the nebular phase, whichalmost flatten out after about 90 days from the optical maximum. sn 2010jl hasone of the highest intrinsic h_alpha luminosity ever recorded for a sn iin,especially at late phase, suggesting a strong interaction of sn ejecta with thedense circumstellar material (csm) ejected by the progenitor. this is alsoindicated by the remarkably strong balmer lines persisting in the opticalspectra. one interesting spectral evolution about sn 2010jl is the appearanceof asymmetry of the balmer lines. these lines can be well decomposed into anarrow component and an intermediate-width component. the intermediate-widthcomponent showed a steady increase in both strength and blueshift with timeuntil t ~ 400 days after maximum, but it became less blueshifted at t ~ 500days when the line profile appeared relatively symmetric again. owing to that apure reddening effect will lead to a sudden decline of the light curves and aprogressive blueshift of the spectral lines, we therefore propose that theasymmetric profiles of h lines seen in sn 2010jl is unlikely due to theextinction by newly formed dust inside the ejecta, contrary to the explanationby some early studies. based on a simple csm-interaction model, we speculatethat the progenitor of sn 2010jl may suffer a gigantic mass loss (~ 30-50m_sun) in a few decades before explosion. considering a slow moving stellarwind (e.g., ~ 28 km/s) inferred for the preexisting, dense csm shell and theextremely high mass-loss rate (1-2 m_sun per yr), we suggest that theprogenitor of sn 2010jl might have experienced a red supergiant stage andexplode finally as a post-red supergiant star with an initial mass above 30-40m_sun.

1208.6419	age and mass studies for young star clusters in m31 from seds-fit	in this paper, we present photometry for young star clusters in m31, whichare selected from caldwell et al. these star clusters have been observed aspart of the beijing--arizona--taiwan--connecticut (batc) multicolor sky surveyfrom 1995 february to 2008 march. the batc images including these star clustersare taken with 15 intermediate-band filters covering 3000--10000 \aa. combinedwith photometry in the {\sl galex} far- and near-ultraviolet, broad-band$ubvri$, sdss $ugriz$, and infrared $jhk_{\rm s}$ of two micron all sky survey,we obtain their accurate spectral energy distributions (seds) from 1538-20000\aa. we derive these star clusters' ages and masses by comparing their sedswith stellar population synthesis models. our results are in good agreementwith previous determinations. the mean value of age and mass of young clusters($&lt;2$ gyr) is about 385 myr and $2\times 10^4 {m_\odot}$, respectively. thereare two distinct peaks in the age distribution, a highest peak at age $\sim$ 60myr and a secondary peak around 250 myr, while the mass distribution shows asingle peak around $10^4 {m_\odot}$. a few young star clusters have two-bodyrelaxation times greater than their ages, indicating that those clusters havenot been well dynamically relaxed and therefore have not established thethermal equilibrium. there are several regions showing aggregations of youngstar clusters around the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring, indicating that thedistribution of the young star clusters is well correlated with m31'sstar-forming regions. the young massive star clusters (age $\leq 100$ myr andmass $\geq 10^4 {m_\odot}$) show apparent concentration around the ringsplitting region, suggesting a recent passage of a satellite galaxy (m32)through m31 disk.

1211.2069	metal abundance and kinematical properties of m81 globular cluster  system	in this paper, we presented metal abundance properties of 144 m81 globularclusters. these globulars consist of the largest globular cluster sample in m81till now. our main results are: the distribution of metallicities are bimodal,with metallicity peaks at [fe/h]\sim-1.51 and -0.58, and the metal-poorglobular clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated than the metal-richones; the metal-rich globular clusters in m81 do not demonstrate a centrallyconcentrated spatial distribution as the metal-rich ones in m31 do; like ourgalaxy and m31, the globular clusters in m81 have a small radial metallicitygradient. these results are consistent with those obtained based on a smallsample of m81 globular clusters. in addition, this paper showed that there isevidence that a strong rotation of the m81 globular cluster system around theminor axis exists, and that rotation is present in the metal-rich globularcluster subsample, while the metal-poor globular cluster subsample shows noevidence for rotation. the most significant difference between the rotation ofthe metal-rich and metal-poor globular clusters occurs at intermediateprojected galactocentric radii. the results of this paper confirm theconclusion of schroder et al. that m81's metal-rich globular clusters atintermediate projected radii were associated with a thick disk of m81.

1305.0364	structural parameters for globular clusters in m31	in this paper, we present surface brightness profiles for 79 globularclusters in m31, using images observed with {\it hubble space telescope}, someof which are from new observations. the structural and dynamical parameters arederived from fitting the profiles to several different models for the firsttime. the results show that in the majority of cases, king models fit the m31clusters as well as wilson models, and better than s\'{e}rsic models. however,there are 11 clusters best fitted by s\'{e}rsic models with the s\'{e}rsicindex $n&gt;2$, meaning that they have cuspy central density profiles. theseclusters may be the well-known core-collapsed candidates. there is a bimodalityin the size distribution of m31 clusters at large radii, which is differentfrom their galactic counterparts. in general, the properties of clusters in m31and the milky way fall in the same regions of parameter spaces. the tightcorrelations of cluster properties indicate a "fundamental plane" for clusters,which reflects some universal physical conditions and processes operating atthe epoch of cluster formation.

(2) more magnetic elements with opposite polarities in the quietregion are connected by arch filaments, estimating from magnetograms andh${\alpha}$ images. (3) we measured the magnetic flux of about 1000 magneticelements in each observing region. the flux distribution of network andintranetwork (in) elements is similar in both polarities in the quiet region.for network fields in the coronal hole, the number of negative elements is muchmore than that of positive elements. however for the in fields, the number ofpositive elements is much more than that of negative elements. (4) in thecoronal hole, the fraction of negative flux change obviously with differentthreshold flux density. 73% of the magnetic fields with flux density largerthan 2 gauss is negative polarity, and 95% of the magnetic fields is negative,if we only measure the fields with their flux density larger than 20 gauss. ourresults display that in a coronal hole, stronger fields is occupied by onepredominant polarity; however the majority of weaker fields, occupied by theother polarity.

1403.3490	estimation of absolute magnitude-dependent galactic model parameters in  intermediate latitude with sdss and scuss	based on sdss and south galactic cap of u-band sky survey (scuss) early data,we use star counts method to estimate the galactic structure parameters in anintermediate latitude with 10,180 main-sequence (ms) stars in absolutemagnitude interval of $4 \leq m_r \leq 13$. we divide the absolute magnitudeinto five intervals:$4 \leq m_r &lt; 5$, $5 \leq m_r &lt; 6$, $6 \leq m_r &lt; 8$, $8\leq m_r &lt; 10$, $10 \leq m_r \leq 13$, and estimate the galactic structureparameters in each absolute magnitude interval to explore their possiblevariation with the absolute magnitude. our study shows the parameters depend onabsolute magnitude. for the thin disk, the intrinsic faint ms stars have largelocal space density and they tend to stay close to the galactic plane. aplausible explanation is that faint ms stars with long lifetime experience longgravitational interaction time result in a short scaleheight. however, for thethick disk, the parameters show a complex trend with absolute magnitude, whichmay imply the complicated original of the thick disk. for the halo, theintrinsic faint ms stars have large local density and small axial ratio, whichindicate a flattened inner halo and a more spherical outer halo.

astro-ph;0002477	dependence of spiral galaxy distribution on viewing angle in rc3	the normalized inclination distributions are presented for the spiralgalaxies in rc3. the results show that, except for the bin of$81^{\circ}$-$90^{\circ}$, in which the apparent minor isophotal diameters thatare used to obtain the inclinations, are affected by the central bulges, thedistributions for sa, sab, scd and sd are well consistent with the monte-carlosimulation of random inclinations within 3-$\sigma$, and sb and sbc almost, butsc is different. one reason for the difference between the real distributionand the monte-carlo simulation of sc may be that some quite inclined spirals,the arms of which are inherently loosely wound on the galactic plane and shouldbe classified to sc galaxies, have been incorrectly classified to the earlierones, because the tightness of spiral arms which is one of the criteria of thehubble classification in rc3 is different between on the galactic plane and onthe tangent plane of the celestial sphere. our result also implies that theremight exist biases in the luminosity functions of individual hubble types ifspiral galaxies are only classified visually.

astro-ph;0209460	photometric redshift determination with the batc multicolor system	in this paper, we present the methodology of photometric redshiftdetermination with the batc 15-color system by using hyperz program. bothsimulated galaxies and real galaxies with known redshifts were used to estimatethe accuracy of redshifts inferred from the multicolor photometry. from thetest with simulated galaxies, the uncertainty in the inferred redshifts isabout $0.02\sim0.03$ for a given range of photometric uncertainty of $0.05 \sim0.10$. the results with the 27 real galaxies are in good agreement with thesimulated ones. the advantage of using batc intermediate-band system to deriveredshift is clear through the comparison with the ubvri broad-band system. theaccuracy in redshift determination with batc system is mainly affected by theselection of filters and the photometric uncertainties in the observation. whenwe take the limiting magnitudes of the 15 filters into account, we find thatredshift can be determined with good accuracy for galaxies with redshifts lessthan 0.5, using only filters with central wavelengths shorter than 6000 a.

astro-ph;0612368	age constraints for an m31 globular cluster from seds-fit	we have constrained the age of the globular cluster s312 in the andromedagalaxy (m31) by comparing its multicolor photometry with theoretical stellarpopulation synthesis models. this is both a check on the age of this globularcluster, as well a check on our methodology. main-sequence photometry has beenthe most direct method for determining the age of a star cluster. s312 wasobserved as part of the beijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multicolorsky survey from 1995 february to 2003 december. the photometry of batc imagesfor s312 was taken with 9 intermediate-band filters covering 5000-10000\aa.combined with photometry in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) of {\sl galex},broad-band $ubvr$ and infrared $jhk_s$ of 2mass, we obtained the accuratespectral energy distributions (seds) of s312 from 2267-20000\aa. a quantitativecomparison to simple stellar population models yields an age of$9.5_{-0.99}^{+1.15}$ gyr, which is in very good agreement with the previousdetermination by main-sequence photometry. s312 has a mass of$9.8\pm{1.85}\times 10^5 \rm m_\odot$, and is a medium-mass globular cluster inm31. by analysis of errors of ages determined based on the sed fitting methodof this paper, secure age constraints are derived with errors of $&lt; 3$ gyr forages younger than 9 gyr. in fact, the theoretical seds are not sensitive to thevariation of age for ages greater than $\sim 10$ gyr. therefore, for globularclusters as old as the majority of the galactic gcs, our method do notdistinguish them accurately. we emphasize that our results show that even withmultiband photometry spanning nuv to $k_s$, our age constraints from sedfitting are distressingly uncertain, which has implications for age derivationsin extragalactic globular cluster systems.

astro-ph;0701282	batc 13-band photometry of open cluster ngc 7789	we present 13-band ccd intermediate-band spectrophotometry of a fieldcentered on the open cluster ngc 7789 from 400 to nearly 1000 nm, taken withbeijing-arizona-taiwan-connecticut (batc) multi-color survey photometricsystem. by comparing observed spectral energy distributions of ngc 7789 starswith theoretical ones, the fundamental parameters of this cluster are derived:an age of $1.4\pm0.1$ gyr, a distance modulus $(m-m)_{0}=11.27\pm0.04$, areddening $e(b-v)=0.28\pm0.02$, and a metallicity with the solar composition$z=0.019$. when the surface density profile for member stars with limitingmagnitudes of 19.0 in the batc $e$ band ($\lambda_{\textrm{eff}}=4925$ \aa) isfitted by king model, the core radius $r_{c}=7.52\arcmin$ and the tidal radius$r_{t}=28.84\arcmin$ are derived for ngc 7789. the observed mass function (mf)for main sequence stars of ngc 7789 with masses from 0.95 to 1.85 $m_{\odot}$is fitted with a power-law function $\phi(m)\propto m^{\alpha}$ and the slope$\alpha=-0.96$ is derived. strong mass segregation in ngc 7789 is reflected inthe significant variation of the concentration parameters $c_{0}=\log(r_{t}/r_{c})$ for member stars of ngc 7789 within different mass ranges:$c_{0}=1.02$ for most of massive stars; $c_{0}=0.37$ for the lowest-mass msstars. strong mass segregation in ngc 7789 is also indicated in the significantvariation of the slopes $\alpha$ in different spatial regions of the cluster:the mf for stars within the core region has $\alpha=-0.71$, much flatter thanthat for stars in external regions of the cluster ($\alpha=-1.20$).

0812.2820	refinements of lattice paths with flaws	the classical chung-feller theorem [2] tells us that the number of dyck pathsof length $n$ with $m$ flaws is the $n$-th catalan number and independent on$m$. in this paper, we consider the refinements of dyck paths with flaws byfour parameters, namely peak, valley, double descent and double ascent. let${p}_{n,m,k}$ be the number of all the dyck paths of semi-length $n$ with $m$flaws and $k$ peaks. first, we derive the reciprocity theorem for thepolynomial $p_{n,m}(x)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^np_{n,m,k}x^k$. then we find thechung-feller properties for the sum of $p_{n,m,k}$ and $p_{n,m,n-k}$. finally,we provide a chung-feller type theorem for dyck paths of length $n$ with $k$double ascents: the number of all the dyck paths of semi-length $n$ with $m$flaws and $k$ double ascents is equal to the number of all the dyck paths thathave semi-length $n$, $k$ double ascents and never pass below the x-axis, whichis counted by the narayana number. let ${v}_{n,m,k}$ (resp. $d_{n,m,k}$) be thenumber of all the dyck paths of semi-length $n$ with $m$ flaws and $k$ valleys(resp. double descents). some similar results are derived.
