0907.0054	new limits on radio emission from x-ray dim isolated neutron stars	we have carried out a search for radio emission at 820 mhz from six x-ray dimisolated neutron stars with the robert c. byrd green bank radio telescope. notransient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast fouriertransform, and single-pulse searches. the corresponding flux limits are about0.01 mjy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for theparticular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2%, and 20 mjy for singledispersed pulses. these are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emissionfrom x-ray dim isolated neutron stars. there is no evidence for isolated radiopulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients.our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lowerthan those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-periodnearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the earth. totest the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to providea 1 sigma probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. we also give adetailed description of our implementation of the fast folding algorithm.

0907.3486	double and single recycled pulsars: an evolutionary puzzle?	we investigate the statistics of isolated recycled pulsars and double neutronstar binaries in the galactic disk. since recycled pulsars are believed to formthrough accretion and spinup in close binaries, the isolated objects presumablyoriginate from disrupted progenitors of double neutron stars. there are acomparable number of double neutron star systems compared to isolated recycledpulsars. we find that standard evolutionary models cannot explain this fact,predicting several times the number of isolated recycled pulsars than those indouble neutron star systems. we demonstrate, through population synthesiscalculations, that the velocity distribution of isolated recycled pulsars isbroader than for binary systems. when this is accounted for in a model forradio pulsar survey selection effects, which include the effects of dopplersmearing for the double neutron star binaries, we find that there is a small(25%) bias towards the detection of double neutron star systems. this bias,however, is not significant enough to explain the observational discrepancy ifstandard (sigma = 265 km/s) neutron star natal kick velocities are invoked inbinary population syntheses. population syntheses in which the 1d maxwellianvelocity dispersion of the natal kick is sigma=170 km/s are consistent with theobservations. these conclusions further support earlier findings the neutronstars formed in close interacting binaries receive significantly smaller natalkicks than the velocities of galactic single pulsars would seem to indicate.

0908.1689	pulsar science with the five hundred metre aperture spherical telescope	with a collecting area of 70 000 m^2, the five hundred metre aperturespherical telescope (fast) will allow for great advances in pulsar astronomy.we have performed simulations to estimate the number of previously unknownpulsars fast will find with its 19-beam or possibly 100-beam receivers fordifferent survey strategies. with the 19-beam receiver, a total of 5200previously unknown pulsars could be discovered in the galactic plane, includingabout 460 millisecond pulsars (msps). such a survey would take just over 200days with eight hours survey time per day. we also estimate that, with about 80six-hour days, a survey of m31 and m33 could yield 50--100 extra-galacticpulsars. a 19-beam receiver would produce just under 500 mb of data per secondand requires about 9 tera-ops to perform the major part of a real timeanalysis. we also simulate the logistics of high-precision timing of msps withfast. timing of the 50 brightest msps to a signal-to-noise of 500 would takeabout 24 hours per epoch.

0908.3813	timing observations of rotating radio transients	we present radio timing measurements of six rotating radio transient (rrat)sources discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey. these provide fournew phase-connected timing solutions and two updated ones, making a total ofseven of the original 11 reported rrats now with high-precision rotational andastrometric parameters. three of these seven rrats have magnetic fields greaterthan 10^13 g, with spin-down properties similar to those of the magnetars andx-ray detected isolated neutron stars. another two of these rrats have longperiods and large characteristic ages, and lie near the `death-line' for radiopulsar emission. the remaining two rrats with timing solutions have propertiestypical of the bulk of the pulsar population. the new solutions offer insightsinto what might be responsible for the unusual emission properties. wedemonstrate that the rrats have significantly longer periods and highermagnetic fields than normal radio pulsars, and find no correlation with otherspin-down parameters. these solutions also provide precise positions, whichwill facilitate follow-up studies at high energies, crucial for relating thesesources with other neutron star populations.

0912.3944	constraining pulsar emission physics through radio/gamma-ray correlation  of crab giant pulses	to constrain the giant pulse (gp) emission mechanism and test the model oflyutikov (2007) of gp emission, we are carrying out a campaign of simultaneousobservations of the crab pulsar between gamma-rays (fermi) and radiowavelengths. the correlation between times of arrival of radio gps andhigh-energy photons, whether it exists or not, will allow us to choose betweendifferent origins of gp emission and further constrain the emission physics.our foremost goal was testing whether radio gps are due to changes in thecoherence of the radio emission mechanism, variations in the pair creation ratein the pulsar magnetosphere, or changes in the beaming direction. accomplishingthis goal requires an enormous number of simultaneous radio gps andgamma-photons. thus, we organized a radio observations campaign using the 42-fttelescope at the jodrell bank observatory (uk), the 140-ft telescope, and the100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope (gbt) at the green bank observatory(wv). while the observations with the two first ones are ongoing, here wepresent the preliminary results of 20 hrs of observations with the gbt at thehigh frequency of 8.9 ghz. these particular observations were aimed to probethe model of gp emission by lyutikov (2007) which predicts that gps atfrequencies &gt; 4 ghz should be accompanied by gamma-ray photons of energies of1-100 gev.

1001.1483	observations and modelling of relativistic spin precession in psr  j1141-6545	observations of the binary pulsar psr j1141-6545 using the parkes radiotelescope over 9.3 years show clear time-variations in pulse width, shape andpolarization. we interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precessionof the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.over the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more thana factor of three. large variations have also been observed in the 1400-mhzmean flux density. the pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 aprilusing digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variationsin both linear and circular polarization. position angle variations, bothacross the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with majordifferences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. modellingof the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of thepulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 degand that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course ofour observations. at the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impactparameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0deg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. wehave therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing thatit is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. the derivedprecessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2msun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small. with thereversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter, we predict that overthe next decade we will see a reversed "replay" of the variations observed inthe past decade.

0708.1149	discovery of pulsations and a possible spectral feature in the x-ray  emission from rotating radio transient j1819-1458	psr j1819-1458 is a rotating radio transient (rrat) source with an inferredsurface dipole magnetic field strength of 5e13 g and a 4.26-s spin period. wepresent xmm-newton observations of the x-ray counterpart of this source, cxouj181939.1-145804, in which we identify pulsations and a possible spectralfeature. the x-ray pulsations are at the period predicted by the radioephemeris, providing an unambiguous identification with the radio source andconfirmation of its neutron star nature. the x-ray pulse has a 0.3-5 kev pulsedfraction of 34% and is aligned with the expected phase of the radio pulse. thex-ray spectrum is fit well by an absorbed blackbody with kt = 0.14 kev with theaddition of an absorption feature at 1 kev, with total absorbed flux of 1.5e-13ergs/cm^2/s (0.3-5 kev). this absorption feature is well modeled by a gaussianor resonant cyclotron scattering model, but its significance is dependent onthe choice of continuum model. we find no evidence for any x-ray bursts oraperiodic variability on timescales of 6 ms to the duration of the observationand can place the most stringent limit to date of &lt; 3e-9 ergs/cm^2/s on theabsorbed 0.3-5 kev flux of any bursts.

1005.4653	new limits on the population of normal and millisecond pulsars in the  large and small magellanic clouds	we model the potentially observable populations of normal and millisecondradio pulsars in the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc) where theknown population currently stands at 19 normal radio pulsars. taking intoaccount the detection thresholds of previous surveys, and assuming optimalperiod and luminosity distributions based on studies of galactic pulsars, weestimate there are (1.79 +/- 0.20) x 10^4 and (1.09 +/- 0.16) x 10^4 normalpulsars in the lmc and smc respectively. when we attempt to correct for beamingeffects, and the fraction of high-velocity pulsars which escape the clouds, weestimate birth rates in both the lmc and smc to be comparable and in the range0.5--1 pulsar per century. although higher than estimates for the rate ofcore-collapse supernovae in the clouds, these pulsar birth rates are consistentwith historical supernova observations in the past 300 yr. a substantialpopulation of active radio pulsars (of order a few hundred thousand) haveescaped the lmc and smc and populate the local intergalactic medium. for themillisecond pulsar (msp) population, the lack of any detections from currentsurveys leads to respective upper limits (at the 95% confidence level) of15,000 for the lmc and 23,000 for the smc. several msps could be detected by acurrently ongoing survey of the smc with improved time and frequency resolutionusing the parkes multibeam system. giant-pulse emitting neutron stars couldalso be seen by this survey.

1008.1928	radio pulsar populations	the goal of this article is to summarize the current state of play in thefield of radio pulsar statistics. simply put, from the observed sample ofobjects from a variety of surveys with different telescopes, we wish to inferthe properties of the underlying sample and to connect these with otherastrophysical populations (for example supernova remnants or x-ray binaries).the main problem we need to tackle is the fact that, like many areas ofscience, the observed populations are often heavily biased by a variety ofselection effects. after a review of the main effects relevant to radiopulsars, i discuss techniques to correct for them and summarize some of themost recent results. perhaps the main point i would like to make in thisarticle is that current models to describe the population are far from completeand often suffer from strong covariances between input parameters. that said,there are a number of very interesting conclusions that can be made concerningthe evolution of neutron stars based on current data. while the focus of thisreview will be on the population of isolated galactic pulsars, i will alsobriefly comment on millisecond and binary pulsars as well as the pulsar contentof globular clusters and the magellanic clouds.

1009.5873	a 6.5-ghz multibeam pulsar survey	a survey of the galactic plane in the region $-60\degree \leq l \leq30\degree$, $|b| \leq 0.25\degree$ was carried out using the seven-beam parkesmethanol multibeam (mmb) receiver, which operates at a frequency of 6.5 ghz.three pulsars were discovered, and 16 previously known pulsars detected. inthis paper we present two previously-unpublished discoveries, both withextremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angulardistance, to the galactic centre. the survey data also contain the first knowndetection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar psr j1550-5418. oursurvey observation was made 46 days prior to that previously published andplaces constraints on the beginning of pulsed radio emission from the source.  the detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that thereare few pulsars in the direction of the inner galaxy whose flux densityspectrum is governed by a flat power law. however, these pulsars would belikely to remain undetected at lower frequencies due to the large amount ofscatter broadening which affects pulsars with high values of dispersionmeasure. surveys with future telescopes at high observing frequencies will,therefore, play an important role in the discovery of pulsars at the galacticcentre. by simulating pulsar surveys of the galaxy with phase 1 ska atfrequencies of 1.4 ghz and 10 ghz, we find that high-frequency observations arethe only way to discover and observe the galactic-centre pulsar population.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1205.3699	discovery of the optical/ultraviolet/gamma-ray counterpart to the  eclipsing millisecond pulsar j1816+4510	the energetic, eclipsing millisecond pulsar j1816+4510 was recentlydiscovered in a low-frequency radio survey with the green bank telescope. withan orbital period of 8.7 hr and minimum companion mass of 0.16 msun it appearsto belong to an increasingly important class of pulsars that are ablating theirlow-mass companions. we report the discovery of the gamma-ray counterpart tothis pulsar, and present a likely optical/ultraviolet counterpart as well.using the radio ephemeris we detect pulsations in the unclassified gamma-raysource 2fgl j1816.5+4511, implying an efficiency of ~25% in converting thepulsar's spin-down luminosity into gamma-rays and adding psr j1816+4510 to thelarge number of millisecond pulsars detected by fermi. the likely optical/uvcounterpart was identified through position coincidence (&lt;0.1") and unusualcolors. assuming that it is the companion, with r=18.27+/-0.03 mag andeffective temperature &gt;15,000 k it would be among the brightest and hottest oflow-mass pulsar companions, and appears qualitatively different from othereclipsing pulsar systems. in particular, current data suggest that it is afactor of two larger than most white dwarfs of its mass, but a factor of foursmaller than its roche lobe. we discuss possible reasons for its hightemperature and odd size, and suggest that it recently underwent a violentepisode of mass loss. regardless of origin, its brightness and the relativeunimportance of irradiation make it an ideal target for a mass, and hence aneutron star mass, determination.

1206.0428	on pulsar distance measurements and their uncertainties	accurate distances to pulsars can be used for a variety of studies of thegalaxy and its electron content. however, most distance measures to pulsarshave been derived from the absorption (or lack thereof) of pulsar emission bygalactic hi gas, which typically implies that only upper or lower limits on thepulsar distance are available. we present a critical analysis of all measuredhi distance limits to pulsars and other neutron stars, and translate theselimits into actual distance estimates through a likelihood analysis thatsimultaneously corrects for statistical biases. we also apply this analysis toparallax measurements of pulsars in order to obtain accurate distance estimatesand find that the parallax and hi distance measurements are biased in differentways, because of differences in the sampled populations. parallax measurementstypically underestimate a pulsar's distance because of the limited distance towhich this technique works and the consequential strong effect of the galacticpulsar distribution (i.e. the original lutz-kelker bias), in hi distancelimits, however, the luminosity bias dominates the lutz-kelker effect, leadingto overestimated distances because the bright pulsars on which this techniqueis applicable are more likely to be nearby given their brightness.

1207.5732	constraining the luminosity function parameters and population size of  radio pulsars in globular clusters	studies of the galactic population of radio pulsars have shown that theirluminosity distribution appears to be log-normal in form. we investigate someof the consequences that occur when one applies this functional form topopulations of pulsars in globular clusters. we use bayesian methods to exploreconstraints on the mean and standard deviation of the luminosity function, aswell as the total number of pulsars, given an observed sample of pulsars downto some limiting flux density, accounting for measurements of flux densities ofindividual pulsars as well as diffuse emission from the direction of thecluster. we apply our analysis to terzan 5, 47 tucanae and m 28, anddemonstrate, under reasonable assumptions, that the number of potentiallyobservable pulsars should be within 95% credible intervals of$147^{+112}_{-65}$, $83^{+54}_{-35}$ and $100^{+91}_{-52}$, respectively.beaming considerations would increase the true population size by approximatelya factor of two. using non-informative priors, however, the constraints are nottight due to the paucity and quality of flux density measurements. futurecluster pulsar discoveries and improved flux density measurements would allowthis method to be used to more accurately constrain the luminosity function,and to compare the luminosity function between different clusters.

1307.1200	on the detectability of extragalactic fast radio transients	recent discoveries of highly dispersed millisecond radio bursts by thorntonet al. in a survey with the parkes radio telescope at 1.4 ghz point towards anemerging population of sources at cosmological distances whose origin iscurrently unclear. here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lowerradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts couldbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 ghz. using asource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometricluminosities $\sim 8 \times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unitcomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density asa function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found bythornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate andredshift probed by a given survey. the non-detection of any such events inarecibo 1.4 ghz survey data by deneva et al., and the allen telescope arraysurvey by simeon et al. is consistent with our model. ongoing surveys in the1--2 ghz band should result in further discoveries. at lower frequencies,assuming a typical radio spectral index $\alpha=-1.4$, the predicted peak fluxdensities are 10s of jy. as a result, surveys of such a population with currentfacilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carriedout with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage. we predict that sources mayalready be present in 350-mhz surveys with the green bank telescope. surveys at150 mhz with 30 deg$^2$ fields of view could detect one source per hour above30 jy.

1308.4956	psr j1723-2837: an eclipsing binary radio millisecond pulsar	we present a study of psr j1723-2837, an eclipsing, 1.86 ms millisecondbinary radio pulsar discovered in the parkes multibeam survey. radio timingindicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, alow-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. the eclipsefraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the roche lobe sizeinferred for the companion. the timing behavior is significantly affected byunmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital periodderivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.we have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archivalultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.doppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association withthe pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,corresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 msun and an orbitalinclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar massrange of 1.4-2.0 msun. spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of g for thecompanion and an inferred roche-lobe-filling distance that is consistent withthe distance estimated from radio dispersion. the features of psr j1723-2837indicate that it is likely a "redback" system. unlike the five other galacticredbacks discovered to date, psr j1723-2837 has not been detected as agamma-ray source with fermi. this may be due to an intrinsic spin-downluminosity that is much smaller than the measured value if the unmeasuredcontribution from proper motion is large.

0705.0685	psr j1453+1902 and the radio luminosities of solitary versus binary  millisecond pulsars	we present 3 yr of timing observations for psr j1453+1902, a 5.79-ms pulsardiscovered during a 430-mhz drift-scan survey with the arecibo telescope. ourobservations show that psr j1453+1902 is solitary and has a proper motion of8(2) mas/yr. at the nominal distance of 1.2 kpc estimated from the pulsar'sdispersion measure, this corresponds to a transverse speed of 46(11) km/s,typical of the millisecond pulsar population. we analyse the current sample of55 millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk and revisit the question of whetherthe luminosities of isolated millisecond pulsars are different from theirbinary counterparts. we demonstrate that the apparent differences in theluminosity distributions seen in samples selected from 430-mhz surveys can beexplained by small-number statistics and observational selection biases. anexamination of the sample from 1400-mhz surveys shows no differences in thedistributions. the simplest conclusion from the current data is that the spin,kinematic, spatial and luminosity distributions of isolated and binarymillisecond pulsars are consistent with a single homogeneous population.

1309.7317	an empirical bayesian analysis applied to the globular cluster pulsar  population	we describe an empirical bayesian approach to determine the most likely sizeof an astronomical population of sources of which only a small subset areobserved above some limiting flux density threshold. the method is mostnaturally applied to astronomical source populations at a common distance(e.g.,stellar populations in globular clusters), and can be applied even topopulations where a survey detects no objects. the model allows for theinclusion of physical parameters of the stellar population and the detectionprocess. as an example, we apply this method to the current sample of radiopulsars in galactic globular clusters. using the sample of flux density limitson pulsar surveys in 94 globular clusters published by boyles et al., weexamine a large number of population models with different dependencies. wefind that models which include the globular cluster two-body encounter rate,$\gamma$, are strongly favoured over models in which this is not a factor. theoptimal model is one in which the mean number of pulsars is proportional to$\exp(1.5 \log \gamma)$. this model agrees well with earlier work by hui et al.and provides strong support to the idea that the two-body encounter ratedirectly impacts the number of neutron stars in a cluster. our model predictsthat the total number of potentially observable globular cluster pulsars in theboyles et al. sample is 1070$^{+1280}_{-700}$, where the uncertainties signifythe 95% confidence interval. scaling this result to all galactic globularclusters, and to account for radio pulsar beaming, we estimate the totalpopulation to be 2280$^{+2720}_{-1490}$.

1311.4608	jumping the energetics queue: modulation of pulsar signals by  extraterrestrial civilizations	it has been speculated that technological civilizations evolve along anenergy consumption scale first formulated by kardashev, ranging from human-likecivilizations that consume energy at a rate of $\sim 10^{19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ tohypothetical highly advanced civilizations that can consume $\sim 10^{44}$ ergs$^{-1}$. since the transmission power of a beacon a civilization can builddepends on the energy it possesses, to make it bright enough to be seen acrossthe galaxy would require high technological advancement. in this paper, wediscuss the possibility of a civilization using naturally-occurring radiotransmitters -- specifically, radio pulsars -- to overcome the kardashev limitof their developmental stage and transmit super-kardashev power. this isachieved by the use of a modulator situated around a pulsar, that modulates thepulsar signal, encoding information onto its natural emission. we discuss asimple modulation model using pulse nulling and considerations for detectingsuch a signal. we find that a pulsar with a nulling modulator will exhibit anexcess of thermal emission peaking in the ultraviolet during its null phases,revealing the existence of a modulator.

1311.4846	the galactic centre pulsar population	the recent discovery of a magnetar in the galactic centre region has allowedspitler et al. to characterize the interstellar scattering in that direction.they find that the temporal broadening of the pulse profile of the magnetar issubstantially less than that predicted by models of the electron density ofthat region. this raises the question of what the plausible limits for thenumber of potentially observable pulsars - i.e., the number of pulsars beamingtowards the earth - in the galactic centre are. in this paper, using reasonableassumptions - namely, (i) the luminosity function of pulsars in the galacticcentre region is the same as that in the field, (ii) the region has had aconstant pulsar formation rate, (iii) the spin and luminosity evolution ofmagnetars and pulsars are similar, and (iv) the scattering in the direction ofthe galactic centre magnetar is representative of the entire inner parsec - weshow that the potentially observable population of pulsars in the inner parsechas a conservative upper limit of $\sim$ 200, and that it is premature toconclude that the number of pulsars in this region is small. we also show thatthe observational results so far are consistent with this number and makepredictions for future radio pulsar surveys of the galactic centre.

1401.0535	a millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system	gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds ofyears and are common in our galaxy. they show complex orbital interactions,which can constrain the compositions, masses, and interior structures of thebodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements areavailable. a triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide suchmeasurements, but the only previously known such system, b1620-26 (with amillisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit ofseveral decades), shows only weak interactions. here we report precision timingand multi-wavelength observations of psr j0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in ahierarchical triple system with two other stars. strong gravitationalinteractions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)msun, where msun is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertaintyin the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)msun and 0.4101(3) msun), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (bothapproximately 39.2 degrees). the unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circularorbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from thoseof known stellar systems. the gravitational field of the outer white dwarfstrongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and thesystem will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strongequivalence principle of general relativity.

1404.1267	nanograv limits on gravitational waves from individual supermassive  black hole binaries in circular orbits	the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves (nanograv)project currently observes 43 pulsars using the green bank and arecibo radiotelescopes. in this work we use a subset of 17 pulsars timed for a span ofroughly five years (2005--2010). we analyze these data using standard pulsartiming models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure andfrequency-variable pulse shape terms. within the timing data, we perform asearch for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive blackhole binaries in circular orbits using robust frequentist and bayesiantechniques. we find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectablecontinuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the mostconstraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves.using the full 17 pulsar dataset we place a 95% upper limit on the sky-averagedstrain amplitude of $h_0\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{-14}$ at a frequency of 10 nhz.furthermore, we place 95% \emph{all sky} lower limits on the luminositydistance to such gravitational wave sources finding that the $d_l \gtrsim 425$mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nhz and chirp mass $10^{10}{\rmm}_{\odot}$. we find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timedpulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased bya factor of $\sim$4 over the sky-averaged sensitivity. finally we place limitson the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1405.7953	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iii. precursor survey and population  synthesis	the pulsar arecibo l-band feed array (palfa) survey uses the alfa 7-beamreceiver to search both inner and outer galactic sectors visible from arecibo($32^{\circ}\lesssim \ell \lesssim 77^{\circ}$ and $168^{\circ}\lesssim \ell  \lesssim 214^{\circ}$) close to the galactic plane ($|b|\lesssim5^{\circ}$)for pulsars. in this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region withpalfa, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in$\ell$ and $|b|\lesssim1^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. for both galacticmillisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detectionswith simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate thenumber of observable pulsars in the galaxy. we place 95\% confidence intervalsof 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9,000 to100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk.these are consistent with previous estimates. given the most likely populationsize in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars,respectively) we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, whencomplete, the full palfa survey should have detected $1,000\substack{+330 \\-230}$ normal pulsars and $30\substack{+200 \\ -20}$ millisecond pulsars.identical estimation techniques predict that $490\substack{+160 \\ -115}$normal pulsars and $12\substack{+70 \\ -5}$ millisecond pulsars would bedetected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the palfa survey had detected283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively.

1406.5214	the green bank northern celestial cap pulsar survey - i: survey  description, data analysis, and initial results	we describe an ongoing search for pulsars and dispersed pulses of radioemission, such as those from rotating radio transients (rrats) and fast radiobursts (frbs), at 350 mhz using the green bank telescope. with the green bankultimate pulsar processing instrument, we record 100 mhz of bandwidth dividedinto 4,096 channels every 81.92 $\mu s$. this survey will cover the entire skyvisible to the green bank telescope ($\delta &gt; -40^\circ$, or 82% of the sky)and outside of the galactic plane will be sensitive enough to detect slowpulsars and low dispersion measure ($&lt;$30 $\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$) millisecondpulsars (msps) with a 0.08 duty cycle down to 1.1 mjy. for pulsars with aspectral index of $-$1.6, we will be 2.5 times more sensitive than previous andongoing surveys over much of our survey region. here we describe the survey,the data analysis pipeline, initial discovery parameters for 62 pulsars, andtiming solutions for 5 new pulsars. psr j0214$+$5222 is an msp in a long-period(512 days) orbit and has an optical counterpart identified in archival data.psr j0636$+$5129 is an msp in a very short-period (96 minutes) orbit with avery low mass companion (8 $m_\mathrm{j}$). psr j0645$+$5158 is an isolated mspwith a timing residual rms of 500 ns and has been added to pulsar timing arrayexperiments. psr j1434$+$7257 is an isolated, intermediate-period pulsar thathas been partially recycled. psr j1816$+$4510 is an eclipsing msp in ashort-period orbit (8.7 hours) and may have recently completed its spin-upphase.

1411.1518	the binary companion of young, relativistic pulsar j1906+0746	psr j1906+0746 is a young pulsar in the relativistic binary with thesecond-shortest known orbital period, of 3.98 hours. we here present a timingstudy based on five years of observations, conducted with the 5 largest radiotelescopes in the world, aimed at determining the companion nature. through themeasurement of three post-keplerian orbital parameters we find the pulsar massto be 1.291(11) m_sol, and the companion mass 1.322(11) m_sol respectively.these masses fit well in the observed collection of double neutron stars, butare also compatible with other white dwarfs around young pulsars such asj1906+0746. neither radio pulsations nor dispersion-inducing outflows thatcould have further established the companion nature were detected. we derive anhi-absorption distance, which indicates that an optical confirmation of a whitedwarf companion is very challenging. the pulsar is fading fast due to geodeticprecession, limiting future timing improvements. we conclude that young pulsarj1906+0746 is likely part of a double neutron star, or is otherwise orbited byan older white dwarf, in an exotic system formed through two stages of masstransfer.

1501.00086	pulsars in globular clusters with the ska	globular clusters are highly efficient radio pulsar factories. these pulsarscan be used as precision probes of the clusters' structure, gas content,magnetic field, and formation history; some of them are also highly interestingin their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios aswell as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity. deep searches withska1-mid and ska1-low will plausibly double to triple the known population.such searches will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be doneduring early commissioning of the telescope - before an all-sky pulsar surveyusing hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. with ska2 it willbe possible to observe most of the active radio pulsars within a large fractionof the galactic globular clusters, an estimated population of 600 - 3700observable pulsars (those beamed towards us). this rivals the total populationof millisecond pulsars that can be found in the galactic field; fullycharacterizing it will provide the best-possible physical laboratories as wellas a rich dynamical history of the galactic globular cluster system.

1501.05343	nanograv constraints on gravitational wave bursts with memory	among efforts to detect gravitational radiation, pulsar timing arrays areuniquely poised to detect "memory" signatures, permanent perturbations inspacetime from highly energetic astrophysical events such as mergers ofsupermassive black hole binaries. the north american nanohertz observatory forgravitational waves (nanograv) observes dozens of the most stable millisecondpulsars using the arecibo and green bank radio telescopes in an effort tostudy, among other things, gravitational wave memory. we herein present theresults of a search for gravitational wave bursts with memory (bwms) using thefirst five years of nanograv observations. we develop original methods fordramatically speeding up searches for bwm signals. in the directions of the skywhere our sensitivity to bwms is best, we would detect mergers of binaries withreduced masses of $10^9$ $m_\odot$ out to distances of 30 mpc; such massivemergers in the virgo cluster would be marginally detectable. we find noevidence for bwms. however, with our non-detection, we set upper limits on therate at which bwms of various amplitudes could have occurred during the timespanned by our data--e.g., bwms with amplitudes greater than $10^{-13}$ mustoccur at a rate less than 1.5 yr$^{-1}$.

1501.05516	the parkes multibeam pulsar survey: vii. timing of four millisecond  pulsars and the underlying spin period distribution of the galactic  millisecond pulsar population	we present timing observations of four millisecond pulsars discovered in theparkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar survey of the galactic plane. psrs j1552-4937 andj1843-1448 are isolated objects with spin periods of 6.28 and 5.47 msrespectively. psr j1727-2946 is in a 40-day binary orbit and has a spin periodof 27 ms. the 4.43-ms pulsar j1813-2621 is in a circular 8.16-day binary orbitaround a low-mass companion star with a minimum companion mass of 0.2 solarmasses. combining these results with detections from five other parkesmultibeam surveys, gives a well-defined sample of 56 pulsars with spin periodsbelow 20 ms. we develop a likelihood analysis to constrain the functional formwhich best describes the underlying distribution of spin periods formillisecond pulsars. the best results were obtained with a log-normaldistribution. a gamma distribution is less favoured, but still compatible withthe observations. uniform, power-law and gaussian distributions are found to beinconsistent with the data. galactic millisecond pulsars being found by currentsurveys appear to be in agreement with a log-normal distribution which allowsfor the existence of pulsars with periods below 1.5 ms.

1503.05170	discovery and follow-up of rotating radio transients with the green bank  and lofar telescopes	we have discovered 21 rotating radio transients (rrats) in data from thegreen bank telescope (gbt) 350-mhz drift-scan and the green bank northcelestial cap pulsar surveys using a new candidate sifting algorithm. rrats arepulsars with sporadic emission that are detected through their bright singlepulses rather than fourier domain searches. we have developed {\tt rrattrap}, asingle-pulse sifting algorithm that can be integrated into pulsar survey dataanalysis pipelines in order to find rrats and fast radio bursts. we haveconducted follow-up observations of our newly discovered sources at severalradio frequencies using the gbt and low frequency array (lofar), yieldingimproved positions and measurements of their periods, dispersion measures, andburst rates, as well as phase-coherent timing solutions for four of them. thenew rrats have dispersion measures (dms) ranging from 15 to 97 pc cm$^{-3}$,periods of 240 ms to 3.4 s, and estimated burst rates of 20 to 400 pulseshr$^{-1}$ at 350 mhz. we use this new sample of rrats to perform statisticalcomparisons between rrats and canonical pulsars in order to shed light on therelationship between the two populations. we find that the dm and spatialdistributions of the rrats agree with those of the pulsars found in the samesurvey. we find evidence that slower pulsars (i.e. $p&gt;200$ ms) arepreferentially more likely to emit bright single pulses than are faster pulsars($p&lt;200$ ms), although this conclusion is tentative. our results are consistentwith the proposed link between rrats, transient pulsars, and canonical pulsarsas sources in various parts of the pulse activity spectrum.

1504.02294	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iv. mock spectrometer data analysis,  survey sensitivity, and the discovery of 41 pulsars	the on-going palfa survey at the arecibo observatory began in 2004 and issearching for radio pulsars in the galactic plane at 1.4 ghz. observationssince 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than werepreviously employed in this survey. a new data reduction pipeline has been inplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, aswell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selectionheuristics. this pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8millisecond pulsars (msps; p &lt; 10 ms), bringing the palfa survey's discoverytotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 msps, and one fast radio burst (frb). thepipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsarsincluding 60 found in palfa data by re-analyzing observations previouslysearched by other pipelines. a comprehensive description of the surveysensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has beendetermined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters andamplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recoveredwith the data reduction pipeline. we have confirmed that the palfa surveyachieves the sensitivity to msps predicted by theoretical models. however, wealso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly usedthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods p &gt;= 100 ms thatgradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for p &gt; 4 s at dm &lt; 150 pc/cc.this degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. wefind that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to bedetected in the absence of red noise. this reduced sensitivity could haveimplications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the galaxy.

1504.03684	einstein@home discovery of a palfa millisecond pulsar in an eccentric  binary orbit	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar (msp) psr j1950+2414($p=4.3$ ms) in a binary system with an eccentric ($e=0.08$) 22-day orbit inpulsar alfa survey observations with the arecibo telescope. its companion starhas a median mass of 0.3 $m_\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. fullyrecycled msps like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by masstransfer from a companion star. this process should circularize the orbit, asis observed for the vast majority of binary msps, which predominantly haveorbital eccentricities $e &lt; 0.001$. however, four recently discovered binarymsps have orbits with $0.027 &lt; e &lt; 0.44$; psr j1950+2414 is the fifth suchsystem to be discovered. the upper limits for its intrinsic spin periodderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to thoseof the general msp population. the large eccentricities are incompatible withthe predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happenedduring their evolution. proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of thepulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in anexchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationallydelayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. we compare theproperties of all five known eccentric msps with the predictions of theseformation channels. future measurements of the masses and proper motion mightallow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.

astro-ph;0207408	the probability distribution of binary pulsar coalescence rates. i.  double neutron star systems in the galactic field	estimates of the galactic coalescence rate (r) of close binaries with twoneutron stars (ns-ns) are known to be uncertain by large factors (about twoorders of magnitude) mainly due to the small number of systems detected asbinary radio pulsars. we present an analysis method that allows us to estimatethe galactic ns-ns coalescence rate using the current observed sample and,importantly, to assign a statistical significance to these estimates and tocalculate the allowed ranges of values at various confidence levels. the methodinvolves the simulation of selection effects inherent in all relevant radiopulsar surveys and a bayesian statistical analysis for the probabilitydistribution of the rate. the most likely values for the total galacticcoalescence rate (r_peak) lie in the range 2-60 per myr depending on differentpulsar population models. for our reference model 1, where the most likelyestimates of pulsar population properties are adopted, we obtain r_tot =8_{-5}^{+9} per myr at a 68% statistical confidence level. the correspondingrange of expected detection rates of ns-ns inspiral are 3_{-2}^{+4}x10^{-3} peryr for the initial ligo and 18_{-11}^{+21} per yr for the advanced ligo.

astro-ph;0312071	an increased estimate of the merger rate of double neutron stars from  observations of a highly relativistic system	the merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars shouldproduce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of generalrelativity. a reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in thegalaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectorswill be successful in detecting such bursts. present estimates of this rate arerather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries withmerger times less than the age of the universe. here we report the discovery ofa 22-ms pulsar, psr j0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativisticdouble-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. this systemwill merge in about 85 myr, a time much shorter than for any other knownneutron-star binary. together with the relatively low radio luminosity of psrj0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in thepredicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our galaxy (and in therest of the universe).

astro-ph;0312101	the cosmic coalescence rates for double neutron star binaries	this manuscript is an updated version of kalogera et al. (2004) published inapj letters to correct our calculation of the galactic dns in-spiral rate. thedetails of the original erratum submitted to apj letters are given in page 6 ofthis manuscript.  we report on the newly increased event rates due to the recent discovery ofthe highly relativistic binary pulsar j0737--3039 (burgay et al. 2003). using arigorous statistical method, we present the calculations reported by burgay etal., which produce a in-spiral rate for galactic double neutron star (dns)systems that is higher by a factor of 5-7 compared to estimates made prior tothe new discovery. our method takes into account known pulsar-survey selectioneffects and biases due to small-number statistics. this rate increase hasdramatic implications for gravitational wave detectors. for the initial laserinterferometer gravitational-wave observatory (ligo) detectors, the mostprobable detection rates for dns in-spirals are one event per 10-630 yr; at 95%confidence, we obtain rates up to one per 3 yr. for the advanced ligodetectors, the most probable rates are 10-500 events per year. thesepredictions, for the first time, bring the expectations for dns detections bythe initial ligo detectors to the astrophysically relevant regime. we also useour models to predict that the large-scale parkes multibeam pulsar survey withacceleration searches could detect an average of four binary pulsars similar tothose known at present.

astro-ph;0504584	a statistical study of 233 pulsar proper motions	we present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with proper motionmeasurements. the sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycledobjects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants.after taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for whichmultiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58%)are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41% using interferometers and theremaining 1% using optical telescopes. many of the 1-d and 2-d speeds(referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of thetransverse velocities respectively) derived from these measurements aresomewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recentelectron density model in determining pulsar distances. the mean 1-d speeds forthe normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6) km/s respectively. thecorresponding mean 2-d speeds are 246(22) and 87(13) km/s. psrs b2011+38 andb2224+64 have the highest inferred 2-d speeds of ~1600 km/s. we study the meanspeeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree withprevious results. applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3 myr, we find the mean 3-d pulsarbirth velocity to be 400(40) km/s. the distribution of velocities is welldescribed by a maxwellian distribution with 1-d rms sigma=265 km/s. there is noevidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. the proper motions for psrsb1830-08 and b2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations with thesupernova remnants w41 and g114.3+0.3 respectively.

astro-ph;0511587	transient radio bursts from rotating neutron stars	the `radio sky' is relatively unexplored for transient signals, although thepotential of radio-transient searches is high, as demonstrated recently by thediscovery of a previously unknown type of source which varies on timescales ofminutes to hours. here we report a new large-scale search for radio sourcesvarying on much shorter timescales. this has revealed 11 objects characterizedby single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. the averagetime intervals between bursts range from 4 minutes to 3 hours, with radioemission typically detectable for &lt; 1 s per day. from an analysis of the burstarrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4 - 7 s for tenof the 11 sources, suggesting a rotating neutron star origin. despite the smallnumber of sources presently detected, their ephemeral nature implies a totalgalactic population which significantly exceeds that of the regularly pulsingradio pulsars. five of the ten sources have periods greater than 4 s, andperiod derivatives have been measured for three of the sources, with one havinga very high inferred magnetic field of 5e13 g, suggesting that this newpopulation is related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed atx-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths.

astro-ph;0609417	tests of general relativity from timing the double pulsar	the double pulsar system, psr j0737-3039a/b, is unique in that both neutronstars are detectable as radio pulsars. this, combined with significantly highermean orbital velocities and accelerations when compared to other binarypulsars, suggested that the system would become the best available testbed forgeneral relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-fieldregime. here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests ofgeneral relativity. use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two starsmakes these tests uniquely different from earlier studies. by measuringrelativistic corrections to the keplerian description of the orbital motion, wefind that the ``post-keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted byeinstein's theory of general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, themost precise test yet obtained. we also show that the transverse velocity ofthe system's center of mass is extremely small. combined with the system'slocation near the sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitationaltheories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar-systemtests. it also implies that the second-born pulsar may have formed differentlyto the usually assumed core-collapse of a helium star.

astro-ph;9906442	the characteristics of millisecond pulsar emission: iii.from low to high  frequencies	in this paper we present the first observations of a large sample ofmillisecond pulsars at frequencies of 2.7 ghz and 4.9 ghz. our new fluxmeasurements extend the known spectra for millisecond pulsars to the highestfrequencies to date. the coverage of more than a decade of radio spectrumallows us for the first time to search for spectral breaks as so often observedfor normal pulsars around 1 ghz. we align the observed millisecond pulsarprofiles with data from lower frequencies. deviations from a dipolar magneticfield structure are not evident and absolute timing across the wide frequencyrange with a single dispersion measure is possible. we seem to observe mainlyunfilled emission beams, which must originate from a very compact region. acompact emission region is also suggested by a remarkably constant profilewidth or component separation over a very wide frequency range. for a fewsources, polarization data at 2.7 and 4.9 ghz could also be obtained whichindicate that millisecond pulsars are weakly polarized or even unpolarized atfrequencies above 3 ghz. the simultaneous decrease in degree of polarizationand the constant profile width thus question proposals which linkde-polarization and decreasing profile width for normal pulsars to the samepropagation effect (i.e. birefringence). comparing the properties of core andconal like profile components to those of normal pulsars, we find lesssignificant patterns in their spectral evolution for the population ofmillisecond pulsars. hence, we suggest that core and conal emission may becreated by the same emission process. in general, msp emission properties tendto resemble those of normal pulsars only shifted towards higher frequencies.

0811.0211	pulsar searches and timing with the ska	the square kilometre array (ska) is a planned multi purpose radio telescopewith a collecting area approaching 1 million square metres. one of the keyscience objectives of the ska is to provide exquisite strong-field tests ofgravitational physics by finding and timing pulsars in extreme binary systemssuch as a pulsar-black hole binary. to find out how three preliminary skaconfigurations will affect a pulsar survey, we have simulated ska pulsarsurveys for each configuration. we estimate that the total number of normalpulsars the ska will detect, using only the 1-km core and 30 minutesintegration time, is around 14000 normal pulsar and 6000 millisecond pulsars.we describe a simple strategy for follow-up timing observations and find that,depending on the configuration, it would take 1-6 days to obtain a singletiming point for 14000 pulsars. obtaining a single timing point for thehigh-precision timing projects of the ska, will take less than 14 hours, 2days, or 3 days, depending on the configuration. the presence of aperturearrays will be of great benefit here. we also study the computationalrequirements for beam forming and data analysis for a pulsar survey. beamforming of the full field of view of the single-pixel feed 15-m dishes usingthe 1-km core of the ska requires about 2.2*10^15 operations per second. thecorresponding data rate from such a pulsar survey is about 4.7*10^11 bytes persecond. the required computational power for a deep real time analysis isestimated to be 1.2*10^16 operations per second. for an aperture array ordishes equipped with phased array feeds, the survey can be performed faster,but the computational requirements and data rates will go up.
