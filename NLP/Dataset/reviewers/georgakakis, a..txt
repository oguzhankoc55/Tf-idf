0904.3747	host galaxy morphologies of x-ray selected agn: assessing the  significance of different black hole fueling mechanisms to the accretion  density of the universe at z~1	we use morphological information of x-ray selected agn hosts to set limits onthe fraction of the accretion density of the universe at z~1 that is not likelyto be associated with major mergers. deep x-ray observations are combined withhigh resolution optical data from the hubble space telescope in the aegis,goods north and goods south fields to explore the morphological breakdown ofx-ray sources in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. the sample is split intodisks, early-type bulge dominated galaxies, peculiar systems and point-sourcesin which the nuclear source outshines the host galaxy. the x-ray luminosityfunction and luminosity density of agn at z~1 are then calculated as a functionof morphological type. we find that disk-dominated hosts contribute 30\pm9 percent to the total agn space density and 23\pm6 per cent to the luminositydensity at z~1. we argue that agn in disk galaxies are most likely fueled notby major merger events but by minor interactions or internal instabilities. wefind evidence that these mechanisms may be more efficient in producing luminousagn (l_x&gt;1e44 erg/s) compared to predictions for the stochastic fueling ofmassive black holes in disk galaxies.

0906.4938	testing the starburst/agn connection with swire x-ray/70 micron sources	we explore the nature of x-ray sources with 70 micron counterparts selectedin the swire fields elais-n1, lockman hole and chandra deep field south, forwhich chandra x-ray data are available. a total of 28 x-ray/70 micron sourcesin the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3 are selected. the x-ray luminosities and theshape of the x-ray spectra show that these sources are agn. modelling of theoptical to far-infrared spectral energy distribution indicates that most ofthem (27/28) have a strong starburst component (&gt;50 solar masses per year) thatdominates in the infrared. it is found that the x-ray and infrared luminositiesof the sample sources are broadly correlated, consistent with a link betweenagn activity and star-formation. contrary to the predictions of some models forthe co-evolution of agn and galaxies, the x-ray/70 micron sources in the sampleare not more obscured at x-ray wavelengths compared to the overall x-raypopulation. it is also found that the x-ray/70 micron sources have lowerspecific star-formation rates compared to the general 70 micron population,consistent with agn feedback moderating the star-formation in the hostgalaxies.

0909.0224	the compton-thick agn in the cdf-n	we present x-ray spectral analysis of the brightest sources (f_{2-10kev}&gt;10^{-15}$ cgs) in the chandra deep field north. our sample consists of 222sources; for the vast majority (171) either a spectroscopic or a photometricredshift is available. our goal is to discover the compton-thick agn in adirect way i.e. through their x-ray spectra. compton-thick agn give away theirpresence in x-rays either directly through the absorption turnover redshiftedin the chandra passband, or through a flat, reflection-dominated, spectrum. theabove selection criteria yield 10 compton-thick agn candidates of which thenine are reflection dominated. the ir or sub-mm data where available,corroborate the presence of a heavily obscured nucleus in most cases. all thefive candidate compton-thick sources with available 24 micron data present veryhigh values of the f_{24}/f_r flux ratio suggesting that they are dust obscuredgalaxies. the low f_x/f_{ir} ratio also suggest the presence of obscured nucleiin many cases. four of the candidate compton-thick sources are associated withsub-mm galaxies at high redshifts z$\sim2$. the number count vs. fluxdistribution of the candidate compton-thick agn as well as their distributionwith redshift agree reasonably well with the predictions of the x-raybackground synthesis models of gilli et al.

0910.1141	the evolution of the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn	we present new observational determinations of the evolution of the 2-10kevx-ray luminosity function (xlf) of agn. we utilise data from a number ofsurveys including both the 2ms chandra deep fields and the aegis-x 200kssurvey, enabling accurate measurements of the evolution of the faint end of thexlf. we combine direct, hard x-ray selection and spectroscopic follow-up orphotometric redshift estimates at z&lt;1.2 with a rest-frame uv colourpre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated withcatastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. only robust opticalcounterparts to x-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matchingtechnique. a bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshiftprobability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our highredshift samples, and allows robust comparison of different evolutionarymodels. we find that the xlf retains the same shape at all redshifts, butundergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z~1, and an overall negativedensity evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolutionat earlier times. we do not find evidence that a luminosity-dependent densityevolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required todescribe the evolution of the xlf. we find significantly higher space densitiesof low-luminosity, high-redshift agn than in prior studies, and a smaller shiftin the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasingluminosity. the total luminosity density of agn peaks at z=1.2+/-0.1, but thereis a mild decline to higher redshifts. we find &gt;50% of black hole growth takesplace at z&gt;1, with around half in lx&lt;10^44 erg/s agn.

0912.3038	the central energy source of 70micron-selected galaxies: starburst or  agn?	we present the first agn census in a sample of 61 galaxies selected at  70microns, a wavelength which should strongly favour the detection ofstar-forming systems. for the purpose of this study we take advantage of deepchandra x-ray and spitzer infrared (3.6-160micron) data, as well as opticalspectroscopy and photometry from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2(deep2) survey for the extended groth strip (egs) field. we investigatespectral line diagnostics ([oiii]/hbeta and [neiii]/[oii] ratios, hdelta balmerabsorption line equivalent widths and the strength of the 4000ang break), x-rayluminosities and spectral energy distributions (seds). we find that the70micron sources are undergoing starburst episodes and are thereforecharacterised by a predominance of young stars. in addition, 13 per cent of thesources show agn signatures and hence potentially host an agn. when the sampleis split into starbursts (sbs, 10^10&lt;l_ir&lt;10^11 l_solar), luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs, 10^11&lt;l_ir&lt;10^12 l_solar) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies(ulirgs,10^12&lt;l_ir&lt;10^13 l_solar), the agn fraction becomes 0, 11 and 23 percent respectively, showing an increase with total infrared luminosity. however,by examining the sources' panchromatic seds, we conclude that although the agnis energetically important in 1 out of 61 objects, all 70micron-selectedgalaxies are primarily powered by star-formation.

1003.5218	infrared excess sources: compton thick qsos, low luminosity seyferts or  starbursts?	we explore the nature of infrared excess sources (irx), which are proposed ascandidates for luminous l_x(2-10kev)&gt;1e43erg/s compton thick (n_h&gt;2e24cm^{-2}$)qsos at z~2. lower redshift, z~1, analogues of the distant irx population areidentified by firstly redshifting to z=2 the seds of all sources with securespectroscopic redshifts in the aegis (6488) and the goods-north (1784) surveysand then selecting those that qualify as irx sources at that redshift. a totalof 19 galaxies are selected. the mean redshift of the sample is $z\approx1$. wedo not find strong evidence for compton thick qsos in the sample. for 9 sourceswith x-ray counterparts, the x-ray spectra are consistent with compton thinagn. only 3 of them show tentative evidence for compton thick obscuration. theseds of the x-ray undetected population are consistent with starburst activity.there is no evidence for a hot dust component at the mid-infrared associatedwith agn heated dust. if the x-ray undetected sources host agn, an upper limitof l_x(2-10kev) =1e43erg/s is estimated for their intrinsic luminosity. wepropose that a large fraction of the $z\approx2$ irx population are not comptonthick qsos but low luminosity [l_x(2-10kev)&lt;1e43erg/s], possibly compton thin,agn or dusty starbursts. it is shown that the decomposition of the agn andstarburst contribution to the mid-ir is essential for interpreting the natureof this population, as star-formation may dominate this wavelength regime.

1005.1833	excess agn activity in the z=2.30 protocluster in hs 1700+64	we present the results of spectroscopic, narrow-band and x-ray observationsof a z=2.30 protocluster in the field of the qso hs 1700+643. using a sample ofbx/md galaxies, which are selected to be at z~2.2-2.7 by their rest-frameultraviolet colours, we find that there are 5 protocluster agn which have beenidentified by characteristic emission-lines in their optical/near-ir spectra;this represents an enhancement over the field significant at ~98.5 per centconfidence. using a ~200 ks chandra/acis-i observation of this field we detecta total of 161 x-ray point sources to a poissonian false-probability limit of4x10^{-6} and identify 8 of these with bx/md galaxies. two of these arespectroscopically confirmed protocluster members and are also classified asemission-line agn. when compared to a similarly selected field sample theanalysis indicates this is also evidence for an enhancement of x-ray selectedbx/md agn over the field, significant at ~99 per cent confidence. deep lyanarrow-band imaging reveals that a total of 4/123 lya emitters (laes) are foundto be associated with x-ray sources, with two of these confirmed protoclustermembers and one highly likely member. we do not find a significant enhancementof agn activity in this lae sample over that of the field (result significantat only 87 per cent confidence). the x-ray emitting agn fractions for the bx/mdand lae samples are found to be 6.9_{-4.4}^{+9.2} and 2.9_{-1.6}^{+2.9} percent, respectively, for protocluster agn with l_{2-10 kev}&gt;4.6x10^{43} ergs^{-1} at z=2.30. these findings are similar to results from the z=3.09protocluster in the ssa 22 field found by lehmer et al.

1005.3331	aegis: a multi-wavelength study of spitzer power-law galaxies	this paper analyzes a sample of 489 spitzer/irac sources in the extendedgroth strip whose spectral energy distributions fit a red power law from 3.6 to8.0 \micron. the median for sources with known redshift is &lt;z&gt;=1.6. though allor nearly all of the sample are likely to be active galactic nuclei, only 33%were detected in the egs x-ray survey (aegis-x) using 200 ks chandraobservations. the detected sources are x-ray luminous with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/sand moderately to heavily obscured with n_h &gt; 10^22 cm^-2. stacking thex-ray-undetected sample members yields a statistically significant x-raysignal, suggesting that they are on average more distant or more obscured thansources with x-ray detections. the ratio of x-ray to mid-infrared fluxessuggests that a substantial fraction of the sources undetected in x-rays areobscured at the compton-thick level, in contrast to the x-ray-detected sources,all of which appear to be compton-thin. for the x-ray-detected power-lawsources with redshifts, an x-ray luminosity l_x ~ 10^44 erg/s marks atransition between low-luminosity, blue sources dominated by the host galaxy tohigh-luminosity, red power-law sources dominated by nuclear activity.x-ray-to-optical ratios, infrared variability, and 24 micron properties of thesample are consistent with the identification of infrared power-law sources asactive nuclei, but a rough estimate is that only 22% of agns are selected bythe power law criteria. comparison of the power-law selection technique andvarious irac color criteria for identifying agns confirms that high-redshiftsamples selected via simple irac colors may be heavily contaminated bystarlight-dominated objects.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1109.0287	observational constraints on the physics behind the evolution of agn  since z ~ 1	we explore the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame colours and spacedensities of agn hosts (relative to normal galaxies) to shed light on thedominant mechanism that triggers accretion onto supermassive black holes as afunction of cosmic time. data from serendipitous wide-area xmm surveys of thesdss footprint (xmm/sdss, needles in the haystack survey) are combined withchandra deep observations in the aegis, goods-north and goods-south to compileuniformly selected samples of moderate luminosity x-ray agn [l_x(2-10kev) =1e41-1e44erg/s] at redshifts 0.1, 0.3 and 0.8. it is found that the fraction ofagn hosted by red versus blue galaxies does not change with redshift. also, thex-ray luminosity density associated with either red or blue agn hosts remainsnearly constant since z=0.8. x-ray agn represent a roughly fixed fraction ofthe space density of galaxies of given optical luminosity at all redshiftsprobed by our samples. in contrast the fraction of x-ray agn among galaxies ofa given stellar mass decreases with decreasing redshift. these findings suggestthat the same process or combination of processes for fueling supermassiveblack holes are in operation in the last 5 gyrs of cosmic time. the data areconsistent with a picture in which the drop of the accretion power during thatperiod (1dex since z=0.8) is related to the decline of the space density ofavailable agn hosts, as a result of the evolution of the specificstar-formation rate of the overall galaxy population. scenarios which attributethe evolution of moderate luminosity agn since z \approx 1 to changes in thesuppermassive black hole accretion mode are not favored by our results.

0712.0033	the environment on few mpc scales of infrared luminous galaxies at  redshifts z~1	we investigate the environment of infrared luminous galaxies (l$_{ir}$[8-1000$\mu $m$] &gt;10^{11}$l$_{\sun}$). we focus on the redshift range 0.7 $\leq$ z$\leq$ 1, where these galaxies dominate the star formation activity and play asignificant role in galaxy evolution. we employ mips 24$\mu$m data to identifyinfrared galaxies in the extended groth strip (egs). we use a local densityindicator to probe the environment on few mpc scales and a group membercatalog, both of which make use of the deep2 spectroscopic redshift catalog, toquantify the environment of these galaxies.  we find that the local environment of lirgs and ulirgs is intermediatebetween that of blue and red galaxies. lirgs and ulirgs avoid underdenseenvironments and inhabit local environments that are more dense on average thanthose of other deep2 galaxies at similar redshifts. however, when thecomparison sample of the non-ir deep2 galaxies is restricted to have the samerange of stellar mass, color, or luminosity as the ir--galaxies, there is nolonger any significant difference in environment; the ir-galaxies follow thesame trends in the color-environment and luminosity-environment relationsobserved at z$\sim$1.  we also find that about 30% of the lirgs and ulirgs belong to groups,associated with a minimum dark matter halo of6$\times10^{12}$m$_{\odot}$h$^{-1}$. the group members constitute 20 % of thesources responsible for the ir star formation rate density and comoving energydensity at z$\sim$1.

1212.5076	measuring the dark matter halo mass of x-ray agn at z~1 using  photometric redshifts	data from the aegis, cosmos and ecdfs surveys are combined to infer the biasand dark matter halo mass of moderate luminosity [lx(2-10 kev) = 42.9 erg s-1]x-ray agn at z~1 via their cross-correlation function with galaxies. incontrast to standard cross-correlation function estimators, we present a methodthat requires spectroscopy only for the agn and uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions for galaxies to determine the projectedreal-space agn/galaxy cross-correlation function. the estimated dark matterhalo mass of x-ray agn in the combined aegis, cosmos and ecdfs fields is~13h-1m_solar, in agreement with previous studies at similar redshift andluminosity ranges. removing from the sample the 5 per cent of the agnassociated with x-ray selected groups results in a reduction by about 0.5 dexin the inferred agn dark matter halo mass. the distribution of agn in darkmatter halo mass is therefore skewed and the bulk of the population lives inmoderate mass haloes. this result favour cold gas accretion as the main channelof supermassive black hole growth for most x-ray agn.

1305.2200	constraints on black hole fuelling modes from the clustering of x-ray  agn	we present a clustering analysis of x-ray selected agn by compiling x-raysamples from the literature and re-estimating the dark matter (dm) halo massesof agn in a uniform manner. we find that moderate luminosity agn (lx(2-10kev)=10^42-10^44 erg/sec) in the z=0-1.3 universe are typically found in dmhaloes with masses of ~10^13 msun. we then compare our findings to thetheoretical predictions of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation modelgalform. we find good agreement when our calculation includes the hot-halo modeof accretion onto the central black hole. this type of accretion, which isadditional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxymergers, is tightly coupled to the agn feedback in the model. the hot-halo modebecomes prominent in dm haloes with masses greater than ~10^12.5 msun, whereagn feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderateluminosity agn that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. cold gas fuellingof the black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred dm halo masses ofx-ray agn. switching off agn feedback in the model results in a largepopulation of luminous quasars (lx(2-10 kev) &gt; 10^44 erg/sec) in dm haloes withmasses up to ~10^14 msun, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering ofquasars. the abundance of hot-halo agn decreases significantly in the z~3-4universe. at such high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsiblefor shaping the environment of moderate luminosity agn. our analysis supportstwo accretion modes (cold and hot) for the fuelling of supermassive black holesand strongly underlines the importance of agn feedback in cosmological modelsboth of galaxy formation and black hole growth.

1306.2328	the hot and energetic universe: understanding the build-up of  supermassive black holes and galaxies at the heyday of the universe	observations in the last decade have provided strong evidence that the growthof supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies is among the mostinfluential processes in galaxy evolution. open questions that relate to ourcurrent understanding of black hole growth and its relation to the build-up ofgalaxies at redshifts z=1-4, when most black holes and stars we see inpresent-day galaxies were put in place, include: what is the nature of agnfeedback and whether it plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies?what is the dominant population of accreting agn at that critical epoch? is itdominated by obscured objects as required by many current observations andmodels? the athena+ mission concept will provide the technological leaprequired for a breakthrough in our understanding of agn and galaxy evolution atthe heyday of the universe. the high throughput of athena+ will allow thesystematic study of the incidence, nature and energetics of agn feedbackprocesses to z~4 via the identification and measurement of blue-shifted x-rayabsorption lines. the excellent survey and spectral capabilities of the athena+wide field imager will complete the census of black hole growth by yieldingsamples of up to 100 times larger than is currently possible of the mostheavily obscured, including compton thick, agn to redshifts z~4. thedemographics of this population relative to their hosts is fundamental forunderstanding how major black hole growth events relate to the build-up ofgalaxies.

0801.2160	the role of agn in the colour transformation of galaxies at redshifts  z~1	we explore the role of agn in establishing and/or maintaining the bimodalcolour distribution of galaxies by quenching their star-formation and hence,causing their transition from the blue to the red cloud. important tests forthis scenario include (i) the x-ray properties of galaxies in the transitionzone between the two clouds and (ii) the incidence of agn in post-starbursts,i.e. systems observed shortly after (&lt;1gyr) the termination of theirstar-formation. we perform these tests by combining deep chandra observationswith multiwavelength data from the aegis survey. stacking the x-ray photons atthe positions of galaxies (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9) not individually detected at x-raywavelengths suggests a population of obscured agn among sources in thetransition zone and in the red cloud. their mean x-ray and mid-ir propertiesare consistent with moderately obscured low-luminosity agn, compton thicksources or a mix of both. morphologies show that major mergers are unlikely todrive the evolution of this population but minor interactions may play a role.the incidence of obscured agn in the red cloud (both direct detections andstacking results) suggests that bh accretion outlives the termination of thestar-formation. this is also supported by our finding that post-starburstgalaxies at z~0.8 and agn are associated, in agreement with recent results atlow-z. a large fraction of post-starbursts and red cloud galaxies show evidencefor at least moderate levels of agn obscuration. this implies that if agnoutflows cause the colour transformation of galaxies, then some nuclear gas anddust clouds either remain unaffected or relax to the central galaxy regionsafter the quenching their star-formation.

1311.3700	a wide search for obscured active galactic nuclei using xmm-newton and  wise	we use a combination of the xmm-newton serendipitous x-ray survey with theoptical sdss, and the infrared wise all-sky survey in order to check theefficiency of the low x-ray to infrared luminosity selection method in findingheavily obscured agn. we select sources in the 2-8 kev x-ray band which have aredshift determination in the sdss catalogue. we match this sample with thewise catalogue, and fit the seds of the 2844 sources which have three, or more,photometric data-points in the infrared. we then select the heavily obscuredagn candidates by comparing their 12 micron agn luminosity to the observed 2-10kev x-ray luminosity and their expected intrinsic relation. with this approachwe find 20 candidates, and we examine their x-ray and optical spectra. of the20 initial candidates, we find nine (64%; out of the 14, for which x-rayspectra could be fit) based on the x-ray spectra, and seven (78%; out of thenine detected spectroscopically in the sdss) based on the [oiii] line fluxes.combining all criteria, we determine the final number of heavily obscured agnto be 12-19, and the number of compton-thick agn to be 2-5, showing that themethod is reliable in finding obscured agn, but not compton-thick. howeverthose numbers are smaller than what would be expected from x-ray backgroundpopulation synthesis models, which demonstrates how the optical-infraredselection and the scatter of the l_x-l_mir relation introduced by observationalconstraints limit the efficiency of the method. finally, we test popularobscured agn selection methods based on mid-infrared colours, and find that theprobability of an agn to be selected by its mid-infrared colours increases withthe x-ray luminosity. however, a selection scheme based on a relatively lowx-ray luminosity and mid-infrared colours characteristic of qsos would notselect ~25% of the heavily obscured agn of our sample.

1402.0004	x-ray spectral modelling of the agn obscuring region in the cdfs:  bayesian model selection and catalogue	agn are known to have complex x-ray spectra that depend on both theproperties of the accreting smbh (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and thedistribution of obscuring material in its vicinity ("torus"). often however,simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the x-ray spectra ofagn. in the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have animpact on e.g. the determination of the agn luminosity function, the inferredaccretion history of the universe and also on our understanding of the relationbetween agn and their host galaxies. we develop a bayesian framework for modelcomparison and parameter estimation of x-ray spectra. we take into accountuncertainties associated with x-ray data and photometric redshifts. we alsodemonstrate how bayesian model comparison can be used to select among tendifferent physically motivated x-ray spectral models the one that provides abetter representation of the observations. despite the use of low-countspectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry ofthe torus. for a sample of 350 agn in the 4 ms chandra deep field south field,our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity ofthe observed x-ray spectra: (abridged). simpler models are ruled out withdecisive evidence in favour of a geometrically extended structure withsignificant compton scattering. regarding the geometry of the obscurer, thereis strong evidence against both a completely closed or entirely open toroidalgeometry, in favour of an intermediate case. the additional compton reflectionrequired by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a signof a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk.finally, we release a catalogue with estimated parameters such as the accretionluminosity in the 2-10 kev band and the column density, $n_{h}$, of theobscurer.

1402.2277	investigating evidence for different black hole accretion modes since  redshift z~1	chandra data in the cosmos, aegis-xd and 4ms cdfs are combined withoptical/near-ir photometry to determine the rest-frame u-v vs v-j colours ofx-ray agn hosts at mean redshifts 0.40 and 0.85. this combination of colours(uvj) provides an efficient means of separating quiescent from star-forming,including dust reddened, galaxies. morphological information emphasisesdifferences between agn split by their uvj colours. agn in quiescent galaxiesare dominated by spheroids, while star-forming hosts are split between bulgesand disks. the uvj diagram of agn hosts is then used to set limits on theaccretion density associated with evolved and star-forming systems. most of theblack hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.nevertheless, ~15-20% of the x-ray luminosity density since z~1, is takingplace in the quiescent region of the uvj diagram. for the z~0.40 subsample,there is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that agn split by their uvjcolours differ in eddington ratio. agn in star-forming hosts dominate at higheddington ratios, while agn in quiescent hosts become increasingly important asa fraction of the total population toward low eddington ratios. at higherredshift, z~0.8, such differences are significant at the 2sigma level only ateddington ratios &gt;1e-3. these findings are consistent with scenarios in whichdiverse accretion modes are responsible for the build-up of smbhs at thecentres of galaxies. we compare our results with the galform semi-analyticmodel, which postulates two black hole fuelling modes, the first linked tostar-formation and the second occuring in passive galaxies. galform predicts alarger fraction of black hole growth in quiescent galaxies at z&lt;1, compared tothe data. relaxing the strong assumption of the model that passive agn hostshave zero star-formation rate could reconcile this disagreement.

1407.1863	large scale clustering measurements with photometric redshifts:  comparing the dark matter halos of x-ray agn, star-forming and passive  galaxies at z~1	we combine multiwavelength data in the aegis-xd and c-cosmos surveys tomeasure the typical dark matter halo mass of x-ray selected agn[lx(2-10kev)&gt;1e42 erg/s] in comparison with far-infrared selected star-forminggalaxies detected in the herschel/pep survey (pacs evolutionary probe; lir&gt;1e11solar) and quiescent systems at z~1. we develop a novel method to measure theclustering of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshiftprobability distribution functions in addition to any spectroscopy. this isadvantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clusteringanalysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. the method works bestfor large samples. the loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy isbalanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering. wefind that x-ray agn, far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies and passivesystems in the redshift interval 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 are found in halos of similar mass,$\log m_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. we argue that this is becausethe galaxies in all three samples (agn, star-forming, passive) have similarstellar mass distributions, approximated by the j-band luminosity. thereforeall galaxies that can potentially host x-ray agn, because they have stellarmasses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes of $\logm_{dmh}/(m_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formationrates. this suggests that the stellar mass of x-ray agn hosts is driving theobserved clustering properties of this population. we also speculate thattrends between agn properties (e.g. luminosity, level of obscuration) and largescale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of the hostgalaxies.

1407.4511	linking the x-ray and infrared properties of star-forming galaxies at  z&lt;1.5	we present the most complete study to date of the x-ray emission fromstar-formation in high redshift (median z=0.7; z&lt;1.5), ir-luminous(l_ir=10^10-10^13 l_sun) galaxies detected by herschel's pacs and spireinstruments. for our purpose we take advantage of the deepest x-ray data todate, the chandra deep fields (north and south). sources which host agn areremoved from our analysis by means of multiple agn indicators. we find an agnfraction of 18+/-2 per cent amongst our sample and note that agn entirelydominate at values of log[l_x/l_ir]&gt;-3 in both hard and soft x-ray bands. fromthe sources which are star-formation dominated, only a small fraction areindividually x-ray detected and for the bulk of the sample we calculate averagex-ray luminosities through stacking. we find an average soft x-ray to infraredratio of log[l_sx/l_ir]=-4.3 and an average hard x-ray to infrared ratio oflog[l_hx/l_ir]=-3.8. we report that the x-ray/ir correlation is approximatelylinear through the entire range of l_ir and z probed and, although broadlyconsistent with the local (z&lt;0.1) one, it does display some discrepancies. wesuggest that these discrepancies are unlikely to be physical, i.e. due to anintrinsic change in the x-ray properties of star-forming galaxies with cosmictime, as there is no significant evidence for evolution of the l_x/l_ir ratiowith redshift. instead they are possibly due to selection effects and remainingagn contamination. we also examine whether dust obscuration in the galaxy playsa role in attenuating x-rays from star-formation, by investigating changes inthe l_x/l_ir ratio as a function of the average dust temperature. we concludethat x-rays do not suffer any measurable attenuation in the host galaxy.

1409.1867	compton thick agn in the xmm-cosmos survey	heavily obscured, compton thick (ct, nh&gt;10^24 cm^-2) agn may represent animportant phase in agn/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide asignificant contribution to the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). through directx-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured agn (nh&gt;3x10^23 cm^-2)in the 2 deg^2 xmm-cosmos survey. after selecting ct agn based on the fit of asimple absorbed two power law model to the xmm data, the presence of ct agn wasconfirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper chandra data and more complexmodels. the final sample of ct agn comprises 10 sources spanning a large rangeof redshift and luminosity. we collected the multi-wavelength informationavailable for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of smbh andhost properties, such as bh mass (m_bh), eddington ratio (\lambda_edd), stellarmass (m*), specific star formation rate (ssfr) in comparison with a sample ofunobscured agn. we find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantlysmaller m_bh and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while aweaker evolution in m* is observed. the ssfr of highly obscured sources isconsistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,at all redshift. we also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution(sed) and morphology for the sample of 10 ct agn: all the available opticalspectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highlyobscured torus component is needed in the sed of the ct sources. exploiting thehigh resolution hubble-acs images available, we conclude that these highlyobscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect toother x-ray selected samples of agn. finally we discuss implications in thecontext of agn/galaxy co-evolutionary models, and compare our results with thepredictions of cxb synthesis models.

1502.00676	the xmm-newton survey in the h-atlas field	wide area x-ray and far infrared surveys are a fundamental tool toinvestigate the link between agn growth and star formation, especially in thelow-redshift universe (z&lt;1). the herschel terahertz large area survey (h-atlas)has covered 550 deg^2 in five far-infrared and sub-mm bands, 16 deg^2 of whichhave been presented in the science demonstration phase (sdp) catalogue. here weintroduce the xmm-newton observations in h-atlas sdp area, covering 7.1 deg^2with flux limits of 2e-15, 6e-15 and 9e-15 erg/s/cm^2 in the 0.5--2, 0.5--8 and2--8 kev bands, respectively. we present the source detection and thecatalogue, which includes 1700, 1582 and 814 sources detected by emldetect inthe 0.5--8, 0.5--2 and 2--8 kev bands, respectively; the number of uniquesources is 1816. we extract spectra and derive fluxes from power-law fits for398 sources with more than 40 counts in the 0.5--8 kev band. we compare thebest-fit fluxes with the catalogue ones, obtained by assuming a common photonindex of gamma=1.7; we find no bulk difference between the fluxes, and amoderate dispersion of s=0.33 dex. using wherever possible the fluxes from thespectral fits, we derive the 2--10 kev logn-logs, which is consistent with aeuclidean distribution. finally, we release computer code for the toolsdeveloped for this project.

0804.4007	searching for mid-ir obscured agn in the cdf-n	the efficiency of mid-infrared selection methods for finding obscured agn isinvestigated using data in the \chandra deep field north. it is shown thatsamples of agn candidates compiled on the basis of mid-infrared colours onlysuffer substantial contamination from normal galaxies. x-ray stacking analysisreveals a soft mean x-ray spectrum for these sources, consistent withgamma~2.1. this suggests that star-forming galaxies and not obscured agndominate the stacked signal. in contrast agn selection methods that combinemid-infrared with optical criteria are more successful in finding heavilyobscured agn candidates. a method similar to the one proposed by fiore et al.(2008) is adopted to select extremely red objects (r-[3.6]&gt;3.7mag) with high24micron to optical flux ratio (f_24/f_r&gt;1000). about 80% of these sources arenot detected at x-ray wavelengths. stacking the x-ray photons at the positionsof these sources shows a flat mean x-ray spectrum (gamma~0.8), which suggestscompton-thick sources, low-luminosity and moderately obscured (n_h~8e22) agn,or a combination of the two. the mid-infrared colours and luminosities of thesesources are consistent with ulirgs at z~2, while hst/acs images, available forthe optically brighter of these sources, show disturbed optical morphologies inmany of them. the evidence above suggests that this population includes systemsin the process of formation.

1503.04870	a tidal disruption flare in a massive galaxy? implications for the  fuelling mechanisms of nuclear black holes	we argue that the `changing look' agn recently reported by lamassa et al.could be a luminous flare produced by the tidal disruption of a super-solarmass star passing just a few gravitational radii outside the event horizon of a$\sim 10^8 m_{\odot}$ nuclear black hole. this flare occurred in a massive,star forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks torepeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. by takingdifference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year sdss stripe-82light-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum overthe course of the outburst. the tidal disruption event (tde) interpretation isconsistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, whichdisplays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (witha clear superimposed re-brightening flare). our analysis places constraints onthe physical properties of the tde, such as the putative disrupted star's massand orbital parameters, as well as the size and temperature of the emittingmaterial. the properties of the broad and narrow emission lines observed in twoepochs of sdss spectra provide further constraints on the circum-nuclearstructure, and could be indicative that the system hosted a moderate-luminosityagn as recently as a few $10^4$ years ago, and is likely undergoing residualaccretion as late as ten years after peak, as seen from the broad h$\alpha$emission line. we discuss the complex interplay between tidal disruption eventsand gas accretion episodes in galactic nuclei, highlighting the implicationsfor future tde searches and for estimates of their intrinsic rates.

1503.09078	aegis-x: deep chandra imaging of the central groth strip	we present the results of deep \chandra\ imaging of the central region of theextended groth strip, the aegis-x deep (aegis-xd) survey. when combined withprevious \chandra\ observations of a wider area of the strip, aegis-x wide(aegis-xw; laird et~al. 2009), these provide data to a nominal exposure depthof 800ks in the three central acis-i fields, a region of approximately$0.29$~deg$^{2}$. this is currently the third deepest x-ray survey inexistence, a factor $\sim 2-3$ shallower than the chandra deep fields (cdfs)but over an area $\sim 3$ times greater than each cdf. we present a catalogueof 937 point sources detected in the deep \chandra\ observations. we presentidentifications of our x-ray sources from deep ground-based, spitzer, galex andhst imaging. using a likelihood ratio analysis, we associate multi bandcounterparts for 929/937 of our x-ray sources, with an estimated 95~\%reliability, making the identification completeness approximately 94~\% in astatistical sense. reliable spectroscopic redshifts for 353 of our x-raysources are provided predominantly from keck (deep2/3) and mmt hectospec, sothe current spectroscopic completeness is $\sim 38$~per cent. for the remainderof the x-ray sources, we compute photometric redshifts based on multi-bandphotometry in up to 35 bands from the uv to mid-ir. particular attention isgiven to the fact that the vast majority the x-ray sources are agn and requirehybrid templates. our photometric redshifts have mean accuracy of $\sigma=0.04$and an outlier fraction of approximately 5\%, reaching $\sigma=0.03$ with lessthan 4\% outliers in the area covered by candels . the x-ray, multi-wavelengthphotometry and redshift catalogues are made publicly available.

1507.07558	the x-ray luminosity function of active galactic nuclei in the redshift  interval z=3-5	we combine deep x-ray survey data from the chandra observatory and thewide-area/shallow xmm-xxl field to estimate the agn x-ray luminosity functionin the redshift range z=3-5. the sample consists of nearly 340 sources witheither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.the combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminositybaseline of three orders of magnitude, lx(2-10kev)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z&gt;3. wefollow a bayesian approach to determine the binned agn space density andexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. our methodology accountsfor poisson errors in the determination of x-ray fluxes and uncertainties inphotometric redshift estimates. we demonstrate that the latter is essential forunbiased measurement of space densities. we find that the agn x-ray luminosityfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. thereis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminositydependent. the space density of agn with lx&lt;1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5between the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter agnappears to be milder. comparison of our x-ray luminosity function with that ofuv/optical selected qsos at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at brightluminosities, lx&gt;1e45erg/s. the faint-end slope of uv/optical luminosityfunctions however, is steeper than for x-ray selected agn. this implies thatthe type-i agn fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z&gt;3, oppositeto trends established at lower redshift. we also assess the significance of agnin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. our x-ray luminosity functionyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep theuniverse ionised at redshift z&gt;4. a source of uncertainty in this calculationis the escape fraction of uv photons for x-ray selected agn.

0805.4417	a new method for determining the sensitivity of x-ray imaging  observations and the x-ray number counts	we present a new method for determining the sensitivity of x-ray imagingobservations, which correctly accounts for the observational biases that affectthe probability of detecting a source of a given x-ray flux, without the needto perform a large number of time consuming simulations. we use this newtechnique to estimate the x-ray source counts in different spectral bands(0.5-2, 0.5-10, 2-10 and 5-10kev) by combining deep pencil-beam and shallowwide-area chandra observations. the sample has a total of 6295 unique sourcesover an area of $\rm 11.8deg^2$ and is the largest used to date to determinethe x-ray number counts. we determine, for the first time, the break flux inthe 5-10 kev band, in the case of a double power-law source count distribution.we also find an upturn in the 0.5-2kev counts at fluxes below about6e-17erg/s/cm2. we show that this can be explained by the emergence of normalstar-forming galaxies which dominate the x-ray population at faint fluxes. thefraction of the diffuse x-ray background resolved into point sources atdifferent spectral bands is also estimated. it is argued that a singlepopulation of compton thick agn cannot be responsible for the entire unresolvedx-ray background in the energy range 2-10kev.

0807.2240	x-ray selected agn in groups at redshifts z~1	we explore the role of the group environment in the evolution of agn at theredshift interval 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.4, by combining deep chandra observations withextensive optical spectroscopy from the all-wavelength extended groth stripinternational survey (aegis). the sample consists of 3902 optical sources and71 x-ray agn. compared to the overall optically selected galaxy population,x-ray agn are more frequently found in groups at the 99% confidence level. thisis partly because agn are hosted by red luminous galaxies, which are known toreside, on average, in dense environments. relative to these sources, theexcess of x-ray agn in groups is significant at the 91% level only. restrictingthe sample to 0.7&lt;z&lt;0.9 and m_b&lt;-20mag in order to control systematics we findthat x-ray agn represent (4.7\pm1.6) and (4.5\pm1.0)% of the optical galaxypopulation in groups and in the field respectively. these numbers areconsistent with the agn fraction in low redshift clusters, groups and thefield. the results above, although affected by small number statistics, suggestthat x-ray agn are spread over a range of environments, from groups to thefield, once the properties of their hosts (e.g. colour, luminosity) areaccounted for. there is also tentative evidence, significant at the 98% level,that the field produces more x-ray luminous agn compared to groups, extendingsimilar results at low redshift to z~1. this trend may be because of eithercold gas availability or the nature of the interactions occurring in the densergroup environment (i.e. prolonged tidal encounters).

astro-ph;0406346	on the use of photometric redshifts for x-ray selected agns	(abridged) in this paper we present photometric redshift estimates for asample of x-ray selected sources detected in the wide field (~2 deg^2), bright[f_{x} (0.5-8 kev)~10^{-14} cgs] xmm-newton/2df survey. unlike deeper x-raysamples comprising a large fraction of sources with colours dominated by thehost galaxy, our bright survey primarily probes the qso x-ray population.therefore photometric redshift methods employing both galaxy and qso templatesneed to be used. we employ the photometric redshift technique ofhatziminaoglou, mathez &amp; pello (2000) using 5-band photometry from the sdss. weseparate our x-ray sources according to their optical profile to point-like andextended. we apply qso and galaxy templates to the point-like and extendedsources respectively. x-ray sources associated with galactic stars areidentified and discarded from our point-like sample on the basis of their lowx-ray--to--optical flux ratio and their broad band colours that are best fit bystellar templates. comparison of our results with spectroscopic redshiftsavailable, allows calibration of our method and estimation of the photometricredshift accuracy. for ~70 per cent of the point-like sources photometricredshifts are correct within dz &lt;= 0.3 (or ~75 per cent have dz/(1+z) &lt;= 0.2),and the rms scatter is estimated to be sigma_z = 0.30. for the opticallyextended objects the photometric redshifts work only in the case of red (g - r&gt; 0.5 mag) sources yielding dz &lt;= 0.15 and dz/(1+z) &lt;= 0.2 for 73 and 93 percent respectively. however, we find that the above photometric redshifttechnique does not work in the case of extended sources with blue colours (g -r &lt; 0.5): such sources cannot be fit successfully by qso or galaxy templates,or any linear combination of the two.

astro-ph;0407078	the phoenix deep survey: the radio properties of the hard x-ray selected  sample	the radio properties of hard (2-8kev) x-ray selected sources are explored bycombining a single 50ks xmm-newton pointing with the ultra-deep and homogeneousphoenix radio (1.4ghz) survey (hopkins et al. 2003). a total of 43 sources aredetected above the x-ray flux limit f_x(2-8kev)=7.7e-15cgs with 14 of themexhibiting radio emission above ~40mujy (3sigma). the x-ray/radio matchedpopulation lies in the borderline between radio loud and quiet agns andcomprises sources with both soft and hard x-ray spectral properties suggestingboth obscured and unobscured systems. the spectroscopically identifiedsub-sample (total of 6 x-ray/radio matches) comprises narrow emission line agns(4) with hard x-ray spectral properties and broad line sources (2) with softx-ray spectra. we find evidence that the fraction of x-ray/radio matchesincreases from ~20% for sources with rest-frame column density n_h&lt;1e22cm^-2 to\~50% for more absorbed systems. poor statistics however, limit thesignificance of the above result to the ~2sigma level. also, the x-ray/radiomatched sources have flatter coadded x-ray spectrum(gamma=1.78^{+0.05}_{-0.03}) compared to sources without radio emission(gamma=2.00^{+0.03}_{-0.04}). a possible explanation for the higher fraction ofabsorbed sources with radio emission at the mujy level is the presence ofcircum-nuclear starburst activity that both feeds and obscures the centralengine. for a small sub-sample of z~0.4 radio emitting agns with n_h&gt;1e22cm^-2their combined spectrum exhibits a soft x-ray component that may be associatedwith star-formation activity, although other possibilities cannot be excluded.we also find that radio emitting agns make up about 13-20% of the hard-bandx-ray background depending on the adopted normalisation.

astro-ph;0409670	the xmm-{\em newton}/2df survey - vi: clustering and bias of the soft  x-ray point sources	we study the clustering properties of x-ray sources detected in the wide area($\sim 2 $deg$^{2}$) bright, contiguous xmm-{\em newton}/2df survey. we detect432 objects to a flux limit of $5\times 10^{-15}$ ergcm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in thesoft 0.5-2 kev band. performing the standard angular correlation functionanalysis, a $\sim 3\sigma$ correlation signal between 0 and 150 arcsec isdetected: $w(\theta&lt;150^{''})\simeq 0.114\pm 0.037$. if the angular correlationfunction is modeled as a power law,$w(\theta)=(\theta_{\circ}/\theta)^{\gamma-1}$, then for its nominal slope of$\gamma=1.8$ we estimate, after correcting for the integral constraint and theamplification bias, that $\theta_{\circ}\simeq 10.4 \pm 1.9$ arcsec. using aclustering evolution model which is constant in comoving coordinates($\epsilon=-1.2$), a luminosity dependent density evolution model for the x-rayluminosity function and the concordance cosmological model ($\omega_{\rmm}=1-\omega_{\lambda}=0.3$) we obtain, by inverting limber's integral equation,a spatial correlation length of $r_{\circ}\sim 16$ $h^{-1}$ mpc. this value islarger than that of previous {\sc rosat} surveys as well as of the opticaltwo-degree quasar redshift survey. only in models where the clustering remainsconstant in physical coordinates ($\epsilon=-3$), do we obtain an $r_{\circ}$value ($\sim 7.5$ $h^{-1}$ mpc) which is consistent with the above surveys.

astro-ph;0411572	the phoenix deep survey: the clustering and the environment of extremely  red objects	in this paper we explore the clustering properties and the environment of theextremely red objects (eros; i-k&gt;4mag) detected in a ~180arcmin^2 deep(ks~20mag) ks-band survey of a region within the phoenix deep survey, anon-going multiwavelength program aiming to investigate the nature and theevolution of faint radio sources. using our complete sample of 289 erosbrighter than ks=20mag we estimate a statistically significant (~3.7sigma)angular correlation function signal with amplitude aw=8.7^{+2.1}_{-1.7}x10^{-3}consistent with earlier work based on smaller samples. this amplitude suggestsa clustering length in the range ro=12-17h^{-1}mpc, implying that eros traceregions of enhanced density. using a novel method we further explore theassociation of eros with galaxy overdensities by smoothing the k-band galaxydistribution using the matched filter algorithm of postman et al. (1996) andthen cross-correlating the resulting density maps with the ero positions. ouranalysis provides direct evidence that eros are associated with overdensitiesat redshifts z&gt;1. we also exploit the deep radio 1.4ghz data (limiting flux60microjy) available to explore the association of eros and faint radio sourcesand whether the two populations trace similar large scale structures.cross-correlation of the two samples (after excluding 17eros with radiocounterparts) gives a 2sigma signal only for the sub-sample of high-z radiosources (z&gt;0.6). although the statistics are poor this suggests that it is thehigh-z radio sub-sample that traces similar structures with eros.

astro-ph;0411578	the phoenix deep survey: spectroscopic catalog	the phoenix deep survey is a multi-wavelength survey based on deep 1.4 ghzradio imaging, reaching well into the sub-100 microjy level. one of the aims ofthis survey is to characterize the sub-mjy radio population, exploring itsnature and evolution. in this paper we present the catalog and results of thespectroscopic observations aimed at characterizing the optically ``bright''(r&lt;~ 21.5 mag) counterparts of faint radio sources. out of 371 sources withredshift determination, 21% have absorption lines only, 11% show agnsignatures, 32% are star-forming galaxies, 34% show narrow emission lines thatdo not allow detailed spectral classification (due to poor signal-to-noiseratio and/or lack of diagnostic emission lines) and the remaining 2% areidentified with stars. for the star-forming galaxies with a balmer decrementmeasurement we find a median extinction of a(ha)=1.9 mag, higher than that ofoptically selected samples. this is a result of the radio selection, which isnot biased against dusty systems. using the available spectroscopicinformation, we estimate the radio luminosity function of star-forming galaxiesin two independent redshift bins at z~0.1 and 0.3 respectively. we find directevidence for strong luminosity evolution of these systems consistent with l(1.4ghz) ~ (1+z)^(2.7).

astro-ph;0412335	x-ray bright optically inactive galaxies (xbong) in xmm-newton/sdss  fields: more diluted than absorbed?	we explore the properties of x-ray bright optically inactive galaxies (xbong)detected in the 0.5-8 kev spectral band in 20 public xmm fields overlappingwith the sdss. we constrain our sample to optically extended systems with log(f_x/f_o &gt; -2) that have spectroscopic identifications available from the sdss(r&lt;19.2 mag). the resulting sample contains 12 objects with l_x (0.5-8kev)= 5 x10^41 - 2x10^44 erg s-1 in the redshift range 0.06 &lt; z &lt; 0.45. the x-rayemission in four cases is extended suggesting the presence of hot gasassociated with a cluster or group of galaxies. the x-ray spectral fits showthat two additional sources are best fit with a thermal component emission (kt\~ 1 kev). three sources aremost likely associated with agn: their x-rayspectrum is described by a steep photon index ~ 1.9 typical of unobscured agnwhile, they are very luminous in x-rays (l_x (0.5-8 kev) ~ 10^43 - 10^44 ergs-1.) finally, three more sources could be associated with either normalgalaxies or unobscured low luminosity agn (l_x &lt; 10^42 erg s-1). we find noevidence for significant x-ray absorbing columns in any of our xbongs. theabove suggest that xbongs, selected in the total 0.5-8 kev band, comprise amixed bag of objects primarily including normal elliptical galaxies and type-1agn whose optical nuclear spectrum is probably diluted by the strong stellarcontinuum. nevertheless, as our sample is not statistically complete we cannotexclude the possibility that a fraction of optically fainter xbong may beassociated with heavily obscured agn.

astro-ph;0501047	dust in a merging galaxy sequence: the scuba view	we investigate the cold and warm dust properties during galaxy interactionsusing a merging galaxy sample ordered into a chronological sequence from pre-to post-mergers. our sample comprises a total of 29 merging systems selected tohave far-infrared and sub-millimeter observations. we use the 100-to-850 micronflux density ratio, f100/f850, as a proxy to the mass fraction of the warm andthe cold dust in these systems. we find evidence for an increase in f100/f850along the merging sequence from early to advanced mergers and interpret thistrend as an increase of the warm relative to the cold dust mass. we argue thatthe two key parameters affecting the f100/f850 flux ratio is the star-formationrate and the dust content of individual systems relative to the stars. using asophisticated model for the absorption and re-emission of the stellar uvradiation by dust we show that these parameters can indeed explain both theincrease and the observed scatter in the f100/f850 along the merging galaxysequence.

astro-ph;0503494	the xmm-newton needles in the haystack survey: the local x-ray  luminosity function of 'normal' galaxies	in this paper we estimate the local (z&lt;0.22) x-ray luminosity function of`normal' galaxies derived from the xmm-newton needles in the haystack survey.this is an on-going project that aims to identify x-ray selected `normal'galaxies (i.e. non-agn dominated) in the local universe. we are using a totalof 70 xmm-newton fields covering an area of 11 sq. degrees which overlap withthe sloan digital sky survey data release-2. `normal' galaxies are selected onthe basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low x-ray--to--opticalflux ratio (log(f_x/f_o)&lt;-2) and soft x-ray colours. we find a total of 28candidate `normal' galaxies to the 0.5-8 kev band flux limit of ~2x10^{-15}cgs. optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 percent). these provide additional evidence that our sources are bona-fide'normal' galaxies with x-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emissionand/or x-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. sixteen of ourgalaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type spectral energy distribution(sed) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-typesed. combining our xmm-newton sample with 18 local (z&lt;0.22) galaxies from thechandra deep field north and south surveys, we construct the local x-rayluminosity function of `normal' galaxies. this can be represented with aschechter form with a break at l* ~ 3x10^{41} cgs and a slope of ~1.78+/-0.12.using this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of theform  (1+z)^{3.3} we estimate a contribution to the x-ray background from `normal'galaxies of 10-20 per cent (0.5-8 kev). finally, we derive, for the first time,the luminosity functions for early and late type systems separately.

astro-ph;0511317	red agn in xmm-newton/sdss fields	in this paper we combine archival and proprietary xmm-newton observations(about 5deg^2) that overlap with the sloan digital sky survey to explore thenature of the moderate-z x-ray population. we focus on x-ray sources withoptically red colours (g-r&gt;0.4), which we argue are important for understandingthe origin of the x-ray background. firstly, these systems constitute asignificant fraction, about 2/3, of the z&lt;1 x-ray population to the limitf(2-8kev)~2e-14cgs. secondly, their luminosity function under evolution of theform ~(1+z)^3 suggests that they could be responsible for about 17 per cent ofthe diffuse x-ray background to z=1. thirdly, their stacked x-ray spectrum inthe range 1-8kev is consistent with a power-law distribution with gamma~1.4(without fitting intrinsic absorption), i.e. similar to the diffuse x-raybackground. we find that the optically red x-ray population comprises a mixedbag of objects, both obscured (n_h&gt;1e22 cm^{-2}) and unobscured (n_h&lt;1e22cm^{-2}), with a wide range of x-ray luminosities up l_x~1e44cgs. we argue thatdilution of the agn light by the host galaxy may play a role in shaping thecontinuum optical emission of this population. finally, we explore a possibleassociation of these sources and the moderate-z red (j-ks&gt;2mag) agns identifiedin the two micron all sky survey (2mass). the median n_h of the red x-raysources studied here is ~1e21cm^{-2}, lower than that found for the 2mass agns,suggesting different populations.

astro-ph;0607270	aegis: the color-magnitude relation for x-ray selected agn	we discuss the relationship between rest-frame color and optical luminosityfor x-ray sources in the range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.4 selected from the chandra survey ofthe extended groth strip (egs). these objects are almost exclusively activegalactic nuclei (agn). while there are a few luminous qsos, most are relativelyweak or obscured agn whose optical colors should be dominated by host galaxylight. the vast majority of agn hosts at z~1 are luminous and red, with veryfew objects fainter than m_{b}=-20.5 or bluer than u-b=0.6. this places the agnin a distinct region of color-magnitude space, on the ``red sequence'' or atthe top of the ``blue cloud'', with many in between these two modes in galaxycolor. a key stage in the evolution of massive galaxies is when star formationis quenched, resulting in a migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence.our results are consistent with scenarios in which agn either cause or maintainthis quenching. the large numbers of red sequence agn imply that strong,ongoing star formation is not a necessary ingredient for agn activity, as blackhole accretion appears often to persist after star formation has beenterminated.

astro-ph;0607274	all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey: the  environment of x-ray sources at z~1	we explore the environment of z~1 agn using a sample of 53 spectroscopicallyidentified x-ray sources in the all-wavelength extended groth stripinternational survey. we quantify the local density in the vicinity of an x-raysource by measuring the projected surface density of spectroscopicallyidentified optical galaxies within a radius defined by the 3rd nearestneighbour. our main result is that x-ray selected agn at z~1 avoid underdenseregions at the 99.89% confidence level. moreover, although we find that theoverall population shares the same (rich) environment with optical galaxies ofsimilar u-b and m_b, there is also tentative evidence (96%) that agn with bluecolors (u-b&lt;1) reside in denser environments compared to optical galaxies. weargue that the results above are a consequence of the whereabouts of massivegalaxies, capable of hosting supermassive black holes at their centers, withavailable cold gas reservoirs, the fuel for agn activity. at z~1 an increasingfraction of such systems are found in dense regions.

astro-ph;0610828	chandra and spitzer observations of cdfs x-ray obscured qsos	we present chandra and spitzer data of the 186, extragalactic, hard 2-10 kevx-ray selected sources, which lie in the central part of the chandra deep field  south (cdfs). for the vast majority of sources (99.5%) there is aspectroscopic or photometric redshift available. we classify 17 sources asx-ray obscured qsos, according to strictly x-ray criteria, i.e. defined ashaving large hydrogen column densities (n_h&gt;10^22 cgs) and luminosities(lx&gt;10^44 cgs). the surface density of x-ray obscured qsos is ~210 sq. deg. wefind 18 candidate compton thick n_h&gt;10^24 cgs sources, of which three have qsoluminosities (l_x&gt;10^44 cgs). the x-ray obscured qso comprise a mixed bag ofobjects, covering the redshift range z=1.3-4.3. eight of these show narrow lineoptical spectra, two show no obscuration in their optical spectra presentingbroad lines, while for the other seven there is only a photometric redshiftavailable. about half of the x-ray obscured qsos show high x-ray to opticalflux ratios, x/o&gt;1, and red colours, i-3.6&gt;4. combination of the x-ray with themid-ir 8 or 24 micron flux can be used as an additional diagnostic to sift outthe heavily obscured agn. all x-ray selected qsos present red mid-ir coloursand can be easily separated among mid-ir sources, demonstrating that mid-irselection provides a powerful tool for the detection of obscured qsos.

astro-ph;0702132	x-ray selected starbursts in the goods-north	we investigate claims that recent deep x-ray surveys are detecting starburstsat cosmologically interesting redshifts (z=0-1). we combine x-ray data from the2ms cdf-north with multi-wavelength observations from goods to build the seds(uv, optical, ir) of x-ray sources in this field. these are fit with modeltemplates providing an estimate of the total ir luminosity of each source. wethen exploit the correlation between ir and x-ray luminosities for star-forminggalaxies, established in the local universe, to select sources that aredominated by star-formation. this approach is efficient in discriminatingnormal galaxies from agn over a wide range of sfrs. the resulting sampleconsists of 45 x-ray selected star-forming systems at a median redshift z~0.5,the majority of which (60%) are lirgs or ulirgs. this sample is least affectedby incompleteness and agn contamination and is well suited for cosmologicalstudies. we quantify the x-ray evolution of these sources by constructing theirdifferential, dn/ds, and comparing them with evolving luminosity functionmodels. the results are consistent with luminosity evolution of the form(1+z)^{p} with p~2.4. this is similar to the evolution rate of star-forminggalaxies selected at other wavelengths, suggesting that the deep x-ray surveys,are indeed finding the starburst galaxy population that drives the rapidevolution of the global sfr density in the range z~0-1. our analysis alsoreveals a separate population of ir-faint x-ray sources. these include oldgalaxies but also systems that are x-ray luminous for their stellar masscompared to local e/s0. we argue that these may be post-starbursts that will,over time, become fainter at x-rays and will eventually evolve into early-typesystems (e.g. e/s0).

astro-ph;0702424	radio observations of the cdf-south: a possible link between radio  emission and star formation in x-ray selected agn	we explore the nature of the radio emission of x-ray selected agn bycombining deep radio (1.4ghz; 60micro-jy) and x-ray data with multiwavelength(optical, mid-infrared) observations in the extended chandra deep field south(e-cdfs). the fraction of radio detected x-ray sources increases from 9% in thee-cdfs to 14% in the central region of this field, which has deeper x-raycoverage from the 1ms cdfs. we find evidence that the radio emission of up to60% of the hard x-ray/radio matched agn is likely associated withstar-formation in the host galaxy. firstly, the mid-ir (24micron) properties ofthese sources are consistent with the infrared/radio correlation of starbursts.secondly, most of them are found in galaxies with blue rest-frame opticalcolours (u-v), suggesting a young stellar population. on the contrary,x-ray/radio matched agn which are not detected in the mid-infrared have red u-vcolours suggesting their radio emission is associated with agn activity. wealso find no evidence for a population of heavily obscured radio-selected agnthat are not detected in x-rays. finally, we do no confirm previous claims fora correlation between radio emission and x-ray obscuration. assuming that theradio continuum measures star-formation, this finding is against models wherethe dust and gas clouds associated with circumnuclear starbursts arespherically blocking our view to the central engine.

astro-ph;9604118	the nature of the faint galaxies in the hubble deep field	we present a study of the galaxies found in the hubble deep field. a highproportion of hdf galaxies are undergoing a strong episode of star formation,as evidenced by their very blue colours. a wide range of morphological types isfound, with a high proportion of peculiar and merger morphologies. fitting themultiband spectra with redshifted seds of galaxy types e to hii, we predict thespectral types and redshifts of galaxies detected in the hdf. we find a medianredshift of 1.6, with $68\%$ having $z &gt; 1$ and $31\%$ with $z &gt;2$. the i-bandabsolute magnitude distributions as a function of galaxy types show a plausibletrend of decreasing luminosity towards later types. the derived i-bandluminosity function agrees well with that from the canada-france survey (lillyet al 1996) for $z &lt; 1$ and shows strong luminosity evolution at $m_i &lt; -21$for $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$, comparable to the rate seen in quasars and starburst galaxies.we have predicted infrared and submillimetre fluxes assuming most of thegalaxies are undergoing a strong starburst. several planned space-borne andground-based deep surveys are capable of detecting interesting numbers of hdfgalaxies.

astro-ph;9903016	the phoenix survey: optical and near-infrared observations of faint  radio sources	using a deep australia telescope compact array (atca) radio survey coveringan area of ~3deg^{2} to a 4\sigma sensitivity of \ge 100 \mujy at 1.4ghz, westudy the nature of faint radio galaxies. about 50% of the detected radiosources are identified with an optical counterpart revealed by ccd photometryto m_{r}=22.5 mag. near-infrared (k-band) data are also available for aselected sample of the radio sources, while spectroscopic observations havebeen carried out for about 40% of the optically identified sample. theseprovide redshifts and information on the stellar content. emission-line ratiosimply that most of the emission line sources are star-forming galaxies, with asmall contribution (\approx 10%) from sy1/sy2 type objects. we also find asignificant number of absorption line systems, likely to be ellipticals. thesedominate at high flux densities (&gt; 1 mjy) but are also found at sub-mjy levels.using the balmer decrement we find a visual extinction a_{v}=1.0 for thestar-forming faint radio sources. this moderate reddening is consistent withthe v-r and r-k colours of the optically identified sources. for emission linegalaxies, there is a correlation between the radio power and the h\alphaluminosity, in agreement with the result of benn et al. (1993). this suggeststhat the radio emission of starburst radio galaxies is a good indicator ofstar-formation activity.

astro-ph;9903293	the 1.4 ghz and halpha luminosity functions and star formation rates  from faint radio galaxies	using a recently completed survey of faint (sub-mjy) radio sources, selectedat 1.4 ghz, a dust-free estimate of the local star formation rate (sfr) iscarried out. the sample is 50% complete to 0.2 mjy, with over 50% of the radiosources having optical counterparts brighter than r = 21.5. spectroscopicobservations of 249 optically identified radio sources have been made, usingthe 2-degree field (2df) facility at the anglo-australian telescope (aat).redshifts and equivalent widths of several spectral features (e.g., h\alpha and[oii]3727) sensitive to star formation have been measured and used to identifythe star-forming and absorption-line systems. the spectroscopic sample iscorrected for incompleteness and used to estimate the 1.4 ghz and h\alphaluminosity functions (lfs) and luminosity density distributions. the 1.4 ghz lfof the star-forming population has a much steeper faint-end slope (1.85) thanthat for the ellipticals (1.35). this implies an increasing preponderance ofstar-forming galaxies among the optically identified (i.e., z &lt; 1) radiosources at fainter flux densities. the h\alpha lf of the faint radio populationagrees with published h\alpha lfs derived from local samples selected byh\alpha emission. this suggests that the star-forming faint radio population iscoincident with the h\alpha selected galaxies. the 1.4 ghz and h\alphaluminosity densities have been used to estimate the sfrs. the two estimatesagree, both giving a sfr density of $0.032 m_\odot yr^{-1} mpc^{-3}$ in therange z &lt; 1.

astro-ph;9910318	the phoenix radio survey: the angular correlation function	using the phoenix radio survey, a homogeneous survey selected at 1.4ghz andcovering an area of ~3deg^2, we analyse the clustering of the sub-mjy radiopopulation using angular correlation function analysis. extensive simulationsare carried out to investigate the significance of the estimated angularcorrelation amplitudes. our analysis show that for the s_1.4&gt;0.5mjy sub-samplesthe radio source distribution is anisotropic at the 2$\sigma$ significancelevel. additionally, we estimate upper limits for the angular correlationamplitudes that, despite the large uncertainties, are in good agreement withthe amplitude estimates for sources brighter than 1mjy, detected in the firstradio survey (cress {et al.} 1997). adopting a radio luminosity function andassuming an evolving spatial correlation function of the form\xi(r)=(r/r_{o})^{-\gamma} (1+z)^{-(3+\epsilon)}, with the evolutionparametrised by \epsilon, we find an upper limit for the angular correlationlength r_{o}~9h^-1mpc for s_1.4&gt;0.5mjy and \gamma=2.1. this agrees well withthe value r_{o}~6-8h^-1mpc estimated from the first radio survey for sourcesbrighter than 1mjy. additionally, we quantify the characteristics, in terms ofareal coverage and limiting flux density, of future deep radio surveys to yielda significant correlation amplitude detection and to explore possible changesof the correlation amplitude with flux density.

0812.2034	are red 2mass qsos young?	we use photometric data from spitzer to explore the mid- and far-irproperties of 10 red qsos (j-k&gt;2, r-k&gt;5) selected by combining the 2mass in thenir with the sdss at optical wavelengths. optical and/or near-infrared spectraare available for 8/10 sources. modeling the sed from uv to far-ir shows thatmoderate dust reddening (a_v=1.3-3.2) can explain the red optical and near-ircolours of the sources in the sample. there is also evidence that red qsos have60/12micron luminosity ratio higher than pg qsos (97% significance). this canbe interpreted as a higher level of star-formation in these systems (measuredby the 60micron luminosity) for a given agn power (approximated by the 12micronluminosity). this is consistent with a picture where red qsos represent anearly phase of agn evolution, when the supermassive black hole is enshrouded indust and gas clouds, which will eventually be blown out (possibly by agn drivenoutflows) and the system will appear as typical optically luminous qso. thereis also tentative evidence significant at the 96% level that red 2mass qsos aremore often associated with radio emission than optically selected sdss qsos.this may indicate outflows, also consistent with the young agn interpretation.we also estimate the space density of red qsos relative to optically selectedsdss qsos, taking into account the effect of dust extinction and the intrinsicluminosity of the sources. we estimate that the fraction of red qsos in theoverall population increases from 3% at m_k=-27.5mag to 12% at m_k=-29.5mag.this suggests that reddened qsos become more important at the bright end of theluminosity function. if red qsos are transition objects on the way to becomingtypical optically luminous qsos, the low fractions above suggest that thesesystems spent &lt;12% of their lifetime at the "reddened" stage.
